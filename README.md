# Minimal Recipes
A website that provides recipes without all the filler. A project I made to help me practice my web dev skills.
The website gets recipes from existing websites using a Python script and saves them as json files to be displayed on the website.

## To-Do
Add autocomplete. Currently, you need to write the specific name of the recipe for it to appear.
Add a homepage
Store recipes in a database instead of a bundle of json files
Deploy as a website(?)
