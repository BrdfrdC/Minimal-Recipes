Trim the rind from the watermelon slices, and place the largest slice onto a cake plate. Alternate layering sliced strawberries, slices of cantaloupe, and slices of fresh pineapple; follow with the second-largest watermelon slice. Repeat once more to make a layered fruit stack that looks like a cake."

"reviewBody": "This \"100% Fruit Cake\" was a huge hit! I made mine 3 hours in advance and placed it in a pie plate by chance because I was taking it to a picnic. A lot of fruit juice seeped from the fruit, but fortunately the edges of the pie plate caught the excess fruit juice so I didn't have a big mess. I just \"drank away\" the excess juice with a straw. From now on when I make this recipe I will place the cake in my flan pan both to catch the juices and so I can stack up lots of fruit for garnish. Thank you InTheKitchen for sharing your recipe."

"reviewBody": "I make mine a little differently, but same concept. I cut the ends off the watermelon leaving the center flat on both sides, remove the rind to form an actual cake shaped watermelon and then decorate with other fruit using toothpicks to secure the pieces that need to stay in place. For the leaves, flowers, stars or other shapes I use cookie cutters or just a paring knife. \n\nGreat alternative to a traditional cake and everybody raves about the look. It takes me about an hour to make, mostly cutting up all the fruit; putting it together is fun, easy and kid friendly. Any leftover fruit goes in a side bowl for fruit salad. My family always eats the bowl first saying the cake's too pretty to eat.."
