"reviewBody": "6.27.22 Whoa, just doesn’t get much easier than this. Took out of the oven at 40 minutes, inverted it onto a bottle, and as instructed, let it cool for 2 hours. Ran a table knife around the center and edges, turned upside down onto a plate, and it just popped right out, no sticking at all. I could see this with a quick-and-easy blueberry sauce, and as another reviewer mentioned, adding some coconut to the batter just might be another great option. And most importantly, it’s delicious on its own!"
