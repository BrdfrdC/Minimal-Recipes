The key is to evenly distribute the butter over the raw cake mix powder. I don't even melt the butter, I just slice up a stick and put a dab every half inch, or so. It's so versatile and can be done with any fruit base."

The crust was thick, powdery and salty in places, and caramelized in others; the filling was good, but sloppy wet. It's a good concept that needs more peaches in the larger pan, probably partially drained. Worth working on."

I made it exactly to the recipe using 2 cans of sliced peaches in juice and Duncan Hines yellow cake mix. \nNext time, I will try half a box of cake mix, and add some chopped walnuts and oatmeal to it, and cut the cold butter into it like a streusel.\nTwo more ingredients and another bowl to wash, but it's just too cloying for me as is."

I've never used the Duncan Hines mixes, but have opted for either a vanilla cake mix from Trader Joes or a cinnamon crumb/coffee cake mix from my local supermarket. I used 1 can of sliced peaches in light syrup and then frozen fresh peach slices (not thawed) to fill the bottom of the baking dish (the cake mixes have enough sugar that no extra sugar is needed). And I also sprinkled vanilla extract over the top of the cake mix before the melted butter. Delicious!!!"
