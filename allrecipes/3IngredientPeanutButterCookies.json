It is simply delicious and amazing! The entire family loves them. I did cut the amount of sugar( I used light brown sugar) to half of the amount and added 2 teaspoons of vanilla to them also. I tried making a batch with chocolate chips in them and it ruined the peanut butter cookie in my opinion. I have shared this recipe with my father as well as my Grandmother and they use it too! It is a great recipe for my Grandmother because it doesn't have a bunch of ingredients to remember or steps to make them. Thank you for sharing such a wonderful useful recipe."

As written, it is a great recipe - go for it ! I am a bit confused about one thing. Someone wrote a review giving this recipe only two stars. Was it because you did not care for the cookies or the fact that you over-cooked them on your open grill??? First off, why grill cookies on an open fire then expect positive results. Second, why even write a review for this when you did not follow the instructions Delete your review, it throws of the rating curve. Somebody else stated that it \"grinds their gears\" when reviews are written for a recipe they changed. Agreed! If you change it, then it is not the same recipe."

I also used super chunk peanut butter ( all natural ) and sprinkled a little sugar on top, just a tiny bit. Hubby has had me make his w peanut butter chips, chocolate chips, and once with powdered sugar not granulated sugar on top ( not all at onceüòÅ) (Men like all that stuff, I'm happy with plain perfect peanut butter cookies üòò. I definitely recommend this recipe, it's fast, easy to prepare and remember, and they turn out great. I think he wants marshmallows next time lol."

I also had to bake longer than stated and a little longer. Mine did best when I pulled them out, waited 3 minutes for them to set, a little, and flipped them, before finishing the last few minutes of the bake."

I only did one thing different and that was add about a quarter cup of quick oats because the mix seemed a bit oily. Well I must admit they turned out good but not 5 star good. Others said they weren't sweet enough but after one cookie I was pouring a glass of milk and I like sweet stuff! I'm glad I didn't roll them in sugar like one person suggested. They were easy enough to make and satisfied my sweet tooth."
