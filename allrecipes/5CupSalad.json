My in-laws like to add chopped walnuts and sometimes vanilla extract. Mix the sour cream and coconut together first and gently mix in the remaining ingredients. So easy to put together and put in the fridge several days before serving just add the marshmallows last, 24 hours before serving. I will make again. Not everyone will love this recipe but I enjoyed it."

I am not very fond of marshmallows but i love them in this salad. You do have to let it sit for a minimum of 5 hours or it will not sweeten up. I very rarely have any left over but when I do, I can tell you it is always better the next day. I have never measured the ingredients, just eyeball it all. It is a taste preference. I use extra marshmallows."

It is so easy to make, just dump everything together (making sure you drain the fruit). I like to add color to it now and then and add maraschino cherries to it but rinse them off first so the color doesn't bleed and turn everything pink. Still it is just my additional ingredient, not necessary. The secret is to let it set at least overnight to let the flavors blend."

First, if you do not have 24 hours to let your salad sit over night in the refrigerator than don't make the salad. Be sure to drain your canned fruit well. I also use much less sour cream than is called for, in fact, I use just enough sour cream to coat all the ingredients, cover, then chil overnight! Love it!"
