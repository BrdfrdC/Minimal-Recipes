"reviewBody": "Would I make these again? In a pinch, sure. Were they my favorite? No! I decided to tweak the recipe a bit. I made a smaller batch so I did 1.5 cup all purpose flour, 6 tbsp of brown sugar. (Sifted as finely as possible) Then I added 1 egg, room temp butter, and about tbsp of vanilla extract and about 3/4 cup chocolate chips. Once thoroughly mixed I balled them up and placed on a sheet with parchment and a bit of pam and popped them in the freezer for 5 minutes. After that I placed them in the oven on 350 and eyed them 15-18 minutes. Before taking them out I pressed them down because they were still in balls. Texture was kind of like a cookie cake. Big tip: Eat them cooled!!! They taste way better this way!! My way yields about 14-18 cookies depending on size of balls."

After mixing everything together and seeing how dense and dry it was, I checked the reviews to see who had a fix for it. I ended up adding 1 egg white and a teaspoon of vanilla extract and it helped somewhat. Baked the cookies for the full 15 minutes and they came out ok. Still dense, but the flavor wasn't bad. Just not the chocolate cookies we were craving. Lesson learned...always check the reviews first!"

Everything else I followed exactly and this is how they turned out! They were delicious!! ** I also put the dough in the freezer for about 5 minutes before baking**"

"reviewBody": "The rating for the recipe is a 2..\nFor the add-ons I placed it made it a 4...\n\nNote these cookies don't leave the shape of how you made them!!! \n\nSo the recipe is dry and bland. I doubled the batch and added another cup of sugar as well as 2 tps of vanilla extract. I set aside my left over chocolate chips and melted them. Once the cookies where done I ended up dunking the cookies into the chocolate completely coating them and setting them solidify again. It most definitely saved the cookie from it's blandess and also gave it a delicious taste. Heck of a recovery."

This is a basic recipe---so you can embellish it anyway you like..add more sugar, use really dark sugar instead of brown sugar, add vanilla or nuts or coconut or cherries...the dough's simplicity will make the star of the show what you add, rather then over powering the fruit or nuts or whatever."

To make this better and still keep 5 ingredients double the sugar and the chocolate chips. or to improve this recipe while keeping it simple add a pinch of salt and some vanilla extract. to lighten the cookies whip the butter and sugar first. recommend smaller cookies baked until crunchy."

I always add tooons of chocolate (I just chop up a dark choc bar), my husband likes peanut butter cups, my grandma likes walnuts, raisins, and spice."

Without a leavening agent they were only as thick as you make them; they were kind of dense. Overall, these wouldn't be at the top of my list, but were quick and easy enough that I would use them again in a pinch."
