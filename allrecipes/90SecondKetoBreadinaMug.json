Add some left over sautéed peppers and bacon for another choice. I make mine in a glass dish that is about the same circumference as a muffin. It puffs up quite high so I am able to cut it into 4 rounds to make 2 muffin style sandwiches. I pop them into the toaster or pan fry, then add toppings - pizza flavour, ham’n cheese, cheese and sausage, etc. Super quick, super convent and super satisfying. Tons of personalization choices too. Going to try making burger sliders next."

For anyone who wants to try this, I did 1/2 cup of Almond flour, 2 eggs, 1 teaspoon, and a heaping pinch of salt. It is so good I plan on making a blueberry lemon loaf and a jalapeno popper loaf."

I had to heat my butter twice as long and could probably have made it with half as much butter but 90 seconds was the exact time it needed to cook. I took it out of the mug and waited to slice it and it is crumbly like cornmeal but has a great flavor. To me the groans reminded me of nuts in multigrain bread.\nI look forward to fiddling with it to try different varieties like others have done.\nIf you decide to make this, FOLLOW THE RECIPE EXACTLY before messing with it so you know how to adjust it as necessary. if you don't like it grainy, then try sifting it before cooking it."

I can’t afford to use “good butter” all the time so I keep a package of the good stuff and then the cheaper stuff around too.. you’re going to want to pull out the good stuff for this one. \n2. Put Parmesan cheese in this. It gets a little chewy and just adds EVERYTHING to this recipe! I used maybe 1&amp;1/2 to 2 tablespoons. Mix it in with all the ingredients before cooking."

After I sliced and added more butter and brown sugar swerve on top and soaked in heavy cream and then pan seared over butter. Comes out like French toast!! So delicious!! Next time I will added real blueberry to batter and maybe pecans!"

Well worth five stars. \n\nWe aren’t keto, so we sub the butter with smart balance. We cook it in a flat bottom fairly standard sized cereal bowl (makes a little over 3 inch diameter disc), slice it in half, toast it in a pan, and layer a turkey sausage patty, greens, and a fried egg or egg whites in between for breakfast."

Added a little Vidalia onion, sea salt, and a few sunflower seeds to the avocado mash. Topped it all off with some campari tomato slices and splash of balsamic vinegar. It was amazing. This is a versatile recipe that can be used in many ways. I like to add a half to one teaspoon of psyllium husk fiber for great texture. You could also use golden flax meal for texture. For grilled sandwiches and hamburger buns, I use a ramekin to make these and then cut it in half. It really is a no fail recipe that works for me every time. Thank you so much for sharing it!"

Yea it does have an egg flavor and after sitting for a little bit it does get dry, but when you add meat or cheese to make a sandwich it works perfectly. I like to mix in everything bagel seasoning before I microwave it. When it's done i slice it into 4 slices and top them with lox and cream cheese."
