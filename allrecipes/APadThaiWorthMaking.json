You might have to double up or even triple the sauce; I added 3/4 teaspoon to every 1 serving on the sauce it called for. I like my Thai food hot, so I added more crushed red pepper and some dried chili powder which gave it a great pad Thai hot taste. :) overall a very good recipe!"

I added 2 Tablespoons PB to the doubled recipe(I doubled the whole recipe so a little more than doubled the sauce as well). \n\nI added brown sugar instead of white.\nI didn't have any chile paste so I used 1/4 tsp chayanne pepper powder.\nI added about a cup of thin strips of yellow and red bell pepper.\nI added jullianned fresh basil as well as some fresh cilantro leaves at the end.\nI added about a Tablespoon of sesame oil, 3 T pad thai paste(containing tamarind puree) and 2 T soy sauce to the sauce.\n\n\nPhenomenal."

It was tasty but I think next time I would reduce the fish sauce just a bit and add a bit more soy sauce and garlic for a bit more flavor since I have to omit the chili/garlic sauce. Lastly, I did soak my noodle in hot water to speed up the soaking time. It was very good! Thank."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is easy and delicious. I made half of the recipe because hubs doesn't like pad thai at all, but I was craving it. It made enough for dinner last night and lunch today. My only complaint with this recipe is that it seems a little heavy on the fish sauce. The flavor is good, but it's overwhelming as far as the smell goes, and that's a bit distracting. I had replaced a bit of the lime juice for tamarind nectar (which is located with the cans of other nectars in the ethnic aisle of the grocery store, if you can't find paste), but I think I will keep playing with the ratios of tamarind nectar, lime juice and fish sauce to find the right balance. I couldn't decide whether to use sweet chili sauce or sriracha -- I went with sweet chili sauce, but may also play with the heat next time."

I didn't want to go to a specialty store to get the ingredients for the sauce, so for the fish oil, I used the oil from sardines (and added a chopped-up sardine for good measure), I used soy sauce instead of oyster sauce, and used lime juice from concentrate, and added a little bit of vinegar to give it more punch. I also skipped the bean sprouts and used carrots (cut like match sticks) and shredded cabbage. I cooked the chicken and garlic first, then took that out and cooked the veggies until they were done, then removed them to add the egg, then noodles, sauce, etc. I skipped the shrimp too...and even with all these changes the recipe turned out fantastic. It was better than any restaurant pad thai and my boyfriend loved it too."

"reviewBody": "This is my go-to recipe for Pad Thai although I've made a couple of minor adjustments. The noodles need to soak longer than 20 minutes or you will end up with chewy, stuck together noodles. I pour boiling water over them and let them set 30-40 minutes. I do not use white sugar. It does not help at all. Use 2 tbsp brown instead and if it's still too salty for you (the fish sauce is super salty) add more and maybe more oyster sauce. The recipe says to divide the chili paste but never says where to add it in after the 2 tbsp to the sauce. I like mine spicy so I add it all in to the sauce. Family love this one!"

Second, my bf does not like anything spicy, so I didn't add the chili sauce either (I just used spicy sauce on mine). Also, between going to two stores, they only had 3 packs of bean sprouts (8 oz. I think) and 2 looked bad, so I only bought one, but next time I will definitely add more. I did not add shrimp. I made as written, and it came out so good. My bf ate all his and said it was as good as a Thai restaurant! I will be making this again."

There were a couple of servings left over but by the way my daughter acted, it won't be around for long. I used chicken bullion instead of stock and I completely cut the shrimp, fish stock, oyster sauce, and bean sprouts. But only because I couldn't find them at any of the local grocery stores. I will definitely make this again. Might add the shrimp next time, but the meal was substantial without it. . . .oh, and my wife and daughter both added a little bit more of the chili sauce to their servings. I didn't think it needed it."

Followed it nearly to the recipe except for using about 2 tablespoons of tamarind concentrate, 3 red thai chiles in addition to the sambal chili pepper sauce, and forgot to add the sugar. Added an extra egg, and used homemade chicken stock. I will def make again, and probably add tofu. Oh, you also don't have to measure the oil, just add enough to coat - it will not turn out greasy and will not be missed. Oh, I also found fresh rice noodles and so I just soaked them for about 5 min instead of 20. Perfection!"
