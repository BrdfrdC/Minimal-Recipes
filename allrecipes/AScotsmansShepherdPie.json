He recently did a lot of \"fixit\" things for me and I thought I would make your recipe...the only thing I changed was that I used beef, because lamb was $11.00 per pound! I also used frozen mixed veggies (carrots, green beans, peas and corn) in place of the fresh carrot and peas. I made everything ahead of time and did not put the potatoes on top until I was ready to cook the casserole. I followed the recipe exactly and IT WAS FABULOUS! He raved about it all night as did my daughter and he has been telling everyone it was the absolute best Shepherd's pie he has ever had! Thank you so much for this yummy recipe...obviously a total hit!"

Doubled carrots &amp; peas, but omitted tomatoes, cooking veggies in half of the stout with a generous T. of tomato paste. Substituted dried mint instead of parsley because it's tasty with lamb and peas. Followed suggestion of cooking in oven, then browning under broiler. Thanks for recipe! Will become a cold night staple at our house."

Replace stewed tomatoes with diced tomatoes and 1c water. 1 c frozen peas and 1 c frozen corn (I used white), double up the carrot, 1 clove garlic minced, double the gravy amount and thickener. Leave the mashed potato mix as is - delicious. Also, I put mine in a 2 qt casserole dish (slightly smaller than called for, but nicer servings). Doing what I did made the most amazing Shepherds Pie that I’ve ever eaten. My wife is a chef at a catering company and it blew her away."

I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the beef mixture before I added the roux. I baked the meat mixture at 350 for 25 minutes before adding the mashed potatoes. I had to use a TON of salt for the mashed potatoes, and I always add Montreal Steak Seasoning to my mashed potatoes. (If you have never tried it, you won't make them any other way...the flavor the steak seasoning gives, is hard to beat!). Thanks for the recipe..."

My husband loved it too, and he is picky (especially when I'm serving him fake meat). I will make this one a lot, especially in the winter. I made it in August, which was probably not the greatest idea, but it was worth it."

"reviewBody": "This dish was a huge hit with my crew. After reading reviews I opted to add flour to the meat then added the additional ingredients and added the potatoes in the same cast iron skillet I used for making the meat mix.. We opted for deer meat because that is what was on hand. Next time around I’ll add a little more flour as it was still a little on the runny side and more meat. And maybe a little cayenne to give it some kick and a little more pepper. (We like spicy..). My son suggested putting it in a pie shell next time to add a bit of texture. All in all a fantastic recipe. The meat filling would definitely make a great pot pie filling. This will certainly be on the menu again."

It was SO SO GOOD. I used a lager and I liked the flavor but if you didn’t you could just replace it with beef broth."

It looks more complicated than it really is--actually quite easy. Couldn't find lamb so I had to use ground beef but it was still delicious. The potatoes are fantastic on their own so make a little extra for another night. We enjoyed it was yeast rolls , a salad and a rerun of Outlander."

Flavor is different from other SP recipes, and I have made several, but really good. I will say, even after waiting for it to set it was still a little soupier than other recipes, the first night. HOWEVER, the next day this was perfect! This will become my new go-to SP recipe."

This is the best recipe I have found and the combination of flavors is better than the originals. The entire family thought it was amazing...including my finicky pea-hating kids. I got around their pea-aversion by using a food processor to chop some semi-frozen peas into small pieces along with the carrots and onion. Since they were no longer pea-balls, they didn't even notice. I didn't have any Guiness on hand either, so substituted with a dark porter beer. It had the same effect and was amazing in the gravy."

I highly recommend skin on red potatoes with garlic, cheese, sour cream, and butter, you won't regret it!"

I didn't have any beef bullion cubes, so instead I used a packet of beef gravy mix (I didn't add any of the flour that the recipe calls for). I also wanted creamier potatoes, I added cream to the consistency I like. I used Guinness beer ??. This recipe is absolutely delicious! The only thing I will change for next time is perhaps draining the stewed tomatoes. I feel like that made it a little too soupy. The flavor is amazing!"

Added one more cup of Irish beer to the roux. 2 tbsp. of flour to thicken, and increased beef broth to two cubes. My potatos were made day before and cold. I mixed all into them including 1 egg yoke. Needed to add 1/3 cup milk to potatos to get them to fluff up. Next time, I will warm up potatos before mixing. The quantity of the beer sauce was spot on! I figured it right. Everyone asked for seconds, so it was a hit! Glad I made larger quantity of this recipe because we have delightful leftovers. After I assembled the dish, I did heat in oven on 350 degrees for 20 minutes because my taters hadnt been preheated."

I substituted non-fat Greek yogurt for the sour cream, Neufchatel cheese for the cream cheese, and Beyond Beef plant-based \"meat\" for the lamb. My spouse and I are on the Noom program, so I'm constantly trying to revise recipes to make them a little less caloric and a little healthier. Next time I make this I'm going to try to substitute soy or almond milk for the sour cream and cream cheese. I'm sure there will be a noticeable difference, but I'm willing to give it a try. But it was great as is!"

I made 2 changes, instead of putting under the broiler I baked in oven at 350 for about 30 mins I used my own mashed potato recipe which contains sour cream anyway and I don\"t put cheese on top, if you leave the cheese off, the potato forms a nice crust. This pie is so flavorfull you wont miss the cheese. I made it twice with ground lamb and once with angus ground beef )which technically makes it a cottage pie) it is really good both ways but I prefer it with the lamb. You can adjust seasonings to suit your tatse but don\"t leave the beer out! This is the shepard's pie recipe I will use from now on, thanks for posting rhis wonderfull recipe."

I'd reduce the amount of tomato product (I'm assuming here that we all use what we have -- sauce, diced, whole, etc.) I don't know what it would taste like with beer, but I'm not willing to experiment with it because the red wine was sooo delicious."
