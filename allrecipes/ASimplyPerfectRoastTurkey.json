I think the broth and tenting in the beginning, must steam the turkey a bit and keeps all the moisture in. It did take much longer than 4 hours with all of the basting, but it was well worth it. Taking the temperature is key. Delicious!"

I prepared it slightly differently, but used the same ingredients. I sautéed the onion and spices in a cast iron skillet. When the onions were brown, I tossed in the squash and sautéed it a bit as well. Then added the cheese and sour cream. Once topped with cheese, I put the cast iron skillet in the oven. A true one-dish meal :) You could easily add cooked chicken or ham to make it even heartier. This one's a keeper!"

Used homemade chicken stock cause I didn’t want to go to the store if I didn’t need to during this time. My husband only likes dark meat, but he was craving it and served himself all breast meat. Gave me a piece and it was super moist. This was also my first time ever roasting a turkey. I’m super happy with the recipe and directions. Will use for the Real Thanksgiving in November. Praying this virus will be gone soon."

I massaged a melted butter and poultry seasoning, salt marinade under the skin the evening before, covered the turkey with wax paper and a wet towel and placed back in fridge overnight. Roasted 4 hours as directed for a 14-15 lb turkey. Before roasting I put sliced onion and celery into the cavity, and salt and half stick butter. I highly recommend this recipe highly!"

"reviewBody": "First time I ever made roast Turkey and it turned out delicious, however a few things that I found which could be helpful if you're a newbie to making raost turkey:\n1) It took quite a bit longer than recipe (and time-size chart) describes to get temp up to 160 deep in the thigh, which is key if you want yummy, moist, drop-off-the-bone dark meat: I had a 14 pound bird, started at 425 for first 30 minutes as suggested by another reviewer (because the bird is a bit cold when taken out of the fridge), then I dropped the oven to 350 for the next hour, and 325 thereafter. I basted only once per hour to help keep the temp up, and I have a great oven, but it still took just under 5 hours to get temp in thigh up to 160 - and with the 30 minutes prep at start and another 30 minutes at end for the turkey to sit at room temp before carving, you should expect this recipe to take 6 hours from start to serving, even for a turkey smaller than the 18pounds in the recipe.\n2. I put the aluminum foil tent on the bird after the first 30 minutes (when I droppped oven temp from 425 to 350) but then left it on the rest of the way\n3. Instead of bread stuffing, I stuffed the bird with quartered apples, onions, several whole garlic cloves, and sections from one peeled orange, per another comment; this generated alot of moisture and flavor; awesome.\n4. For the basting broth in bottom of pan, I used 50-50 combo of apple cider and chicken broth, per suggestion from another recipe to broaden the flavor of"

I substitute Swanson chicken broth for the the turkey stock because chicken broth tastes better and has more flavor and it comes out perfect every time.

I also rubbed a mix of herbs de provence inside and out after I salted the bird. I cooked at 425 for the first 30 mins, then turned it down to 325 and basted every 30 mins thereafter. I tented from after the first 30 mins. It was excellent. A gorgeous golden colour, juicy, and delicious. I would absolutely make it again!"

Makes awesome gravy, especially if you add the diced giblets."

"reviewBody": "I combined this recipe with chef John's turkey recipe. I used his recipe because it calls for vegetables underneath the turkey 3 stalks celery, 2 small onions, 2 carrots. And I also added potatoes. I used a couple thyme inside the bird instead of sage and rosemary as his recipe calls for. And as chef John suggested place butter pieces between meat and skin and also over the turkeg. As far as the rest I followed this recipe and I must say it came out wonderrful. The stuffing I used was cornbread and I followed the instructions on the back of the box. This turkey was to die for! Please do not make this recipe if you are not going to use a thermometer it is crucial to pull out the bird the exact right time. Just a little overbaked and your bird will come out dry. I placed a thermometer inside the stuffing and was alerted by the thermometer alarm when it hit 165\n degrees."

"reviewBody": "As simple as it was, using this recipe produced the best turkey I have ever made. We used a vegetarian, anti-biotic free turkey, kerry gold butter for the outside (going over the turkey 2-3 times before putting into the roasting pan) and organic turkey stock for basting. The two keys were the temperature probe and the basting. Our ovens tend to cook things faster and our 18lb turkey only took about 5 hours total and was at the 180 degrees. We also covered with foil at the end and let rest an hour before cutting and serving. The turkey fell off the bone and while I had the carving knife out, it was not required. Great way to make a turkey and I've saved for all future years."

I had a 15 lb organic turkey and I'm glad I did some research on cooking times because it took me 5 hours to cook a 15 lb turkey at 350 to reach an inner temp of 165, which I had already planned to do. I don't believe my oven is different than others because I cook a variety of home cooked meals everyday for decades now. Please research cooking times online more before you decide to follow just one recipe. The original recipe poster said this is a recipe for an 18 lb turkey and cooking time of only 4 hours? That seems a bit off."

"reviewBody": "I used a wild turkey. I have no idea how much it weighed dressed, but 14 pounds is my guess. I made the recipe as listed, using chicken broth because that is all I had. I baked it for 2.75 hours total. The turkey did turn out very moist, even with it being wild. My advice to myself for next time: watch the liquid in the bottom of the pan closely. When it was getting low, but not evaporated off yet, it started to brown/burn. I will keep it better replenished next time. The drippings still made excellent gravy. Also, I let it sit for probably 40 minutes because my husband was late from work, and I think that helped a lot! It was very juicy. I'll season the butter with salt and pepper next time to try and infuse a little more flavor into the meat."

What I do is use a seasoning injector and inject melted butter mixed with onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Now with the dressing I will add diced Granny Smith's apples, diced celery, diced onions, dehydrated cranberry and raisens (equal portions). In the bottom of the pan I pour 1 (32oz.) box low sodium chicken broth. After assembling Turkey and dressing I place on a rack in the roaster. Cover with aluminum foil and roast at 275 deg. for six to eight hours. Fall off the bone moist."

The one difference would be that I cook it in one of those V-shaped racks in a turkey pan and cover it with a foil tent for the first few hours to get the bird done. Toward the end, take off the foil and up the heat to brown the outside. Then let it rest under the foil tent on top of the stove for 30 minutes or so to let the juices settle into the meat. It is a basic recipe, but it's always well received. Thank you for sharing!"

Besides that, I did everything exactly the way the recipe asked for including the roasting time even though my turkey was only 13lb. Had to make sure it was cooked through since I don't have a meat thermometer. And I rubbed a little bit of salt and pepper mixture in the cavity as well. I pour the drippings on top of the sliced/carved turkey, makes it really juicy and flavorful. Love love this recipe."

I highly recommend the investment in large electric roaster ( 40 bucks) you will be glad you did"
