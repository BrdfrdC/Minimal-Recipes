I would definitely recommend adding more green Chili’s or maybe just using jalapeños instead. Also I feel the cream corn made it have more of a cake texture than cornbread. It tasted fine, just not what I was looking for."

I used 1/2 cup pepper jack cheese and cut out the rest of the cheese (I'm not a big cheese fan). Glass 9x13 and cooked for about 80minutes @300 but I think my oven is not as hot as others."

It was still oily and too sweet. It wasn’t flavorful and the consistency was more gooey than cornbread even though it was definitely done. I wish I had added some heat and used all cheddar cheese. If I make Mexican cornbread again, I’m going to find a skillet recipe."

At the end of an hour I had to increase the temp to 375 and bake for an additional 13 minutes. Whoever made this recipe needs to tweak it badly. I was surprised and disappointed."

The alterations I make sometimes: only 1/2 cup of butter, 1/2 cup sugar and instead of creamed corn, I put salsa. It gives it the taste of corn tortillas with salsa. I also bake them in muffin cups and half the bake time. This makes it easy to share at gatherings."

If you love your cornbread sweet and chunky like I do then this recipe is perfect for you and goes amazingly with chili. My hubby was spooning in with his chili and loved it. I wish it weren’t so crumbly but that’s my only complaint. Fabulous recipe!!!"

So made with 6 Tbsp. of butter, approx. 1/4 tsp. red pepper, approx 1/4 cup mild jalapenos.
