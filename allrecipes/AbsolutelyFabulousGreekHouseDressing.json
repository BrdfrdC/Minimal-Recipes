The only modification I make is to use the same amount of olive oil and red wine vinegar.

"reviewBody": "5-Stars, so this is just extra info:\nI don't care for either onion powder or garlic powder, however the flavour mellows out ofter a day and the convenience of having the dressing on the counter and ready to go is a more than fair exchange. I dial the onion and garlic powder back a bit and when ready to actually have the salad I rub a sliced garlic clove or two over the salad bowl. \nI also am a fan of fresh lemon juice in in the dressing, so I dial back the vinegar a tad and when ready to actually have the salad I add a squeeze of fresh lemon to the bowl.\nI like experimenting with vinegar and often try to mix it up a bit, though red wine vinegar remains the core.\nI confess to being an oregano junkie, and tend to up the quantity.\nAll said and done, a fabulous and convenient greek dressing exactly as published. The the changes are merely personal tweaks."

It’s AMAZING!!! It would be so good on pasta salads too! \n\nI scaled back to make a smaller portion:\n3/4 cup olive oil\n1 cup red wine vinegar \n2 tsp garlic powder \n2tsp oregano \n2tsp basil \n1.5 tsp salt\n1.5 tsp pepper\n1.5 tsp onion powder \n1.5 tsp Dijon mustard \n\nLiterally amazing!!!"

I scaled the servings to 10 and flipped the measurements for the O&amp;V, using the larger for the oil. I also added about a TBS of sugar. Mix in a blender to properly emulsify. It's tart but very delicious!"

"reviewBody": "Awesome greek salad dressing! I made it as stated the first time and it was great. \n\nThe only thing I didnt like was that it separated within seconds of shaking and it if you pour out a bit too much your salad is ruined. I put the dressing in one of those store bought salad dressing shakers and it ended up spewing everywhere on the ride home. \nThe fix is to definitely emulsify it... throw it in a good blender and chop up all of those seasonings super fine. The mix will stay blended better and not be as leaky.\n\nAlso, my hubby hates salty and I thought this may come across way to salty to him, so I left out the salt. The vinegar added enough flavor for both of us to enjoy."

I want to comment that I made a few modifications , but nothing drastic.\n1- I cut the amount of olive oil in 1/2 and used low fat chicken broth as a substitute for the remaining amount of oil. I did this because I wanted a lower fat version. TIP: You can actually do this for any dressing recipe \n2- After reading a ton of the other reviews stating that the vinegar was too much, I cut the amount of vinegar in 1/2 and used lemon juice as a substitute for the remaining amount\n3- I don't believe that Danielle says this in her recipe, but I made it in the blender to make sure that the oil &amp; vinegar blended. \nThat was it! The mustard gives this dressing a touch of creaminess but it still remains a vinaigrette and the flavor is amazing."
