I used my wire rack for the dredged shrimp and wound up wishing I had another one to drain them on after sautéing - they were a little oilier than I would have preferred. But so good! I didn’t like the smell of the wine we had on hand (and was scared of lighting it on fire), so I just added a little butter to the oil and sautéed plenty of extra garlic. Put shrimp on fettuccine, garlic on shrimp, poured what little oil was left over top, and squeezed lemon juice on everything. Could basically live on this."

The bag of shrimp i had was a little larger that what was called for in the recipe so I increased the other ingredients but followed the procedure of the recipe. Why change perfection? I did use 1/2 butter and 1/2 Olive oil and increased the amount of garlic and red pepper.I have never made any recipe that couldn't benefit from more garlic! I served the scampi over thin spaghetti . We both LOVED the meal and will be proud to serve it to guests."

Probably would have been better as a main along side rice pilaf as suggested in the description, but since the picture showed pasta that's what we did. We had to butter the noodles to add a little moisture. I also added some lemon juice based on other reviews. I added extra garlic and used dried parsley since we did not have fresh. We also did not have brandy in the house. The closest thing to white wine we had was Marsala, so we tossed that and the shrimp back in the skillet and skipped the igniting and broiling."

I added all ingredients and did a quick warm up sauté before souring over pasta. I was surprised at the flavor. Absolutely the best scampi my guests and I ever had. I will use this recipe from now on. Thanks!"

"reviewBody": "Breaded shrimp scampi is a new twist for me. The family liked it (I added Parmesan prior to broiling) but wished for more sauce. I don't keep brandy on hand so I doubled the wine. So maybe next time I'd add butter and a squeeze of lemon. Will probably make this recipe again, altho the breading part adds time.UPDATE: April 2015 This recipe takes more time then most others, but the result is worth it. I added 1/2 stick of butter and then tossed the shrimp with pasta. A squeeze of lemon on top is the finishing touch."

"reviewBody": "We loved this recipe, a different twist on scampi. We had fried a bit of bacon for salad and started the sauté with the leftover bacon grease with the olive oil and a bit of butter. I had no brandy but used a blended whiskey (yum), added some lemon juice at the end and threw some parmesan cheese on as we served it on some pasta. Not too much pasta because the shrimp became the main character for the entre. Wedge salad and garlic bread completed the meal, Heaven!"

I used four tbsp White Zinfandel instead of the white wine and brandy because it was already open in the fridge, and I didn't want to find real alcohol. I topped it with half a lemon's worth of juice, lemon zest, and parmesan. I definitely will make this again."

I guess that I could have added more white wine. \nI loved the lightly breaded and pan fried shrimp the best! I dredged the shrimp in a gluten free potato and garbanzo bean flout and it turned out perfect. \nI used cilantro and lemon instead of parsley less garlic and and a chopped porcini mushroom and butter.\nNext time I make I will use more white wine and add a little thickener for a nice sauce."

I served it with roasted asparagus with parm. It was better than I expected and I certainly make it again."

We like the extra sauce to mop with bread or the pasta."

But, one thing I do different (which still sticks with the ingredients), is make the flour mix in advance in a container... and toss the shrimp in it well before cooking it, and put it in the fridge for a while. Might look like a goowey mess when it comes to cooking time, but that flavor gets into the shrimp. \n\nNow, for those that say \"this isn't a scampi because scampi isn't breaded!\"... Ummmm Scampi is a very small Lobster caught off Norwegian shores.... soooo.... If you are using shrimp you aren't close anyway. But... I'm not close to Norway... soooo... I love this dish with Shrimp!"

The differences I used were, replaced all purpose flour with rice flour, tripled the garlic, the juice of 1/2 lemon and about a tbl of zest to the saute, added chopped fresh spinach, and small sliced roma tomato to the shrimp prior to putting under the broiler, I also used red cooking wine instead of the brandy because I was out. Over all husband, 18 yr old son, his girlfriend and my 14 yr old daughter loved it. I made a double batch to have for lunches tomorrow, but as there is none left we will be having sandwiches. :)"
