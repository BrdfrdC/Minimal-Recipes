After leaving the dressing in the fridge for twelve hours, it became thin, runny, and very unappetizing, to the point that I threw it away. Has anyone else encountered this?"

"reviewBody": "This was my first time making blue cheese dressing. MUCH better than the store-bought stuff. My slight changes to this recipe were that I halved it (just two of us eating) and used Splenda instead of sugar. Then, I added much more garlic powder because I love garlic and a splash of fresh lemon juice. This was delicious on a BLTA salad I made and I won't be buying the store-bought dressing again!"

It was delicious and I believe the white wine vinegar with its clean, crisp taste is what really makes it. My husband actually added more to his wedge and he is not a dressing guy. Thank you!"

So, I reviewed the ingredients from several different blue cheese dressing recipes and combined a few things here and there. After that, it was delicious! Everyone that has tasted the modified version asks for the recipe. Great for salads and wings! I've even used it as a chip and veggie dip! With the modifications, I now have a keeper recipe that I've made multiple times. Thanks for the base recipe."

Let it chill for about 30 mins. Absolutely delicious!"
