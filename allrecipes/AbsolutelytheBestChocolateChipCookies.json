Toasted walnuts would be good in these cookies."

Also, I use 3/4 C. all purpose unbleached white flour and 1 1/2 C. whole wheat flour to get o the 2 1/4 C. total of flour (and I think this gives them just the right amount of chewiness). Salt can be cut in half. And for my oven, I need 8 minutes at 375 degrees. But so so so good."

I was hoping for a crispy cookie. Instead they look like the delicious mincemeat cookies I made about 10 days ago. So it’s not my shortening. I hope I can post a picture of the finished cookie. The taste is okay. It’s just disappointing that they are thick. I even made smaller cookies for the second cookie sheet. And I pressed them down but they are still nothing like pictured or described. \n\nI also think for my taste there’s too many chocolate chips. But that’s just me. So I am not a fan. No offense. Next time I will use my late mother’s recipe which I cannot locate thus far."

Used regular sheet pans (special air flow one made them flat) and only cooked 1 pan at a time (verically) in oven, on top rack, farthest from heat source. Cooked 8 mins only and allowed to cool 5 mins on sheet pan before removing. Spent the 5 mins scooping next pan up. Use Medium pampered chef scoop to portion, 8 cookies to a pan, flatten slightly after scooping. Most beautiful cookies I've made. Since I am gluten free, I don't have a review on taste. I made these for family and friends. Will update in future when i get their response!"

"reviewBody": "Amazing cookies! Chewy centre and slightly crispy exterior. No flattening at all. To avoid getting flattened cookies: make sure to really beat the shortening (or butter if you’ve substituted), sugar, egg mixture until it turns very light beige and is light and fluffy (took 2-3 min of beating at medium speed with electric mixer after adding each egg to get this result). I made a batch with shortening and one with butter: very similar results, FYI in case you only have butter on hand."

"reviewBody": "These were good but not great. The first batch came out to mushy and spred way too much. The first thing you need to tell people is are you scooping out the flour or dipping in thus makeing it more compact? After that what I did to fix it is instead of adding more flour I added cocoa powder to make theme cho. choc. chip. These came out fantastick. So If you want to keep them plain dip into the flour bag if not then scoop and add 3/4c. cocoa to the flour mixture. I also upped the vanilla by a bit for more flavor.\n\nEdit..... I've made these about 20 times since and have them down pat. First off, add another tbsp. of flour. Second, add 1/2 tsp. butter flavoring if not using butter flavored shortening. Third, add another 1/2 tsp. Vanilla and up the brown sugar (dark) to 1 cup and white sugar decreased to 1/2 cup then they are perfect. Allow the dough to rest overnight in the refrigerator if possible to get the best flavor."
