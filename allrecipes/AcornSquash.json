The recipe seemed too simple! \nTo make it faster, I used the InstaPot, cooking the halves for 15 minutes, then released the pressure. So well done they almost fell apart, so I put the mashed flesh into a oven proof bowl, added 2 T brown sugar, about a T of butter and a t of coconut oil. Sprinked 1/2 t of cinnamon on top and warmed it while something else was cooking (not necessary if already warm enough) and we devoured it....delicious! Will make for Thanksgiving dinner."

I used 1 tsp. of butter in each half and had a pool of melted butter; I can't imagine a tablespoon per half! I used much less brown sugar too. As a kid, this was pretty much the only way we ate acorn squash. Thanks for the delicious memory! Will definitely make again."
