I can't imagine adding 2 - it would be like a soup. At tip - if you wait until the bean mixture has thoroughly cooled, it's much less watery and easier to fill into the tortillas. We ate some and froze the rest."

"reviewBody": "First of all, this makes a LOT. I’ll probably half it in the future. That being said, I used black beans and 3 cans was 5 cups. Rather than open another can, I just used 5 and added the seasonings by adding the last part of the measurement gradually - for example, if it called for 3 teaspoons, I added two teaspoons and added the third one by taste. I was surprised at how spicy the beans were. I like spice, but didn’t add the pinch of cayenne. The great thing about this recipe, in my opinion, is that, although the beans are spicy, the sweetness of the potatoes balance that out. I put the cheese inside the burrito instead of on top of them. I like sour cream or guacamole on burritos, but these were great as is, as well. They are filling, too. This is a very nice and inexpensive vegetarian recipe! I will be making it again!"

I also used the canned yams instead of sweet potatoes because I was unable to find fresh sweet potatoes in any store near me. The combination of the spices in the beans and the flavor and sweetness of the yams is fabulous. Because I love very spicy food and my family not so much, I added chopped jalapenos to only half of the burritos, so everyone was happy! This recipe is definitely a keeper."

After sauteing the onion and garlic I added about 1/3 cup of water and mixed in peeled, cubed sweet potatoes along with chickpeas (which are easier to digest). I used more potato than peas. While it was cooking I graded cheese. When it was done, about 20 min later, I added 1/3rd of the rest of the ingredients and mashed it all in the same pan. We spooned the mixture into tortillas. Served it with the cheese, sour cream and salsa. Excellent vegetarian meal and the cumin gives it a wonderful flavor. Thank you for sharing."

"reviewBody": "Oh dear Lord, these are good. I made the recipe exactly (except I only used about 1/4 c. water) and these were truly a religious experience. I've been putting off making these because I really thought the sweet potatoes would be too sweet and weird. They're not! Also, you may think adding mustard and soy sauce are the oddest thing ever, but these ingredients totally work and make the filling irresistible. The only negative thing I can say about this recipe is there is a very real danger of eating half of the filling out of the bowl while preparing the burritos. It takes A LOT of restraint. And need I state how healthy these are? I think I just did : ) I ate these with guacamole (although it isn't really needed.) Yummmmmmmmmy."

"reviewBody": "I was skeptical of this recipe, thinking it would be bland, and was so pleasantly surprised at how it turned out! Only did a few things different than the original recipe: 2 tablespoons of chili powder instead of three, cooked the onion first, released the flavor of the garlic by cooking it for a minute with the onion, then added all the spices to the onion garlic mixture to release the flavor of the spices. I added all remaining ingredients to the warm pan to mix, but omitted the water as I didn’t want the same mashed consistency of the potatoes for the beans. I only roughly mashed the beans once added so there was more texture. We froze the remaining burritos for lunches/snacks as needed so we’ll see how that turns out too!! Will definitely be making these again. I’ll probably add green pepper next time too"

My only variation (which is tastier and easier in my opinion) is this: I use refried black beans instead of the whole kidney beans. More flavorful, better texture, and much easier than mashing whole beans. Just use about 1/2 cup to whole cup less than the recipe calls for and less water. I also find that Colby Jack cheese is a nice replacement for cheddar, as it melts so nicely and pairs well with the other flavors. Less oily, too. Sour cream on top is definitely delish!"

Sweet potatoes and chili beans are not a good combination. 3 out of 5 of us ate it anyways because we don't waste food here. I think this recipe must have come about as a creative attempt to use what was left in the fridge so I gave an extra star for that it is creative. You could do this with russet potatoes and it would be good. Also you do not need to drain your beans and add water. I used two cans kidney and two cans chili flavoured red beans."
