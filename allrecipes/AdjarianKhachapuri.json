Spread about 1/4 cup cheese mixture over each oval, leaving a 11/2-inch border uncovered. Fold the long edges of each oval inward to meet at the center and pinch the seam together tightly to seal in cheese mixture. Turn dough over, so the seam side is down. Use a small, sharp knife to make a shallow lengthwise slit down the center of the top layer of dough, stopping within 1 inch of each end. Use your fingers to roll each long edge away from the slit and tuck it under to create a rolled border, sealing in some of the cheese mixture."
