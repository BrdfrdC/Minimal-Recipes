I followed the directions worrying about what reviewers said about being too crispy, so I air fried for 30 minutes and then put the sauce on and put it in the oven with foil on top at 250 degrees for 30 minutes - falling off the bone and moist!!! Ribs cooked in one hour and perfect!"

I finished the thicker half of the rack in the oven at 300 for 45 minutes, and those were very good too, but the 1st half rack, with that air fryer crisp crust and tenderness of the meat was better in my opinion. Either way they were quick and trouble free."
