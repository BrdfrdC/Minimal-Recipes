"reviewBody": "I think the amount of cook time depends on size of Air Fryer. I agree this is the best way cooking bacon, especially for the clean-up. I have a 9qt. basket style Air fryer and I pour off oil/fat between batches &amp; at the end. Wash my pan and basket in hot soapy water then rinse at the end of cooking bacon, towel dry, &amp; I'm ready for next dish. For me I cook @ 400 degrees flip strips at 5 minutes then cook 4-5 minutes more except I cut my bacon package in 1/2, shorter strips lay flat &amp; cook a little faster. I also cook 3/4 or 1lb. package all up and put cooled bacon in zip lock bag in fridge to be used at another time with-in a week or so. (if there is any left and bacon survived being undiscovered) Best way ever to cook up Bacon! Rich Womack"

"reviewBody": "I cut the bacon in half so it would be in a single layer. I adjusted the time to 8 minutes, at 375, turning half way. My air fryer has a metal rack that can be added, so I am actually cooking 2 levels. The top level was perfect ! I cooked the lower layer an additional 2 minutes. This was thick sliced bacon. (It needs to be drained on both sides on the paper towel) Clean up is easy, it was not near as messy/smelly, and great on these unbearably hot summer days when you want a BLT but not a hot kitchen!"

Best timing I found to be 7 and 6 minutes (flipping in between, as written). 8 and 7 was crispy and great for crumbling, but 7 and 6 was better for crisp BLTs where it needed to hold together a little bit. Thanks for this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "OMG! I don't think I will make bacon any other way now! I have a 3.6qt air fryer. I cooked 1lb of bacon in 3 batches. I did overlap them a bit but it's great if you like cooked med well to well done, especially if you are using it for bacon bits. The other big PLUS is that my kitchen (which I usually close off from the rest of the house) doesn't hardly smell like bacon and there was hardly any grease on the bacon!!! Of course the clean up was great too! I used a baster to get the grease out of the fryer and the rest was easy!"

I also recommend cutting package in half and placing the 1/2 strips around the basket with minimal overlap. Check with 2-3 min remaining and turn, toss, or shake up as needed for most even cooking."

"reviewBody": "This has potential but as written you will end up with very burnt bacon. I went ahead and experimented with the entire pound package. The basket only holds a few pieces at a time so this was quite a lengthy test. On the very last batch I got it right. I ended up reducing the temp to 350, cooking it for 5 minutes, flip and cook for another 3-4 minutes. Another helpful hint is to cut your bacon pieces in half prior to putting them in the basket. If you do not, the pieces that overlap never get as done as crisp as the parts that are not overlapping."
