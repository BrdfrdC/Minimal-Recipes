I didn't have the exact ingredients so I used 1/2 c. chopped mushrooms, 1 tsp. chopped green onions and 1/2 c. cheddar cheese and air fried for 17 minutes. The top was a bit dry but it was cooked through and delicious! I may still use the oven during cold weather but for warmer weather this is great so you don't heat up the kitchen! Thanks for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "This is a good, basic recipe. But depending on the size and shape of your air fryer you cannot preheat first and get your pan in without spilling egg mixture all over. I have a Cosori air fryer. It is square shaped. The round cake pan insert almost touches the sides. You really cannot lower a little pan into the basket without burning your hands. And doesn’t work well to wear mitts, because there’s just no space to get your hands in there. Turns out completely fine without pre-heating. ALSO This cook time is way off. At 360 the frittata will be completely done in about 6 minutes."

Normally I would sauté my vegetables and add about 2-3 table spoonfuls of Chinese cooking wine (Shao Xing wine) and a drizzle of sesame oil (you can find these at any Asian food store) when I'm cooking the vegetables. The wine and sesame oil will give it a fragrance but don't overdo the wine. If you use leftovers, you can stir-fry it again in a tablespoon of olive oil on a pan, add a bit of mushrooms or fresh vegetables to give it a fresher taste. I just added the egg mixture in the baking tin and topped it off with a combination of mozzarella and cheddar pizza topping cheese and baked it for 18 minutes in the airfryer. Et voila! Delicious."

I found I had to stir it two times because it was not cooking on the bottom. I don't know if that is because of the shape of the bowl. I also added mushrooms and used turkey sausage instead of regular sausage. Turkey sausage tasted great as a substitute."

"reviewBody": "Breakfast just got easier. No fuss. No mess. No flipping the darn skillet and getting egg on the floor. I followed the description about the ingredients and used some leftover cooked steak instead of sausage and added a jalapeno. It was nicely browned and fluffy at 18 minutes exactly. Excellent recipe, thank you for sharing it."
