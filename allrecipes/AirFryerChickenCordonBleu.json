I used whole grain dijon mustard and added a simple sauce of heavy cream and butter with herbs de Provence. Here is one very important tip that will help keep things together. My son is a cook and showed me how to use plastic wrap to roll up the pieces. Once rolled up, hold both ends of the wrap and spin the rolled-up deliciousness to make it tighter. Next, put this in the freezer for 45 minutes. After taking it out, do the egg wash and breading then put it back in the freezer for 45 minutes. After this, take them out and put them in the air fryer."

I swapped pounded/seasoned tenders and thighs out for the breasts; pre-cooked bacon for the ham; peppered colby-jack for the swiss; rolled in egg and parmesan/ coconut flour to keep it keto friendly; and instead of mustard inside, I made a honey, spicy mustard, mayo, sour cream dressing to put over it after air-frying. Served with a salad with the same dressing. It was tender, juicy, flavorful, and slightly crispy outside. It was a huge hit!"

This is quite difficult as there's just too much there to roll. I don't see how rolling the open butterflied chicken breasts would work. Still, its delicious. I used Jarlsberg cheese."
