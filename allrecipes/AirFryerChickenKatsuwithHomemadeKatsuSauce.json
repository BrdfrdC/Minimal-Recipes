"reviewBody": "Loved it. I would use less ketchup next time, the ketchup flavor was a little overpowering. I'll find some way to have the tomato bit with the ketchup flavor. My air fryer seems to be different from others, that is to be expected, so I adjust the temp up, and time down a bit. Next time I'll up the temp past 375 (which I used this time), and time down a bit more than the 8 min. per side. We love the crunch, and if I'd gone with the suggested, 350 and 10min, it would have had a LOT of crunch, not bad, but way over cooked and dry. We both used some sriracha sauce at the table, as we like a bit of spice. I would incorporate that into the recipe next time for us. All in all, an excellent Katsu recipe though. We will be having this again and again! Sorry the meal didn't survive long enough for a picture, but it looked like that other pictures!"

"reviewBody": "We had heard our friends rave about air fryers and when a toaster oven style air fryer came on sale we decided to get it. We saw this recipe and were skeptical about the ratings - how could it be so good? - but we decided to give it a try. Well, the recipe delivered in spades. The crust was super crunchy, and the chicken was really moist. We prefer the dark meat (and will try boneless thighs next time) but THIS is how to do chicken breast and not end up with it being dry and tasteless. The sauce was spot on - a little sweet, a little tangy - and ridiculously easy to make from ingredients we always have around. His Majesty used the left over sauce when he made pizza the next day. Different, but good. We served this with Japanese Sticky rice and Japanese curry vegetable medley. Fast and easy enough to make on a weeknight - good enough to serve company. We'll definitely be putting this into the rotation. WINNER of a recipe."

My Worcestershire was at the bottom of the bottle so it may have been on the strong side. I ended up with it overpowering the sauce. Once I added it on top of the chicken, though, it was pretty good. Next time I will start with a teaspoon, taste, and add more if necessary. Still, the dish is making in on my 'make again' list."
