"reviewBody": "This recipe rocks! People Rave about these! I have the Cuisinart fryer that looks like a toaster oven. My oven actually wont do 320 degrees (either 325 or 300 degrees) so I do 325. I use my wire basket with parchment paper at the bottom. Use my cookie scooper to make cookies. I found that if I lightly tap the top of them down so they are a bit flatter, they don't burn badly. I put the basket on the lower rack which really helps. I cook mine for 9 minutes and pull them out immediately. I keep them on the parchment paper and pull all of them on the paper out of the basket and onto a cooling rack. They will be soft until they cool down. And the bottoms will not have any color (I tried flipping them over 1/2 way through to get color on bottoms and that worked but honestly, no need.) Pain to do flip them."
