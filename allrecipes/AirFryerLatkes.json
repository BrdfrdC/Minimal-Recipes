"reviewBody": "The key to crispy latkes is to get as much moisture out of the potatoes as possible, and I find that my Oxo salad spinner really helps with that. We enjoyed these as an appetizer, so I did make them a little smaller. They cooked at 8 minutes and were crispy, crunchy, and tasty. Served with a garnish of chopped parsley and sour cream and applesauce for dipping."
