This was PERFECT! Wow good! I agree - this might be the only way I make lobster moving forward. Thank you Allrecipes Team for a “holy $&amp;&amp;7!” Good recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I've made this several times. Oddly the recipe photo doesn't match the described process. The photo isn't showing the tails to be \"butterflied\", just split. For my experience butterflying the tails makes it a challenge to get the meat to leave the bottom shell. My suggestion is to split the hard upper shell then pull the meat out, close the shells and let the meat rest on top of the hard top shells. Follow the recipe from there, it's tasty and easier to eat."

I forgot to take a picture, but hearing my husband say “Oh my God” as he tasted it was priceless. He is a very hard food critic, and with him is either hit or miss. He gave me the 4, and he says it could have been a 5 but he doesn’t know it. So I think it’s truly a 5!"
