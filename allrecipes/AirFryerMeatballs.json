I changed the seasonings a bit just to our preferences, and served with egg noodles and a stroganoff sauce for the kid and the hubs. (I don't like stroganoff so I ate mine as \"meatloaf bites\" and dunked in steak sauce.) Will make again for sure!"

I preheated to 400, lowered to 380 and cooked the first 8 for 12 minutes - too long. OK, but too long. The next batch I cooked for 10 minutes, and they were perfect. I didn't need to toss or shake, because they moved around on their own."

Great thing is you can make these ahead of time and freeze. The only thing I wasn't sure of was the grated parmesan cheese. So I just used the grated in the bottle like you would serve w/spaghetti."

I ended up with 15 balls rather than 16.\n\n3). I rolled the meatballs in parsley before cooking.\n\n4). I cooked all 15 balls at once in the air fryer, using 350 degrees for 10 minutes, turning them over, then for another 10 mins.\n\nVery, very tasty!!! \n\nI made 4 batches. Had one batch for dinner. The other three I will cook and freeze tomorrow, so I have \"meatballs ready to thaw, heat and eat\" for future meals.\n\nSo glad I found this recipe."
