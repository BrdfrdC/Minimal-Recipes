"reviewBody": "I loved the flavor of this recipe, but I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I’m a new air fryer user (got one for Christmas). So far everything I’ve made has been too salty, even though the recipes were for air frying, and I’m big on salt. Therefore, I reduced the salt to a half a teaspoon. I also added a brown sugar, mustard and ketchup glaze from another recipe 10 minutes before time ended. The meatloaf was already getting really brown, so I hoped the glaze would slow that process. However, the glaze was super crispy. I have a Ninja and chose the roast option to cook my meatloaf. The default temp was 325. Im thinking next time I will use that temp and check it at 25 minutes and check it for fineness, then add the glaze and add five more minutes to the timer. Still, it was very good!"

"reviewBody": "This was fantastic although I suggest a couple mods. Much less fresh thyme - I used less than a tsp and that was plenty. After 30 minutes the outside was beautifully dark brown, but the internal temp was 130F. I the deeper I went in, the cooler it got. I took it out of the baking pan and put it on the browning plate in the air fryer. Internal temperature came up from 130F to 160+ within 6-10 minutes. No baking dish next time. I’m guessing it might interfere with hot air circulation, which is what an air fryer is all about. BTW, the 392 temperature is just the direct result of converting 200C to F. I think I’ll make another for breakfast with a couple eggs over easy on a big fat slice. Enjoy!"
