"reviewBody": "The calzones were tasty. I used a combo of pepperoni, Italian sausage and mozzarella cheese. I did add extra pepperoni to fill the calzone. Just be careful not to overfill. I also used water on the edges to seal the calzone to prevent leakage. I sprayed the air fryer basket with cooking spray and used a mister filled with olive oil to spray the calzones. I baked at 370 degrees because my air fryer doesn't have the option of 375 degrees. Thank you Yoly for the great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "the idea sounded great, but calzones have more inside. mini pizza pockets would be a good descriptive name. However, i added a mixture of Italian spices along with a teaspoon with a mixture of cottage cheese (small curd) and ricotta cheese, lessened the pepperoni by 1 slice for room and they turned out great with more of a truer calzone flavor. You can also leave out the sauce and use it for dipping."
