"reviewBody": "These are so good. I used garlic powder and a very small amount of cayenne and cut the salt by about half. They were done and very crispy at 15 minutes, next time I might shorten the time a minute or two. I can't imagine what would have happened if I had left them in for 35 minutes! Thanks for an excellent, super-quick recipe for pumpkin seeds!"

"reviewBody": "This is a great way to cook pumpkin seeds. I doubt Iâ€™ll ever cook them in the oven again. They cook evenly with just a shake or two. However, the temperature here was a bit high for my air fryer. But turning it down a few degrees helped cook without burning. Thank you for the recipe."

I had to line my air fryer basket with parchment paper to prevent the seeds from falling out. Other than that, it was quick and easy."
