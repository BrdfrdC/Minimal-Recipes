"reviewBody": "I made 2 batches, my air fryer only went to 195F so Ii extended the time it takes to cook it however it should be fine as I cue the pieces fairly thin. The first batch I used Montreal Steak Spice (Low Sodium) and added a pinch of MSG since everything I used was low sodium. The second batch I used a Carolina Reaper Steak Spice with a dash of Red Pepper Flakes, this one also got a 2 table spoons brown sugar to help balance out the heat. I also let mine come to room temp before covering to ensure some of the moisture was vented out before covering and placing in the fridge over night. The next day I let it come to room temp before snacking."
