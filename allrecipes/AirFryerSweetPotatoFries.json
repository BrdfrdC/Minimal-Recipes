Created a variation on the 3rd batch: Garlic Parmesan Crusted Sweet Potato Fries Added 1/4 cup grated Parmesan Bumped up garlic powder to 1.5 tsp Used regular paprika instead of sweet Cut out the salt and pepper. The Parmesan was salty enough for me Tossed the fries and air fried them in a ninja foodi for 10 minutes. I cut my fries thin so they fried better. Thick ones were super soft in the center."

"reviewBody": "I read reviews of soggy fries and researched how to avoid it. I soaked the potato sticks in water for 15-20 minutes until I was ready to start making the fries. I probably could have soaked them for less time as you could see the starch in the water within just a few minutes. The key was to COMPLETELY dry the fries before coating with oil. I shook them a few times during cooking to check for doneness. I had cut them really thin so I wasn't sure about the time. They came out crisp and delicious. It is a new family favorite!"

I added 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon. I was so glad I did. Mine were a bit on the spicy side which I attribute to the paprika. I will try them again without it but continue to use the cinnamon and maybe add 1/2 tsp brown sugar. I like my baked sweet potato with brown sugar and cinnamon. I also put them in a ziploc bag. Great idea!"

I did the 10 minute cooking of them, turning them half way. Hard to tell because of the spice coating if the fries were getting browned, so I kept them in for 2 more minutes. They were cooked and tasty, but were not really crisp. Don't know if that's how they come out or if I needed to cook them longer. They taste great, tho!"

I tried twice with the same results. \nA suggestion I'll try next is tossing the cut fries in Corn Starch before tossing in salt and oil, then adding the other spices after cooking. That might actually work to crisp these air fried sweet potato fries."

I used a little olive oil and cajun seasoning along with salt and pepper.\nFelt the heat was too hot after 5 minutes or so, so I turned it down to 375 so I wouldn't have dark fries.\nOverall quick, easy and good. Will make again."

The cooking time for my fryer was more like 18-20 minutes turning them half way. I just watched them till they were nicely dark, but not burnt. They came out soft on the inside but retained a firm crust which was pleasant. A bit of chili powder or cayenne would go well for a kick. Will make these again"
