Now we use the mini Club Crackers. They add just a little sweetness to counter the pungent Ranch Dressing mix. And instead of Vegetable oil we use Canola Oil. Just saw another reviewer mention using Italian Dressing mix. I think I will have to try a small batch of those next time."

"reviewBody": "Since it was my first time making this I wasn’t about to make a 1 lb box of crackers version the recipe calls for. I did about 33% of a box of crackers. I tried to adjust the quantities, but the package calls for two 1oz packages of dry ranch dressing. I ended up using one package. So, it was a little heavy on that factor - and hence a little salty. Other than that, I’d give it a 5 if recipe directions were followed exactly. It’s nice that you can adjust the red pepper flakes to your heat prefs. You could also substitute cayenne (ground red pepper) to get more even distribution. I’ll make this again."

I left them in the bag for about 12 hours and gently turned the bag every 15 minutes or so. Since this recipe will be super easy to divide I will split it up next time and use two bags with half recipe in each bag. The only down side is I felt they were too salty. I will use salt-free crackers next time."

Yowsa, these are addictive.\nThe changes I made: I used mini saltine crackers for two reasons 1)mini anything is just more fun and 2) I like a smaller cracker but am not a fan of the way oyster crackers tend to split. I personally think the mini saltines are preferable to the full size for snacking purposes. The only other changes I made were using extra light tasting olive oil (I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut it in half), a pepper blend instead of red pepper flakes (because I ran out), and one packet of ranch and one Italian (because I had them on hand already).\nJust the right amount of flavor and crunch. I will most definitely be making these again."

"reviewBody": "Probably the simplest and cheapest gussied-up snack out there. Here are a few tips for this otherwise tasty recipe: 3T cayenne flakes is more heat than I like; 1T is not enough. Three different grocery stores did not have whole-GRAIN saltines, so I substituted whole-WHEAT. (A few years ago, I found whole grain crackers in grocery stores, but not yesterday.) The whole wheat crackers I bought were kind of crumbly. Next time I'll just use regular saltines. I will also mix the seasonings with the oil in a 4-cup glass measure and drizzle that onto the crackers after the crackers are in the bag - just smooshing and flipping the cracker bag does not mix the oil among the crackers well. The crackers need the overnight hours in the bag to absorb the oil."

I then place them in the oven on the warm setting. That does two things, 1)the heat helps cook the spices on to the cracker, 2) the heat and paper towels help push out and absorb the excess oil making them not quite as oily."

I wanted to make something that was portable enough that the officers could take it back to their housing units. This hit the spot. The right amount of heat and seasoning. I have made this at least 3 times since finding the recipe and have even used oyster crackers on a batch. Easiest snack to make and oh so good. :-) Thank you for sharing."

I followed the recipe as written but like others here, i mix the oil and seasonings separately in a bowl then pour over the crackers. i have to stop myself from going into the bag before the 24 hours is up! I thought they were going to be greasy but surprisingly, they are still crispy. the craving for more hit me yesterday so ill be making them this evening. im going to try with ritz, and cheezits too."

This is the worst recipe I've made on this site, or really any where. In trying to coat them in the plastic bag, they get broken. I couldn't get anyone to eat them and threw them all out"

"reviewBody": "These are my go-to snacks when I want something savory! I have been making them for YEARS. A few pro-tips that will have you snacking on them in about 2 hours, instead of the next day: you CAN use just one cup of oil, and have it work just fine. Use a 2 1/2 gallon ziplock bag for mixing. Once you mix your oil and spices, let the flavors infuse the oil for about half an hour, stirring up the bits from the bottom a few times while you wait. I also like to use white pepper in place of the black pepper. Pour the oil over the crackers in the bag, and when you close it, leave plenty of air in there to shake them around in. Every 15 minutes or so, flip the bag and give it a good shake, then let it rest another 15 minutes. In two hours, from start to finish, you can happily enjoy your treat!!"

As the recipe submitted mentions, I would think that they’d be a good partner to chili, but I think I’ll stick with my oyster crackers, so I’m not constantly reaching for a napkin to wipe off my fingers."

"reviewBody": "Made this many times now. It is one of the most requested recipes. I do not use multi-grain crackers but regular UN-salted top saltine crackers (or it gets too salty). I tried this with Italian packets only and ranch dressing only but my favorite is using both Italian and Ranch dressing packets. The bags really have to be turned every hour, at least 3-4 times, then definitely have to sit for over night. But I found out that leaving them for second night is even better. I made some without following this instruction and the result was completely disaster, so I strongly suggest to turn the bag and don't touch for one or two days."

Just for our personal taste preference I did the following: made sure to purchase \"ranch &amp; seasoning mix\" (not just the ranch!) , omitted black pepper, only 2 tablespoons of crushed pepper, added 1 tablespoon of cayenne."
