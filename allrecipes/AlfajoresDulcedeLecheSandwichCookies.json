I would not change a thing on the recipe. The cookies are so tender they just melt in your mouth. I will definitely be making them again."

"reviewBody": "I followed this recipe exactly except for the 2 hours of chilling part. I chilled for maybe 20 min then accelerated it by putting the dough in the freezer for 15 min. MISTAKE! This was too long so I had to wait for them to soften for cutting. This recipe is similar to another Alfajores recipe I've used. This one adds 1/4c sugar. After combining the flour to the butter mixture, the dough will be crumbly, this is OK. You can work it by hand on a lightly floured surface into 2 logs. Mine were 1.75\" diameter. The dough was easy to cut and may be placed fairly close to each other on the cookie sheet. They expand but not that much. In the past I've worked the dough into a disc, Saran wrapped, chilled, then rolled to 1/4\". I use a small, round cookie cutter dipped in flour to get consistent-shaped cookies. These cookies are good but I'll stick to my old recipe that stay more crisp/crunchy; a personal preference. Like another reviewer said, don't overbake; they'll stay the light, pale colour when done."
