Also, since I wasn't sure what kind of apples I was using (we have several different trees), it was a little chunky this morning so I was lucky enough to have one of those hand mixers that has a whisk attachment. A quick minute of whisking each pot and the jars were ready to fill. So smooth. Easy and tastes delicious."

"reviewBody": "Excellent base recipe! Definitely a keeper! Used Gala and Pink Lady apples- 3lbs each. Chopped up apples into bite size pieces- added 1 3/4 cups light brown sugar, 2 Tsp ground cloves, 1TBSP cinnamon, 2 tsp apple pie spice. Mixed and using a food processor chopped into smaller bits- this had to be done in small batches. Placed back in crock pot, covered and cooked on low for 10 hrs- checking to mash down larger bits. Removed and put in processor again and processed til a smooth consistency. Returned to the crock pot and cooked on high for 1hr mixing occasionally. Consistency thickens as it cools. Canned in 1/2 pint jars- yield 4-6 jars."

The peels lend that lovely rosy colour of apple butter and have masses of natural pectin that lets apple butter set nicely. The recipe was obviously written by someone with no knowledge of food history or food preservation. I'll use it as a base, but with peels on, then strain it."

My husband raved about it and was making happy yum noises while he ate it on homemade bread. It's just the two of us, so I froze most of the batch in \"jello shooter\" cups with lids. This is the perfect amount to for us each to \"butter\" two slices of toast. It freezes well. A real treat. Thanks so much for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "My favorite apple butter recipe! I have found this fills around 9 to 11 half pint jars. Kind of depends on how juicy your apples are or how much moisture cooks out. Or maybe its because I weigh my apples after I have peeled and cored them.\n\nMy favorite variation: Substitute half of the weight of the apples with fresh cranberries! Run the cranberries through your food processor using the shredding blade first. This will make an amazing cranberry apple butter!\n\nTip: prepare and get it started in the slow cooker in the evening, or about 12 hours before you will be awake the next morning. Then it can cook all night unattended and its ready in the morning to put in jars and process/can. \n\nI have also used only 3- 3.5 cups of the sugar and it still tastes great. I much prefer to taste the apples and spices rather than a bunch of sugary sweetness."

I think the immersion blender is the key to a silky smooth butter. Mine has no water but does glisten nicely. It may have gotten darker with a longer cooking time but I think I'd lose more volume. I used mostly Wolf River apples. Absolutely delish!"

I had a ton of Early Mac apples leftover from an early orchard trip, so this was a great way to use them up. When I make it next time, I may cut down on the sugar a bit as I found it quite sweet. But the flavor is delicious and Iâ€™m looking forward to having it for breakfast throughout the fall and winter."

"reviewBody": "Absolutely incredible. \nI followed some of the suggestions of other reviewers and did one batch with 1.5 cups white sugar + .5 cup brown sugar (i.e. the sugar amount gets halved). Ended up throwing it all, a few cups at a time, into my blender after 9 hours, then uncovered as is in the recipe for 1-2hrs. Came out stellar!\nNext batch I did 2 cups white sugar, 1 cup blown sugar (i.e. 3/4 sugar amount). Left overnight untouched 10 hrs, then in the morning I blended it all a few cups at a time, let it sit heating uncovered for a few hrs and voilÃ ! Perfection. This batch came out more caramelized, and personally I feel is more fit for pancakes and waffles due to sweetness.\n\nIf I'd known making apple butter was THIS EASY with a slow cooker, I'd have been making it years ago. Fresh apples are so plentiful here in northern CA. It's such a great way to use apples that aren't ideal for eating raw due to texture, size or high tartness.\n\nWill make again and again and again!!!"

The next morning I put it back on low for about 4 hours then took off the lid and set it on high for about 3 hours. I also used my immersion blender to blend it which worked wonders. Oh, I chopped the apples up in my processor before putting them in the crockpot. I checked to see if it was done by placing a wooden spoon upright in the center of the crockpot till it stood up straight on its own. I then filled canning jars and bathed them for a half hour. It turned out great. The long wait is well worth it. I'll definitely use this recipe again."

"reviewBody": "Here's what I learned - use a soft apple-like red delicious. I used about 20 of these and added in 3 honeycrisp apples because that's what I had. The red delicious apples cooked down smooth after about 12 hours in the cooker, the honeycrisp ones left it a bit chunky. You could run it thru the blender or food processor, but I just chopped my apples into tiny bits by hand. The type of apple you use will make a difference in the smoothness. I made more than the recipe calls for - I filled up my 6 1/2 Q cooker to the top and ended up with about 4 C of apple butter. Do not be tempted to add a lot of extra spices based on a lot of apples because the flavor will become concentrated as it cooks down. I used 2C brown sugar instead of white for additional depth of flavor. You can add more sugar &amp; spices as needed after it has cooked down for awhile."

The one with brown is richer and darker, but both were terribly much too sweet. I wanted to try the recipe as is even though some reviewers said to reduce the sugar. The flavor is spot on and all is not lost. I did add allspice and increased the cinnamon a little. Just my taste. I will try this again next fall and maybe halve the sugar or just add more apples. Great recipe though minus the super sweetness."

It has become my reason to go into the kitchen. I recently received about ten pounds of apples, a lovely gift. But in time they would spoil. I never had apple butter, I tried it as a sample. So I found this recipe. My slow Cooker could only handle 3 lbs of large Delicious red apples.. I followed the recipe, except I only added 2 cups of sugar. I also used a blender once everything was cooked. I am amazed how good it turned out. For me, it was like winning, a simple pleasure. I will make this again"

Makes 20 small gift jars. Canâ€™t wait to try it on a lovely baked Brie for Thanksgiving! Yes, it is sweet but you can always adjust to taste. I will try reducing sugar to 2-3 cups for next time, but keeping it 50/50 for white/brown sugar. Will definitely make again!"

"reviewBody": "I found there were quite a few adjustments to making this recipe work; the outcome really depends on the type of apples you're using. Also, 1 hour with cover off was nowhere near enough for my preference of thickness. For the 1st batch, a neighbor gave me honeycrisp off their tree. Since they're already quite sweet, I added 1/3 c white sugar &amp; 3/4 c brown sugar, which balances out the sweetness &amp; gives a caramelly flavor. Let it go all night in the crock on low, used my immersion blender &amp; had it sit about 7 hours w/ lid partly off to get the thickness I wanted. The next batch was a blend of the remaining honeycrisp &amp; others I had on hand. After the step of immersion blender, I wasn't at all happy with the taste. Added more sugar, more cinnamon, a tbsp of vanilla. After letting it thicken, it still tasted kind of flat, and any further adjustments would make it too sweet or too spicy. I'll be using it more for apple butter muffins &amp; bars so it doesn't go to waste."

It took a little longer to cook (about 12 and a half hours) but that could be because I just cubed the apples instead of finely dicing them. The house smelled amazing while I was cooking it so I wasnâ€™t complaining. I added 1/2 teaspoon of allspice and upped the cloves to 1/2 teaspoon as well cuz I loved spiced apple. I also cut the sugar in half (only added 2 cups) as a few of the other reviews suggested. Next time I make this I might only add 1.5 cups of sugar cuz it still came out sweet. Itâ€™s a bearable sweet though, not sickly sweet. This recipe is definitely staying in my fall collection though."

I thought it was too sweet, so I made another batch to use for holiday gifts. I used 2 cups regular sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, again using Granny Smith apples but left the peel on. After I removed the lid, I used a stick blender to break up the chunks and peel. For me the second batch was perfect. With less sugar you can taste the apple and keep the tart bite. I also canned using a 5 minute hot water bath to preserve. Makes a great gift and soo easy!"
