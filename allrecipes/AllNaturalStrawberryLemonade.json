Be aware of how much you are making; the entire container was demolished by 4 people who were trying to be polite and not drink as much as they would have liked. I wish I had doubled it because it stays wonderful stored in the pitcher for multiple days (as I found out on my second time making it without the hungry foursome)!"

I've learned it helps to make a simple syrup by combining the sugar and equal part water then heat up to dissolve the sugar &amp; allow to cool (for this recipe of 2 cups lemon juice, I used 1.5 cups sugar + 1.5 cups water). I did add nearly twice as many strawberries and 2 extra tbsp sugar because my strawberries weren't super sweet - keep that in mind when making strawberry lemonade :) And personal preference. I then added an additional 5 cups water (instead of 6). Start smaller - you can always add more, and keep in mind you may be adding ice."

I used 7-9 strawberries cut in half with about 3 tbsp sugar and instead of water I used 1 cup of the lemonade. I whirred this all together in the blender until we’ll blended. Then I added the rest of the liquid as lemonade. This made my so so lemonade taste delicious."

If I was in a hurry O'd consider using store bought lemon juice from a bottle as it may be a little faster to make it that way. If you're looking for a nice treat for your friends and family then try this recipe for strawberry lemonade!"

We spun the juice and pulp in the Bullet, also.\nExcept for a bit less lemon juice, followed the recipe, and it was delicious; I don't think I would want any more lemon than we had.\n Made 2 quarts."

"reviewBody": "I made a double batch for the Fourth of July and put it in a beverage dispenser. I used a lot more strawberries and a little more sugar because it seems that strawberries are not as sweet as they used to be. They are very tart. It was a hit. The only problem I had was that about half way through I had to put a ladle in the dispenser because the pulp clogged the spout. There was a lot of pulp from the strawberries I had liquified in the blender. Next time I might strain it first. Two thumbs up from me ??"

I used a whole plastic bin of strawberries ( what my husband didn't eat the night before but a little more than 8 medium sized ) followed the measurements of the recipe otherwise and this was perfect. Everyone loved it! Nice combo of tart and sweet. Very easy to make, will do again and again."
