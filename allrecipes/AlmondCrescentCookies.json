With a teaspoon amount- I had to adjust the cooking time to only 8-10 mins. Came out perfect. I can’t stop eating them! Next time I will make a double batch!"

But I made the mistake and bought self rising flour, and I used an extra 1/4 c powdered sugar. They still came out perfect. I doubled the recipe and got about 7 dozen half dollar size cookies. I didn’t shape them into crescents lol."

I have actually rolled them out and used cookie cutters on them too rather than form the dough. I find that works well. Not sure what happened with the 1 star reviewer on here but I imagines they did not include the almonds or did not chop them fine. I chop my almonds in blender or food processor basically until it is like a flour. That makes up a significant part of the dough. Maybe they missed that part."

This recipe has to be one of the best recipes I've ever tried and this is the second time I made it and I added just a little bit more of what I like to the cookies. ENJOY!!!!"

My only change was cutting back the almond extract by half. I used pure almond extract, but still find it too strong to use more than that. For ease, I processed the almonds using my Vitamix machine. I baked them on a parchment lined baking sheet for 21 minutes. ty"
