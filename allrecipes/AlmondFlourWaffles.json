If you want it crispier, cook it longer, as seen in my photo. Add more batter if it comes out too small. If you don’t like honey, just remove it or change it to something else. Use 4 eggs. I repeat, use 4 eggs. Why? Because it makes the batter fluffy, plus it gives you more protein,"

I was in a hurry, so I didn’t take the time to read the reviews and suggestions, but defined made some substitutions as per my taste and experience. Instead of honey (because I’m not a fan) I used 1 tsp of sugar substitute, et voila! They weren’t rubbery at all! Instead, they kind of had the consistency of cornbread on the inside and crispy and golden on the outside, flavor was great. Next time I will definitely try separating the eggs (wouldn’t recommend lowering the amount!!!!), adding cinnamon and nutmeg (‘cause they’re my favorite spices)."

Yes, the consistency of the batter is almost watery. You’d never imagine it could make good waffles. But it does!!! They cook up very quickly (1.5 minutes in my mini waffle maker) and yes, they are sort of limp at first. But once they cool down a bit, they are a bit stronger consistency and SO LIGHT AND FLUFFY AND DELICIOUS! No, they’re not crispy waffles, but they are incredibly delicious and very filling!"

Next time I will eliminate two of the egg yolks, add a pinch of cinnamon, pinch of baking powder, a 1/2 tbsp of coconut oil and 2 tbsp of milk. I think this may just do the trick to add crisp and lightening up the batter a bit."

So don't walk away from your waffle maker and make sure you have your plate ready to put it on. They are just sweet enough that you don't really need anything else, but I bet some macerated strawberries and some coconut whipped cream would be amazing on top."

As an added bonus it only makes two and a half round waffles keeping me from stuffing myself. P.S. Fresh blueberries and strawberries completed the great breakfast."

The key difference is that I whipped the egg whites until stuff and stirred everything else together. Then I folded the white back in. This improves texture and volume but is also why one less egg is better. This came out golden brown and fluffy, which is a major feat for Paleo!"

First, to all the people who think they aren't crispy enough, trade the honey for organic brown sugar and they will crisp up nicely. I don't mind that they are a little soft, I just add a couple of mashed up bananas and they taste like banana bread waffles. I also add about a 1/4 cup of tapioca starch and two tablespoons of butter to help them hold together better. I never would have tried it without this recipe giving me the idea. Thanks for the post."

Mixed in frozen blueberries. Check for consistency and add more milk if needed as coconut flour soaks liquid up. Results were phenomenal. I don't like waffles flimsy or eggy waffles. These were right on! Makes 6 waffles in Belgian waffle maker."

"reviewBody": "These waffles were pretty good and pretty quick to make. My 3 year old woke up wanting waffles, and I needed something quick. Every other paleo recipe out there is much more involved. These took 5 minutes to put together. Reading the other reviews, I used unsweetened applesauce for the honey so they wouldn't be too sweet. I did add about a teaspoon of honey along with the applesauce. They were not too sweet with maple syrup on them. The waffles were not crisp like \"normal\" waffles, but the they weren't too flimsy either. I give this recipe 4.5 stars, only losing 1/2 a star for the consistency. Although they lack in consistency, the time it takes to throw these together makes up for it."

The only ingredients I added were a tsp of cinnamon and a little more almond flour. I added more almond flour only because the batter was very thin, due to the fact that I only had jumbo eggs. The next time I make them I will adjust the eggs and see which turns out best! (more flour or less eggs) This is definitely going in my recipe box. I am always looking for healthy alternatives to feed my family, and they loved them!"

I did as another commenter suggested and whipped the egg whites to a stiff peek (with half a tsp of cream of tartar) before adding it to the rest of the batter. It was definitely a light and fluffy batter, and the waffle, although not crispy, is definitely not pancake like as other commenters suggested. Whipping the egg whites is the way to go. It was perfect with fruit and yogurt. So yummy. Oh, and I also added cinnamon to the batter, and will perhaps increase the vanilla next time. But, really, I didn't AT ALL feel like I was eating a gluten free product."

"reviewBody": "My first impressions: *very* strong egg flavor, not crispy, and a very light flavor/sweetness. Some may like this, but didn't really rock my boat. Now, since I read through many reviews before attempting this, I did do some things differently from the original recipe. Because I didn't have much almond flour, I used a mixture of flours (1/2 c almond, 1/4 c rice, 1/4 c sorghum); and I also separated the eggs and beat the whites before adding to the rest of the mixture. My thought was these modifications would improve the texture (I've read rice flour makes things crispier). So, overall result: It was okay, and I plan to make again, but with some modifications. Next time I will try using 2 eggs and add some almond milk for more liquid. I will probably increase the amount of rice flour I use. I may also add a bit more honey or a bit of sugar (maybe brown?)."

"reviewBody": "I followed one reviewer's (untested?) advice and whipped egg whites with a pinch of cream of tartar. Good idea, but if you follow the rest of the recipe exactly there's no way to blend the whites with the rest of the batter - the other stuff is too stiff - so here's what I did:\n3 eggs, separated\n1/4 cup almond milk\npinch cream of tartar\n\nMix egg yolks, honey, milk vanilla and dry ingredients. Beat egg whites to stiff peaks and fold into egg-yolk mixture.\n\nBecause of personal preference, I cut back on the honey by about a tablespoon. I added cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg (batter smelled like custard and nutmeg goes with custard). I filled my 1 cup measure most of the way up with loosely packed almond meal (trader joe's), then topped off the last 1/2 inch of the measuring cup with a mix of oat flour and corn meal (medium grind). The oat flour helps things stick a little, the corn meal adds a bit of crunch, neither adds gluten.\n\nWaffles were delicious with a fluffy texture - not crisp on the outside, but not super rubbery either. Topped with cherry compote and greek yogurt.\n\nOne note - Almond flour is usually HIGH FAT - this is why the recipe doesn't need any oil."

One suggestion that I have for the people who are trying to follow the paleo diet is using unsweetened apple sauce instead of honey and maybe using half coconut flour and half almond flour and use sea salt. This will add the sweetness without the honey and will be paleo. Although, I am not sure if this recipe is supposed to be paleo but if you wanted to make it paloe thats what I would do."

"reviewBody": "Suggestion for improving the texture of this batter:\n\nIf due to allergies you cannot add a different flour with more gluten (which would be one way to make these more waffley), then I suggest separating the egg whites.\n\nWe do this when making wheat waffles to add lift and fluffiness, and it should work here.\n\nJust make the recipe as directed but before adding the eggs, separate the egg whites. Then whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks before very gently folding them back into the batter.\n\nWhisking to stiff peaks is tough - I suggest using electric mixers and you may need a stablizer such as cream of tarter. But this should help the texture tremendously!"

"reviewBody": "Since it's been mentioned that the almond meal/flour used can make a difference, I will say that I used 'Bob's Red Mill Almond meal' to make these. I wasn't too sure about the lack of oil or milk, but I get plenty of both in my diet &amp; I was surprised at how runny the batter was. \r\n**WARNING** These cook up FAST!!! \r\nMy DH (the waffle chef at our house) burned the first one because they cook so fast. As others have noted, they do not crisp up like a good waffle should. Also previously noted, they are more \"eggy\" than a normal waffle (it reminded me of the \"egginess\" of a french twist donut). These two things combined equal 1 star lost in rating. Still tasty &amp; worth adding to my personal recipie collection, but not over-the-top, all-out to-die-for delicious. I liked the heartier texture &amp; the light sweetness. Even better with a sprinkle of cinnamon in the batter. I also liked these better plain than I did with butter, which never happens for me. Syrup is definitely not needed. I didn't add fruit or yoghurt, as suggested, but may next time - I can see where they would compliment the taste &amp; texture. I also think I might try subbing almond extract for the vanilla. \r\nThese are a pleasant change of pace that I will make again &amp; I really love the natural ingredients that allows most of the people I know with health/dietary restrictions to enjoy these with me."
