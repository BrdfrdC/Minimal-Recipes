Increased almond flavoring to 3 teaspoons and added a dash of salt. Used a shallow rectangular glass pan to cut the gelatin into cubes. Refreshing with canned lychees and pitted sweet Bing cherries. Better than ice cream and probably healthier."

"reviewBody": "I couldn't find agar agar so I tried this gelatine-based recipe. I used less sugar too (1/2 cup) but still turned out to be too sweet. I also substituted part of the milk with evaporated milk (like 1/2 cup of evaporated milk and 1 1/2 cup of milk) to get a stronger milk taste but it probably added to the overall sweetness. And I used less water (like 1.75 cups in total) for a firmer texture. \n\nThe traditional recipe with agar agar uses 1/4 oz agar powder, 2 cup water, 1/5 cup milk, 1/5 evaporated milk, and few drops of almond extract. Procedures are the same"

However, it is tasty and a great addition to a fruit salad whether you're using fresh or canned fruit. I used only 1/2 cup of sugar (it was still plenty sweet; will use less next time) and 2 tsps. of almond extract."

The only thing I might change is to lessen the amount of liquid so that the jello is more firm. Thanks for sharing!"

I noticed when I use kiwis or pineapple, they seem to become icky. I found that if I blanched fruits like kiwi, figs, guava, pineapple, gingerroot and papaya, the enzymes are gone. Also, fruits in heavy syrup, fresh seedless grapes, canned peaches, canned pears, and fruit cocktail sink. Fresh fruit, fruit in light syrup, including fresh orange and lemon slices, sliced apples, peaches, or bananas float."

We felt that it was still sweet enough with only 1/2 cup sugar."

"reviewBody": "This is a quick standby for a classic Chinese dessert. It took minutes to prepare and set within hours. The only modification I made the first time round was to reduce the sugar from 3/4 to 2/3 cup. It was still plenty sweet especially with canned fruit cocktail in syrup, so I may reduce the sugar a bit more the next time round. Classic almond jello is made with agar agar, and I have yet to find a good recipe for this. Gelatin has a slightly different texture, more spring and elasticity, but is a good substitute. My toddler loves it, and it's a good way to get calcium in him! The next times I try it, I will experiment with unsweetened soy instead of milk, using 3 cups milk to 1 cup water, substituting coconut milk for 1 cup of milk, etc. This is a keeper!"
