"reviewBody": "I’ve made this once and it turned out PERFECTLY! Here are my tips: purchase a spatula with thermometer inside of it. I got mine on Amazon for $20. Game changer! Use salted butter and add a pinch of salt to the toppings. I used the Pampered Chef hand grater with the little attached cup to grate the chocolate, and it was a breeze. Stir constantly- that means do not stop. Keep heat on low to low/med. Once the temp gets to 300, pull it off and pour quickly over the toppings, then sprinkle more and let it set. You’ve got this!"

I added a 1/2 cup of the almond bits just before reaching temp so they were throughout the toffee. I also used brown sugar for a deeper toffee taste and color ... Delish!"

I liked the idea of aluminum foil lining the cookie sheet. I sprayed the foil with non stick spray before adding the almond and chocolate...clean up was a breeze!!!"

"reviewBody": "The butter and sugar separated after 10 minutes of stirring. All was going well, it was looking syrup-like ... I turned it down a tiny bit (0.5) and - boom - separated into sludge and melted butter. I am going to try this again and I may revise my rating. I would really like to make roca that uses butter instead of corn syrup so it is worth an experiment or two. With corn syrup, when the sugar mixture is the colour of a brown paper bag, then it is ready. I don't have a candy thermometer to know if it is ready at 350 or to know if it gets there. Round two!.......................When you do it right, this recipe is amazing! So, I learned that butter and sugar can be finicky. The butter should be melted at low heat first. Then add the sugar. Stir it constantly - for realsies - constantly. If your mixture separates, you may be able to save it by taking it off the heat and mixing. If that doesn't work - try adding a spoonful or two of cold water and mixing it to get them to go back together and then gradually adding it back to the heat...............When I did it right, it was so delicious I had to make more because I ate most of it myself. I bought tons of butter and chocolate chips when they were on sale at Thanksgiving, so I am making this for Christmas - a lost batch did not empty my pockets and I felt free to try it out in different ways. The aluminum foil is a great addition and really reduces clean up tremendously. So tasty!"
