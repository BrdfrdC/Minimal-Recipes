I make it on holidays with 6 drops of food coloring in the shape of hearts, in 4 leaf clovers, etc. I also make frosting with powdered sugar, milk, and shortening, to decorate them with a border, a name, etc... And that \"icing on the cake...\"asked these cookies out of this world to EVERYONE!"

I made just half the recipe but added 2.5 tsps of almond extract as the one I currently have seems to be weak. I also brushed egg white and sprinkled a bit of sugar on them before baking as I'm not a fan of pale cookies. These are small cookies and also thin -- I tend to roll out pastry kinda thinly. But it made them crispy! Will be making again üòä"

"reviewBody": "I really liked this recipe, but my review comes after a few experimentations with the dough. As you roll, use the sugar as you would use flour. It will help if your dough is slightly sticky. I noticed this recipe got more pliable and less sticky if left in the fridge for a bit longer in the fridge. I left one part in the fridge for a few days just for the sake of it and to have shortbread ready to roll and bake. After bringing it to room temperature, the dough was nicely pliable, and I had pretty much no trouble. Be mindful about the thickness of the dough as you roll it. skinnier will yield a crunchier shortbread. Thicker will yield a chewier one. Also, be aware of the oven temperature as they are all different and shortbread cut thinner will brown much faster making it a bit too crunchy. I solved the over browning of my oven by cutting the baking time by 5 minutes and it worked for both thin or thick shortbread. Will make it again as it is so buttery. Also, will make more shapes as this is a versatile dough that is good enough to cut it in so many cute shapes and make gifts. Next time I might dip them into chocolate or make a bit of a thin glaze to decorate them."

"reviewBody": "This cookie was so good I felt compelled to write a review! It was buttery and almondy and so delicious! I took parts of other reviews and split the difference on the flour and used 2 1/4 cups. It was quite crumbly at first, but using my kitchenaid mixer the dough came together perfectly with just some time. I did add 1/8 cup light brown sugar to the mix because I love brown sugar in my cookies anyways, but I bet they would have tasted just as good with just the granulated sugar. I formed two logs over an inch in diameter and let those chill in the fridge before slicing between 1/4 and 1/2 inch thick cookies. Not all my cuts were consistent, but that‚Äôs what I was aiming for. I let them bake 25 minutes and they are absolutely delicious! This will definitely be my go to shortbread recipe from now on!"

I added 1 tablespoon of dried lavender from the summer garden. You cannot imagine the scent. I also rolled and patted into a log to chill, then rolled in course bakers sugar (turbinado, demerrara) and sliced. The lavender lends a cool tang brought out by the butter (never margarine) not too sweet, elegant little tea cookie."

The dough was so crumbly (Maybe my butter was too hard). I had to both use a paddle attachment on my mixer and knead it a bit with my hands to get it to come together, I refrigerated it for 1 1/2 hours, and it was hard as a rock. the dough stuck to my rolling pin a bit and fell apart while cutting the cookies. They took about 32 minutes to bake, so a little longer than it should. I'll totally be making these again, and hopefully the dough will cooperate better!"

They spread out thin in the oven and I had to remove them early because they were getting too brown. I allowed them to cool on the cookie sheets but when I transfered them to a wire rack they all fell apart!! I was so disappointed. They do taste good so I‚Äôll have to figure out what I can do with the crumbled mess...I‚Äôd hate to toss them all out."

It was so fast, I let firm up in the freezer about 1/2 an hour after rolling into two logs in waxed paper. I fit all of the sliced up cookies on one large cookie sheet but that increased the bake time to 40 minutes. The recipe is great since I can see how customizable it is - I plan to add in chopped nuts and/or dried fruit next time. Great with milk, and I'm sure will be just as good with tea or coffee."

Put in fridge twenty minutes..cut into 1/2 inch circles, coated the bottom of a glass in sugar and smashed them down to about 1/4 inch. Simple and easy! Mine baked 15 minutes and were slightly golden. I sprinkled with ground almonds, cinnamon and sugar. My dough was perfect. Maybe could be sweeter but i thought it was good with that amount of sugar."

"reviewBody": "Amazing recipe even with my blunders! The only things I did differently were: 1) I substituted the almond extract with vanilla because I didn't have any almond extract. 2) Rolled the dough into logs before chilling and cut up afterwards. 3) I accidentally put only half the butter in and only realized it after I had added the flour. I added the rest of the butter and it still turned out great! Chopping up the butter into small cubes and letting it sit at room temperature for a few minutes made it easier to whisk together as well. Great basic and very yummy shortbread cookie. Thanks for posting!!!"

Make them thinner and sandwich two together with a chocolate or vanilla buttercream. Additionally, would make an excellent strawberry shortbread with the addition of fresh strawberries and whipped cream."

Rolled into logs, refrigerated overnight, let sit out for just a little until slightly softened and sliced into circles. I topped half with granulated sugar prior to baking and left the others plain. Once baked, I dipped the plain cookies halfway across with melted white chocolate and then sprinkles. Absolutely delicious - perfect amount of crispness. Everyone loved them.

I tried letting warm back to room temp but it was still too crumble. Instead I pressed it into the bottom of a metal pie pan (1/2 the dough into 1 pie pan), pricked it thoroughly with a fork, and baked about 25 minutes or til light golden. It was delicious cut into wedges. But I was disappointed I couldn't use my cookie cutters."

I rolled my dough to about 1/4 inch thickness and used a snowman shaped cookie cutter to cut out the cookies. Each time I gathered up the dough, I rolled it out to 1/4 inch thickness and stuck it in the freezer for 5-10 minutes. It was the perfect consistency for cutting out my snowmen. I also baked the cookies at 325 degrees for 15 minutes. (My cookie cutter was 5 inches long) The cookies turned out perfectly!"

I made one circular log and one square log and put them in frig for 1 hour. I did roast almonds, crushed them fine and mixed with sugar and cinnamon and rolled the cookie logs into that before slicing them. (and the hint of using my Kitchenaid for every step was especially helpful....You were right...having the mixer beat the dough longer allowed it to become soft and smooth...not crumbled like some people reported.) My 5 year old helped me sprinkle colored sugar on them just before setting them into the oven. Simple, easy and yummy. Thanks for this recipe. I never made shortbread before because I thought it was a very hard cookie to make. This was so easy!"

I followed the recipe's ingredients to the letter. I just changed the way I cut the cookies out &amp; the decoration. Like another reviewer, I rolled the dough into a log. In addition I added amaretto-toasted almond trimming. I blanched about a 1/2 cup of raw almonds &amp; toasted them in amaretto, let them cool &amp; chopped them finely. So after rolling out my cookie dough into a log, I brushed on some egg wash and rolled the dough over the chopped nuts, wrapped in plastic wrap, chilled for the recommended amount of time, then cut them about 1/4 in and baked according to the recipe. They came out wonderful and now I'm storing them in my fave cookie jars. They're incredibly buttery, crunchy and just plain delicious!! I just finished eating one with ice cream for dessert...sooo yummy!! I highly recommend this recipe especially since it just nails the basics of shortbread cookies. You can always take the basics and build on them the way u like! Good luck."

These shortbreads had the buttery, melt in your mouth crispness that I was looking for. I followed the ingredients as listed, except for adding 3/4 cup crushed almonds. Also, instead of dividing and chilling 2 hours, I simply shaped the crumbled dough into a log (about 1.5 feet long) on a piece of waxed paper, rolled it up in the paper, and chilled it for about 20 minutes. Then I sliced the cookies 1/2\" each, dipped the tops in sugar, and baked for about 20 minutes. We really enjoyed these and I'll make them again. PS-- I also used an electric mixer when making the dough."

I followed the directions exactly for ingredients, mixing, chilling and rolling... the only thing I did differently was divide the dough in 3 parts instead of 2 to prepare for rolling (3 parts = 1 dozen each) \r\n\r\nThe dough tasted pretty good before baking. The almond extract was light and the PERFECT amount for just a hint of almond. The was SOOO hard to roll out. I divided my dough into 3 rounds to prepare for rolling, and by the time the center was the right temperature for rolling, the edges were melting from all the butter. I made these separate from all of my other cookies this year, because I didn't want the kitchen to be hot from the oven going while I was rolling something with so much butter... it didn't help. \r\n\r\nThe few cookies I did get to come out were horribly dry and crumbly, and the sweet almond-y flavor from the dough was gone. Dusting with sugar did not help, because they were so dry nothing would stick. \r\n\r\nIt is unlikely I will attempt these again--too much experimentation to get it \"right\" is effort better spent trying other recipes. Cutting the flour, increasing the sugar, rolling in powdered sugar... these all might help.\r\n\r\nThese might work for you if you live in an extremely humid but very cool climate."

I ditched the wooden spoon concept and went over to my hand mixer. There was no \"smooth and well combined.\" It was like... flaky dough. After I let it sit in the bowl while I re-read the reviews, I decided I'd put it in the fridge. I took it out of the fridge and it was a rock. So, I microwaved it, got it room temp, and then ended up being able to roll it out between two pieces of saran wrap. I was almost going to throw it out when I said, oh, we'll just test it. They turned out. Not sure if it was worth the work."

"reviewBody": "After reading all the wonderful reviews of this cookie I decided to give it a try. Not sure what I did wrong but they never got to the oven. I left the dough in the frigde overnight (that may have been the issue, not sure) but when I took it out the dough was like a rock. Couldn't roll it it was so hard. I left it on the counter for three hours and it was still like a rock so I tossed it. Can anyone shed some light on this I really want to add these to my holiday baskets. Thank-you and Merry Christmas."
