I used 1/2 cup of sugar, added nutmeg and cinnamon (just a dash) I added salt as well along with vanilla and Almond Extract. Disappointedly I didn't have walnuts but used pecans instead. It was/is delicious! I LOVE THIS RECIPE! Tip: Don't overmix the wet ingredients that will make your crust rubbery."

These are great popped into the toaster on a low setting to get them warm for a breakfast item with my coffee in the morning. Even with the addition of a 1/4 cup of dark chocolate chips to the recipe, the calorie content for each donut is 106."

MAJOR COMMENT is that this bread is VERY sweet with 3/4 cup sugar - if you're looking to make this for a bake sale or something where this is meant to be a treat/dessert, then I think it's fine to use it but otherwise I would definitely recommend cutting to 1/2 cup sugar (or even less)."

My personal little secret, though, is cutting back on the sugar and adding a sugar-free, flavored coffee syrup (I used Jordan’s Skinny Syrups in Maple Bourbon Pecan flavor - a find at TJ MAXX - just 1-2 TBSP - 0 fat, 0 calories, 0 sugar - and it added a lot of flavor and a little moisture! So delicious! Thanks for the recipe!"

Am making another oat loaf now, this time with dried cranberries and pecans. Yum!"

Its perfectly soft and moist, dense almost because its so moist?? But airy at the same time! Im not a fan of the overly light &amp; airy banana breads and this one has the PERFECT texture! Its not overly sweet at all, which i was afraid of, infact i was planning on only adding 1/2c sugar, but upon reading reviews, 1/2c wouldve been not sweet enough so i used 3/4c and it was the perfect amount!\nI dont see why does this recipe doesnt have 8k 5-star ratings because this recipes tops ALL the other banana breads ive tried EASILY"

I set the time at the lessor setting of 50 minutes and was very glad I did, it was ready to come out then. This recipe is a little less sweet than I personally like but I like it on the sweet side. I did not decrease the sugar due to my personal preference. The brown sugar on top adds a very nice crunch and is very pleasing to the eye. My grandson didn’t even let it cool before he cut out a large hunk! It is good!"

Using electric oven. I loved the recipe and diffently will add it to my favorites but next time I believe I 'll use whole nut."

There was a slight hint of flavor being off - I think maybe a pinch of salt would help. I also had to bake mine much longer than 55 minutes - maybe a reflection of all of the changes I made? It was probably closer to 1:05-1:10. I would definitely make this again."

Apple sauce isn't so widely available in the UK so I subbed some soy yoghurt and I cut the sugar to a half a cup (also I only had brown sugar, which gives it a lovely molasses flavour). It wasn't gummy or tough and honestly it didn't even last 24 hours on the counter! I now use this recipe as a base for different loaves (I've also made some yoghurt-lemon chia cake!)"

I used homemade applesauce and followed everything else to the letter. I ended up having to cover w/ foil half-way through and they still got darker than my usual bread. My son and I taste-tested while they were slightly warm and fresh - the bread is super dense, still moist but rubbery texture almost, and lacks flavor. I've enjoyed a dozen BB recipes more than this one - but this one is easy to put together quickly and will be fine for breakfast when we don't want something overly sweet."
