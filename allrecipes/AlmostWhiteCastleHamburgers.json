I followed the recipe exactly adding as one member said small cut up pieces of onions onto he pan before adding the meat on it. WOW!! OH WOW!!! TY very well done!! The meat was cooked perfectly at 10 mins. I did a 9 X 13 pan, and made my burgers a little thicker than White Castles does, that of course did not change the taste at all, but it DID me more satisfaction. If you are also low sodium , use a no sodium pickle (or low sodium) and low or not salt buns. That'll make this very reasonable."

"reviewBody": "This was FUN!!! I grew up in NYC and had White Castle (or White Tower). The frequent challenge was how many you could eat without throwing up! I wad only good for about six! For 25 years I lived in Atlanta. There was a Krystal's less than a mile away. I had my Krystal's fix once a month (I had dropped to just 4 back then. \n\nHaving the buns steamed just right is critical. The onions, pickles and squirt of ketchup is essential. I only made 8 and ate 4 tonight. I am on the Noom diet and completely busted my 1400 max calorie limit. \nWhen I make them next (and I will), I will try a dinner roll less bulky than the Hawaiian ones. They're a tad sweet for my taste. Pepperidge Farms or Sara Lee will probably work better. \n\nI hope to live long enough to one day need to GAIN weight. I will keep this recipe close by just in case."

I just don't think White Castle uses onion soup mix, but it adds a lot to he flavor. My only other suggestion would be to follow other reviewers in that a finely chopped layer of onion in the pan adds alot. Finally, unless you really like sweet rolls, these are better with savory rolls, which Kings Hawaiian does put out a version of."

"reviewBody": "@ TWITCH RADIO: The information in your comment comment is completely incorrect. White Castle was the first fast-food hamburger system ever developed, starting in 1921 by Billy Ingram and Walter Anderson. Krystal restaurants didn't start until 1932, over 10 years after White Castle, the basic idea being copied from the White Castle system after a visit to a White Castle location by Rody Davenport, Jr., and J. Glenn Sherrill, the founders of Krystal. The two systems are only similar in the certain appearance aspects of the finished hamburger. The cooking methods are entirely different, being that the White Castle hamburger patty is steam cooked on a bed of onions and water, and is never flipped; while the Krystal is fried and flipped halfway through the cooking process. White Castle is THE FIRST AND ORIGINAL fast-food system. The two companies are completely unrelated. May I suggest that you please get your fact straight before you publish erroneous, potentially scurrilous information here that only propagates rumors and muddies the waters for folks who don't know the true story. It is irresponsible comments like yours that further untrue stories about the quality and of fast-food restaurants and other businesses."

I stuck to the recipe but I wound up grinding the onion soup to a powder (for my picky child.) I also followed another commenter and rolled out the meat between two pieces of parchment paper. That makes it much easier to create a thin, consistent patty. I used foil on my cookie sheet and placed the meat on a cookie rack on the sheet. The grease then dripped into the pan. Worked great and easy to clean up! Thanks for a great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "3.21.18 I grew up in the Midwest, where we called White Castles® belly bombers, and I ate my share of them! I mixed up the beef, put half of it in the freezer, and made 12 burgers today. I took the suggestion of one reviewer and put down a layer of finely chopped onions beneath the big burger patty (would recommend you try this) because that’s how they’re cooked on the grill (no beef broth as was suggested), used a straw to poke ventilation holes in the big patty, and cut them to fit the bun with a pizza cutter. The one thing that was omitted from this recipe was a dill pickle slice for each burger, it's important; as I recall, that’s something they always had. The only thing that would bring this recipe closer to the real deal (other than having that little cardboard box), is to steam the buns, they need to be softer, and I will try that the next time. Had some burgers left today which I wrapped up individually in plastic wrap, then into the freezer to be reheated at a low temp in the microwave. Please, no American cheese or Dusseldorf mustard, just a plain White Castle®, the way they always were sold (and yes, I remember when they were 12-15¢). Gotta tell ya, an indulgence for sure, but I totally enjoyed this, it was like a \" blast from the past!\" ***UPDATE 6.2.18: Today, I steamed the finished burger, and OMG, now they’re the real deal!"

We also sauteed half a diced sweet onion (EVO/salt/pep) and smeared that on top of the beef after 10m, then layered the whole thing with 'Murican cheese slices and cooked it another 5m. We didn't have pickle slices but relish works just as well. We sliced it w/ a pizza slicer. Yeahhhh boiii."

My friends were surprised to find out I hadn't gotten them at the drive through. That first time I followed the recipe precisely. Changing it too much defeats the purpose anyway, right? The next time I used ground sirloin instead of chuck to reduce the fat, and nicer rolls.\n\nDo use a larger cookie sheet than called for, and roll the meat all the way to the edges. If it sticks to the side a little it will reduce shrinkage. Also, if you can slice the rolls all in one piece, you can put on a slab of meat and top it all with cheese at once. Cutting the rolls apart afterward is easier than making two dozen individual burgers."
