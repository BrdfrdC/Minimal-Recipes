When i first made this recipe before letting it sit over night i tried it and i though it had to much vinegar but once it sat up it was amazing. So don't judge it till after you let it sit in the fridge over night. I did read a some reviews that said it was a little runny so i used 2 heads of broccoli instead of 1, also my broccoli heads were a little small. i didnt change anything else didn't add anything either. It came out perfect. i also heard some say too crunchy so cut my broccoli into small pieces. I did see someone say they used frozen broccoli instead of fresh i don't recommend that fresh is best in this (just my opinion). Definitely will be making this again!"

Used 2 broccoli crowns, about 1/3 of a red onion, about 1 1/2 cups of sliced red grapes, precooked bacon (it's so convenient!), and the last of a bag of sunflower seeds, toasted. Made the dressing per the recipe except used Swerve instead of sugar. We cannot tell the difference. Put half the crumbled bacon in with the salad to marinate then the other half along with the sunflower seeds right before serving. Hope the leftovers are even better tomorrow!"

"reviewBody": "Let's get real- I am a confirmed broccoli hater from childhood. Just the idea of eating it makes me feel ill. Though I never could bring myself to touch this salad, my family begged me to make it because they are broccoli deprived and wanted to try something exactly like this. I made it- simple as could be, even the prep. You can save yourself the hassle of frying bacon by using the already cooked kind and microwaving it right before using on top. Best of all, everyone loved it and gave it high praise (yay!). I did think it should be eaten right after that 2 hour period since the remainder I kept until dinner seemed to get a little \"mushy\" for our taste but it is an excellent addition to your summer, fall and winter salads."

"reviewBody": "Delicious recipe for Broccoli Salad! I've been making a similar broccoli salad from this site for years, but it's more of an eyeball and adjustment on the dressing. With this recipe, the ingredient amounts are perfect. Since we don't like raisins, I used dried cranberries. I'm also used to adding slivered almonds with the other recipe, but for this one I used a 50/50 split of slivered almonds and sunflower seeds and it was perfect! Thank you for the recipe!"

Used recommendations of red seedless grapes &amp; adding most bacon before serving &amp; think that made a big difference. The little that was left was being argued over by people who wanted to take some home, now that is success!"

Substitutes- honey, apple cider vinegar, and all 3 heads of broccoli that come in the traditional bunch. however i eat all organic and i wonder if organic heads of broccoli are smaller? still saucy with all three heads and yet still devour-able. Tip if you do use honey make sure you mix it with the vinegar first, the acidity breaks down the viscosity and then makes for a nice thin blend to add to the mayo. Fabulous."

I have tried this exactly as written and it was great! remade some time later and did not have raisins or white wine vinegar so I didn't add raisins and used apple cider vinegar instead and it was just as delicious! also on my remake I used the real bacon bits instead of cooked slices (once again because I did not have any on hand) it was just as good with extra bacon bits, not as balcon-y fresh bacon but is was still very good. I see lots of variations to this and I believe all would be great. But as written it is wonderful!"
