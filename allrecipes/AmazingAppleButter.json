Both cooked at different temperatures so I had to make adjustments, but I had to cook on low for both of them. I ran out of cloves so I only used a pinch of cloves but some family members don't care for cloves. I thought the allspice had enough clove in it to make sufficient without the cloves. Will be keeping this recipe and making it again."

It did not scorch and by mid-morning it was ready to can. Only change I made was to add a little more cinnamon than the recipe calls for. Love that it is so low in refined sugar compared to other recipes."

They loved it so much some wanted the recipe. I had a slice of homemade bread spread some peanut butter on it and then this apple butter and it took me back to my childhood days. Thank you for this recipe, so yummy"

I have had to throw away whole batches due to scorching. There is nothing better on biscuits from the oven. I thought this recipe was too light on the spices, but after cooking it, spices are spot on and the apple flavor shines! Truly amazing.."

I don't know if my crockpot heat on high is hotter than some, but I made sure to scrape out the burnt spots. Again, you end up with a great flavor, but overnight up to 24 hours seems way too long at that heat."
