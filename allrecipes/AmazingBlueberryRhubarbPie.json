"reviewBody": "This recipe was delicious! Just the right amount of sweet and tart. The crust was fully cooked through, and didn't become soggy on the bottom. I baked it and then chilled it fully for a whole day before cutting, and it was perfectly firm, super-easy to get out of the pie plate. I made the recipe as described, other than brushing the crust with milk and sprinkling it with turbinado sugar. I think any extra sugar in the filling would have made it too sweet. It's a very adult flavor combination. I accidentally used a 10 inch pie plate, but I think it made for a good ratio of crust to filling."

"reviewBody": "Amazing awesome pie. Our family loves it. I have made it twice and it disappeared. The only change is that I used the 3T cornstarch like other reviewers as I didn't have Tapioca. What I especially love is that it has only 1/2 a cup of sugar total and it's sweet as can be. Having less sugar is great and beats the 2 cups I need for a full rhubarb pie. This one is going to be a family favorite every year when our Rhubarb and Blueberries are ready in the garden."

However, as the pie cooled the tapioca absorbed the liquid and was no longer visible after an hour. For extra assurance, I did poke a few blueberries through the vents to give the tapioca something to absorb."
