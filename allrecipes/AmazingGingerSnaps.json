Also reduced baking powder by 1/4 tsp. I rolled into balls and rolled in sugar, then lightly pressed them with a glass bottom (and slightly re-sanded tops w sugar), then baked for 10 minutes. Came out with fab flavor and flatter like I wanted with gently crispy edges and chewy centers. Perfect!"

"reviewBody": "I agree with other reviewers that this dough is kind of crumbly and a bit hard to work with. But it seems a trade off for much less saturated fat in the cookies. I did reduce the sugar to 1/2 c and they tasted fine. I think I will try freezing the balls before baking them. Maybe the texture will improve. If not then I will try adding butter to the oil and reduce the oil."

I decided to try it out today, and will be making 12 dozen of these two weeks from now, after all. \n\nMy toddler is fully enjoying this cookie with a small glass of milk. \n\nHaving just made the cookies today, I find the crunchy edges and inner chewiness delightfully seasonal and a nice change from other run-of-the-mill cookie exchange fare. I wonder if any will last until tomorrow to see if the texture or taste improves from what impressed me today.\n\nThe only thing I did different from the recipe was to use vegetable oil. Oh, I also lightly sprayed the pans and only halfway rolled the cookies in sugar, trying to prevent any from sticking to the pan, in case that was going to happen otherwise."
