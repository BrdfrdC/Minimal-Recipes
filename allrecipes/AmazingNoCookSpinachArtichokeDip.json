I made it as directed with 8 cloves of garlic, and the garlic was so strong it overpowered everything else. Like when you eat a small bite of roast beef with a spoonful of horseradish. Next time I'll saute the garlic and onion and proceed from there!"

When following the recipe exactly I feel the onion and garlic can over power the other flavors a bit and my kids won’t eat it that way . So now I sauté the diced onion and garlic in a pan before blending everything up. This makes it perfect flavor-wise for our family preferences."

I also added water chestnuts for crunch, but it was tasty without it. I honestly don’t know how 8 cloves of garlic could be used, it is strong with just the one, but I know that will mellow out as it rests overnight. Thank you for the recipe!"

I made it exactly like the recipe, except I added a can of heart of palm( such a great treat) and I added a little pimento (less than a teaspoon, maybe just a little taste) to the cream cheese. It was better than I expected. I served it on mini bagels, with different flavors of crackers, and with fresh vegetables. It makes so much and can be served so many different ways. I am now asked to bring my special dip to everyone's gatherings. I love it! Oh I did cut way back on the garlic. Maybe 2 cloves and very little salt. The cans of artichokes and heart of palm have sufficient amount of salt.I never thought about water chestnuts. What an excellent idea. I am definitely going to add that next time."

The consistency is well balanced and it's simple to make. The only thing I might change next time I make this is to process a little less (do more chopping with a knife and mixing) and maybe one less clove of garlic. It's strong right after making but maybe it will tame down in the refrigerator."

Kept the juice and added it to spinach mix (called artichoke mix) in instructions.\nOh and of course salted and peppered to taste. (White pepper) I only altered for amount and cost. So follow the original if you can."
