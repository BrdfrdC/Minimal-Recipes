"reviewBody": "This recipe has been a family favorite for many years. What I have learned over time: (1) use parchment paper, not foil to avoid a metallic taste and stickiness; (2) Like others have done, just pour the chocolate chips directly on to the super-hot toffee-covered matzot. It will melt on its own, thus saving a difficult cleaning job (albeit taking the joy away from licking the pot). Spread with spatula once melted. Try different toppings on top of the chocolate. We make a variety. Not all together, but we have used chopped pecans, Heath bar bits, a scattering of butterscotch chips, pesadek candy sprinkles. This year, I might try berries."

"reviewBody": "I made it a variety of ways, one of which ways to use no topping at all after the margarine/brown sugar combination. My husband like that the best. The key to getting the margarine and brown sugar to combine is to constantly stir the mixture. This is a great Passover dessert after such a big meal. I served it with a Strawberry Mousse made with a package of strawberries cut in quarters, one egg white and a 1/2C sugar whipped for 15 minutes with a hand mixer and then frozen."

"reviewBody": "20 oz of chocolate seems like too much for 6 matzohs. Make sure you lightly toast your pecans!! Also make sure you cut them while warm or you'll be sorry! I make something similar, but use light brown sugar, one cookie sheet, 4 unsalted matzos, stir 1 cup chopped pecans into the caramel right before spreading on the matzohs, and bake the caramel on the matzos at 350 for 7 minutes. Then take out, add 1 cup chocolate chips, put back in oven for 2 minutes, take out, spread, then add sliced almonds and pat them down while chocolate is still wet. Thanks for posting this variation. This toffee is worth the effort!!!! Everyone who tastes it likes it. Seriously!"

Then I spread the chocolate. This just eliminates an unnecessary step. I also toasted the pecans before sprinkling on top. Delicious."
