"reviewBody": "I've been making this for over 20 years but never had an actual recipe!! So, this was great to find with actual measurements!üôå I've just always made it by the seat of my pants! And it never came out the same way consistently! I've used pineapple tidbits, crushed and chunks. (Prefer a mix of crushed AND tidbits btw!) But I also make a way bigger amount!! I've done versions with a can of Mandarin oranges, added spices (or not), used apple cider, fresh oranges, orange juice, plain water, even pomegranate juice and pins, you name it!! But THAT'S the beauty OF THIS recipe!! Use it as your base and then YOU can add or omit whatever suits your family and personal taste preferences!!!üëçüòÅüëå Your kitchen, your rules and decisions! (I've seen the comments where people get so upset IF you alter a recipe!üôÑ) But I think that's the fun and best part OF cooking!! Use THIS recipe!!üôå As is! OR wing it and just experiment!!üòÅ It'll never come out \"bad\"!! Thanks for posting!!üëç As I now HAVE actual measurements!!üôåüòÇ"

Chopped up the mandarin oranges &amp; added about 1/2 of the can of oranges when adding in the pineapple. By adding mandarin orange juice, didn't need to add water to make a cup of liquid. Was a big hit - people were gobbling it up!!"

I used organic cane sugar in place of white sugar, and used 2 cans of crushed pineapple, which gave me 2 cups of pineapple juice for the syrup base. I used 3/4 of the remaining crushed pineapple and this dish was spectacular. Will be a favorite for many years to come!"

The only thing we did slightly different is that we used crushed pineapple and we added about 2 tablespoons of honey.\n***We also doubled the recipe to can some for the winter! We got a nice bowl full for Thanksgiving, three jelly jars and 2 pints out of the double recipe.***"
