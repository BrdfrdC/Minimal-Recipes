The second time I made it all you could taste was the onion soup mix, very strong and unpleasant. It didn't even smell good while it was cooking, and the pork was dry and chewey. I changed nothing in the recipe. Still trying to figure out what I did that was different. I will try this one more time and do as some of the other reviewers have done by using real onion instead of the mix. I'll also add some beef broth and seasonings. Think I should have rotated the pork half way through, too."

I poured a little of it over the meat, I may not wait too long to make this again. I used a Pork Roast as that is what I had and it was great. I did cook for 4 hours on low as recipe stated. I did turn it up to high for the last half hour to three quarters of an hour. \n\nI think one thing I will do next time is punch some holes in the roast and let it marinate for an hour or more before putting in the crock pot. Just to get a little more flavor into the roast. \n\nMy husband loved it and he usually does not like soy sauce in anything."

I follow the recipe exactly and it is perfect - not too salty at all. Doesnt need searing (which I love as quicker and less messy to get going).\nPork loin or tenderloin works equally well - I use whatever I get from the store or is on sale. \nCant go wrong with this and SO easy"

Meat was very tender, flavorful, and cooked thoroughly. Added some corn starch to the juices while the meat rested. Good gravy over mashed potatoes and as au jus for the meat. Rounded out the meal with roasted asparagus and a cool, creamy cucumber salad. Very good!"

I serve with garlic parmesan mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. This has gone into our regular rotation of dinners, it's really that tasty!"

I was afraid it would be too salty. It was a bit salty, but I'm a sodium freak, so it didn't phase me. But, dang! was it good! Served it with egg noodles and a veggie. Thickened the au jus only a little bit for more consistency. The hubby was quiet while eating aside from regular utterances of \"mmmm,\" \"oh yeah,\" etc. Will make again!"

I also used the substitute for the onion soup mix suggested by one of the reviewers. The meat turned out a bit dry - don't know how that could happen when cooking in liquid in a crockpot, but the really bad part was that the sauce had a bitter aftertaste. With company coming, I was desperate. I added honey to the liquid, and the result was good. But I doubt if I will make this again. There are better recipes for pork tenderloin."

The trick, I found, to making sure all the pork was tender was to chop it up into half-fist sized chunks. Due to oversight, a couple of ingredients were different - half of the red wine was Sangria, and half of the soy sauce was actually teriyaki sauce. \n\nThe second time, I used a pork shoulder roast, carving off chunks of the meat and then just dropping the whole bone into the sauce to cook for the full time. Everything came out tender and moist and delicious all over. It was really easy to remove the meat left on the bone from it with just a fork, it was so tender."
