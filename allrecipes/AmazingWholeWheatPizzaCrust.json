The regular dough turned out fine, but this dough teared when rolling, stuck to the pan and came out more like a brownie consistency than a pizza dough. I'm not sure if it's something that I did wrong or it's the recipe itself - I followed the instructions as written and let sit both doughs the same. Only thing that I converted the measurements from cups and such to grams - maybe that's what messed it up. I'm not sure about it. \nI'd maybe try it again, but I'd have to change something."

Then I separated out in five sections and made personal pizzas in the air fryer. 375 for 7-10 minutes depending on thickness or how long the oven was on. A huge success! I have made this before on pizza stone and found it gummy, but the air fryer made the outside crusty and the inside chewy. I did roll the dough extra thin due to my last go with this recipe. Perfect for a hot day when you want pizza but not a hot house"

I an extra teaspoon of salt and added 1 t. italian seasoning to the dough for added flavor. I put the ingredients in the bread machine on the dough setting and let it do the work for me!! I precooked the crust for 5 min at 500 degrees and then added the ingredients and cooked it for an additional 14 minutes at 425. Pizza came out PERFECT! even those at the table who were skeptical of whole wheat crust RAVED about this recipe. we will be making this one again and again!"

The crust does not become cracker-like as some other thin crusts do, so don't make my mistake of putting too much sauce or toppings on your pizza. The crust isn't strong enough for that. Less is more in this case it seems. Good crust overall though!"

We often have a pizza night at the house. Everyone gets their own dough and makes whatever they want on their individual pizza. This recipe makes 5-6 individual crusts, which is perfect for our family. We've used this recipe several times now, all successful The most important step in this recipe IMHO is that second rise. Don't skip or skimp on that step - you'll regret it if you do. No substitutions needed - this is a winner!"

Finally I gave up, dumping the sticky, shaggy mess into the bowl. I had to add more olive oil to keep it from sticking to the bowl. So I have a giant shaggy wad of olive oil goo over there in a bowl!

I made 3, with a homemade sauce and used the last quarter to make tiny pizza bites that looked like calzones. The dough was a little tough to get thin enough for my son's taste but that could just mean that I need practice. :-) The pizza bites were a little hard to do too, couldn't get enough sauce and cheese inside."

My hands wimped out at kneading so I used a dough hook to do the work after the first rise. The dough seemed dry, I had to play with liquids to get what I thought was the right texture/consistency. Did bake for 5 minutes at 500 and then added toppings and finished at 425 like reviewers suggested. It made 4 personal pizzas, at Boboli size, it was crispy on the outside and chewy inside. I actually oiled three dough balls and froze them, made one a week later, and still just as good. The last two I am going to roll thinner to see if I can get more crisp than chew. And next time will add spices to the crust. Overall a great basic recipe."

Followed recipe exactly except for adding salt with the flour not with the yeast. The dough rose beautifully and was so easy to work with. I've made this 3 times in the past 2 weeks and intend to make it again this week. The texture is light which I didn't expect with the whole wheat and so delicious. My family loves it so goodbye to all other recipes. After spreading the dough onto my greased pizza pans, I bake at 450-500 for about 10 minutes to precook the pizza before adding sauce and cheese. I might even freeze the precooked crusts for the next party to make my life easier!"

In response to another reviewer's comment: You are referring to whole grain wheat not whole wheat. White flour is in fact 100% wheat, it is just not 100% of the wheat (ie. including the germ, bran, etc.). Commercially ground whole grain wheat flour is not available in the US. Even the flour labeled as such is actually only white flour that has had some of the bran and germ added back. The only way to get true whole grain flour is to grind it yourself, which I do. This receipe is equally tasty made either way."

The texture was wonderful, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. We tossed it, dusted the bottom with cornmeal, then baked it on a pizza tray (not a stone) at 325 for 10 minutes, THEN added toppings and baked 10 minutes more. It came out perfect. The second time we made it, we added some spices to the dough, and a little honey and it came out very good that way as well. Very versatile. Thank you for a wonderful share!"

It did need more seasoning so I doubled the salt,but I make a vegan pizza with only sauce and veggies so it may not be needed with traditional pizza toppings. \n\nI also eat low fat so I eliminated the oils. I cook the pizza on parchment paper to make it oil-free nonstick. I also eliminated the all purpose flour and increased the whole wheat. I ended up with 3 1/4 cups of whole wheat flour, more or less may be needed depending on humidity. I swapped out the sugar for honey.

"reviewBody": "I really like this recipe a lot - I will not buy store-bough pizza crusts again! I made a couple of adjustments - some due to preference and some for my breadmaker. I used all whole-wheat flour - 3 1/4 cups and I usually have to add an additional 1-2 tablespoons of water during the kneading phase to get the dough the right consistency. I use a teaspoon of honey instead of white sugar, and sometimes I add a tablespoon of Italian seasoning to the mix. Set the breadmaker on the dough setting, and this makes enough for 2 large thin crusts. I bake the crust for 5-6 minutes at 475 degrees, then add topping and cook for another 10-12 minutes. I usually use 1 crust and freeze the other for the next week. To thaw, I put it in the fridge for a day &amp; let it set on the counter for 30 minutes before using. Seriously, after making this, I see no reason to buy dough or crusts anymore!"

The crust is slightly crunchy on the edge and soft and chewy inside. I will try this recipe again using my dough hook next time. Also I may use only a third of the dough next time to see if the crust will turn crunchy. \r\n\r\nIf this is the only pizza crust recipe you want to try, this recipe is the one for you!

I used Just 1 cup of all-purpose flour and subbed an extra (just under) half a cup of whole wheat for the remaining AP. I bake at 425F for 16 minutes, then broiled on low for another four minutes. My crust was medium thickness. I like thin but I was too lazy to put the work into making it thinner, plus I had already rationed out the dough and that's the size that allowed two pizzas to fit on one baking sheet. I do not have a pizza stone, but after having this pizza I just don't see the need."
