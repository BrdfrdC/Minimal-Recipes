"reviewBody": "Five stars! I like to browse reviews for substitutions and ideas, so here’s what I ended up with. Cut up the bread first, over an inch thick, so that it stales and won’t completely disintegrate in the soup. I ran out of wine quicker than I expected so I substituted the same amount of brandy. I cold brewed some dark coffee, about 1/4 cup, and added that with the vinegar and brandy. Worcestershire sauce is a must for this particular soup (but naturally? I misplaced mine, so I used a splash of teriyaki sauce instead. I was generous with the thyme and added a sprinkle of Italian seasoning (oregano, parsley). A dry cheese would be preferred and next time I would rather use swiss, asiago, or shredded parmesan. Finally butter and toast both sides of the stale-ish bread and drop it into the bowl, generously cover with cheese and broil to perfection! Use your imagination and this soup will knock your socks off every time."

Only one thing I would recommend is to make sure to not add the salt until after the hour’s simmer is complete. I added the salt and pepper as the simmer was underway; there is some reduction during that time, which in turn intensifies the saltiness. \nI made this with a mix of cheddar and mozzarella on homemade French bread. I would make this for company any time. Delicious. Thanks Chef John. UPdate: if using salted butter don't add any other salt to the soup."

The recipe’s directions indicate that the total cooking time is 1 hour and 20 minutes. However, the steps in the recipe indicate that the cooking time is over 2 hours. \nThe bread can easily be browned in the oven after the onions are removed from the oven and placed on the stove top to cook. I turned off the oven when I removed the onions and browned my bread in the oven when it was off. \nThis is a mild tasting onion soup. I prefer a more savory onion soup and added Worcestershire sauce and red wine to the finished soup."

Then when we're ready for soup I just warm up a couple bowls of the base, toast a few slices of bread, grate the cheese, assemble and bake. In less than 15 minutes we've got a tasty bowl of French Onion Soup with an American attitude."

Allow at least two hours from start to finish and maybe a little longer.

Halved the recipe for my husband and I and we had a hearty bowl plus a third bowl left over. Prepared the recipe as written, with the exception of using Swiss and Provolone cheese and used a multi grain bread for the toast. I made it a few days ahead so it would be an easy dinner to prepare after work. Thank you so much......AWESOME!!!"

"reviewBody": "I tried this recipe exactly as written and deem it to be snackey. I generally like French Onion soup and order it in restaurants when they feature it so I can compare it to what I make. Theirs seldom measures up. This one is very good, much easier to make and takes a lot less time than my my version. I buttered both sides of the crouton up and toasted both sides up so that the crouton is extremely dried out then the cheeses Chef John suggested. This allows the crouton to suck up as much of that delicious broth as possible. It's heavenly comfort food. \nI think this recipe however should come with some sort of a disclaimer which Chef John should have included... Please don't watch the video as you cook this recipe, I'm sure Chef John will not be responsible for any half eaten computer screens."

"reviewBody": "The technique of baking the onions and finishing them on the stove is genius and gave me time to get other things done. Layering the flavors intensifies the deliciousness (deglazing the pan with vinegar and wine). The consistency of the soup was perfect. I used balsamic vinegar and red wine in place of the sherry and asiago and gruyere in place of the sharp cheddar and Monterey Jack I used more thyme and a bay leaf in the stock. We had Caesar salad with it and a glass of Italian red wine."
