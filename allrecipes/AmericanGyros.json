I followed the recipe and it is just like I used to have in the city. After step 4, I froze the slices and took them out to defrost as I needed them. It is great to have a quick and easy dinner in under 5 minutes. Of course, I served them in a warmed pita with tzatziki sauce, Chef John's pickled onions, lettuce and tomato."

The first time I made this recipe, I followed the directions and allowed the meat to cook and then pan fried to caramelize. Unfortunately, I found that step dried the meat out. This time, I sliced it right from the oven and it was delicious!! The tzatziki saucier is great — but if you’re not a huge fan of spicy, leave the cayenne out or simply a sprinkle will do. Very good recipe!"

Admittedly, I did leave out the cinnamon and I also used 2/3 beef and 1/3 lamb, which was just a personal preference for me. I am going to scour the rest of Chef John's recipes now because this was so amazing. Thank you!"

We ate it with tzatziki, chopped tomatoes, and pickled onions. I think the pickled onions are so important to cut through the richness, and so don't skip those either. Definitely better than any takeout or gyros from the store, and worth the time."

"reviewBody": "This is an amazing method for approximating authentic gyros from a Greek restaurant. I did not take any shortcuts and I'm glad I didn't. Browning the meat is absolutely necessary and well worth the labor. I do suggest that you start out with medium heat and incrementally increase the temperature if necessary. Medium-high heat created a smoky house and I think I could have avoided that if I had been a little more judicious with the temperature. Once the cast iron skillet reaches a targeted temperature, it takes awhile to it back it down. Take your time and increase the temperature as needed. The recipe doesn't mention it, but most gyros that I have had include tomatoes, tzatziki sauce, onion, and maybe a little lettuce. I used Chef John's Tzatziki Sauce and his pita break recipe as well. I did leave out the cinnamon. Maybe next time, Chef John. Great stuff. We loved it."

I didn't make the bread but used the same bakery as my favorite restaurant uses. The sauce is great and leftovers make a great snack with raw veggies. Keep a jar of pickled onions in the fridge.

I followed the recipe and didn’t change any ingredients. Served it with sliced tomato, red onion, and store bought sauce on pita bread. Absolutely perfect. I’ll be making this again, and often!"

Followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it tasted just like the gyros we get from our local place. I found some tzatziki ranch dressing at the store in the area with the refrigerated salad dressings to put on it. The meat, dressing, lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers were just perfect."

Also I wanted a quick meal, so only cooked it in the oven - not chilled/sauteed. That left the meat kinda soft, but so delicious!"

"reviewBody": "This was good. The only change I made was to omit the cinnamon and bread crumbs. I don’t think these were missed. Neither belong in gyro meat in my humble opinion. Hubby liked it and thought it was meat loaf. I did grind my own lamb and run the meat onions and spices in a food processor. I don’t think you get the right texture if you don’t use a food processor. It actually killed my processor so now I need a new one. I will be making this again. Great recipe."

I think I may have wasted some of the flavor by not doing that.?"

"reviewBody": "3.7.18 Followed this recipe to the letter, and there was one ingredient that I had reservations about, but I added it anyway, and that was cinnamon. After the meat came out of the oven, I sliced off a small piece, and OMG could I taste that spice. I told my husband there was one thing I didn’t like about the meat but didn’t tell him what, and asked him to take a bite. He immediately said it’s the cinnamon, and I don’t like it either. We live fairly close to a large Greek community in Florida, and I’ve had many, many delicious gyros over the years, and never tasted even a hint of cinnamon. This recipe certainly measures up very well, but WITHOUT the cinnamon. This is so easy to make, can be made in advance, and I love how quickly you can get a good quality gyro on the table in the evening. The cinnamon may be a personal taste issue with me, but I’ll be making this recipe again, and will just omit the cinnamon making it a 5-star recipe for me. ••••UPDATE 5.5.18: Had some in the freezer so I used the mandolin to slice the meat which cut it thinner than possible with a knife, perfectly to be honest . Just really tasty. This recipe is better than most gyros you'll find at restaurants."

Made twice as it is a new family fave. Used Naan bread and tomatos and cucumbers from the garden. I couldn't find lamb so used 1 lb. of meatball mix and 1 lb of ground pork. Delish!"
