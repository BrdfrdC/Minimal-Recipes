After draining the mixture I added a can of condensed vegetable soup but mine has no corn so I also added about 200g canned corn. I replaced the IP lid just to keep the contents warm then peeled the potatoes and put them into the kitchenaid mixer. I mixed at 1 for about 45 seconds.\nSome thinly sliced old cheddar was placed on top of the potatoes after they went onto the meat mixture I had placed into an 8\" square pyrex pan.\nTwenty minutes later and voila! \nSalt and pepper were added by individuals as was butter.\nVery easy, tasty and quick."

When cut for packaging it resembles a moon or shalf moon. It is made from cow's milk rather than sheep's or goat's milk. The flavour can be anything from mild to sharp but it is usually a Colby or Jack cheese."

I didn't use any thyme, the kids don't like onions so those are out, I don't eat celery so that had to go. I did throw in a can of peas, corn, and green beans. For the cheese I used Mexican blend shredded, and a little mozzarella. Everyone in the house loved it. A wonderfully flexible recipe!"

I did not use thyme or vegetable soup. I made my own mashed potatos to put on top and mixed some cheese into the potatos instead of topping it with cheese at the end. You really can throw anything you want in there. My boyfriend &amp; I both agreed this was one of the best things I have made in awhile. Don't be afraid to experiment!

"reviewBody": "This recipe was good with modifications (thank you, Sworden!). I really liked it, and my boyfriend thought it was good, but not great. I added a clove of garlic to the hamburger, celery, and onions and cooked that on the stove. I used vegetable soup. I also added about half a can of green beans, half a can of corn, and -- this is SO important -- 3 tablespoons of worchestire sauce. Without the worchestire, this would be super bland. I also added the 4-cheese Idahoan brand potatoes on top, which tasted great! I only used one package, and it was barely enough to cover the top. If you want a thick layer of taters, you should use 1 1/2 to two packages of potatoes. Served this with cornbread, which was a great flavor combo. I also used very lean ground beef to cut fat and so I didn't even have to strain the beef after cooking. Will make this again."

Use any cream of soup, I think it is best with cream of mushroom. Mix soup with Cooked beef and onion. Use this as the bottom layer. Add steamed or canned corn as 2nd layer. Mashed potatoes are the third layer. The use American cheese slices to cover top. My late father made this when mom was away. \"snow on the mountain\""

I added corn, green beans, 3 T of Worcestershire sauce (brings out the flavor), 1 clove of garlic when cooking meat. Instead of ground beef, I used ground turkey. I also used Idahoan Four Cheese potatoes and omitted the thyme, since I'm not a big fan of thyme. It was amazing! Definitely will be making this again! Thank you so much for this recipe!\r\nUpdate....I tried it with cream of mushroom soup, and it still tastes wonderful. Definitely add the Worcestershire; without it, it's bland."

I added Worcestershire to the meat along with a few other spices (pepper, garlic powder). I put some thawed frozen peas and carrots on the meat before adding the potatoes. I used the steam and mash potatoes from the freezer section (Ore Ida brand) and they worked great. Really easy for a weekday night. I'm a huge mashed potato snob and I thought those were just fine. Just add some butter and milk and they fluff up just fine. I'll be making this one again."

I also added some frozen peas to beef mixture I added the soup to the meat / veg mixture in the frying pan and mixed together. We like lots of potatoes, so I used 6 rather huge ones... I also omitted the cheese, as we are lactose interolerant. Yummy!!!!"
