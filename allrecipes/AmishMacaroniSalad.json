After chilling, I did add more mayo, but that was only needed because of the increased amount of pasta used."

"reviewBody": "I have made this 3 times. There is a possibility that if you use all mayonnaise, you might want some sugar, but if using Miracle Whip, that’s plenty sweet on its own. 1st time I followed the recipe exactly, except I used only ¼ cup sugar. Way too sweet. 2nd time I used ½ mayo, ½ Miracle Whip and ¼ cup sugar. Still way too sweet. 3rd time I used ½ mayo, ½ Miracle Whip and NO sugar, and this was good to us. The salad is begging for some color. I know the Amish don’t do this, but I threw in a tiny bit of chopped olives and a tiny bit of chopped parsley, just for color. If you want a complete meal from the leftovers, add a can of tuna to a bowlful for a delicious tuna salad."

I used half again the amount of macaroni (3 cups total) and pretty much follow the recipe as is, except for the sugar. 3/4 of a cup of sugar sounded like WAY too much. I wish I'd read the reviews first to confirm that!! I ended up adding less than 1/4 cup and it still tasted too sweet. I'm wondering if this is a typo. I don't make desserts with that much sugar. Anyway, I tried to balance the sweetness with more egg and veggies. Otherwise, it's a great recipe, easy and uses ingredients I generally have on hand."

The second adjustment I made was I only did 3 tablespoons of sugar. The third adjustment is I used fat free/ light miracle whip to cut down the diary. Especially since my grandpa has been craving macaroni salad and he’s not supposed to have that much diary. The last adjustment I made was 4 eggs instead of 3. But this recipe was great and you can customize it."

"reviewBody": "Typically if you are adding sugar and vinegar you'd be using mayonnaise, not Miracle Whip. Miracle Whip already has that in it, hence the tangy zip. This recipe is meant to be very sweet, so be aware of that and adjust accordingly. I used mayo and reduced the sugar by tasting as I mixed it. Also, how you prepare the macaroni matters a lot. If it is cooked al dente, it will be a smaller amount, cooked well done it will be a larger volume with the extra water it soaks up. According to Cook's Illustrated, overcooking macaroni is a good thing when making a mac salad---it soaks up the dressing better."

Makes perfect sense, really, when you have a barn to raise and quilts to make--there's no time for dessert. Since I'm not as busy, I keep the two meals separate by cutting the sugar back to a tablespoon or two, and I use sweet pickle relish. Everything else I kept the same. I've made this ahead to take camping, and it tastes just as fresh the next day or two."

I reduced the sugar to an 8th of a cup , increased the vinegar based on our tastes, and doubled the noodles. Might go a little heavier on the veggies next time but that was my bad since I doubled the noodles and didn’t increase the veggies to make up for it."

I cut the recipe in half to suit the needs of a two person household, which resulted in a little guesswork as to amounts of certain ingredients. Didn't hurt the recipe a bit. This is one of those \"adjust to suit yourself\" recipes that you can't mess up."

"reviewBody": "My family loves Amish macaroni salad. I decided to try to make it today. This recipe was perfect. I did add/change a few things.Are used olive oil mayonnaise instead of miracle whip. And I used 1/2 cup more because I like my dressing thicker. I didn’t have an onion, but I had a Shallot, so I use that instead.I added a tablespoon of rice vinegar as well as the 2 1/4 tablespoons of white vinegar. I also added chopped olives. My mother put olives in all of her picnic salads and this was a pleasant addition! Some said that that was too much sugar, but I used the three-quarter cups. Maybe the extra brine of the olives offset the flavor of the sugar, but the ratios were spot on. My wife loved it, and she’s an Amish salad aficionado, so I know this recipe is good!"

I also reduce the sugar to 1/8 of a cup, and I reduce the mustard to 2 Tbsp. The original recipe is WAY too sweet. I also like the way the salad looks with only 2 Tbsp of mustard. More creamy looking, instead of such a yellow tinge, but still has all the great flavour."

Next time I’ll throw in only half of an onion and reduce mustard to 1 1/2 Tbsp. mustard. I would also reduce the celery seed to 1/4-1/2 tsp. Last, I would add at least one more egg, maybe more, and leave out the yolks. I think it has the potential to be really good with the adjustments!"
