I made a gluten-free filling with bacon, the mushroom stems, red pepper, a clove of garlic, a small onion and some oregano from my garden. I sprinkled in some parmesan cheese and colby jack chunks that I placed in each mushroom cap before filling. That melted just right, and worked well. But the 400 degrees at 20 minutes was right on for me and these got rave reviews from my family. Thanks for sharing!"

It made a lot of mixture which I'll use the extra for omelets as someone else suggested."

I used turkey Italian sausage, 1-1/2 C. mozzarella cheese, 1/2 C. asiago cheese, left out the basil since the sausage is spicy, and added 2 T. white wine because the stuffing seemed rather dry. I subbed 2 T. olive oil for the margarine and sprinkled 1/2 C. romano cheese on all last 10 min. of baking. As a previous reviewer suggested, the pack of mushrooms from Costco was just right to use up all the stuffing. I didn't cook the mushrooms first but had no trouble with them getting soggy from too much liquid. As one reviewer stated, they were a bit like a meatball in a mushroom, but hey, WE LOVE MEATBALLS!"

Check the water level to be sure not too much water is released and rise up to the stuffing. The mushrooms were completely cooked through as well. They were devoured at Christmas dinner."

I also bought 3 pounds of mushrooms (but only used stems from 2 pounds of the mushrooms). It turned out to be the perfect amount of stuffing! I will definitately be making this again. My friends once again raved over this recipe."

I used very large stuffing mushrooms, so I added a little water to the casserole while baking to ensure the mushroom was cooked through and not dried out. The cheese and bell peppers really make this recipe special."

I modified it to be vegetarian and also for personal tastes (I left out the bell peppers, added onions and twice the garlic and used fake sausage(gimme lean) instead of the hamburger) I brought the mushrooms to Thanksgiving dinner, and they disapeared in about two minutes! Everyone raved about them, and were shocked to hear I used fake sausage (none of them are vegetarian and they are usually a little afraid of vegetarian type products and recipies) My friends grandmother even made me promise to send her the recipie! I think the only thing I'd change next time is to make at least 5 times as much :-)"
