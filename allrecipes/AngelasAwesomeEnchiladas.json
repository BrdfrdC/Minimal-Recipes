I used light everything and actually used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream in the soup mix just because I didn’t have enough sour cream. That was the only change I made. It was perfect!"

I read reviews that said that enchiladas do not have chicken soup, this was bland etc. absolutely not true for us, it made the dish spectacular. I made the tray for my husband as written, the only change I made was added a generous dash of cumin to the chicken mixture. (For myself I suffer from chronic heartburn so in another dish I filled 3 tortillas with the chicken mixture with cheese as directed and topped with some of the reserved soup/sour cream mixture, and leftover chicken mixture and finally cheese. Not sure which one tasted better with or without the enchilada sauce, I think mine was but my hubby thought his was either was this was fantastic, I highly recommend it."
