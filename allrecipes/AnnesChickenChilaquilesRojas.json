"reviewBody": "This was OK. I didn't have the cojita cheese, so just used extra shredded Mexican cheese. Otherwise, followed the recipe as is. Flavor was good - kind of has an enchilada flavor, but dry. I was concerned about the tortilla chips getting mushy when covered in the sauce - so I did tossed them quickly. However, they kind of mushed together when baked - so I wasn't very fond of the texture. If it had more sauce, maybe it would be better. If I made this again, I would use fewer chips, increase the sauce and eat with a lot of salsa and sour cream. Also - if you already have shredded chicken on hand, that will save a lot of time!"

"reviewBody": "Okay, I probably overdid it with the tortilla chips, and I would make the tomato sauce mixture even bigger ---- but this was a REAL HIT for my family of 7. I got lots of \"thanks for making that , Mom\" from all the kids. I used the InstaPot to pressure cook the chicken. I think that helped make it moist. I doubled the recipe. Will make again for sure."
