I used 1 can cream of mushroom soup + 1 can of water instead of fresh mushrooms~ only because my hubby isn't a fan~ I added it after the veggies heated in the flour/roux. Also, I cheated by using cooked shrimp so I added them at the end."

"reviewBody": "I'm a very picky eater and dislike grocery shopping. I stumbled upon this recipe one day and saw how little ingredients it required so decided I would try it. I couldn't believe how great it tasted. Since trying this recipe a month ago, I had been making it every weekend and eat them for lunch and dinner for the upcoming week. I doubled the recipes (40 servings) and finished eating the entire thing in less than a week. I'm addicted to this recipe. I will continue to make it once a week until I get sick of it, which I don't think I ever will.\n\nFew things I modified: I add some starch for thickening and 1/2-3/4 cup of red wine. I cook the shrimp for 15 minutes instead of the suggested 45. Also, to save some money, I double all the ingredients except for shrimp. \n\nThank you so much for sharing such an awesome recipe. You make a picky eater like me so happy. I have problem with keeping weight on me due to my laziness of cooking and I don't like spending money eating out, but thanks to this recipe I have been maintaining my weight since I enjoy eating this so much."

I used chicken broth &amp; white wine instead of water (a little over a cup). I also seasoned the shrimp in some old bay prior to cooking. I also did some other things to the sauce.. I used \"Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning\" (instead of salt) along with the paprika, a couple dashes of Whorcestershire sauce, I also added a chopped tomato for some flavor and color. With a few changes I would give this 5 star &amp; I will keep it and make it again!!"

I use 1 stick butter and 1/2 C olive oil. I add a green bell pepper chopped and a can of Rotel tomatoes. I add the water/ chicken broth and Rotels right after mixing in of the flour and let it all cook for about 15 minutes. If it needs to be thickened I add a mixture of cornstarch and white wine. I agree with another review that the shrimp is cooked way to long. I used chopped shrimp and crawfish tails and cook for about 6-7 minutes. This recipe will make 6-8 good size servings. Not even close to 20 small cup size servings. I find it delicious."

I also added half a large tomato, a green bell pepper, some worchestershire, and hot sauce. I agree that it seemed rather bland before adding the extra flavors. It was very tasty over rice!"

Made a few revisions to accommodate my own tastes.. Chicken stock instead of water.. a small can of tomato paste.. chopped green pepper.. added cooked, brown rice at the very end to thicken it up and add some heartiness.. come chili powder &amp; hot sauce for more kick.. Oh, and some salt to taste. I know.. a lot of revisions!! I'd use this recipe as a starting point again, for sure! Very yummy."

Based on other reviewers' comments, I agreed that, as is, this dish needed some depth of flavors; so I used chicken broth rather than water, added homemade cajun seasoning (rather than just paprika, cayenne, S&amp;P), a little worcestershire, some tomato paste, garlic powder along with the fresh, &amp; a bit of white wine. I used a portabello mushroom &amp; all that was available in my town was already-cooked shrimp, which I tossed in toward the end, after the sauce had simmered, to warm it through. Served over sticky rice alongside steamed buttery broccoli. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Ann!"

Based on other reviews, I added chicken broth, a can of rotel original, tony chachere's, old bay, sliced okra, crab meat.....served it over rice with cornbread, my fiance' who's Arabic, loved it too, the gravy/sauce lingers on your tongue and you just want to keep eating until its all gone.
