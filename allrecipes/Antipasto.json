"reviewBody": "This was my first time making anti pasto, I followed other reviews on halfing the amount of vinegar and oil. Next time I would add a second can of tuna as my boyfriend said there wasn't enough. This does make a huge amount - I even had to go buy a bigger pot to cook it in- but I just put it into jars and they sealed from the heat. It turned out well, the flavor definitely increases over time so it's nice to let the jar sit for a week or two."

"reviewBody": "So delicious! I made a half serving of this, and it was still a huge amount of antipasto, i gave some away and froze some for later. I used 4* cans of tomato paste instead of one, cut out the mushrooms (i dont' like them), and instead put in 2* cups of capers and upped the amount of olives to 2* cups each. I also used pickled pearl onions, and after the whole concoction was cooled, I briefly put it in the food processor to give it a great consistency for crackers :) definitely will make again. *adjusted to fit the original recipe"

I would eliminate the pickling spice and add Italian spices directly to the tomato sauce. I put my canning jars in the dishwasher, wash them and dry with heat. When they are done, I put the hot antipasto in them and put the seals/caps on. I just heard two seal. No need to put in water bath if you start with hot jars."

I added pepperoncini to the batch but make sure you cut the bottom of each pepper to allow some of the vinegar to drain out or your antipasto with have a HUGE zing to it!"

"reviewBody": "I also found this recipe to have too much vinegar at first. But I remedied this by adding a half cup of ketchup, a quarter cup of white sugar and another small can of tomato paste. That fixed it. I also have to note that once canned in my pressure canner, this recipe takes on a rich, fuller taste and the texture is also improved. This stuff turned out to be so good that I immediately made another batch. I will be proud to give some away as Christmas gifts, but not too much as I want most of it for myself. Thanks for sharing!"

Although my family has a 'wartime' variation on this that doesn't require any cooking, lot's of jars and cans...\nMezzetta Giardiniera is a mix of carrots, celery, cauliflower already pickled and jarred. Marinated artichoke hearts, marinated mushrooms (drained,) pickled pearl onions, pimento stuffed green olives, pepperoncinni, black olives, tomato sauce, and tuna.\nDrain all the jars and cans, mix it up and chill in the fridge. If you don't like vinegar you'll hate this..lol."

With some minor changes (I steamed the cauliflower and the carrots instead, used stuffed green olives and added some capers)the ingredients are pretty much the same. This is a GREAT dish, perfect to keep in the fridge and just eat with some crackers during a hot summer day."
