The only ingredient I changed slightly was the ham, choosing smoked ham in place of boiled ham, because I thought it would be drier and eliminate having a soggy crust. I also layered the cheese next to the crust, both top and bottom, again to keep any excess moisture from the crust. So my order of layering was cheese, ham, salami, pepperoni, peppers, egg mixture, cheese and to crust. This was so good and easy to serve. Will make again."

I added tomato pesto to the bottom layer before the meat &amp; cheese and sprinkled garlic powder on the top layer! I baked at 375 instead of 350 - tin foil on for 30mins and then baked without tin foil for 20mins . This was not wet or mushy on the bottom at all. \nMy husband said it was fantastic, but to serve with some sort of mustard next time. A crowd pleaser!"

Although I dislike criticizing a recipe that has been altered from the original, I do so for the purpose of warning others to NOT DO WHAT I DID. I made a double batch (two casseroles) of this to take to my women’s meeting last night. I followed the recipes with these suggestions: \n\nI pre-heated my oven to 375 degrees;\nI left out the salt (an improvement); \nI added a very thin layer of sun dried tomato pesto to the bottom crust (a big improvement);\nI pre-baked the bottom crust after adding the sun dried tomato pesto (6 minutes) (an improvement); \nI added 2 teaspoon of minced roasted garlic to each batch (an improvement); \nI use d Black Forest Ham (it’s much drier than boiled ham and has a better flavor - also an improvement);\nI added VERY WELL DRIED red pepper strips (I think this is what my ladies found objectionable). \n-------------\nI think the next time I make this (and I will), I will remove the casserole(s) from the oven 10 minutes early and spoon a thin layer of sun dried tomato pesto to the top crust and return it to the oven to finish baking. When it comes out of the oven, I’ll give it a light sprinkling of Mozzarella Cheese and a few (patted dry) black olive slices and maybe a 1/4 cup of chopped red pepper (raw and patted dry). I think this would dress it up a bit before cutting into squares.\n\nMaking this recipe is a little pricey, but it smel"

"reviewBody": "This is the first time that I've commented on a recipe after years and years of using allrecipes.com. I made this for a Christmas Brunch this past weekend. Other than bringing the oven temp up to 375* and using honey ham (both in an effort to prevent moisture), I made no changes to the recipe. It was an ENORMOUS hit. I had guests who said they don't like antipasto or don't like peppers going back for seconds or thirds. Whether it is fresh out of the oven and eaten with a fork and knife, or out at room temperature and eaten with your hands, this recipe is delicious. The next time I make this, I'm making 2-3x as much. I highly recommend making these for your next party!"

I spread the bottom layer of crescent rolls, top with sundried tomato pesto and the red peppers, then prebake for 10 minutes. I microwaved the pepperoni on paper towels to soak up some grease. Finally, I put an extra layer of crescent rolls in the middle, which helped absorb some grease. These were a huge hit at the party!"

Most, if not all, of our group of 9 dislike red peppers so I left those out, as well as the swiss cheese which I subbed in mozzarella. I also sprinkled some Italian herb seasoning on this before putting the top layer of crescent roll on. This is easy to make and delicious! I took along some marinara sauce and that put these over the top. We ate them while they were room temperature, but hubby &amp; I sampled while warm. Both ways are great! These make a perfect take-along food for picnics, etc. Not one square was brought home, even the two-year-old ate one and smacked his lips - yummy! My bottom layer was not one bit soggy and I did not pre-bake it. The baking times and temperature were spot-on for me as well. This will be made often."

I comoe from an Italian family and would definitely serve this to them without feeling guilty that I did not make the dough from scratch! this is DELICIOUS. The entire pan of these squares were devoured and gone. I had served them to a party of 15 people and everyone loved it!!!! This appetizer will be a staple in my dinner gaterhings and parties! The one thing I recommend is definitley doing what another reviewer recommended and that is, spread the first layer of crescent dough and add a layer of the tomatoe pesto and cook it for 6 minutes and then add all the other ingredients. The tomatoe pesto adds such a nice flavor with all the other ingedients!!! THIS IS AWESOME!"

"reviewBody": "These were so good! I made some updates based on the reviews and what I had, but I bet the original is amazing too! 1. Like most people suggest, I partially baked the bottom. 2. I topped the bottom crust with 6 slices of cheese - 3 Swiss and 3 Muenster. I had this multipack cheese thing. I'm a huge fan of Swiss, but I actually think the Muenster pieces were tastier. 3. Put a layer of sun dried tomato pesto over the cheese. Next time I will add a second layer of sun dried tomato pesto between one of the meat/cheese layers. 4. Sliced up the salami and pepperoni a little (didn't both slicing the ham) so I could cut it into squares easier. 5. After crust/cheese/pesto I layered salami, then ham, then some shredded pizza cheese (I didn't buy enough cheese and that's what was in the fridge), then pepperoni, 3 slices of provolone (I will use 6 next time), diced (blotted with paper towels) red peppers and then egg/black pepper/Parmesan mixture, to which I added a little garlic powder. (I totally forgot to buy Parm and my mom had some of the wretched green can stuff in the fridge that I used.). I only poured egg mixture (3) inside and did not use any as an egg wash. It was freaking delicious. I served it as lunch and we had to stop ourselves from eating until we were uncomfortable. I was worried about greasiness/saltiness, but it was neither. I purchased really good quality deli meats which I think helped a lot."

"reviewBody": "Made these yesterday for a bridal shower I was throwing and they were the hit of all the food! OK - I followed the recipe with the changes that were suggested in many of the posts. So what I did:\n\n1. I precooked the bottom layer of crescent rolls about 7-8 minutes at 375. I brushed them with a thin layer of basil pesto before baking. \n2. I drained and dried the roasted peppers and the honey roasted ham between layers of paper towels for a good 20 minutes, changing out the paper towels a couple of times. (next time I wlll do this in advance -Even a day a head of time if I am busy and stick them in a tupperware until use)\n3. Next - I first layered provolone so that there was a layer of cheese between and of the foods that could potentially make it soggy. So provolone, roasted peppers, salami, honey roasted ham, muenster (didn't have swiss), garlic salt, pepperoni, egg mixture. I just used about 4 eggs per pan. Then final layer of crecsent rolls. \n\nI didn't have enough eggs to do a final egg wash on top and it was totally fine. I baked at 375 for 20 minutes with foil, then 20-25 mins without. (just watch them at the end). I let them settle and cool - do not cover with foil while cooling!\n\nCut them into squares. Served! Huge hit! Today a day later they are still so good warmed up and eaten for snacks! I will make them often. It is a little pricey as far as ingredients so truth is I will only make them for my own parties :) Or only very special potlucks. LOL."

They can be served hot or room temp and they are fabulous either way (my mom even mentioned that she ate one cold and it was still delicious). It is a must to drain and pat dry the peppers, and I diced them (then patted dry again) to make it easier to spread evenly. All I did differently was pre-bake the bottom layer, use one extra egg, and a TINY bit of egg wash (one egg, skim milk) on top. I am making them again for my New Year's Eve party, and I may add a little sun-dried tomato pesto to the bottom layer of crescent rolls when I pre-bake it. \n\nBottom line- YUM!!!"

"reviewBody": "I have been making these for years and years - originally was given the recipe by my next-door neighbor - and frankly am baffled by the negative reviews. I make these all the time (usually by request!) and I have never heard anything but raves. Rarely are there any left. A couple of tips: I always line the pan with foil or parchment paper so the bars can be lifted out of the pan to be cut. I've never had a problem with soggy bottom crust as some others have seemed to. For a single recipe, I always need more than two packages of crescent rolls - I can never get two to stretch enough. The MOST important tip is that you MUST let the bars rest for about an hour before you cut them - otherwise they will fall apart. So plan ahead! I don't reserve some of the egg/parmesan mixture for the top - just spread it all over the roasted peppers. And I most often double this recipe and bake it in a quarter sheet pan (12\" x 18\"). Finally, you should also be aware that this is not a budget appetizer - but the praise is well worth the cost!!"
