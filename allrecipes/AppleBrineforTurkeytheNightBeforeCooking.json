Put in the garlic and the bird and then put in enough cold water to cover the bird. Filled the rest with ice and sealed it shut. The ZipLoc bags were strong enough for the transfer and even had a handle. The bird came out of the oven very moist. I will definitely use this brine again."

The brine made the turkey taste good, LOL. The brown paper bag method worked beautifully. Only change I made was add fresh basil, sage and rosemary to the brine. I used a Reynolds large oven roasting bag inside of a black trash bag just in case the Reynolds bag did not hold the brine. I did not have any problem with the bag breaking. Just did not want my cooler to smell like brine in case my bag leaked. \nWonderful brine! Thanks"

"reviewBody": "For all of the complaints about your turkey being too salty even after the brining process and being rinsed off: You need to let the turkey rest in the fridge overnight to get the rest of the brining mixture out of your turkey!!! About 2 cups or more of the brine will end up in the bowl. Then rinse the turkey again and pat dry! Most recipes miss this key step. Also don't use salted butter or chicken broth on your turkey or it will end up being salty."

This year we tried your apple juice brine recipe and it was fantastic! So moist and tender. My family loved it! {We also added the contents from a can of Mountain Dew to the turkey cavity---don't know if that did anything \"extra\" or not but we will do it again next year the same way because his year's turkey was perfect. Other reviewers stated that the apple juice brine does not give the turkey any apple-ly taste and that is true---but the turkey tasted FANTASTIC! Thanks for the great recipe---I definitely could not have done this without you!"

"reviewBody": "We eat turkey frequently since it is inexpensive for our large family, so I wanted something a little different for the holidays. This did make a difference, not so much in the flavor, which was good, but the turkey was much more moist and it seemed to have a more intense taste. The leftovers were great in turkey and dumplings! One warning though, it makes a BIG diffrence in cooking time! My turkey was done a full hour before normal! I will use this recipe again and again. Just the cut in cooking time made it worth it to me!"

"reviewBody": "Use a Ziploc XL bag!! It fit my 23 lb turkey this Thanksgiving. I also placed the bag in the cooler first, dissolved the salt, then added all ingredients to the bag inside the cooler. I put the turkey in last along with the ice. I sealed the bag and it worked well. However, for the amount of work I put into this brining thing (which was new to me), my turkey was no different than what I would normally make. My guests thought the same. I usually roast my turkey in my Nesco roaster oven. I put melted butter on top, and season with just salt and pepper. I roast it breast side down and wait until it \"caves in\". Then I know that it is falling apart and done well. This is not good though if you want the picture perfect turkey to put on the table and carve. I do my \"carving\" ahead of time and put the platter of meat on the table."

"reviewBody": "This was a great first experience with brining, thank you. I did have a few \"challenges\" that newbies might learn from. First, we tried using an oven bag, but we noticed it was getting smaller. Yup...a leak. It was too thin for a large turkey (22 pounds), so we started over in a heavy-duty garbage bag (unscented) and took the risk on the \"not food grade\" suggestion. \n\nWe tied the corners in knots first, which I suggest. It kept us from wasting space with the brine. I also think it should be noted that the ice does not go in the bag with the turkey. It goes in the cooler on the outside of the bag, right? The directions aren't clear about that, but it just made more sense to us. \n\nOne rater noted that it cooks faster. That would explain it. I know mine was ready WAY ahead of time, but I thought it was because I was using a new electric roaster oven for the first time. I think this time I'll roast it at a lower temperature...maybe 300 then kick it up for the last 30 minutes to make sure we're getting hot enough.\n\nThanks for a great brine recipe."

I used this recipe with the addition of a little over a cup of brown sugar, and two bottles of beer, and left the garlic out.. oh, and a tablespoon each of dried sage, thyme and rosemary. So this is less about this exact recipe and more about the whole bringing thing.. IT WAS THE BEST TURKEY I HAVE EVER MADE!! MOIST, TASTY MEAT, YUMMY GRAVY WITH THE DRIPPINGS. I used a big enamel pot I have for canning to brine in. It was delicious!"

"reviewBody": "I have no idea how this will make my turkey taste, but for those of you about to do this for your Thanksgiving, please learn from our mistakes! We used a Reynold's oven bag big enough for a turkey and learned a lot from our first experience.\n\n1. Heat up the measured water, pour in the salt to dilute it then fridge the water to cool it off.\n\n2. Place the bag in the cooler, add the ingredients, then the turkey. THE BAGS ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND A TRANSFER, TRUST ME! (We just got done cleaning up apple juice, garlic brine from our floor and surrounding cabinets!\n\n3. And do NOT follow the advice of the person who suggested a garbage bag. As someone else pointed out, it's not food grade.\n\nGood luck and happy Thanksgiving!"

I do not use the garlic, I DO use a garbage bag, and I just put it in a container in the fridge long enough to hold it overnight. It somehow causes the turkey to cook an hour or so less, as well. The gravy is the best!"

(Perhaps using a few more quarts of apple juice (no water), and slicing some tart apples and adding them in would help if that is what you are aiming for.) ;)Hope you all enjoy, remember to gobble 'til you wobble."

After all, my hubby did say it was the best turkey he's ever had! The turkey turned out moist and delicious. Rinse the turkey before you roast it and careful with the seasonings, it doesn't need much more salt! Thanks for the great recipe Godiva!"
