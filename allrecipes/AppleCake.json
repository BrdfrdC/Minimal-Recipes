"reviewBody": "Great, moist cake! Had a ton of apples that needed using and this took care of all but one of them. Made some changes according the previous comments. Subbed oil for 1/2C of melted butter, when batter was too dry I added buttermilk until it was more of a thick cake batter texture. Also halved the sugar as the apples were very sweet and that was definitely a good call, tasted great and would have been too sweet I think otherwise. I also added some spices in addition to the cinnamon. I added a tsp of ginger, tsp of cardamom, and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. It was so easy to throw together and was so good. Next time I might try a streusel topping or something like that for a bit of crunch"

If you use a 9 inch round cake pan instead of the pan they suggest be prepared to bake it almost another 45 minutes for the knife to come out clean.

"reviewBody": "I switched the full cup of oil for 1/2 C unsalted butter and 1/2 C oil. Also exchanged 2 C white sugar to 1 C dark brown, and 1 C white. I'd already spiced up the cut-up apples with cinnamon, nutmeg, 1/8 C sugar and tossed with cornstarch to help coating the fruit a bit more. I used a 9\" round cake pan lined with parchment paper. Total bake time was a bit longer, with an unreliable oven, so it took 1 Hr/08 minutes. I did let it cool overnight before I gave in. I wound up with a rich, not overly sweet cake with a moist crumb and fabulous flavor. I will make this my \"go-to\" for apple cake from this point forward. Thanks for the great recipe."

I substituted all of the oil for low fat vanilla yogurt (1 cup yogurt) and I cut the sugar in half. I also substitued 1/4 cup of flour with wheat germ. It still tastes good and the kids loved it."

"reviewBody": "loved this as a dessert. however i was worried throughout the baking process. didn't know to what extend foamy mean so just beat the oil and eggs until a lot of bubbles were present. i added all the dry ingredients at once which i think i should not have done because the mixture was dry and i didn't think it was going to blend it. i persisted but the mixture was not a batter. it was very stiff unlike any other cake mixture I'd made before. The suggested baking time was not nearly enough. The cake was a nice colour but was still wobbly in the middle. A further 30 minutes later I decided to remove it from the oven. Despite all my concerns it turned out to be really moist. Next time I will add walnuts or sultanas but I'm not too sure what I could do about the suggested time being doubled what is suggested in the recipe. Any suggestions?"

What a waste, especially since I buy the good organic ones. So I wanted a simple, easy recipe using basic pantry items to turn those slightly shriveled up apples into something fabulous. This was great and the result was yummy. I will definitely do this again. I used olive oil, which was fine. Next time I might use less sugar. Thanks for this recipe! So proud of myself!"

"reviewBody": "I never made apple cake before, so I researched many recipes before deciding on this one. First time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly. It was way too sweet for our taste and a little on the oily side. But I think that is a personal preference. Next time, I used one cup of sugar and half a cup of brown sugar. And used only half a cup of oil. It was perfect. I had to bake a little longer because my oven tends to be on the cooler side for the set temperature. I think this cake is more of a muffin texture for me - not a complaint, just an observation, I loved it. I say that because my family likes to eat this for breakfast than dessert. It never stays long enough for me to see how it tastes after a day or two in the fridge. I think next time I will half the recipe and make it in a nine inch round pan. Thank you for an easy and great recipe."

Definitely do not skimp on the apples; they may look like a lot while you're pouring the batter in the pan, but it's absolutely the right amount when you bring it out of the oven! Partway through I realized I only had about half of what was needed of the flour left in my pantry, so I substituted 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour for the other half. (And it didn't detract from the flavor at all.) Other than that, this is a delicious cake that could star as both dessert and breakfast."

I also like to lightly top the cake with a raspberry sauce at about 5 minutes before the cake is finished. This gives it an extra kick of tart sweetness and keeps the top moist. As it is, I give it 4 stars. With the raspberry topping and oil modifications, my family gives it a 5!"

I think you could halve the oil and it would still be awesome. I'll try that next time, because this was delicious - even better the next day! I might add nuts, too, and as someone mentioned, a dusting of powdered sugar would look nice."
