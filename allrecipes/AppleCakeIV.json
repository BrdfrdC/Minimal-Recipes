If you have bad knees, think twice about standing while you are doing all the peeling, slicing, measuring, pouring, folding etc. A good thing I have a heavy duty Kitchen Aid mixer. The mixture is very, very sticky and it was hard for me to get it out of the mixing bowl and into the baking pan. This better be good! I used walnut oil instead of vegetable oil in place of adding the chopped walnuts. The flavor will be there, but without the nuts that some don't care for. I also substituted organic brown sugar for refined white sugar - that stuff is bad for you. OK, I used white sugar in the topping sprinkle! It is baking now. We will soon see: PERFECT! The cake is light and moist, the Fuji Apples, sweetness, and spice level delicious. Thank you."

I'll admit I was hesitant about the minute time for the eggs and sugar, but I did do it this way and I believe it contributed to the beautiful rise of the cake. I subbed 1/2c full fat sour cream and only 1/2c of oil. I used 1 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 light brown sugar. I chopped the apples (all Granny Smith) vs slicing them, and I used 2 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cardamom, 1/4 tsp ginger and 1/4 tsp cloves, just to add more depth of flavor. Wonderfull!"

I used three large apples (instead of 5 smaller ones) and 4 eggs but next time will cut the eggs down to 3. Next time I will also chop the apple much finer so it will cook more evenly. I used less than a cup of brown sugar and it was plenty sweet enough, so I can't imagine using 2 cups of sugar. I also substituted butter for the vegetable oil. Delicious!"

"reviewBody": "This is a great cake! I used Cortland apples (just because they were extras), but will use more tasty apples next time. It’s still really tasty and moist! I diced the apples in small pieces so they are in every bite. I made a few small changes. Used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1-1/2 cups white. I thought 4 tsp. of cinnamon sounded like so much, so I cut it to 3 tsp., but I really think it would be fine with 4, so I’ll do that next time. I cut the oil to 3/4 cup just to save a few calories and added 1/4 cup of light sour cream. I beat the eggs and sugar for 5 minutes, thinking 15 was a mistake. Lastly, I used a little over a 1/2 cup of pecans because I didn’t have walnuts. When it was baking, I couldn’t believe how much it raised in the pan! The sugar and cinnamon topping is a nice touch. The topping is hard when it comes out of the oven but softens later. I’ll be making this cake again and again!"

"reviewBody": "My family went apple picking today and I wanted to use some of the many, many apples we brought home, so I actually doubled the recipe and made 2 pans (one for us, one for my husband to take to work. Risky, right?). I coarsely chopped the apples (I used Macouns) into approximately 1/2\" chunks (some chunks were bigger than others, which I think was a good thing) rather than using slices, but other than that, I followed the recipe as written. (Wait, not completely true - I used grape seed oil because I was out of vegetable oil.) I personally hate when people rate and write reviews for recipes when they've made a bunch of changes to it, so I like to follow the actual recipe as closely as possible to see if it actually needs all the changes that the reviewers mention in their reviews that aren't actually for the recipe as written. The changes are not necessary, folks. My husband, 12 year old daughter, 3 year old son, and I all agree that the cake is delicious. This recipe is a keeper."

This recipe looked great BUT all that sugar..... We discussed it and decided to try subbing the sugar for Monk Fruit Sweetener - zero calories (from the sugar). We both tried it and declared it a success. It tastes great! Monk Fruit does not work for jams and jellies since it crystallizes with liquid but it seems fine in baked goods."

"reviewBody": "Delicious! I have 3 apple trees, all producing like crazy and I've been hunting for apple recipes. The apples I have are small, so I didn't use 5 apples as stated in the recipe but instead peeled and chunked 6 cups of apples. I didn't mix the eggs and sugar for 15 minutes because it seemed like overkill--3 minutes sufficed. Used 1 1/2 cups sugar because my apples are pretty sweet. Added about 4 cups of apples to the batter and sprinkled the remaining 2 cups on top of the cake, then cinnamon/sugar combo. This cake is very moist, with the perfect amount of sweetness, apple-ness, and cinnamon-ness to it. I will make it many times, I'm sure!"

We left out the nuts. We used 2 large Fuji apples and 4 small Granny Smith sour apples, dicing them into small pieces.. Baked it ten minutes longer than recommended and it was perfect!!!"
