"reviewBody": "Addendum to previous submission. I was unsure of which container would be food safe to use, so I put the turkey in a turkey size baking bag with cavity side up then placed in a large stock pot that would accommodate it and the brine past the bulk of the turkey. I poured brine into the bag around the turkey and sealed it as best I could releasing most of air and zip tying."

"reviewBody": "I've been brining turkeys for about 10 years now and this is the best brine I've tried. I added about 1/2 cup of brown sugar, a bit more salt and seasonings, and a couple of extra cups of cider for a 21 pound turkey. The bird went into the brine on Tuesday evening and came out about noon on Thursday. After rinsing, patting dry, and stuffing, it cooked in a bag for about 2.5 hours, then with the bag peeled back for another hour to brown up. While all the brines I've used improve the tenderness and moisture of the turkey, this one accomplished this to the max and added wonderful flavor as well. The gravy didn't have any weird flavors from the brine. The drippings were a bit salty to begin with, but once flour and stock were added, the gravy was perfect. This is now my go to brine!"
