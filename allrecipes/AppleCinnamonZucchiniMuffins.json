"reviewBody": "I just haven't eaten it yet. But it smells delicious. I just wanted to make a suggestion as to how to serve it. My first experience with zucchini bread was at a place in NJ called the Pub(at steak house). They served it on their salad bar, also on that salad bar was a huge bowl of applesauce that they had added diced maraschino cherries to. I put the applesauce on top of the zucchini bread and it was to die for. Now when I make applesauce I also add the cherries to it but when eating zucchini bread you can't do better then topping it with this mixture. It was better then the steak in my opinion. Just thought I'd share that with zucchini bread lovers."

I only really can taste the apple and maybe a tinge of cinnamon. I think more spices need to be added and maybe dice the apple for some texture or add nuts. I only made a half recipe and I'm glad I did; otherwise I would be eating these for quite awhile."

I used 3/4 cup pure cane sugar, 1/2 olive oil 1/2 apple sauce for the 2/3 cup oil, used 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flower, and added nutmeg, cloves, and walnuts. My boyfriend who isn’t into healthy stuff said he really liked them. A total keeper."

I stuck fairly close to the original recipe - used 1c wheat flour + 1.25c all purpose, used 1 Tbps cinnamon + 1 Tbsp pumpkin pie spice, used 3/4c white sugar + 1/2c brown sugar (didn’t reduce sugar due to the overall quantity here), and added about 1c chopped walnuts. My batch made 18 reg size muffins + 3 giant size muffins. Great flavor, definitely not too sweet, and awesome crispy tops. I will definitely make this again!"

I did add the extra cinnamon because we are cinnamon people!"

I find it can use some more zing, which is why I'm giving it a four star.\n\nI'm using it now as a base, but cutting back on the cinnamon for freshly ground nutmeg and adding diced apples along with the shredded to give it more apple flavour and texture. \n\nThis recipe makes a great loaf and I think I prefer that over the muffins. Pour the batter into a well-buttered loaf pan and bake at 350F for about 55 minutes. Moist and light and absolutely yummy!"

This is now my go to recipe for zucchini bread and will make a batch of chocolate ones with the leftover zucchini."

I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar. I made them in my stand mixer and they turned out moist, not too dense and not too sweet. I will add nutmeg and all spice next time. Also it made 17 muffins not 24. My kids hate zucchini and they gobbled them up this morning!"

"reviewBody": "These really deserve a three and a half. They're good for you, particularly if you make the changes I made - replace half the oil with applesauce and use light whole wheat flour. But I found them moist to the point of unpleasantly dense, and even with the addition of nutmeg and allspice, they were still a little bland. Still, the kids did eat them, and it's a breakfast I'm happy to give them, so that counts for plenty."

"reviewBody": "Pretty tasty, and kid-approved! I subbed cinnamon applesauce for half the oil and added a pinch each of allspice and nutmeg. Mine turned out moist, not dense, but I used about half a cup more shredded zucchini/apples than the recipe called for, so my batter was fairly watery. Filling the muffin cups about 3/4 full worked well. They're also popular as mini muffins (bake time about 14 minutes)."

"reviewBody": "My 3-year-old and I liked these. I cut the recipe in half (3/4 a large zucchini, 1 small apple, 2 eggs, 1/2 C sugar, etc), which only made 9 muffins (filled the papers most of the way.) They were not quite finished baking at 25 minutes. We both said they taste good, and they're soft and moist. They need to cool fully before eating so they won't stick to the muffin papers. I agree that adding chopped walnuts would make them better."

"reviewBody": "After going apple picking today, I made these with my fresh picked honeycrisps. I used whole wheat flour and substituted half the sugar for 1 1/2 tbsp. fresh honey (cut oil down to 1/2 c. because of the added liquid). I also added some ginger and nutmeg. After the first batch came out of the oven, I added more of the spices to the rest of the batter. This is a delicious, lightly sweet, packed little muffin. I'm definitely looking forward to this autumnal breakfast treat. As with other reviews, if I would have had them on hand, chopped pecans and raisins would have been great additions!"

I tripled the recipe so I can individually freeze them for the kids to have a quick and healthy breakfast. They turned out moist and fluffy. Not as dense as the other pics I saw (perhaps, because I almost doubled the zucchini and apples)? Absolutely perfect. I added raisins of course. ;) Thank you!"

I used 3/4 cup sugar, subbed 1/3 cup coconut oil + 1/3 cup oil, and I added a splash of almond extract and a dash of cardamom and allspice to round out the flavour. Delicious."

This is a tasty and healthy subsitution for cupcake at family gatherings, office treats, and after dinner desserts! Thanks so much for the recipe!! Two thumbs up! P.s. For those who enjoy sugary snacks, this is probably not for you. Its mildly sweet and like i stated, much healthier for you :)"
