The apples were cut early in the day, and I squeezed a lemon over them to prevent them from turning brown. And, I baked it about 50 minutes which helped keep the topping crunchy. Will definitely make again."

"reviewBody": "Cake turned out very well and is delicious. I used double sour cream because I didn't have vanilla yogurt. Minor changes I made: used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar for the cake batter, added 1 cup of chopped walnuts, buttered and floured the baking dish instead of using cooking spray and baked it for 45 minutes. Like the balance between cinnamon and apple flavor. If you like a very strong cinnamon flavor, you could add an additional teaspoon to the batter. Recipe could easily be doubled for a 9\"x 13\" pan. Make sure butter is very soft/room temperature for it to blend easily with the other ingredients. If you are looking for an apple cake with a substantial layer of plain cake topped with apples, this is not it. This cake is the type where the apples are diced and mixed with the cake batter. However, the amount of cake batter is minimal - just enough to hold everything together, resulting in a lot of apple in every bite. Could be served with a dollop of whip cream. Topping might be better by substituting the flour with oats. Might try it next time. Another possibility would be instead of or in addition to adding walnuts, try adding 1/2 cup of raisins that have been soaked in water or rum. So many possibilities. This receipe is a definite keeper."

I had no sour cream or yogurt so I used an equal amount of Mexican crema and about 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Also I doubled the crumble topping. The crumble topping was way too moist (almost like frosting) so I put in freezer for 5 minutes then added more sugar and flour. Still on the wet side. Regardless, cake came out perfect and literally better than any breakfast sweet I've ever eaten. I will make this again."

Next, I used three small Gala apples. As other reviewers suggested, I cut the brown sugar in the batter to 1/2 cup. The last thing was, as written, the topping was not crumbly at all, so I added 1/4 cup of finely chopped walnuts, and viola! Crumbly! Thanks for sharing! This will be breakfast, and if there’s any left, ala mode tonight for dessert!"

"reviewBody": "Excellent coffee cake!\nI stuck close to the recipe. I had no sour cream or regular vanilla yogurt on hand, so I replaced both with the plain greek whole milk yogurt I had, and doubled the vanilla extract. The batter was thicker due to the thick greek yogurt, but the result was wonderful. The cake itself was moist and mildly sweet with a melt-in-your-mouth texture and the crumb topping provided a sweet and crumbly contrast. My neighbor's comment when I shared a piece: \"We'll let you make that one again!\"\nMy 9\" pie pan was the right size for this recipe. When I try it again, I plan to use my 10\"x13\" pyrex baking pan and double the recipe."

Added a dash of salt to the topping (was not using salted butter). I think I would increase the topping by another half to make the top more crunchy, but I will definitively make it again! I like that it isn't too sweet. With additional apples, it was more apple than batter, and I liked that."

Made exactly as outlined, with granny smith apples (took 2 medium sized ones, peeled &amp; cut into small cubes)... used full fat Greek yogurt along with 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, a bit more cinnamon than called for, added pumpkin spice and a little cardamom, also doubled crumb topping because we love that part. LOVE everything about the simplicity and the deliciousness of this cake. Made our entire house smell heavenly, too. Thank you so much for sharing, Nancy! :)"

I used 1/2 cup (sort of medium packed) to start, added about another 1/8 cup, but it stayed thick and dark. Eventually I gave up and just proceeded with the recipe. The batter was quite thick, more of a spread than a \"pour\" into the pan. However the resulting cake had a great texture and was delicious!"

I baked it at 350 for 55 minutes, but had to add an extra 15 minutes of baking time. It was delicious and I will be making this again."
