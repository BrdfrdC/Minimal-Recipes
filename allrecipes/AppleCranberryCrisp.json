Because I love cranberries I doubled (at least!) the number of cranberries and so increased the sugar inside the crisp by about a tablespoon or so. I was out of nutmeg and didn’t miss it, but I’m guessing it would be great with it."

Then realizing I was out of pecans, I substituted sliced almonds. It was delicious warm with ice cream! It is hard to mess this recipe up. Great fruit combination!"

I followed everything else as written and believe a little less cinnamon would be more preferred by me. It was great with vanilla ice-cream and a wonderful tart treat!

Since it was summer when I made this, I was unable to find cranberries fresh or frozen. So, instead I made it as an entirely apple crisp. It was fabulous. Would be good served warm with a scoop of ice cream! Going to roll this out for company on Thanksgiving and add the cranberries. Don't read any further...you are guaranteed to love it!"

Instead I ground gluten free oats to make oat flour. Next time I will use only 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. I also leave the apple peels on....we like it that way and it saves time on making it too. It was delicious!"

Omitted pecans, made about 1 1/2 times the topping which was plenty. Used 4 apples(2 lbs) and 1 1/2 C cranberries. Also seasoned w/1 t mace, 1 t cinnamon, &amp; 2 t fresh allspice = amazing! I think next time I'll be using 3 apples &amp; 2 C cranberries. My host topped it with fresh whipped cream and it was perfect."
