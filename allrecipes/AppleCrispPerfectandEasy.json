Only I used 1 cup of flour and 1 cup Oatmeal. Also didn’t want to double the sugar….glad I didn’t …used 1 1/4 cup in mixture Then didn’t really want 2 sticks of butter, so used the one (cut up cold in tiny squares and worked quickly through the dough) and about (didn’t measure) 1/2 cups of sliced almonds cut up more with my pastry blender and sprinkled on top. Then topped the mixture with extra cinnamon and sugar (like I do my pie crusts). EXCELLENT. My husband who prefers my pie to ANY crisp….almost won him over. This was so crunchy….even next day. I did bake it about an hour! THANK YOU for sharing. LOVE Love this recipe!"

I doubled the recipe using a 9x13 pan and used canned apple pie filling on one side and a 15 oz can of sliced, drained peaches on the other since my husband only likes apple and I wanted peach (quarantine cuisine). Maybe it was because I used pie filling which is already sweet, and canned peaches that were already in juice, but even taking that into consideration, the topping by itself was very, very sweet. If I make it again, I will cut back on the sugar, maybe to 2/3 cup."

"reviewBody": "Great staple recipe with no hassle ingredients that most people have on hand. I always read the reviews before making a recipe to see if there is a standing theme that works for most people. Here's what I found. \n\nI used an 8 X 8 glass pan, lightly greased, 6 medium apples, peeled, sliced and layered (I found this amount to be perfect and mine came almost 1/2 way in the pan). I made the topping with all the measurements EXACT with ONE change - I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar and tossed in a cap full of vanilla extract. It makes the topping look so pretty when cooked, a nice golden color.\n\nThe baking time is exact, along with the temp for my stove. This is a sweet dish, it's a dessert. Make it once as is, if it's too sweet for you, lower the sugar amount. We found it perfect and every one I've made a dish and sent one too has raved it's perfect as is."

I also used a blender on low (stopping and punching in several times) to incorporate until crumbly. My oven cooks hot so 350 for 40 mins was perfect. I loved the simple number of ingredients. I used pink lady organic apples."

But I had some picky eaters so I tried this version and had to leave out the cinnamon too. I was shocked how much better apple crisp is without those 3 delicious ingredients. It gave it a clean, fresh quality and it was definitely better, but isn’t that a counterintuitive outcome!? I wouldn’t have believe taking out my favorite ingredients would make something better but it really did.\n I used honey crisp apples, btw."

I'll definitely make it again and probably try it with peaches also."
