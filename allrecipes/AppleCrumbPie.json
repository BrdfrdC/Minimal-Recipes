I liked that the apples were sliced thinly so that they were cooked thru and softened, rather than just cutting the apple into 8ths. I did add an extra tablespoon of flour to make the sauce thicker. That was a good idea."

I made this exactly as written except I used Vegan butter instead of real butter. Since I am not an experienced pie maker I took other reviews advice and used 6 medium Cosmic Crisp apples and I ended up- with way too much filling. I only had one crust so I just made a crumble in a 2nd pie dish. Even so, there was enough crumble for both pies. Thanks so much for the recipe!"

I was leary of raisins and walnuts but wanted to see so I just scattered some of each. Well, we absolutely loved it. S much so, we have declared it to be the best apple pie that we have ever tasted! My husband says it is apple pie crack; it is that good to him!\nIngredient choices are everything so I would like to note that 1) I used a raisin medley that I got from bulk food section of Winco, and 2) I always toast my nuts for baking after learning about the improved flavor from America's Test Kitchen.\n*Using Honey Crisp apples gave me a pie that was not runny. I don't know if that is what can make a difference or not for those who used Granny Smith apples."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is amazing!!!! I made 2 pies and both were finished within 24 hours. Only one person said it was too sweet. It is very sweet, but it's as sweet as apple pie should be. However, I will use less sugar next time because I'm sure it will still be great even if I used a little less in the filling. Changes I made included doubling the flour in the filling to prevent it being too watery as other reviewers mentioned, and I added an extra tablespoon of butter to the crumble as well as adding 50% more of all ingredients to have enough of the topping. I also cooked it covered for 40 min and uncovered for 30 min, then allowed it to cook for 1-2 hours before cutting. It was perfect! Next time I will place aluminum foil under the dish to catch any spillage for easy clean up (some filling did spill out while cooking uncovered)."

I’ve been making my own pie crusts and wanted to branch out from quiche - this was a great option in light of my crust being questionable for topping for a traditional apple pie. I blind baked my crust for about 10 minutes at 350° while I was prepping the filling. I also added a dash of clove to the filling and it really enhanced that lovely fall flavor. This is a great dish, and aside from the clove I didn’t change it. Enjoy!"

"reviewBody": "This is our go to apple pie recipe. Delicious but too sweet for our taste. Reduce sugar in both apple and crumb topping and it should do the trick. I followed recipe with one small addition... 1/4t. Corn starch to the flour sugar cinnamon nutmeg mixture the apples are tossed in. Was afraid of too much liquid based on previous reviews. It made for a lovely caramel-like coating around well cooked apples. Used mandolin for uniformly sliced apples, thin worked great as we like a well cooked apple in our pies. Will make again, just less sugar."

I use Pink Lady apples, the tart blends well with the super sweet topping. I too double the crumb topping, because it makes the pie better than great &amp; serve it with vanilla bean ice cream. I omit the raisins/walnuts per request after the first year of baking it. Its simple, its easy, its inexpensive and am so glad and grateful I have this recipe!!"
