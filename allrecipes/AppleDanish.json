The only thing that surprised me with this is that I was expecting a different type of texture to the pastry, it's not what I was expecting with a \"danish\", it's more of a cinnamon bun type texture (which is still so delicious) just not what I was expecting. Either way, this will not disappoint."

"reviewBody": "Apple danishes have been my favorite forever. As a kid in the 90s, before dance class, my parents would treat me to McDonald's apple danish (which they no longer sell). If I see them at a bakery, I have to try it. So I had some honeycrisp apples I needed to use up, and Allrecipes is my go to. This recipe is fairly easy. I try to follow recipes as written when trying for the first time, unless the reviews consistently suggest a change (ie. not enough liquid or too much salt/sugar, etc). I would say that I followed this mostly exactly, except I think I used 4c of apples. Another reviewer is correct: this is a time-consuming pastry, but I was making chili and cornbread at the same time, so I had things to pass the time. Depending on your schedule and what you want to make it for, I'd suggest making it in the evening for the next day. I used my KitchenAid to knead the dough and I kept to the 10 min. The filling is delicious, but very basic, so I think you could really make it to your personal tastes. I don't think 20 minutes is enough time to bake, so start with 20 and then maybe add 10. Presentation is everything, so if you decide to do the braiding, definitely take your time. I will be making this again and perhaps with other fruit or cheese!"

For a cook who is terrified of yeast, this dough was easy to make, rose properly, and the finished bread had a nice texture and a good sweet flavor. The golden brown color of the finished braid was beautiful — I added an egg wash prior to baking to give the finished product a little shine. The filling was tasty and developed a nice caramel sauce for the apples as it cooked. I didn’t have nutmeg, so I put in a pinch of allspice instead. After making this, I’m encouraged to try more bread and pastry baking!"

"reviewBody": "This Danish is delicious. I was looking for a simple recipe to use some Granny Smith apples. The dough was easy to work with. The only ingredient change I made was to sprinkle chopped pecans over the filling before braiding the dough. Rather than cooking the filling on the stove, I used the microwave. I find microwaving to be easier because scorching isn't likely. Melt the butter in a microwave safe bowl or large measuring cup. Add the apples, cover and cook for 5 minutes. Stir well, then add remaining ingredients. Stir well, cover and cook 4-5 minutes more. Stir well. The filling should have thickened. If not, microwave in 1 minute increments until thickened. Proceed as directed in the recipe."

"reviewBody": "This was really good. I basically followed the recipe with a few minor changes. I used some extra yeast (closer to 2 t.) because my yeast was old, and also because of the old yeast, I extended the rise times. I sprinkled raisins over the apple filling before sealing it up. The browned butter glaze was really good--the browning really did add to the flavor. Just make sure you watch the browning butter carefully so it doesn't burn. If I make this again, I will leave it in another five or 10 minutes longer--I think it's a bit undercooked at 20, and you don't need to add the foil on top. One other change I would make is to reduce the salt, probably to a 1/2 teaspoon. I like salty, but the dough was a little too salty."

They forgot the 15 min after you punch the dough and the 30-40 min after the dough is braided. Plus the time you wait for your oven to reach its temperature even if you do it in advance, we're talking here over 2 hours! Roll the dough bigger then 13x8. Maybe 13x13 as the filling will overflow and it won't stay as a nice braid. Or reduce the quantity of apples to 2 cups instead. Pros: the filling is fantastically good!"

"reviewBody": "So far, so good. I posted a pic of mine as it was in the final rising. Looks nice and puffy so far, I'm well pleased with this recipe. I'll post a final pic when it comes out of the oven and after I've had a piece. I cleaned up the little filling remaining the saucepan after I filled the dough - it was yummy. Can't wait for the final danish!\nOK - finished the danish - posted 2 more pics (cut and uncut danish). It was absolutely delicious! I had baked it in the evening and frosted it in the morning. The only thing I'll do differently next time is heat the danish slightly if I make it the night before - that way the whole thing will be nice and warm. This is a definite must-make!"

Creates a shiny, flavorful glaze without the heavy icing taste, which isn't a flaw of this recipe but personal taste. Beautiful presentation. Rave reviews. Will make this often!"

I mixed two tablespoons of milk with a teaspoon of vanilla flavor and a table spoon of warm honey, and brushed it on top for the golden brown coloring. I also added walnuts to the filling and a few on top for presentation. Definitely a keeper!!"

This is going to be my go to recipe for sweet bread. \nI do think that the baking temp/time is a little bit off and recommend baking a little bit longer at a lower temperature (depending on your oven)."

"reviewBody": "I thought this turned out excellently! I was a bit scared because I didn't see it rising much, but then I'm pretty new to breadmaking and I take it this type of pastry isn't intended to have the dramatic rising effect of most bread. The term \"doubled in size\" baffles me, however as every bread recipe uses this measure and it apparently means vastly different things to different breads. \n\nBut it was excellent. The filling was DELICIOUS! Definitely a keeper."

"reviewBody": "Very nice. I used regular yeast and desolved it in the warm water with a little sugar. A little grated lemon rind ads a nice flavor to the dough. If the apples are very sweet I would use less sugar for the filling. Mine turned out a bit too sweet. Also leave the apples a little on the crispy side. Next time I would add some chopped almonds. The glaze is fantastic and an absolute must. I hope I have some left over for tomorrow morning because my husband is sampling again and again."
