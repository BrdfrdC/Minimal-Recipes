Dough took me awhile to properly roll out because I’m very inexperienced and used very chilled dough. Didn’t help I made a double batch. In spite of my ineptitude they came out GREAT! If a doufus like me can have a success with this recipe then it’s a solid keeper."

Other than that, it was perfect. \nMy particular issue (if you can even call it that) is that it took much longer to cook down the butter, salt, sugar, apple combo into a chunky apple butter state. I did add the water as directed and added one tsp of lemon juice to glaze the pan. My husband loved it. Just plan more time to make it than the superior chef suggests (oh, I used pillsbury ready pie crust rolls so next time I'll pre make the dough and do it all.) Thanks, Chef John...Any chance you can suggest a way to make Grappa out of discarded grape rinds and pits?"

"reviewBody": "Delicious recipe and by far better than anything at a restaurant. I’ve made it twice now. I will say that I will personally use 3 apples instead of two so I can enjoy a thicker filling. I just like mine more fruity and less fruit syrup. There is so much room for experimentation in this recipe. The first time I made it as-is, and my husband raved about them. This second time I added some almond extract and nutmeg to the apple mix. Also delicious! I think I’ll try some pecans mixed in at some point or some apricots or maybe some raisins. It’s just too fun to not experiment with this recipe! I give the original recipe 5 stars because it’s great, but I also give it 5 stars because it’s simple enough of a recipe to modify for fun."

I used pre-made Pillsbury pie crusts and some slightly soft green apples that wouldn’t be eaten. Only change I made was to use lemon juice rather than water to deglaze, I just like the tartness it adds. I went a little firmer with my apples in the cook, and they were a big hit with the husband and kids, so will make again sometime! Thanks for the recipe and the video was super helpful for getting a nice tight seal on the pies, virtually no seepage!"

I like the Honeycrisp and Jonathan apples the best, but I've also liked the Pink Lady Apple version very much. Even McIntosh apples, which I always seem to have on hand for eating raw, make a fine pie. You just need to adjust for the amount of liquid the various apple types exude while cooking. Add a little tapioca to firm up the filling if necessary."

Most of the time I just throw together my own apple pie mixture and use it in the hand pies. The crust that ChefJohn uses for this is amazing. I love it so much and I'll never use anything else.. \nOne thing different I do is make eight smaller pies because that's a lot of pie for us to eat. They are still great. And I like it that we can still have apple pie for dessert every once in a while without making an entire pie and wondering what to do with the rest of it."

I used 3 Granny Smith apples as mine were not large. Still got 4 hand pies. I loved the ratio of tarty and sweet with this recipe. I kept to the recipe with the exception that I also added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and a few shakes of cardamom...I love that spice! I found I did not need to add any water as there was enough juice in the apples. I prefer to keep the apples chunky so did not cook them down too much. We all enjoyed these scrumptious little hand pies. In fact I may just double or triple this recipe for apple filling for my pies too! I will definitely try Chef John's butter crust recipe next time!"
