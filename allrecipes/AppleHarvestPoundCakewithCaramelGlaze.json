"reviewBody": "I made this cake after a neighbor brought it to my mom. My parents loved it SO much they got the recipe from her and shared it with me. Now I've made it twice and we all LOVE it! So easy and delicious! I went a little crazy and used 3 teaspoons of cinnamon, added three shakes of ground cloves and a pinch or two of nutmeg. This recipe has such great bones. No, it's NOT too much oil so don't let other reviewers fool you. I used Canola Oil and the amount was perfect. I'll bet they just forgot some of the flour. It happens... The batter is a thick batter so don't worry about that. The cake itself is not too dense and perfectly moist. The nuts end up tasting like candied nuts... Amazing!!! Also, I used pecans instead of walnuts. Just a taste preference... You should definitely make this cake!!! By the way, it is annoying to me too, when people entirely change a recipe and then rate it. I simply added more spices and swapped out the nuts. I did not mess with the amounts of flour, sugar, eggs or oil. Sometimes I think recipe makers cut down on the amount of spices because long ingredient lists can intimidate people. Definitely save this recipe and make it for tonight! You won't regret it!"

The batter does get SUPER thick before you put it in the pan, which I was concerned about but it didn't seem to matter. I baked it for 70 minutes @ 350 which was perfect. It was cooked but the middle was moist for sure while the outside was harder. I'd make this again with the applesauce substitutions just to see how it is."

The recipe said to \"grease the pan\", which I did, but should I also have used flour? 2) I waited until the cake came out of the over to make the glaze, so it was still pretty warm and ran more than I expected. Should I have made it while the cake was baking to give it more time to cool before drizzling over the warm cake?"

I would give it another try, but would not bake so long, and would grease AND flour the pan!"

I use Granny Smith Apples, and Pecans instead of Walnuts &amp; the Glaze is meant to be poured over a hot cake, just as it comes out of the oven. I cover the Bundt pan with foil after pouring over the Glaze, and leave it to sink deep into the cake- overnight. The cake always slides out easily. It's Always Delicious and a hit wherever you serve it!"

Also decreased the time to 70 minutes which was spot on, if not slightly overcooked. \n\nThe cake has a nice texture, maybe it could have used more apple, or maybe I chopped them too finely. \n\nAs per other recommendation I placed the cake plate under the rack so it caught the extra glaze so there is glaze on the bottom as well as the top."

But this was a pretty easy recipe to follow and I put the mixture into a two 8\" cake pans. Surprisingly, it came out perfectly:). I got so many compliments, that I'm looking for something else to try baking. The icing was my actual favorite. Now I know how to make it! thanks so much for sharing. As far as all the people complaining about the oil or using applesauce, good onya, but its not necessary. We don't eat tons of desserts at my house, so that's not an issue for my family. This is a treat. I wouldn't try a recipe with substitutes and then review it, lol. Either make it as written or submit your own recipe. When you change the recipe, you arent rating the recipe, your submitting yours. Just do that to start with."

Like many other reviewers, I too made some improvisational changes that just sounded right to me: 325 degrees for 70 mins was perfect; used 1/2 cup of walnuts; substituted 1 1/2 cups of veg. oil for 1 cup of walnut oil and 1/2 cup of fat free greek yogurt, used about 3 1/2 - 4 Honey Crisp apples, doubled the cinnamon, added vanilla to the glaze but only applied 3/4 of the amount to the cake and used 50% white sugar/50% light brown sugar. Then did a light dusting of confectioners sugar on top for contrast. Oh yeah...and add a little rum to that caramel glaze! (if you just want to add an added flavor dimension, add rum while cooking as it will cook out the alcohol. If you want the little extra “kick” from the rum, add rum (to taste) after cooking and just prior to drizzling over cake. :-)"

For the oil: used 1/2 cup of apple sauce and 1 cup of oil. Half white and half brown sugar. Used 1 tsp cinnamon. Baked at 325degF for 70 min. (It's been a while since I made this, but I believe that I took it out sooner.) I left out the walnuts since I some people don't want them. A reviewer suggested just topping the glaze with some, which is a good idea. Dani, thanks for the great recipe! UPDATE 11/28/19: At 325degF, this tested done a lot sooner, 55 min."

I did have a little trouble getting it out of the pan but I had only greased it; next time I will flour it too.\nI will be making for Christmas along with a gingerbread cake."

The tiered cake I prefer because I added the caramel topping in between the layers and therefore it was more moist and more flavorful. The bundt is a great coffee cake option because it is less sweet as the topping is light and most of the cake you will not be getting carmel with. I cooked the round cake for about 28 minutes. My husband took the tiered cake to a work function and it won out of almost 100 options. We didn't even know about the contest! It's a winner for sure! Enjoy!"
