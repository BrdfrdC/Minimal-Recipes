Top pie with the second crust and crimp the two crusts together with a fork to seal. Cut 4 slits into top crust for steam vents. Whisk egg yolk with water in a small bowl and brush the yolk mixture over top crust."

The next time I increased the apples and used the remaining mincemeat. It was really good. I think in the future I will make 2 pies out of the 1 jar (cut back on the recommended amount to about 1.5 cups- or 1/2 jar) and it should be perfect."

I used Robinson's mincemeat that I purchased from Worldmarket and shredded the apples rather than chopped. Looked and smelt like the typical christmas pies we had back at home."
