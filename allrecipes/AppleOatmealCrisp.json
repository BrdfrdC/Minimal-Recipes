So, I decided to put a different 'spin' on it and make it with raspberry pie filling today. Again, It was a hit. That along with a fresh cup of coffee!! Wonderful!! Thank you so much for this recipe I know this is a keeper for us and one that we will be reaching for time after time."

I didn’t use white sugar at all cause apples are already sweet naturally. And instead of sprinkling cinnamon, it’s better to mix it evenly with the apple first. Also, I put only 3/4 cup of flour and used 4 apples instead."

If I need to, I add a little extra butter to the mix so that it spreads more easily in the pan. I also chop closer to 4 cups of apples. I think that my apples were too chunky, and next time I will chop them finer. Sprinkling the cane sugar or Swerve or combination, right over the apples, and then putting the top layer on, is perfect."

I did like how easy it was to follow how ever the half cup of white sugar and the the 2tbs of cinnamon wasn't really explained and what it did say seemed way over board to mix it all in the apples so we shall see it's different then ltge one I'm used to but it was quick smooth and easy to follow.....Taste Test Will follow ....."

I probably could have used a quarter of the amount and it would probably still be OK (will try that next time because I try not to have too much sugar). I used 1.5 cups of oatmeal and half a cup of flour per one of the other suggestions and it was the right amount of crisp. For the apple mixture, I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon (3 total). I will definitely make again! Thank you for the recipe!"

I sprayed the pan with cooking spray and I'm glad I did because it stuck a little after it cooled. the flavor was excellent and my 14 year old grandson had two helpings and took home most of what was left. I used pink lady apples because I've found they hold up well when baked and have a wonderful sweet apple flavor. great, easy treat!"

I think less flour and combining the crumb and the apples might help, along with a little lemon and ginger. I used a combination of Granny Smith and a new sweet, juicy variety of apples."

Followed the recipe exactly as it was written with one minor exception: I did mix the cinnamon and sugar with the apples first in a separate bowl instead of just sprinkling in on the apples - extra bowl yes, but I feel like it helped evenly coat the apples. Turned out wonderful and it was all gone by the next day. It reheated nicely on day #2 straight from the fridge. I will definitely make this again."

My suggestion is that it's a fine recipe but you will need to add some apple juice to the mix. Maybe drizzle it on before baking. I will serve it with creme fraiche."

I find that using the full 1/2 c of white sugar makes it too sweet. As far as the dryness, the recipe as is, is too dry for my taste, to combat this, after washing the apples, I don't dry the apples and I also sprinkle 1-2 tabs of water on top of the apples after I put the first layer of crumple and the apples down. This makes for a gooey bottom that I love have fallen in love with."
