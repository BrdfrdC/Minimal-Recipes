I found a bag of the filling in my freezer from 12 months ago that needed using. \nI had one pre-made pie crust on hand, so I lined a med. sized casserole dish with the crust, dumped in the thawed filling, folded and brushed butter on the exposed crust, and sprinkled it with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar. Voila, my own version of an apple galette! Yummy!"

I used Golden Delicious apples, which is my \"go to\" apple for baking. I am planning on using the leftover liquid to make an apple crisp."

I changed the number of servings from 40 to 10, I just wanted enough for one pie to try out the recipe. At 10 servings it says 4 and a half cups of apples, I used 5 because I like more apple pieces. It also called for 2 and a half cups of water and I used half of that. Everything else I followed. Made the filling, let it sit and cool a bit while I made my crust, and then cooked the pie like I normally would. I didn't see anyone else using the filling right away so I wanted to try it and let you know how it went...in case anyone else wondered if it would work out without freezing it ??"

"reviewBody": "Nice and thick. I did 8 cups of Granny Smith apples and did just under 1/2 cup corn flower, I used allspice and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon because I didn't have enough cinnamon. 8 cups of apples is about right for one pie. I also used 2 cups of white sugar and just mixed all ingredients in which worked fine. You can’t really stuff this recipe up to be honest and you can easily make additions to suit your preferences."

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe as written. I did indeed have an excessive amount of liquid. That being said I was able to remove some via a colander and big bowl. Reserving the liquid for later I was able to make pies. The time saved alone in making pies gets me to give four stars the fifth came from the taste. I took the remaining liquid and reduced it until it was nice and thick. I added about four tablespoons of butter and made a nice apple pie caramel sauce. Made the Apple pie ala mode I had even better! Orchard apples are definitely juicier than store bought apples. So if you don’t have the time or patience to make a nice sauce then reduce cooking water to at least eight cups. Adjust corn starch to suit thickness of your sauce. Over all it’s a recipe I will use again and again."

I took the advice and ended up using 6 cups of water and a little more cinnamon than called for. It was delicious. I would probably divide the recipe into 3 containers instead of 5. I like deep dish apple pie. Thanks for sharing the recipe. I'd share a picture, but it's pretty much gone."

Follow the rest of the directions. Make your own pie crust or use store bought pie crust. I made 12 hand pies using a 3 inch biscuit cutter. Add about 2 - 3 tsp. of filling in the middle. Add a stem use water to wet dough to add stem. Use a small sharp paring knife to cut a pumpkin face on the top of one of the circles. Use your finger to wet the rim of the bottom circle. Add top and seal. Crimp edges with a fork. Brush the hand pie with an egg wash. Sprinkle orange sprinkles on top. Spray a foil lined pan with cooking spray. Bake for 14 min at 375 degrees or until done. To freeze pie filling: This was an excellent recipe. I did follow the suggestions of other people who reviewed this recipe. I used 1/2 of the water, increased the cinnamon and added nutmeg. The pie filling came out perfect. It was the first time freezing any type of fruit filling. Next Fall, I will get a bushel of apples and make some pie filling to have for the whole year."

I used 6 c water, and then gradually added more at times when it looked too thick, or was heating up too fast (all those apples to peel!). \n\nAlso, I originally only made four pies (7 large granny smith apples, 2 medium gala apples and 9 small 'premium' apples). It was enough to fill four 9\" foil-lined pie plates albeit to a low enough level that I worried they would end up sunken when baked (they didn't, they were flat but fine). \n\nHowever, I had so much left-over 'syrup' that I decided to make a fifth pie for us. 8-9 smallish granny smith apples filled up a 10' deep dish glass pie plate. All I had to do was add some water and re-heat the 'syrup', then make it the same as before.\n\nAlso: I used the Make Ahead Pie Crust by SUPERMOMOF4 for these pies and it worked well--see my review of it.\n\nMy only issues with this filling is two: one, it takes MUCH LONGER to bake frozen filling. I tried the 15 min @ 450, 35 min @ 350 time and NOPE--the filling would be barely lukewarm. I always ended up sticking it back in for another half hour. Upping the time at 450 resulted in an overly-browned crust, so by the time I was baking the last pies I went with 15 min @ 450, 50 min @ 350. \n\nIssue two: this filling simply doesn't compare in taste to Grandma Ople's (also on allrecipes). It's good, but a little bland; it doesn't explo"

Any other, i.e. Golden Delicious, Honeycrisp, etc., consider reducing sugar by at least a quarter. I reduced by half when using Honeycrisps.\n\nPerfect 'easy' recipe as-is for topping pancakes, french toast, waffles, ice cream, etc. REDUCE WATER by at least a third (I went half, had extra juicy apples) if using as a pie filling. Soppy, soggy mess otherwise.Terrific freezer recipe, especially for use as a topper. Thus, 5 stars for versatility and ease, 4 for flavor and consistency. I have put away 12 pints of this recipe for use at brunches, breakfast and desserts. Thank you for a great recipe."
