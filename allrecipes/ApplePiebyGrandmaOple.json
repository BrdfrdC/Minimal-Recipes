I simmered the sauce while I prepared the apples and it was so thick I couldn't pour it into the holes :) ....so I added a little water ( I did not add the full 1/4 cup from the start) so all good. I did have to add cinnamon and vanilla...because MY grandmother.... I don't care that I burned my mouth so bad that I have to suck on an ice cube because I didn't wait for it to cool...but I wanted to taste it! I'd do it again!!!! It is that good!

I didn't have time to fix it so I tried to break it up and distribute it as much as I could with the apples, hoping that the water released from the apples cooking wold soften the caramel. It did! The pie cooked perfectly. The apples were firm instead of mushy. Luckily, my child arrived just in time to make a little bit more of the sugar mixture, this time with water, which we spread across the top of the pie. Absolutely delicious."

"reviewBody": "I've been making this pie for 20 years-since I was a young married lady. The recipe was published in the \"All Recipes Tried and True Favorites\" cookbook and it has blessed my family for two decades. The only modification I make is minor-I sprinkle a tiny bit of cinnamon over the apples before I cover them with the latticework crust. Otherwise, I recommend baking as written. Do NOT mix the sauce with the filling. Pouring over the top as directed and baking at the initial high temp will result in a nice caramelized finish on the top crust and just the right amount of the sauce will drip down into the applies. I also suggest using a heavy glass pie dish and making sure you are working with a clean oven as I've found that thinner dishes and dirty ovens cause mischievous results (burning or dark spots in some areas, light in others). May Grandma Ople rest in peace and thank you Moshasmama for sharing her recipe and story with us."

Overall this recipe was simple and straightforward to follow, the pie turnrd out good, and I got to practice making a lattice pie top for the first time. What I liked most about the recipe was the butter sugar sauce being poured over the lattice. It was a nice technique that made for a nice sweet crunchy experience. However, I didn't love the flavor of this pie, it left something to be desired IMO. For example I should have def added some cinnamon."

"reviewBody": "WAY too sweet! I don't know how this has so many rave reviews, the omission of any spices and the large amount of sugar makes the flavor basically just sweet. I did use granny smith apples, so it wasn't the apples' fault. IF I were to make this recipe again (and that's a big if) I would cut out 1/4 - 1/2 of the sugar it calls for. Additionally, do not let the sugar/caramel mixture cool, have the pie filled and the lattice on before you make the sauce so you can pour while still warm to avoid the sauce solidifying, as mine did. I would advise adding some apple pie spice or something. Personally I don't like the way the caramel sauce looks on the lattice, just seems messy to me. I'll definitely keep searching for the perfect apple pie recipe."

"reviewBody": "I have made this pie twice. I have a sweet tooth in general and don't tend to reduce sugar in recipes. Both times I added cinnamon to the apples and vanilla to the butter/flour/sugar mixture (and maybe a little salt to the caramel, don't remember), but I made no other changes. The first time I made this, it was absolutely perfect. It tasted like a caramel apple, but as a pie. I was so, so excited to have found this recipe. It was awesome. The second time around, I was super excited to make it again, but this time I didn't use Granny Smith apples, but other apples that were less tart than Granny Smith (though still generally pie apples, not sweet apples. I think they were Braeburn). That time, the pie still tasted .. ok, but it was not the perfect flavor balance. Since the apples were less tart than Granny Smith ones, the whole pie came out significantly too sweet for my taste and the flavor was too flat. The apples were also a lot softer and made the filling a bit too runny. That was a real shame. So I would strongly recommend to either only use Granny Smith apples for this recipe(or other apples that are just as tart) or to reduce the sugar by 1/4 or 1/3 of the listed amount if using other, less tart apples (like Elstar, Braeburn etc), and then maybe sprinkle the (non-Granny Smith) apples with a tablespoon of flour or cornstarch to prevent a watery filling. In my opinion this recipe would not work well with sweeter apples like Gala or Golden Delicious unless you just like intensely sweet things."
