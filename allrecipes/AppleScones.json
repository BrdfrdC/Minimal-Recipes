"reviewBody": "The dough turned out incredibly dry, it looked like I hadn't added any wet ingredients to it. I thought it was because I cut the apple into chunks instead of shredding it and I used buttermilk instead of milk. I added an extra 1/4 cup of buttermilk and they got nice and sticky, and instead of kneading them I just scooped them onto the baking sheet. The dough itself wasn't very sweet or flavourful so I really dumped the cinnamon sugar on top and they turned out pretty nice after that."

"reviewBody": "A pretty simple recipe to follow, esp. as it was my first time tackling scones (pastries always scare me, I spent days researching scones before finally trying it myself)! I will say I made a couple changes based on what I learned, and what I read in other's reviews. I added about 2tbsp of cinnamon and pinch of nutmeg to the flour mixture. I also reduced the milk by a third, removed some of the juice from the shredded apple, and added in a handful of raisins. It helped make the mixture less wet, and as Kristiegreen mentioned, more scone-ish. Then I increased the butter by a tbsp. With these additions, the scones were deliciously flavorful! And so very soft and flaky."

I used brown sugar instead of white and forgot to shred the apples, finely chopping instead. As one viewer suggested, I added 1 tsp cinnamon to batter instead of topping. I sometimes lightly glaze scones with powdered sugar and lemon juice when scones come out of oven and will try that in future instead of the milk, sugar, cinnamon. I recommend cutting each round into 6 separated pieces before baking. Yes, I made changes, but I know this would be a great recipe as written. My family loved them."

I chopped 1 pink lady apple and grated a golden delicious apple first, then added 1/2 teaspoon apple pie spice then let that stand while I mixed the dry, added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. added the apple and milk patted it out and kneaded it 5-6 times. turned out really good for our taste. \n One reader said she could taste the baking powder . I use aluminum- free baking powder. no baking powder taste. this item can be found in most stores in the baking isle right beside the regular baking powder. this also works well in biscuits. Will try these again and use more spices. they were easy to make and disappeared very quickly."

"reviewBody": "I made this as an Easter lunch for my roommates and myself. It was a hit! My only complaint was that it was hard to taste the apple, next time I will use a stronger tasting or a bigger apple. I threw some cinnamon straight into the dough, as well. It took a while to bake through, but that's because I realized I'd forgotten to slice my circles into the 6 wedges, I imagine it bakes better then you don't forget important steps. I think all things said and done, I've found my new Easter tradition! Goes great with butter and jam, or any spread you prefer."

I read a number of the reviews which stated the same thing so I diced the apple, instead of shredding it, to get more direct apple taste but it made no difference. BTW, I didn't bother with the baking soda - it isn't needed. I did use a bit more baking powder. I'll have to continue my search for a really good apple scone."

(And I don't usually like raisins in my baking but my husband loves raisin apple combinations). I used cream instead of milk. Skipped the butter / cinnamon on top just cut cold frozen butter and added to mix with cinnamon. We will be making these again. Needed 5 extra minutes to bake than directions perhaps since I added extra grated apple. Very moist recipe and not overly sweet."

Since I couldn't make the scones dairy I substituted margarine for the butter and rice milk for the milk. I also added chocolate chips to the scones since many reviews stated that they needed a little more zing. Instead of making the dough into circles and filling them with the sugar and cinnamon I rolled the dough into three inch circles and sprinkled the sugar mixture on top. I will probably make this again!"

So I cut it in as I simultaneously mixed in the liquids, just moistening the dry. No problems came of my err. A nice, simple recipe, and my kitchen smells so wonderful!"
