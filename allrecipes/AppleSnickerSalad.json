"reviewBody": "You can't go wrong with these ingredients! Made this for the Super Bowl party and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. Whoever decided to call this a salad is a dessert lover so I will file this under \"Desserts\"! As for the recipe I decided to lower the milk to 1/2 cup because I was concerned if there was a lot left over it would get runny from the apples softening. I used a small box of vanilla instant pudding stirring only with a rubber scraper to blend in the milk and then gently folding in the 8 oz of thawed whipped topping. I used six snickers bars, the normal size. You can buy these in one package. If using a long chopping knife you can slice/chop all six bars at once at room temperature. I added the chopped snickers to the filling and let it chill for an hour before adding the chopped apples, using only 5 granny smith apples. Depending on the size of each apple you'll have to judge for yourself how many to add. I chilled the mixture another hour before serving and you could definitely chill longer."

"reviewBody": "I've made this a couple times, it's really good. I'm not a big fan of butterscotch pudding and I rarely buy it, so I used vanilla, as a few others did. I also only buy the six-serving size pudding mix, so I used that and added an extra half cup of milk. For the whipped topping, it comes in 8 oz containers so I just put in the whole thing. I also buy the fun size or miniature Snickers, freeze them, then hit them with a hammer while they are still in their wrappers. Then I just dump them right into the pudding mixture--no need to cut them up and make a huge mess on the counter. I put in the whole package (it says nine servings are in the bag). I cut up 4 apples. I feel guilty throwing the vitamins that are in those yummy apple peelings down the disposal, so I don't peel my apples, just wash them and then chop them up. They taste great and my family loves them. Plus, then you don't need to feel guilty about putting candy bars in your salad!"

I always double the recipe. to cut the apples faster I use an apple slicer then I put them in a dicer that I purchased at Walmart. It is white oblong, it comes with 2 trays. It always takes between 15-20 minutes to make to entire recipe. I always make the night before so it will be really cold. While my daughter is taking the wrappers off the minature snickers I cut them in half. We cut the apples last, as I am slicing them she puts them in the dicer, this is a lot of fun for the kids :)"

"reviewBody": "This was tasty! I used SF pudding mix and FF whipped topping, and you couldn't tell the difference. We actually didn't care for the Snickers bars in this, as the texture was too chewy, but that's our personal opinion. We really enjoyed the apples mixed into the pudding mixture and it tasted like caramel apples, so that was fun. All in all we enjoyed this, and I would make it again, but I would find a replacement for the Snickers. Thanks for sharing. :)"
