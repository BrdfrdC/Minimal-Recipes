Because I was adding a can of apple pie filling to the mix, I did not add as the box stated. Instead I reduced the water to 1/2 cup, reduced the eggs to only 2 and I kept the vegetable oil at 1/3 of a cup. I also added the allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon (even though it was a spice box mix). It turned out moist and delicious. I had to cook it about 10 minutes longer and I thought it was \"heavy\" but it was done and tasted delicious."

"reviewBody": "This cake is our new favorite fall cake! I modified the recipe a little bit though... I couldn't find my \"regular\" measuring spoons; the ones that I had were table spoons only...! I didn't have allspice so I added, instead, 1/2tbs ground cloves and 1/2tbs of fresh grated ginger. As for the cinnamon, I grated it from a stick instead of the powder (that i don't like anyway). To be on the safe side, I also added 1/2tbs of baking powder. \nHere's how I modified it so it would be a touch fluffier:\n1cup all purpose flour and 1 cup of cake flour. A little less than 1/2tbs fresh grated nutmeg (way better flavor than the already ground one) and I was out of white sugar so I only had 1/2cup of white sugar and 1 1/2cup of brown sugar. I separated the egg whites from the yolks, and added 1/2tsp cream of tartar to the whites and brought the whites to stiff peaks, set aside. Oh, also, I replace the cup of oil by a cup of homemade apple sauce. I added the fresh ginger to the mixture of apple sauce and sugar. Then followed the recipe and the last thing that I did was to fold the whites to the batter. My cake fluffed so much, it is nice and thick and the house smell so good. Looking forward to have it tonight with our Thanksgiving dinner! Oh, I forgot, I also added 1/4cup of walnut pieces. Voilà! Thank you!!!"

I baked in a 9 x 13 for 40 -ish minutes also. I found the cake VERY dense. in fact it is Super heavy in the pan. I refrigerated overnight and the flavor is decent but this was too dense for me.

Also put some of the spices on the nuts with a little flour, before I mixed them in.\n\nI also made a sauce to fancy it up for Christmas dinner.\nUsed the lemon water I had the apples in so the wouldn't turn brown, a stick of butter, lemon, ginger and a little flour. Sorry I couldn't tell you the amounts, just kind of threw it in a pot and prayed and stirred! \n\nI enjoy reading how everyone makes this recipe their own!"

We are German and Native American mixed family and apples are our favorite fruit ( we have 15 trees) I made it the first time exactly per the recipe from then on I doubled the apples because my Indian husband said it needed to be more apple-ly now the ask for it about once a week in the winter."

Easy to make and on a cold day with a cup of apple tea it hits the spot.\nI may cut the nutmeg back to 1/2 tsp as one other person mentioned as the nutmeg seems strong.

I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 apple sauce to cut back on the oiliness; followed other users advice and substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1- 1/2 cup of white sugar. For spices I doubled the cinnamon, used only a sprinkle of nutmeg and 1 tsp of cloves. I also added some walnuts. This was a very moist cake that sets up beautifully over night. Could also be served directly out of the oven with some whipped cream because it is so soft. Definitely a keeper!"

I doubled all of the spices and used a mix of golden and Thompson raisins. These are the only changes I made.\n\nWhen the batter was ready, it was fairly chunky but it baked up fine. It took 45 minutes to bake through.\n\nThe cake is plenty sweet enough, but even more of a treat with maple cream cheese frosting (which was kind of hard to spread on a bundt cake).\n\nNext time, I would consider adding a little clove and maybe carrot or pineapple just to mix things up a bit."

"reviewBody": "Very moist and delicious! I tweaked it to make it GLUTEN-FREE for my crew. Instead of 2 cups of flour, I used 1 1/2 cups of brown rice flour, 1/3 cup of potato starch, 1/3 cup tapioca starch, and 1 tsp of xantham gum. I also added 1/2 tsp of baking powder. I was out of raisins, so I used dried cranberries. I used Gala apples, which were wonderful. The texture was light, not too dense or heavy as some GF cakes can be. It took about 10 mins longer to cook. I did put it in a bundt cake pan, and I was bummed it didn't turn out perfectly. It is not a pretty cake, but I can fix it with a little powdered sugar on top. Still, as far a gluten-free cakes go - it was delish!!"

"reviewBody": "I've baked this cake a couple of times now and every time, none of it gets wasted which is great. I made a few changes to the recipe, omitting a cup of white sugar and replacing it with brown sugar which I think gave it a richer flavour. I also added at least 3x the amount of spices as I knew that just one teaspoon of each of the spices was not going to be enough. Despite adding a lot more spice, the cake had a mild flavour, but it was very pleasant. Next time I think I will add a fourth apple to the recipe as I love the texture of the apples after they are baked. All round, a pleasant cake, very moist and delicious. Will continue to bake it :)"

I also made a cream cheese frosting and added around a TB of maple syrup to it. I also took another person's suggestion and used my food processor to shred the apples. It doesn't really shred but it cuts them up really fine, then I put them in a colander and kind of used my hands to squeeze out a lot of the excess juice. This tip really saves a lot of time and mess. This cake is really moist and delicious. I will certainly make it again and I highly recommend this recipe."
