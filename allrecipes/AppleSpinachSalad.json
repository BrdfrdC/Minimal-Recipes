I usually prefer cold salad but this room temp dressing is so appealing (olive oil, red wine vinegar and 1/2 package of wishbone dry salad dressing mix)"

So simple, but a big flavor payoff. I suggest toasting the pecans first (you could do this quickly in a skillet), or while you're assembling the salad."

"reviewBody": "I had my doubts about how apples would taste with Italian dressing, but I was pleasantly surprised because they’re good! That little bit of sweetness from the apples is a good contrast to the tang of the dressing. I also enjoyed the crunch from the apples, pecans, and celery, and as a bonus, this salad has great eye appeal. Just doesn’t get much easier than this for a light lunch today with a few fig and olive crackers."
