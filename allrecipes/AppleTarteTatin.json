"reviewBody": "It's apple picking season and I come back to this recipe every year! My family and friends love this Autumnal harbinger dish. This kicks off the Fall for us and helps us prepare for the long winter ahead. I add a dash of nutmeg and ginger to my sugar and butter but the recipe as it is, still comes out beautifully. For people who didn't get great results (like Pam), I would suggest watching the video and following him step by step as you prep, then watch again as you cook. I have used every manner of apple with this recipe and Granny Smith is best but Ginger gold is also delicious. Toss in a couple blueberries for some razzle-dazzle or peaches, pears, asian-pears, strawberries or maybe if you feel fancy make some dumplings (balls of pastry). I love this easy make to dish and it makes my family happy. I tried it on a cruise ship in the fine dining restaurant once and suggested that the chef watch Chef John make it. Mine was 75 times better!!! lol"

The Tarte Tatin tastes delicious and is simple and easy to make.\n\nTips:\nThe butter is very hard to spread on. Try melting the butter a little bit. It doesn't matter if there are chunks of butter because it will all end up turning into caramel. \nIf you let the Tarte Tatin cool until it hardens, you can just heat up the pan for 1 minute on the stove and it should come out easily."

Easy to make, but you will have apples sticking to the pan - yes, even in a ceramic coated pan. Had to scrape off and ‘redistribute’! But all in all it tasted great and took no time to make...."

Didn't have a skillet I can put in the over, so I cooked on the fire in a non stick frying pan and the transferred to a pe dish. my dish is 8inch and hence I used only 2 apples, 1/3 cup sugar and 70g butter. Came out extremely tasty. Needs icecream/custard.\n\nEdit : 16.12.17 Made it my Le Crueset frying pan. Followed the recipe exactly, except sprinkled a generous pinch of cinnamon after the caramelisation was done, before putting the pastry on top. Extremely delicious!"

I have a pretty solid pie crust, so have not made Chef John's. \r\n\r\nTwo things I would note: Be sure to make sure the applies are really snug when placing in skillet; and do not get impatient while cooking. You want that lovely caramel to brown! It makes a huge difference in your end result."

Thank goodness the first time was served to guests and not the second time. Be careful how long you cook on stove top. The entire pan does not have to have the deep caramel color (or it will burn)."

"reviewBody": "Excellent. After watching the video I did some research on the tarte, learned it was originally made with puff pastry, which I happened to have on hand, so that's what I used. I made it with Honey Crisp apples and, as per other reviewers, I added cinnamon and also a dash of ground cloves.\nThe tarte came out of the pan perfectly, although I have to say there was more moisture in my tarte than in Chef John's, which probably helped. Delicious, oh so easy. I'm making it again for Thanksgiving. It's really nice to have such a great looking dessert that one can put together so quickly and easily."

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe exactly as written (including the suggested pastry) after watching the video. I think that anyone making this for the first time should view the video before beginning - it shows a lot that the recipe can't explain. Everything turned out very well and I was pleased. My rating is based more on personal preference, rather than how successfully it turned out. I gave a \"4\" because I found the Granny Smith apples a bit tart for my liking and craved a bit of cinnamon to add depth to the flavour. I will definitely make this again (SO easy!) and just change to variety of apple (Gala, maybe?) and add a bit of cinnamon. Thanks, Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "Not an easy thing to make. Ranked this a 2 mostly because it isn't to get the pie to turn out. If you want that nice ruffle edge. I may have cooked longer than I should've in the skillet because I didn't have much \"sauce\". It tasted fine, but my preference would be to add cinnamon &amp; double the sauce. Think we'll just stick with the regular apple pie even though this is easier by just quartering the apples instead of slicing."

I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and I used Gala apples because that's what I had on hand. I cheated and used a Pillsbury pie crust and it did not disappoint. Before I put it in the oven, I sprinkled cinnamon over the apples. I think that was an important addition. When I flipped it, it looked picture perfect...just like Chef John's. When I make it again, I will double the apples. Thank you Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "I was looking for alot more from this recipe. Difficulties started with the clarity of the directions. I wasn't sure whether this called for melted butter or not in step two. The directions state to coat bottom of pan with butter, which seems to mean in order to coat, it needs to be melted however then, when placed on stove in step 4, it calls for cooking until butter melts. Which is it? \nWhen I went to flip the tarte in was stuck to the bottom of the pan.\nI had visions of a beautiful tarte and instead it turned into a mess.\nI ended up using a spatula to get it out and there was no presentation to it at all.\nTo top it all off, it was bland. This needs some cinnamon and nutmeg.\nWill not be making again. \nSorry Chef John. I am usually a big fan."

It was so very delicious that I have made 3 in 2 weeks.\n\nBeing adventurous, it sounded kind of like a pecan sticky bun which I adore, so I included whole pecans just before the carmelized apples were to go into the oven. Then I topped it with some cinnamen and topped it with the crust.\n\nIt was appreciated by all."
