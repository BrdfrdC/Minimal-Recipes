I will try these again, but I'll use my own pastry, grate an apple into the filling, and I might even use raisins! (Or what about a little faux mince? But maybe then they wouldn't be Canadian anymore.)"

"reviewBody": "I made these a few days ago just as the recipe stated and they were wonderful. The apple cider reduction did seize up when I poured it on the brown sugar so I just popped it in the microwave for 30 seconds and continued on. My husband and I ate two a piece still warm and will be the rest at room temp. I used the butter crust recipe and it is very easy to do and very flakey. Normally pie crust doesn't do well for me but this one worked very well. I will definitely be making these again. Thanks for another great recipe Chef John!"
