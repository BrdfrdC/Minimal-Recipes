This may have happened for 2 reasons. I used frozen chicken breasts which were about 1/2 thawed out and the recipe said to cover the dish while baking. I may try this recipe again using regular chicken breasts and I will not cover the pan. The partially frozen chicken breasts and the pan being covered during baking resulted in too much liquid. So disappointed!"

I like to use chicken breast tenderloins now but sometimes still use thin sliced chicken breast. The meat is more moist using them. \nThe first time I made it I was unsure as I don't like apricots or Russian dressing but I loved it all together. You can also use the sugar free apricot preserves and it still tastes the same. No one can tell here. Try it!"

I only use half the bottle of Wishbone Russian dressing, 1 pouch of Lipton Onion Soup mix, and 1 jar of Smucker's Apricot-Pinapple Preserves and have plenty of sauce for the chicken and rice."

I did those steps early only because I wanted to clean up the sticky mess I knew I would have from the jam. The chicken was great. However, no boneless skinless chicken breast needs to bake for an hour at 350. Forty-five minutes was plenty and I probably could have cut the baking time to forty minutes."

"reviewBody": "This dish is very forgivingâ€”you can easily substitute thousand island dressing for the Russian dressing, vary the amounts of the ingredients to taste, use different chicken parts, or move the whole thing to a crock pot. The crock pot version is juicier than the oven version but still very good. Chicken thighs work very well in this recipe and are usually cheaper than breasts. I've tried searing the chicken before combining with the other ingredients, but that doesn't seem to make enough of a difference to bother with. I've also tried adding dried apricots, which was very successful.\n\nMy favorite version so far has been 12 chicken thighs, 1 bottle of thousand island dressing, 1 envelope of onion-soup mix, 1 jar of apricot jam, and 8 ounces of diced dried apricots, all cooked in a crock pot on high for four hours.\n\nOverall, this is a good basic, easy recipe that's a big hit every time."

"reviewBody": "I've been making this recipe for years -- my kids loved it, even my picky daughter who didn't like foods with sauce. It's easy and delicious. Once you've combined the sauce ingredients, you can use half of the sauce for one meal (depending on how many people you're cooking for) and save the rest in the fridge for later; the sauce mix will keep for a long time in the fridge. But it's really important that you get the clear Russian dressing (which can be hard to find) rather than the thick Russian dressing that is sometimes put on reuben sandwiches because the thick stuff is more like Thousand Island dressing."

After making this one, I was dumbfounded by some of the negative reviews I had read. Maybe people should stop rating a recipie where they substitued half the ingredients? Or maybe they don't know how to cook? One of the most delicious recipies I've tried from this site."

I also used 1c of fat free Catalina style dressing, 1c of Saucy Susan(apricot/peach galze/dipping sauce), and the onion soup mix. I prepared this in the morning and basically marinated the chicken in this mixture before baking. Sweet, sticky and delicious! Family inhaled this...will make again! Thanks!"

So if you haven't tried it yet, or are skeptical because of the ingredients, don't be. I still get requests to make it after all these years."

"reviewBody": "Quick and easy, and undoubtedly will appeal to many palates. It's too sweet for my taste, but if you're making a dish with a cup of apricot preserves in it, you're probably looking for sweet. It is reminiscent of sweet and sour chicken, with the onion soup mix adding savory to the mix. I suspect it would work better in a crockpot, or perhaps not baked for 60 minutes. The chicken came out pretty dry for me. I would also consider using a juice sweetened 100% fruit spread, and perhaps less of it, in order to cut down on the sweetness."

"reviewBody": "The flavor is delicious. Apricot was not a favorite of ours until we tried this recipe. One caution about other reviewers' suggestions to cook in a crock pot. The first time, we did the crock pot method at low for about six hours and the chicken was way over-cooked and dry. So if using crock pot, cut down time to about 2 1/2 hours to 3 and check to ensure chicken stays moist. The second time, we did in traditional oven and I still managed to overcook the chicken. I think the reason is I don't use 6 breasts; I only use about 3 to feed just my hubby and me. So if using less chicken, cut back cooking time. Those errors are my fault, so no impact on this recipe. The flavor of the sauce on chicken and over rice is excellent! We'll definitely make it again and again! I also would serve this dish for company. Thanks, Shirley!"

"reviewBody": "This is such great recipe. \"What tender chicken!\" everyone moaned -- with full mouths. So I made this \"as written\" the first couple of times and served it over brown rice. Always one to experiment, I added a few touches the third time I reached for this gem-of-a-recipe. Here's what I did:\nLots more chicken (family pack). Used only one pkg. of dry onion soup mix, to which I added: the apricot preserves; 1/3 C. good-quality DRY Sherry (please, not \"cooking Sherry\"); 1 tsp. DRY mustard; 1 tsp. ground WHITE pepper; and 1 C. raisins. Also, I used \"Light\" Catalina Dressing. The beauty of this, though, is that Shirley's recipe is delicious as it is. But if you have some extra time and want to add a bit of flare, the sky's the limit! Cook time can be less, like 45 min., so be careful or chicken will dry out. Thank you Shirley."

Only, instead of baking it, he saute's the boneless chicken pieces in a skillet with a little olive oil until the pink is gone, and the outside is a little browned. Then he adds the the sauce, reduces the heat, covers and simmers it, and ... Yummmmm! Don't forget to stir it periodically so it doesn't stick. This skillet method cuts cook time down considerably!"
