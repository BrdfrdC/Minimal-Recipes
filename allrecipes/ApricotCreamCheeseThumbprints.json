I again left out the lemon zest.\nMy Family ate all the cookies as soon as they cooled on each batch, therefore the recipe with the extra cream cheese and minus zest earned 5 stars.\n\nThe dough is too sticky to work with and must be refrigerated. I did roll in the powdered sugar which also helped.\n\nI will make again."

It tastes exactly like Red Lobster's.\nMaybe even add in some cheese and herbs for taste."

I used a cherry preserve, which was fine...the cookie is very bland though. I was cooking 1-2 cookies (no jelly) at a time and tasting them before dough set up completely from cooling. I'm not sure what to add to fix it. I even added some salt to the dough, and that didn't help either. My fingers are crossed that after a few days, the cream cheese flavor will get stronger as another review said. It wad easy to put together, but tastes as if the ingredient flavors worked against each other instead of together. Won't make again."

You can tweak it to your preference flavor wise with vanilla etc, if you skip the citrus."

Normally I don’t care for apricot anything so I bought raspberry preserves just in case but I feel the apricot filled ones tasted better than the raspberry ones. They came out incredibly soft and the perfect amount of sweetness. The only difference I did was adding in an additional 1/2 block of cream cheese. Refrigerated the dough the night before and cooked it the next morning. Instead of using your thumb, I took a 1 tsp measuring spoon, dipped the rounded end in powdered sugar and pressed it into each cookie. I wanted a more rounded, professional look then sprinkled powdered sugar on top once cooled. These are now my favorite cookie!"

I ended up using 1/2c butter, 4oz cream cheese, 1/2c sugar, 1/2tsp baking powder, 1 egg, and 1 1/2c flour. I would use this recipe again."

As another reviewer suggested, I used a round measuring spoon to make the \"thumbprints\". I also put the jam in a ziplock bag and cut off the corner to neatly fill them. Worked like a charm! Oh--almost forgot! I used almond extract for flavoring instead of lemon/zest out of personal preference. These are great with a cup of coffee or tea and will add a pretty touch of color to my cookie trays!"

The only thing is they take some time to make. between chilling the dough. rolling it in balls, putting the indent and then the jelly. They really take 15 minutes in the oven. If you are going to make these plan for them to take time. My daughter and I had an assembly line. I balled, she indented and filled with Jelly."

"reviewBody": "This is the 1st review &amp; 1st recipe I tried from this site. If you follow the recipe exactly as it is the cookies taste delicious-melt in your mouth. However, it is very difficult to make balls of the dough with indention and even rolling in sugar as some reviewers suggest doesn't help. The 1st few I baked as per the recipe and made the apricot paste filling at home so they look bland in the photo. The next lot I made, added color to paste and some more flour to the dough. The color was a welcome change and more flour made it easier to roll into balls but it affected the taste which was not melt-in-the-mouth but biscuity. Guess next time will just make them as they are without the thumprints:) \nP.S: I would like to know if they can be stored in an air-tight jar outside or need to be refrigerated so they don't get spoilt."

"reviewBody": "I have no idea why anyone would say these are bland, they have fantastic flavour. I have substituted the lemon for 1 tbsp vanilla and will change up the toppings. A spicy cherry jelly is fantastic, I also used guava paste which is sturdy enough it doesn't run off the cookie at all. I also like to try rolling the dough in different things before indenting and adding the jelly - so far crushed walnuts are the tastiest, sesame seeds look fantastic and powdered sugar adds delicacy and sweetness, I'm sure there are a lot of other things that would work too. My only issue is I actually find the dough to be too sweet, next time I will experiment with cutting down the amount of sugar and possibly adding more cream cheese if I want to work with a pepper or spicy jelly. \nNote - prep time seems incorrect for this recipe, rolling the dough and adding the jelly takes longer for me. Also I didn't make 7 dozen, I must have made my cookies larger but I ended up with 4 dozen."

Made them two days in a row by the dozens of dozens and people at work couldn't get enough of them. I was called evil for bringing something so delicious in to work that the girls starting their new years diets couldn't resist them!! Only thing I changed was to add a little vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract instead of the zest. Then I rolled them in confectioners sugar to keep them from sticking. No need to add extra flour they turn out way better and lighter if you don't."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is a definite keeper! I am an avid baker and often rely on the ratings of others before I will bring it to the table for my family. Since this was rated so highly, I gave it a try and made a few changes. I followed the advice of others and rolled these in powdered sugar to make for easier handling. I also used cherry preserves and when cooled, I made a powdered sugar glaze with milk and added a teaspoon of almond extract to it. The cherry and almond flavoring combo was divine. I also made the other half of the batch using apricot preserves and also drizzled the almond glaze over these, too. What a delicious treat! They are a cross between a sugar cookie with glaze and a classic thumbprint with preserves. You will not be disappointed with these tender cookies. Tip: Use parchment paper when cooking so the preserves don't leak out on the sheet pan. Of course, this will only happen if you push down too much on the cookie for the jam insert. A teaspoon worked perfectly when I dipped it in powdered sugar to form the jam divot. Plus, using parchment deters the cookie from browning too much on the bottom."

I only made a half batch, didn't really want 7 dozen cookies. I got 4 dozen. I also used apricot filling that I buy near the bakery section of my food store . It's niot as runny as preserves and is totally apricots, no sugar added. I rolled the balls in granulated sugar, that's what I do when I make kolachy..they were great, will make again"

I skipped the lemon juice and zest and instead added some almond and vanilla extracts. I unfortunately had only some cheap raspberry jelly to use which ran out of the cookie and all over the cookie sheets but that was the fault of the jelly. I will be sure to make these again with the lemon flavoring and the apricot jelly. Thanks!"
