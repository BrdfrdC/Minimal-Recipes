Fortunately I had a $1.00 (on sale) tube of Pillsbury flaky biscuits that I could roll thin and stuff. The two versions seem equally tasty and were well received. I can see a bunch of variations to this basic recipe."

"reviewBody": "These are delicious. I did add some spices to the meat. I would suggest throwing the raisins in last, once the meat has cooled down, and before stuffing the empanadas. The reason is, they get really plumpy and soft, I don't know about you, but it gives me goosebumps, and the hairs in the back of my neck, stand up. Hence the reason, I always told my mother as a child, not to add raisins to my rice pudding, or bread pudding. :)"

"reviewBody": "Love this! I was apprehensive about the raisins and olives but it was so delicious! I did add a few things to address the \"lack of seasoning\" that is in other review and I think it was perfect. I added one clove of garlic and two serrano peppers to the onion mixture for a little spice. I also did a dash of paprika and I salted and peppered to taste. The cuman was a little powerful when I tasted the mixture before it baked in the dough but after it was all said and done it was perfect. I used three frozen puff pastry sheets and still had scraps left over but that can be refrozen and used at a later date. \nI used my convection oven on 450 and baked for 10 min before I switched racks and then did an additional 3-5 and they came out golden and flaky. I will absolutely be making these again. THank you for the amazing recipe"

"reviewBody": "Why would anyone leave out the raisins and olives? They are crucial to the overall flavor of the empanada. And, if you switch the position of the baking sheets betweens racks as suggested, the bottoms won't burn. I love empanadas with raisins and we put olives (black or green) in our enchiladas too. Hubby loves them that way. Our Mexican family makes empanadas differently but I love a change."

I followed the directions exactly and after 12 minutes I could smell them burning. The parchment paper was burned up and the empanadas were perfectly golden on top but the bottoms were completely black. I've made empanadas before that were wonderful. These are not."

I'm so happy they were featured in the allrecipes magazine!"
