"reviewBody": "Wonderfully delicious recipe for traditional Mexican Parrilla. I’ve served this flavorful and juicy barbecued steak often, in a number of different ways and to a variety of different people successfully. Every time I am traveling in Mexico I make sure to sample as many different Arracherra entrees as I can without making my dinner boring, and, although I’m encountering many different marinades that taste fantastic, this recipe is definitely one of the best I’ve had to date."

"reviewBody": "The arrachera was excellent for our tacos! Per the author's notes, I did add minced garlic and cilantro to the marinade. The only changes I made were: 1) used my own salt free sazon blend instead of store bought and ended up adding a little extra adobo, and 2) used gluten free beer (tested with Omission and Two Brothers) and had no issues with the recipe. This is our new go to recipe for skirt steak tacos and look forward to making it again!"

Don't let the bright orange of the sazon or the beer scare you. They work magic together! You really can't go wrong with this recipe. These are the best tacos you will ever eat."
