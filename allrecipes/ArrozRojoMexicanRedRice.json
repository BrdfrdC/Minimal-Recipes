To save time and a little work, I used a 1/2 cup of canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh grated. I left out the jalapeño because of my toddler, but the tomatoes I used were fire roasted with green chilies and added some great flavor. I’ll definitely be making this again!"

Oh so good, easy- even when I screwed up a few things (accidentally threw the onions in with the tomatoes and had to pick them out so some onions weren't blanched prior to adding remaining ingredients, sautéed garlic with onions right off the bat...) I was making a big Mexican themed dinner and screwed this up a little- and it was to die for! I added 1 extra tomato for good measure as some reviewers had stated it was dry- I think like any time you make rice like this- better a little more moist than dry- watch not to over cook....for those reviews that said it was too dry, don't think it was the recipe....I also halved the jalapeño\nfor my guests as they don't like it so hot, and that was a good call. It sat in a warm oven for about an hour afterwards while I finished everything else, was so good!! Delicious!"

"reviewBody": "I haven’t made Mexican rice in awhile, so maybe my memory is foggy, but I’m not sure I’ve ever made a Mexican rice recipe quite this good. Rather than trying to grate a tomato, I simply blanched it which made the peel come off easily, then just chopped it up very fine. Scaling this down to two servings meant I had to improvise on the tomato sauce – I wasn’t about to open a can for a mere tablespoon or two. For those who might find themselves in the same situation, I used half the measurement in tomato paste and water instead and it obviously worked out great because this was simply delicious. Worth seriously considering for your go-to Mexican rice side dish."

I live in a seven person family, three of the kids barely eat anything (especially green things and veggies) but they love this!"

"reviewBody": "I'm glad I picked this recipe in a hurry last night. I usually will not choose recipes that have not been highly rated by many people and choosing a recipe with only 1 rating is not normal for me. So I had to give this recipe a review. \nThe rice turned like a classic Mexican rice. I didn't have enough fresh tomatoes so I puréed a 12 oz can and used about 3/4 of the can. I also added a little extra cilantro and next time I will also add green chiles. This one is a keeper."
