I just couldn’t see putting DOUBLE the amount that I did without getting a SOUP! It is OK, but I would prefer more Al dente rice. I added vanilla extract and the ground cinnamon too."

The only problem I had was that it did not take 10 minutes to thicken up. Mine took about 25 minutes to thicken and for the rice to absorb the milk mixture. Don’t give up. Keep stirring and it will eventually thicken."

It took a lot longer to cook down. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be soupy or a thicker consistency, it doesn't specify."

It thickens A LOT as it stands and cools. I will make with the full amount of milk the next time. I will also add a bit more sugar. I will try again though. Also it makes a lot. We ate it for three days."
