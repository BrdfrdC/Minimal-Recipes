You could probably use Mozzarella or even grated Parmesan and not notice either - save yourself a few bucks."

I added 2 tomatoes some mozzarella and only used about 2 1/2T of mayo, and I probably could have used less than that even. I also added some lemon juice, toasted the baguette before putting the topping on, and added salt and pepper. I sprinkled the top with Parmesan before broiling and broiled for about 90 seconds (watch this stuff, it will burn fast)! The end result was great, but as written it's wrong and is probably what the 1 star reviewers are reviewing. Just use less mayo and this will turn out great!"

As reading reviews, I did tweak a bit.\n1) I used vegan mayo ( 60% less calorie and amazing taste!)\n2) I did add one clove of garlic and tomatoes.\n3) Instead of using marinated artichoke, I used fresh artichoke hearts and added 2 table spoons of my cilantro, jalepeno pesto which I also found the recipe from allrecipes.com.\nI reduced the serving amount to half from the original recipe called for, and did the math, which the calorie came out to be only 301 calories for the entire serving! Great way to enjoy my new dip!\nThank you for sharing your recipe!"

Here in Seattle we have a product called Mama Lil's Peppers. I chopped up a couple tablespoons of these peppers, added in a tablespoon of the pepper oil, then also added a crushed clove of garlic, a couple tablespoons of minced shallot, a couple tablespoons of mayo, some parsley, and parm. Topped this mixture on toasted bread, then sprinkled more parm on top before broiling. Really great!"

We liked it but agreed it could use a \"kick.\" It is SUPER fast to whip up (put the artichokes in your mini food processor) and broil. I will make it again but will check out some of the additions others liked. Thank you - I love simple app recipes!"

Since I had already planned on making it, I decide to forge ahead and see how it turned out, and it was actually quite good. The only other changes I made were to add a tiny bit of minced garlic and use Gorgonzola instead of Romano. My BF, who hates mayonnaise, actually ate this and loved them. I'm looking forward to trying these again with artichokes!!! Sure that it will be as good if not better."

There's always next time?"

But with the small tweaks I made, this tastes just like Costco's artichoke dip, which I can no longer buy because I don't belong anymore. And now, I don't have to keep asking my mother-in-law to pick a container up for me every time she goes to Costco. Thank you for sharing!"

I followed directions exactly except my can of artichokes was 14.5 oz, but since I don't like the slightly harder leaves, I trimmed them so that maybe made the artichoke mass less :) I also guestimated the mayo, but probably used 4-5 tablespoons cause I LOVE mayo :) I also used a pre-sliced baguette which made life so much easier! I will make this ALL THE TIME!!!!!!!!"

Aside from reducing the mayo, I initially followed the recipe. I tried the spread only on a single bruschetta, and, as others suggested, thought it could use some garlic. Tried another single toast and tought it was still missing just a little something. Lemon zest did the trick. Micro-planed about 1/2 tsp. It cut through the heaviness of the cheese and chokes and livened it up without overpowering."
