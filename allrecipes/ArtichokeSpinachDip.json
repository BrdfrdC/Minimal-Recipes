It makes a lot so 1/2 a recipe was more than enough for us!!!"

I followed the recipe exactly. I did notice that you really have to cook this longer than written due to the overwhelming taste of sour cream. The longer it cooks the more the sour cream, garlic, cream cheese and Parmesan cheese yield together making it just ok enough to eat. My family all said the exact same thing when they tried it, “It’s bland”. The recipe made enough to serve an army. I guess I will keep searching for a good spinach dip recipe. But seriously, thanks for taking the time to post this recipe. It’s people like you that take the time to help others in their pursuit of good cooking."

I have made this twice and I love it - it is very creamy which I was skeptical about but I love it. I use less sour cream (only about 8oz) because I don't really like sour cream. I also add more cheese - I didn't actually measure how much I used but I used a handful of parmesean, romano, and mozzarella cheese. Delicious!!"

"reviewBody": "I used this recipe as the basis for the dip, and it turned out rather tasty and satisfying. I know some people follow recipes to the letter, but I always modify recipes to my preferred taste. For example, I sauteed 1 cup fresh, chopped spinach with 1 tbsp minced garlic, 1/4 cup chopped yellow onions, 2 chopped scallions, and 1/2 cup chopped California style marinated artichoke hearts (comes in a jar) in butter for about 8-10 minutes on med/low heat. Then, I added 1 and 1/2 pkgs of softened Neufchâtel cheese, 2 tbsp low-fat Greek yogurt, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, and 1 tsp salt. I found it was rather lumpy and thick, so I slowly added 1/2 cup low-fat milk and stirred occasionally for about 15 minutes. I served it warm alongside Milton's multi-grain baked crackers. It was a hit! I plan to use this recipe again and try it with other ingredients like extra cheddar and mozzarella cheeses, jalapenos, black olives, cayenne pepper, and chopped water chestnuts."

I also threw some mozzerella cheese in there while it was cooking, and it was amazing without the sour cream! taste restaurant worthy to me served hot with melted mozzerella on top with some tortilla chips. Everything else I kept the same, and im glad I did because I think it would have been over seasoned any other way. Thank you for my first homemade version of the recipe."

I added 5 cloves of fresh minced garlic, 1 finely chopped jalapeno (seeds removed) and about 3/4 cup chopped red onion, all of which I sauteed in the olive oil with some thyme, parsley and paprika before adding 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice &amp; artichokes then spinach. The result was outstanding. This dip goes well with pita chips, tortilla chips, crackers, vegetables and who knows what else. Mmm... Yummy!"

I only had half a block of cream cheese, so I scaled down the recipe to reflect that. I didn't have any artichokes on hand, so instead I increased the spinach amount and also added about 2.5 chopped green onions (the remaining part of the onion I sprinkled on top of the pizza we made). As others suggested, I added some garlic in with the butter in the beginning, but I still added in some garlic salt because it's a stronger flavor. Yummy! It turned out cheesy and delicious, and the green onion complemented all the flavors!"

"reviewBody": "I've barely taken this recipe off the stove for the first time, and I'm already reviewing it. It's THAT good! I halved the recipe from the get-go, but used an entire can of artichoke hearts to avoid waste. I also sauteed two cloves worth of minced garlic in the butter before adding the spinach and artichoke mixture, and threw some Worcestershire sauce and a bit of salt in once all the other ingredients were in the saucepan. Be sure to use a larger dish than you think will be necessary for this one; even halved, this recipe yields a fair amount. I have a feeling that my dinner (Marie's Easy Slow Cooker Pot Roast - another good one from this site!) will be spoiled tonight thanks to this recipe."

Half a lemon, black pepper, onions, cut the sour cream in half and doubled the artichokes. What brought this to a new level was when I went across the street to Chipotle to grab some black pepper, I was inspired to grab some of their chipotle tobacco sauce. Unbelievably good. Add the chipotle tabasco sauce and thank me later."

"reviewBody": "As written, I felt like this was off but with minor modifications, this dip is delicious. IMO it definitely needs double the amount of spinach called for if you plan to use all the cream cheese &amp; sour cream, and fresh garlic, salt, and pepper versus garlic salt is the way to go. About 1C mozzarella cheese is also a nice addition. Add cayenne or hot sauce if you like it spicy. These variations receive rave reviews every time."

"reviewBody": "Thank you for this recipe! I always loved the richness of spinach dips and wondered how it was made. Following the recommendations of other reviewers:\n\n16 oz bag of chopped spinach\n14 oz can artichoke hearts\n4-6 cloves minced garlic\nSome minced onion\n8 oz cream cheese\n16 oz sour cream\nDash of Worchestershire sauce\nDash of lemon juice\nDash of pepper flakes, salt, pepper\nParmesean cheese\nMozzarella cheese\n\nIt was creamy, full of spinach with a little tang (also helps the absorption of iron). At first, I thought it would be too much spinach and artichoke but it cooks down nicely. Makes a big pot so there will be some leftovers. I think it must be healthy!"

I would use less sour cream next time b/c it tasted too much like sour cream. It did LACK A LOT of flavor if you follow recipe as is. I sauteed 3 diced garlic cloves, added pepper &amp; garlic salt, and it still was missing something! I decided to put a few drops of lemon juice like others have suggested and that really helped it. I think PESTO is what this recipe needed! I added a tablespoon. All these flavors came together nicely and everyone loved it at the party. Fed 20 people."

"reviewBody": "I thought this recipe was good. I'm not a huge fan of dips with cream cheese and sour cream bc of the fat content, but I was in a pinch and needed something fast. I took some of the suggestions of the other reviewers cut the recipe in half. Even half recipe makes a very large portion (enough for a group of 10 I'd say). I also sautéed garlic in the butter, added lemon juice, kosher salt. I added a couple splats of Tabasco, which didn't really add much to the flavor. It could have used more if you wanted a little more zing. I recommend skipping the Worchestershire sauce that another reviewer suggested. The flavor didn't really mesh with the other flavors well. Overall, it was easy to prepare, keeps well in the fridge and reheats easily."

Sauteed some onion and garlic on stove first before adding spinach and artichokes, and did not use the garlic salt. Very yummy, even spread some leftovers on pizza crust later on and it was really good that way. Could probably bake it if you wanted to."

I halved the cream cheese and sour cream, sauteed one garlic clove with the spinach, and left out the artichokes (didn't have any). My whole family loved it - it tasted very similar (only better!) to a frozen TGIF version that we get at the grocery store. The best part is that it was made with ingredients that I always have on hand so it can be made on the fly for unexpected company."

I noticed that some reviewers said that it was a little too cream cheese-y, and for me it seemed like the cream cheese clumped up just a little bit and that's when it tasted too much like cream cheese. Maybe I should have let the cream cheese melt just a little bit more. It was still great though. Thanks for the recipe!"

I halve the sour cream and cream cheese, and it always makes LOTS, with just enough spinach and artichokes on each bite. I like to scoop it into a baking dish and melt some cheese on the top in the oven as well. Always a hit where ever I bring it."

I used 16 oz. of spinach instead of 10, and 1 container of sour cream, but later added a little mayo and Lactaid. After heating thoroughly I added a little more lemon juice, chili powder and paprika (just a sprinkle!), and 21-spice salute from Trader Joe's. \n\nIt only took 6 people to kill the crock pot-full, and they couldn't stop talking about how great it was! (Four of the people are into Spin-Art dip in a big way, two are foodies - I couldn't stop patting myself on the back :))"
