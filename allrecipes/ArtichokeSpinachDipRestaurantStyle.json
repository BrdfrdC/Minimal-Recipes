I used all of the cream cheese I had (8 oz) and topped it with some mozzarella. Other than that I followed the recipe. (I would say make sure you use an Alfredo sauce you know you like. I thought it was weird at first but it was so good.) I was pleasantly surprised how good this was that I made an account to review this. Thank you to the owner of this recipe and those in comments that had suggestions! Notes: The Alfredo I used was: Cucina Fresca (I feel this is a great Alfredo for this. I used all of it pretty much) I did get marinated Artichoke hearts (quartered) but washed them off in water and drained them to get the seasoning off of them. I’d suggest not getting marinated artichokes if possible or wash them off gently. I cut them in halves after that."

Because I wanted to make several smaller servings I used a mixer to mix the Alfredo and cream cheese. Also added 1/3 cup of mozzarella to the dip. The remaining mozzarella I added to the top and baked at 350 until cheese was melted. Roasted garlic added great flavor."

I've also done this in a Crock-Pot for Thanksgiving potlucks, just throw it all in, mix it up, and set it on high until it heats through - I usually give it about 2 hours, but I usually double or triple the recipe :)"

I followed the recipe exactly, except added a full block of cream cheese per the recommendation of many other users and I eyeballed the amount of spinach because I had a much larger bag than 10 oz. Next time I'd replace the alfredo with the standard sour cream/mayo or greek yogurt mixture and increase the roasted garlic to 5-6 cloves."

How about trying it with a reduced cream of onion soup and cheeses? Would also like to try this tossed with grilled chicken and angel hair pasta or even the same on pizza crust. Sounds like you could do a lot with this...."

"reviewBody": "This was hands down the BEST recipe I have ever made! Although i did use all of these ingredients i did not follow the measurements that they give. I feel like if i used more Alfredo sauce it would ruin it so i changed it up &amp; it tasted just like the restaurants! Could not stop eating it. Everyone loved it!! I only used about half (or a cup) of regular Alfredo and just chopped my garlic up. I also used all of the 8oz cream cheese. I also added a little bit of garlic powder, some salt &amp; pepper. It turned out so creamy &amp; delicious. I’m making more tomorrow. All the other recipes for spinach dip are so different than this one &amp; they tasted not so good. This one is the best!! Going to make it forever now. Yummm! So glad I found this recipe."

I used a10oz tub from the refrigerated section and it was perfect. Next time I will roast the garlic but due to time, I just used fresh raw garlic &amp; it was fine and still tasty. I also added some cayenne pepper &amp; few drops of hot sauce &amp; also added additional mozzarella cheese blend. I too mixed it all up together and did not layer it &amp; used entire block of cream cheese, per many of the other reviews. I also (per reviews) did not bake &amp; put in my mini crock pot ~ PERFECT!"

Only thing that I changed is using fresh spinach, instead of frozen. It just takes a little longer to chop, but it's definitely worth it. I'm making it for the third time right now. The smell of garlic roasting in the oven is also a plus. Will for sure make again!"

As a note, I cooked on stovetop and then put it in a crock pot to keep warm during the party."
