I sautéed the mushroom caps, one side only, filled them and placed them in a tart pan, the small indentations were perfect for holding the mushrooms upright while baking. \nI also did not use \"marinated\" artichokes and I used hearts because I don't like those little fibers.\n\nI would have to say (all modesty aside) it was one of the best appetizers I have ever enjoyed! \n\nTry it, you'll like it!"

I threw everything into my food processor because of laziness and I accidentally made a bit of a purée rather than a chunkier filling but that was my rookie mistake. The flavor was great even if the texture left something to be desired (again, my fault). I would definitely give this another go!"

"reviewBody": "These were a hit with our guests. I used cremini mushrooms, as they have a nice shape and are flat on the tops so they don't teeter when you stuff and place them in your baking dish. To address some of the reviews about too much liquid coming out, take a spoon and scoop out the \"gills\", the darker part that fans around the base of the stem. This will solve that problem, unless you have used something in the filling to make them ooze all over. I have to admit I skipped the first part of sauteing the mushroom stems and onions in olive oil. No need to do this, unless you have the time. Since I'm the only one in the kitchen and preparing the entire meal for guests, I opted out on having to chop onion, and an extra pan to clean. Instead I just added some crushed garlic to the mix, along with Alfredo sauce from a jar (which was in the fridge from a prior recipe and I needed to use it)in lieu of the sour cream. This is a beautiful appetizer to present for your guests while awaiting the main course."

Made an amazing filling for the mushrooms and also was great in some stuffed sweet peppers we made to accompany on the appetizer tray. The way these mushrooms cook with the filling is mouth watering. Yum! Sprinkled some paprika on top for crusting."

"reviewBody": "Unbelievable! My go to for many vegetarian recipes because you can play with adding other veggies. I always cut the cream cheese in half and use low fat sour cream and cream cheese. I always use non-marinated artichokes and adjust the seasonings to taste. I have served as a main course and used portabello (using lower oven temps and longer cooking times, or parbaking the mushrooms prior to stuffing). With regard to any leftover filling, I have used (or frozen for later) and used as: quesadilla, burrito, or enchilada innards, baked in phyllo or tart shells, in quiches, baked and served on crackers or chips, in eggs Benedict or breakfast burritos, in pasta sauces or baked pasta dishes -- even veggie lasagna, bruschetta, cheesy garlic bread. Really, you are only constrained by the limits of your own imagination. And it is all absolutely delicious; I have never heard a negative comment and routinely get rave reviews and requests for the recipe. Thank you Anita!!! You must be brilliant!"

I mistakenly used one small jar of artichokes instead of the 12 oz. and even though it was good, more artichokes would have been better - I'll pay more attention to the size of ingredients next time!! \nI did mix the parm with some breadcrumbs to sprinkle on top and they browned up nicely and gave the mushrooms a nice little crunch.\nI also used fresh garlic vs. garlic salt - tasted and adjusted with a little salt and pepper"

We had a few left, as only 3 of us 5 like mushrooms, so I am going to chop them up, add to the leftover filling, thin with a little cream or milk and toss with pasta. Doesn't that sound good?

I baked the stuffed mushrooms for 35 minutes instead of just 20; this ensured tap hat the mushrooms were cooked and the filling was plenty hot. Overall I give the Recioe 4 stars for a good start on flavor; the texture is a bit off (without the tweaks) as its just mushy. I will make them again and will sprinkle the tops with bread crumb. Thanks Chicago--Anita for sharing this flavorful recipe."

Put filling in both small phylo cups and mushrooms; mushrooms were much better than the cups as the filling is actually kind of bland. 1/2 batch made enough for 8 med/big mushrooms and 12 cups. I will be making these again, but I'll add some herbs, more S&amp;P, and use the right chokes. Could even see some lemon, maybe a bit of crumbled sausage, or as another reviewer suggested, spinach would be good addition.This is a good base that provides a nice springboard for going in several different directions."
