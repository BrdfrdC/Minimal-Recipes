Thanks for the recipe. It is now in a place of honor in my new 'regular rotation\"."

"reviewBody": "Good base recipe, but I did make some changes to make it more flavorful. As is, the artichokes are not the centerpiece and it is not pretty to look at in the dish-- kind of grey and bound together by the cheese which was added too early and clumps everything up. I added more flour to make it a little thicker, used homemade chicken stock in place of canned, added pepper, whole,cream top milk in place of half in half, and twice as many artichokes (and used the juice in place of some of the stock so you wouldn't waste the artichoke flavor.) I also put the cheese in last as other reviewers did to not have it be such an integrated dish. Finally, I put about three big handfuls of baby spinach in the bottom of the pasta dish and put the final, hot noodles with sauce over that and then gently folded the spinach (now wilted) in. Worked great and added a bit of freshness to a pretty heavy dish. (You should also not cook the linguini until tender, since once you put it in the hot sauce it will overcook. I kept my linguini very al dente and let the sauce cook it the rest of the way.)This is very rich so I'd serve it with something acidic, like a tomato or fruit salad with nothing cheesy or creamy on on the salad."

My chicken broth was my homemade broth using the carcass of Roast Sticky Chicken from this site, so it had all that added flavor (but that's mostly what I use--never the canned stuff). Otherwise, I followed the recipe. My hubby wants this again tomorrow. No problem with that! There are only the two of us, and this makes a lot! But it was really delicious!"

If I make it again, I will cut back significantly on all the liquids. I'll reserve the cheese, toss the sauce with the noodles, put them in a casserole dish, top with the cheese and bake until it's melty and the liquid has thickened."

I almost left out the artichoke marinade, fearing it would make it too thin but I'm so glad I did not. The sauce is a bit thin even with the lesser quantity of chicken broth but the flavor is fabulous and I don't mind at all! This is one of the best recipes I have tried off this site!"

I add a little garlic, more mushrooms, and a lot more dried thyme than the recipe calls for - at least a 1/2 tsp. if not more. I think the extra thyme flavor really stands up well next to the artichoke marinade and parm cheese flavors. Finally, I like to use shorter pasta instead of linguine."

"reviewBody": "After reading the reviews, I decided to add a few things to this to make it a little more flavorful. First, I added about 1/2 cup of sundried tomatoes, and a bit more artichokes than it called for. Then, I added some cut up chicken breast (2 pieces) - which I sauteed in garlic and olive oil. I used fresh thyme instead of dried, and used about 1 tablespoon instead of what the recipe called for. I also tried using both portobello and shitake mushrooms - but the shitake were far better. Lastly, instead of adding the parmesan, when the dish was finished and on the plate, I added a slice of goat cheese to the top. It's really rich and creamy, melts slightly into the pasta, and is soooooo good."
