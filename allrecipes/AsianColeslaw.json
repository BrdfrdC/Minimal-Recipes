Chopped peanut would have been good too. Still using up my fall cabbage harvest so will definitely make again."

I used bagged cabbage mix and broccoli slaw. I also added some mandarin oranges which added sweet flavor and some avocado (I love avocados). Since this wasn’t for a party, I put the salad in a bowl and only added a few tablespoons of dressings. It was yummy. I can make more as I desire and the dressing will last a few days in the fridge. Great recipe. Thanks."

(You have to go down to teaspoons for peanut butter (5 tsp), ginger (2 tsp) and garlic (1.5 tsp). I was trying to use up a half head of red cabbage, which ended up being about 3 cups shredded. I added shredded carrots &amp; thinly sliced Vidalia onion, and dressed it with the amount of dressing I made, which turned out to be the perfect amount. Topped it off with salted sunflower seeds. Very tasty! The red slaw has a heavier presence, so next time, I’ll try the recipe as written with the green cabbage."

"reviewBody": "We loved this! The dressing we made as written the first time. The second time I added an extra tablespoon and half of white wine vinegar. We had to change the base of the slaw, because we had cabbage in the garden that needed harvesting. We used all regular cabbage. I shredded the carrots (adding one extra, because I love carrots). We used walking onions because that’s what is growing now. \nThis is an excellent base recipe, you can play with. We added black sesame seeds and peanuts to the first batch. Exceptional! We added roasted chicken to the second batch. It was really good too. (I liked the peanuts better than the chicken)\nWe did not add the dressing the greens. We added it as we made our salads. One of us likes less, one likes more. This way the leftovers the next day are as good On day two, as day one. Thank you to the author for sharing, this is now my favorite slaw."

Also, 2 T. fresh ginger is SO potent, I used 1/8 tsp ginger powder, it was plenty. Also cut oil in half, didn't miss it, the dressing still DELISH! Dressing so strong and saucy that I had to add a couple more cups cabbage than called for, plus some shredded pork to soak it all up. Next time I'll reduce to 2/3 the dressing amount, and I'll go with HALF the suggested fresh garlic. SUCH A FUN, UNIQUE FLAVOR FOR A SLAW, I'LL MAKE AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!! THANKS for enlivening my kitchen tonight! :)"

"reviewBody": "Bagged Cole slaw works perfectly for this. If you add the dressing right before serving it this will be crispy. But if you add the dressing and let it chill for several hours you will get the right texture for slaw! Addding vinegar to cabbage makes it shrink ( you won't have several quarts of it, as one reviewer you're complained!) and give off its liquids. the easiest way to make the dressing is in a small food processor or blender.\n\nWe love serving this as a side dish with Asian style pork ribs!"

As with most slaws, it doesn't keep very long with the dressing mixed in because it gets soggy (but still tastes great). If I knew that we would be eating on it for a couple of days I might keep the dressing separate. One thing I did different with the dressing was to add half the oil and I added both vegetable oil and sesame oil. This salad would be great with the crunchy Chinese noodles, add some chicken, almonds or sesame seeds...lots of possibilities!"

"reviewBody": "I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I pair it with the Asian chicken thighs recipe from this site. I sub the thighs for chicken breast, let it marinate overnight, broil to cook, boil the remaining sauce for two minutes and add some corn starch to thicken then use the sauce to baste while cooking and finally toss the cooked chicken in remaining sauce. I cut into chunks and let chill. I make this awesome slaw dressing and mix that with bagged cabbage, the chicken, red pepper, green onion and top with wonton strips! A little of this dressing goes a long way. Absolute heaven!"

Decreased the oil by 1 tablespoon.\nWe enjoyed this and also had it the next day. I didn't think it was too wilted as others have stated. I did add more shredded veg to the dressing than the recipe called for...maybe that made the difference. Will make again."

I used half measurements of the dressing ingredients and made the following substitutions: peanut butter for cashew butter (that's what I had at the time); added 2 tablespoons of Mirin sauce; squeezed a large half lemon at the end. The cashew butter turned out to be a great substitute as it is more neutral on the palette and allows for all the other flavors to come through. The sprinkle of lemon juice at the end also lightened up the taste. My husband and I ate it served on tortilla chips..."

They are a bit spicy, so hubby puts more on than me. We have not changed the dressing as we really like it as is. I do use olive oil because I don't buy vegetable oil. Give it a try and if you need a time saver the broccoli slaw you can buy in produce department is so delicious and easy to use. I noticed people saying it got mushy the next day. I never put the dressing on the whole salad. We just put it on our individual salads, so we can have it for days. UPDATE: We have been making this so much. Time saver tips we like.. garlic in the jar, ginger paste in a tube, bagged shredded broccoli, and dry rice noodles in a can. Makes prep so fast!"

"reviewBody": "I was emailed this recipe and asked to make this slaw for a family gathering with an Asian food themed dinner. To be honest, I wasn't optimistic. I'm not a fan of traditional slaw. Surprisingly, this slaw with its amazing peanut, ginger, garlic dressing was out of this world and has become a staple in our home. My picky rarely-veggie-eating daughter loves it so I couldn't be more pleased as I struggle to help her eat well. I generally make twice the amount of dressing and sometimes wrap the salad in spring roll wrappers and Miss Picky brings them for her lunch. Delicious!"

We use pre-chopped slaw and broccoli slaw, and dice onion to add as well. With these changes we love it. Thank you for a great base recipe!"
