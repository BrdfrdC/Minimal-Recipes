Though it's important to note that after you remove the steaks from the refrigerator, to let them sit and come to room temperature. I didn't know that and following the listed directions I wound up with 2 burned steaks with raw insides. Luckily I had a third steak which by that time had sat out long enough to be cooked properly."

This is one of our “treat” dinners because feeding a family of 6 with teenagers, there never seems to be enough steak! I have to double this every time and we still have zero leftovers."
