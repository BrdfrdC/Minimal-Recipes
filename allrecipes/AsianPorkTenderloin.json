I served it with parmesan risotto, chopped spinach, red onion and minced garlic sauteed in olive oil and a white Rioja -- elegant enough for a nice dinner party and simple and affordable enough for a family dinner. It's going in my permanent recipe file."

"reviewBody": "Turned out outstanding, though I made some major tweaks. I had some serious bourbon barrel-aged soy sauce on deck, so I halved the amount to account for its 1.5 grams of sodium per Tbsp. To make up for the liquid I used the juice of half a navel orange as well as its zest. I also included an inch of fresh ginger. The ginger makes it--do not skimp. I marinated for about 18 hours. The acid from the OJ worked wonders and created a very, very tender result.\n\nI highly recommend going at a lower temperature in the oven. I did 350 for 40 minutes, and it was absolutely perfect. However, I only gave the roast a bit of the marinade to keep it moist in the oven and used the rest to make a sauce thickened with slurried flour, which was dynamite. I also recommend adding the leftover pan drippings to the sauce while the meat rests. \n\nServed alongside Lemongrass, ginger, garlic rice with green onions lime added. Excellent and simple meal with minor prep."

"reviewBody": "I didn't care for the flavor of this sauce--I believe the sesame oil overpowered the other flavors, even though I did reduce the amount as others suggested. The ingredients seemed to be conflicting with each other for flavor, rather than blending (perhaps the Worcestershire sauce was also at issue). I reduced the heat as others suggested and used a thermometer to heat it to 145 degrees, which did produce a very juicy and perfectly cooked tenderloin. I wouldn't make this recipe again, but if I did I would use just a bit of sesame oil and probably omit the Worcestershire sauce. I also believe the amount of sauce it makes was more than needed for the size of the tenderloin given."

For vegan tofu, just use vegan Worcestershire sauce, slice pressed tofu into cubes, marinate for an hour, bake at same temp, for same time as pork. I made the pork for my husband and tofu for me."

It wasn‚Äôt too sweet but I still think I might cut back on the brown sugar a bit...we like spicy. The pork was so juicy, we marinated for 2 days. We also cooked down the marinade since it had raw meat in it so we could use it as a sauce for the pork and rice. We made a garlic bok Choy dish on the side and it all went well together. Sharing this recipe and definitely making again!"

I substituted two packets of Splenda for the necessary sweetness and that worked well. It may have caramelized better with the brown sugar, but it still produced a rich, thick and delicious sauce. I served it with roasted broccoli and Asian sesame ginger slaw. Thanks for a great recipe. This one‚Äôs a keeper for sure!"

I knew I wanted to use the marinade, but I also knew I didn't want to use this cooking method, so I used a 2# pork sirloin-tip roast, marinated for a few days (not my choice, it just happened) and cooked it using the High Heat method. 20minuites in 500 degrees and it was perfection. I almost always use the high heat method with pork because it's perfection...I only gave the 4 star because I didn't follow the receipt exactly, YUMM! Try it's sooo good."

"reviewBody": "Excellent meal - I made it just as suggested other than I put everything in a one gallon zip loc bag to marinate instead of using a pan. Using heavy foil to line a casserole dish when baking it meant I had zero clean up too ;-) Sauce was excellent and meat was flavorful and very tender. Looked pretty enough for company, but easy enough for any day. I marinated it about 8 hours (I've found too long in the marinade can make a pork tenderloin mushy so I watch the time now). I cooked it a bit longer than suggested (maybe my tenderloin was thicker than most?) so I suggest being a little flexible in your cooking time. Meat sliced and held together well, so presentation was picture perfect also. I can see this sliced and arranged on a platter with sauce on top at a buffet or holiday meal - it really is a very pretty dish!"

"reviewBody": "This was quite good especially for a last minute weeknight dinner. I would actually award 4.5 stars. It marinaded for approximately an hour. I made the sauce using minced shallots and Siracha chili sauce as that's what I had on hand. My tenderloin was not 2# so I adjusted the cooking time accordingly. I did not read the previous reviews so I'm sure some of my points have been addressed. Much of the sauce burned on the aluminum foil roasting at 450*. Next time, I will double the marinade/sauce and add ginger. In half the sauce, I will marinate the pork then use the sauce for basting the pork while roasting instead of roasting in the sauce. With the other half of the sauce I will add sauteed mushrooms and reduce to about 1/2 to serve tableside as a sauce. I will also roast at 400* instead of 450*. All in all, this was a really good recipe that just needs some adjustment for our personal preference. Thank you for a great recipe."

"reviewBody": "I made this twice, second time with 3 tablespoons of honey instead of brown sugar, marinating it for about 6 hours and grilling it. This recipe turned out better than the first time, and the first time was a 4.5 out of 5 stars. We have a gas grill with 3 burners. I heated the grill to its max, turned off the back burner while keeping the front two on high. By placing the pork over the non-lit burner in the back and turning frequently, it created a nice browned crust which kept the juices in. I then turned down the front two burners to medium high and grilled the pork until juices ran clear when pressed. After removing pork from grill, I let it rest for a few minutes before slicing. The flavor was spectacular and the pork was moist and tender."

The only thing different that I did was to roast the tenderloin in a hot oven-450 degrees on an aluminum foiled baking pan for 13-14 minutes. It came out perfect with a pink center. The leftovers were just as good the next day too. Thank you for the recipe!"

Otherwise the sauce was made as written. I did cook it at 325 for about 85 minutes. I had two 1 lb tenderloins and drizzled some marinade over the meat for cooking and heated the rest with 1/2 tsp cornstarch to serve with the meal. It didn‚Äôt make a lot of sauce but was enough to spoon over the slices and the brown rice we had with it. The meat was moist and tender and my husband especially loved the sauce. This recipe is a keeper!"

I did lower the amount of oil and used EVOO, used Asian chili sauce from chain (Buffalo) Wing Shop instead of paste, and altered the time/temp, as follows: covered w/foil and cooked at 400 deg for 30 min, checked the temp, kept it covered but lowered to 375 and cooked for another 15 min, then uncovered for 15 min. DEFINITELY line your baking pan/dish with foil! I reserved some of the marinade before putting the pork in a zipper bag and used that to coat the stir fry veggies (green beans, baby carrots, red bell) and ramen noodles that I served with the. tenderloin. Sooo good, will make again for sure --thank you for the recipe : )"

"reviewBody": "It's delicious. I did change the chili paste for Sirachia sauce and used regular chicken broth not low sodium. I did not add any salt as called for. Also, could not buy a pork tenderloin but used a rolled pork loin. I highly recommend roasting it at 325F for 80-90mins. This will make it incredibly tender! It literally melted in my mouth. You MUST use light soy sauce, otherwise the regular soy sauce is too salty. At the end of roasting, the marinade was greatly reduced. You can put the marinade in a pan on the stovetop, whisk in some flour or corn starch, add mushrooms to make a gravy. Needed to let the mushrooms cook, about 20 minutes in the gravy sauce, stirring frequently. \n Absolutely delicious!!! Thank you for the wonderful recipe."
