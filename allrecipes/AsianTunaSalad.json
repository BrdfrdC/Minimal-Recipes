I ended up making power bowls with mine on top of sesame kale and quinoa, then I drizzled some Sriracha over the top and ate it with some avocado slices. Absolutely delicious!"

I adjusted the recipe to 2 portions but I’m not sure it worked OK because I ended up with one portion. Next time I will put a little more of everything per tuna can."

I have made it several times, I only made one small change as I did not have chile paste (Not sure what chile it is, but I live in Mexico, and the first time I made it I used I small canned Chipotle peper, cut up very fine, with a bit of the paste it is in, and it was delicious, so I make that substitution. I also have used the same sauce for other saldas. The combination is just really really tasty."

He is very keen to stick with his favorite recipes, so when I embarked on a mission to deliver a much different tuna salad, he was hesitant! However, the asian flair really works here, it was delicious. I found myself just eating it out of the bowl. Thank you for the wonderful combo!"

"reviewBody": "11.30.19 This one’s certainly “outside the box” for tuna salad, but man, does it work. Liked everything about this. Not so sure I’d like it on a tuna salad sandwich, but it was delicious served as an appetizer on Trader Joe’s Rosemary Fig crackers. And I certainly could see a scoop on fresh salad greens for lunch. This will be frequently making its way onto my summer menu when we have a lot of salad plates for dinner. If you have time, put it in the fridge for a couple hours, as I think the flavor even improves. This has been on the site for a while, and I’m so glad I finally found it. In a word, this is “tantalizing!”"

I accidentally left the soy sauce out on first batch and figured out I liked it better that way and I am not a fan of ginger so I never include that in my recipes. I used 2 small cans of tuna with the same measurements the recipe calls for."

I followed the directions as was written and I ate mine on an English muffin with lettuce and toasted. My husband ate his on toasted white bread with lettuce. He loved it also. The only thing I would do different next time is add lemon zest and lemon juice. I think that would add a nice fresh flavor to it. I have a lot left over so I may go ahead and add the lemon zest and juice to it now."
