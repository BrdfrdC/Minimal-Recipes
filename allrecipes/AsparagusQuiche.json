I did have to alter and add two more eggs and one more cup of milk (had run out of half and half) in order to fill the pies to my liking (one of the extra eggs was the yolk and left over egg white after I brushed the unbaked pie shells). I found that baking for 35 minutes was a tad too long for my oven, but the end result was a golden, delicious quiche that my whole family enjoyed. I will make this again."

For that reason, I didn’t bother pre-cooking my asparagus whatsoever, and it came out just the way I like it. The only change I’d make in the future would be to switch out the cheese type. Swiss is cool and all, but I thought this quiche could benefit from a nice Gruyere and more pepper (my fault). Like some of the other reviewers, I kept 4 or 5 asparagus spears intact for decoration on the top. Having those bigger chunks of veg really helped this dish, and I’d suggest y’all do that with your quiche. ??"

This was done because I didn't care for the fresh which were either shoe string or huge and I felt would effect the consistency. The frozen worked great and saved me work since they came precut. It was a hit!"

"reviewBody": "I used this recipe as a base, which means I have to give it five stars or it just isn't fair! I substituted the bacon for 1 cup of canned duck confit (just the meat - the rest will be used used for other decadent purposes), and the Swiss cheese for a Boursin cream cheese that I needed to use. I used two store bought crusts, overlapped a bit in a glass pie plate to make one crust. I baked the egg-white brushed crust for 10 minutes at 450, then allowed it to cool for 10 minutes. The ingredients for the recipe made one perfect deep-dish quiche, filled to the brim but not overflowing. Simple but yummy."

I drizzled it with olive oil and roasted it for a few minutes in the oven, before putting it in the pie shell. I baked the frozen pie crust for just a few minutes before adding the filling. I didn't bother with brushing it with egg white. I used 2 extra large eggs and 3/4 cup half and half. Next time, I might use three eggs to fill the shell a little more."

I did make one change that another of the reviewers recommended; I sauteed the asparagus in the bacon grease rather than steaming. I also used Wright's Bourbon Barrel Bacon which gave it a little different flavor. Next time I make it, I don't plan on adding the salt before cooking it; with the bacon in there, it was super salty. I will definitely make it again though!"

In the same skillet that I fried the bacon in after pouring off some of the drippings, I sauteed some onion, along with the asparagus and a clove of minced garlic. One quiche I added a small can of mushrooms the other I didn't as my son doesn't like mushrooms but the rest of us do. They were both delicious. A lot more flavor than steaming the asparagus. The recipe made 2 beautiful &amp; delicious quiches."

Those two ingredients are pretty important in a quiche and I totally get that different people like different amounts but asking someone to \"salt to taste\" in a baked egg recipe is very frustrating for the cook. I cook a LOT and I still sometimes get it wrong. I can't imagine being an amateur cook with that kind of direction."

I also added some garlic powder, onion powder, spicy mustard and cayenne pepper to the egg mixture. I was short on egg mixture, and had to beat two extra. Perhaps I had small eggs? Whatever the case, excellent base recipe; you can easily swap out ingredients for new quiches."

I add tarragon to all egg dishes and a bit of cayenne. Only had lactose-free whole milk but it worked fine!

I added the roasted tomato, cut into good sized chunks, on the top the last 5-10 minutes of baking. Also, did not have any bacon on hand so I substituted with prosciutto. Finally, I added just a touch of dried thyme to the egg mixture. Awesome!"

First: we are doing low carb around here so I went crustless :) second: we always cook our bacon in the oven at 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes so since we love roasted asparagus and the oven was heated up already I roasted the asparagus for 5 minutes instead of steaming and then cut it into 1/2 inch pieces. Also, as much as I like cream and half 'n half all I had in the house was 2% milk and truly, that worked just fine, evaporated milk would be okay too I bet. Next time I make this I will saute and add finely chopped onions. My daughter would like to see some ham added in with the bacon! Also, I did the whole thing in a pyrex casserole dish instead of pie plates for 38 minutes. Really tasty. Thank you Michele!"

It went over real big, and this morning there is only one piece left. I didn't have enough Swiss cheese so I finished off with mild brick. Next time I'll be sure to use all sharper Swiss. I also didn't have bacon for it, and I think it would have been better yet with it. I used whole milk because I didn't have half and half (can you tell I didn't plan to make this?). I might have put too many eggs in it - I put 5 eggs plus the yolk from the egg white. I can see not making it with the crust because I really wasn't noticing the crust. Be careful - I think I cooked it too long - about 40 minutes. I really didn't make changes - I modified to keep from going to the store:) Great recipe, and thanks so much for sharing."
