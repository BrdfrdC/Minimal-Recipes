It is the most delicious fudge and the easiest by far that I've ever made. I have read the reviews and tried the suggestions of others and it bit me in the behind. The recipe is perfect as it's written. In fact the only times it didn't come out perfectly was when I changed it. This is a great recipe and I appreciate Kelly for sharing it so that others can enjoy it."

"reviewBody": "This fudge has an amazing taste. However, in answer to \"the most helpful critical review\", I took your advice and cooked mine for 6 minutes, and it came out overcooked, hard, crumbly, and does not stick together (the attached image is after I cut out 8 good pieces - all the rest broke apart - and the white lumps are mini-marshmallows I added which helped salvage it a bit). I regret not following the original instructions, since I used up my not-cheap ingredients. :-( Tastes really good, though. Next time I'll go by the instructions. Everyone's stove is different, since I notice others have also said their fudge didn't set in the fridge (and someone said theirs didn't turn out creamy) I think I'd rather have fudge that is too soft than crumbly."

"reviewBody": "This recipe makes a lot of fudge, as others have said. Very rich fudge. A little too rich, and in an 8x8 pan, the portions are very thick/tall. I could only eat a very small piece. Next time, I will use a 9x13 pan. From other reviews, I was concerned the fudge might not set, so increased the boiling time to 7 minutes. The fudge set perfectly, no refrigeration needed, but wasn't as creamy as I anticipated. Next time, either I'll reduce the boiling time to 6 1/2 minutes and/or boil more gently instead of a full boil. As the motto says, \"Practice makes perfect.\" I believe this recipe will help you achieve fudge \"perfection\" with a little experimentation."

Flavor is great, and consistency is great.\nI also like that it makes a smaller batch.\n\nOne thing I've had an issue with is these recipes all seem to call for removing your pan from the heat, and then stirring in the chips until they're melted and the mixture is smooth. That just doesn't happen with me. It NEVER completely melts the chocolate chips. This time I heated the chips in the microwave while boiling the other ingredients. I use a candy thermometer, so I know I'm at the right temp, but doesn't stay hot long enough to melt the chips.\n\nLobstah"

If air dried, it gives a consistency and slight off-taste of a stale marshmallow. Not the traditional fudge recipe I was looking for, but not bad. It’s a decent alternative to traditional fudge."

No, that’s not a real store as far as I know.\n\nI went out on a limb and made a double batch and it was still perfect! I took the advice of reviewers and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup per recipe, and I cut the butter down by 1T per recipe.\n\nTwo early reviewers suggested boiling it for 6.5 minutes and another recommended using a candy thermometer to verify that the fudge achieved soft ball stage. I did both and found that 6.5 minutes was just right.\n\nI highly recommend this recipe. I’ll definitely be making it again."

You have to wait to start timing for five minutes as soon as it comes to a rolling boil, stir constantly, don't use generic marshmallow creme, and have your chips and nuts etc ready to mix in right away. I use a full bag of Ghirardelli milk chocolate and half a bag of Ghirardelli semi sweet chips, they are much better than the cheaper ones. It's THE best fudge I have ever made or tasted."

Toasting the walnuts before putting them in the fudge released a warmer nutty flavor and crisped the walnuts so that it made the fudge even more amazing, and offset some of the sweetness.\n\nI put the nuts in a pie plate and put them in 300 oven for 20 minutes, or until very fragrant. Don't let them go all the way to black, but a nice dark brown is ok."

Used all name brand products. Everything was measured out and ready to go. Started the recipe out on low heat, stirring occasionally. Once I saw small bubbles appearing I increased the heat to medium until I decided what I thought was a rolling boil (patience is a virtue here), Do not rush this step. Set a timer for 6.5 minutes and stirred consistently until timer went off. Removed from heat and added the chocolate. Stirred until smooth and then added the vanilla and nuts. I inverted the Semi sweet and milk chocolate in the recipe since I prefer dark chocolate. P.s. I am a novice cook."

So I followed this recipe to the T but after all set and done, I read a couple of reviews and I didn't bring it up to a rigorous boil! I was freaking out thinking it would not set and it would be an epic fail. But Oh my oh my! IT IS SOLID, IT IS CREAMY, AND IT IS OH SOOO GOOODD! \nI kept a constant stir throughout the whole process, had an even heat for 5 mins. when set in the pan, I kept it out till it reached room temp and then set in the fridge. hubby is going to freak! It really tastes better than all the fudge I have bought at the boardwalks!"

I have been looking for a Rocky road fudge &amp; couldn’t find one that suited me. So I altered this recipe as I knew I had liked it before altering it. \n\nThese changes did not alter the texture, its creamy &amp; melts in your mouth."

Simply place the marshmallow in with the chocolate.\n(I do micro the fluff for 20 seconds to help it get out of the jar, and I also slightly micro the chocolate.)\n\nYou can use less butter. 1 to 2 tablespoons max.\n\nYou can vary the type of chocolate. I like even amounts of semi and milk chocolate.\n\nHere's where most people go wrong. You need to bring the milk and sugar to a slow, very slow, boil. People are putting the burner too hot. (med is the max you should use) and/or boiling it too long.\nWhen the mixture begins to boil, (a few bubbles) start the 5-minute timer. I check the temp with a good digital thermometer. When it hits 230 degrees Fahrenheit lower the burner heat to low. \n\nI slightly heat the milk first and slowly add the sugar. I stir constantly. My fudge comes out perfect every time."

I cooked it for 5 min 30 seconds. Used only the name brand marshmallow fluff and choc chips. Had everything pre measured out and ready to add and stir. My last step was the choc chips and it instantly became stiff and crumbly and dry. Pretty much inedible and super dry. I am not a novice baker and have made plenty of fudge. Pretty upset at a waste of time and money *sigh* Perhaps if i had started off with the marshmallow creme in the pan right away but i dont know :("

"reviewBody": "After looking for that perfect fudge recipes over the years, I finally stopped when I found this one. As far as I’m concerned, Aunt Teen is an expert in fudge making. I estimate I’ve made this recipe at *least* 25 times, and each time it has turned out delicious. I follow the recipe exactly as written, but I use quality ingredients, a heavier pot and a wooden spoon. Also have all of your ingredients ready, because you have to stir this constantly on med-low heat so it doesn’t scorch. Wait for it to get to a moderate rolling boil, then start timing your 5 minutes, otherwise it can be too soft. The ratio of milk chocolate to semi sweet is perfect (and for those who say it’s too sweet..it’s fudge..it’s supposed to be sweet!). I do store it in the fridge, because it is a softer, creamier type of fudge (some reviewers have suggested cooking it an extra minute or two, but I’m afraid that might make it dry). I cut it in 1 inch by 1 inch pieces and keep it covered with plastic wrap. Whenever I have a chocolate craving, this stuff satisfies perfectly, especially around Christmas. I compare all fudge to this recipe—including stores who make it and sell it, and most of them don’t compare to this stuff. Aunt Teen—you rock!"
