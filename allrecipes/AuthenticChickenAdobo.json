The first time I didn't have annatto powder so I subbed for sweet blend tumeric (it has lots of cinnamon in it which added a special magic to the flavor and not to mention it made it smell even better, if you can believe that) and paprika. This time around I found annatto powder and I still added the sweet blend tumeric because I couldn't live without it. Absolutely wonderful and it was an instant hit at home. Thank you. :)"

McCormick now has ground annatto (Achiote Molido), so it's a little easier to find in larger grocery stores. The second time I made it I used reduced sodium soy sauce, and it definitely cut down on the saltiness from when I originally tried the recipe but kept the same great flavor. This one's a keeper!"

"reviewBody": "I am making this recipe for the second time. It's great! Since annatto is a coloring (and I couldn't find it), I substituted a little turmeric. Last time I made it with chicken, this time I mixed pork and chicken and used a slow cooker. It was also wonderful! Since you end up with a ton of sauce, I thickened it with cornstarch at the very end and served it over UNSALTED rice. The sauce is quite salty (guess you could use low-salt soy). It's a very satisfying dish with flavor combinations I am familiar with in marinades but yet, with the vinegar, it turns out to be a very different taste experience...one that we loved! Oh...I wish I could find coconut vinegar but read other adobo recipes and used apple cider vinegar; again, delicious."
