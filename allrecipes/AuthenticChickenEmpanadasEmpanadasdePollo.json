"reviewBody": "My wife and I absolutely loved these. For the shredded chicken, I cooked breasts in a little oil for a couple minutes, flipped and added about a cup of chicken broth, then covered and simmered for 15 or so until the chicken was at 165 degrees. After shredding, I chopped the chicken up pretty fine so it would really mix well with the other ingredients and to make packing easier. For the olives, I diced up green stuffed with pimento which added a fantastic flavor. The Goya brand Sazon con culantro y achiote is a seasoning I had not used before but I'm glad it comes with 8 packs because I will definitely be making this dish again!"

"reviewBody": "This dough is not right. It turned out but it's more like a heavy biscuit dough despite two different leavening agents or perhaps because of them but I suspect the problem is the oil. I expect flakiness from empanada dough. The filling is just meh, certainly not the bang I would expect for the time involved which is NOT a prep time of 35 minutes unless you wield a Gordon Ramsey professional cutting speed which I do not. Was it edible? Yes, which is why it gets two stars rather than one. Would I make it again? No. Also, I saw 5 stars when I decided to make it without checking the amount of reviews (1). Caveat emptor, I won't make that mistake again."
