Couldn't find the mushrooms called for so used a rehydrated shiitake. I added a bit of hoisin and oyster sauce with the low sodium tamari (vs soy). And threw in some chopped cilantro because I had it. Will make these again. I like the way you make everything ahead of time, so it makes dinner appear simple. Thank you for a fantastic recipe!"

Deep fried the first 6 but changed gears halfway through and pan fried the rest instead. Doing so absorbed less grease and we liked the texture better. It also cooked quicker! Would absolutely make again! Personal preference; next time would add onions, garlic and ginger. Still delicious and husband and I enjoyed very much! Thank you!"

These egg rolls were delicious also! (I did want to note that when we were traveling in China, the people did not know what egg rolls are. Either way, thank you for the recipe!)"

"reviewBody": "Great recipe; five stars! There were a few obvious omissions in the directions: cabbage, 1/2 carrot, bamboo shoots, and dried mushrooms need to be shredded or sliced thinly. I used Savoy, or Napa, cabbage, but as a time saver, packaged cole slaw mix can be used. Also, soak Dehydrated mushrooms in hot water until rehydrated before adding to wok. (I just microwaved them in a glass measuring cup with twice the water, then drained them well.) Also, drain finished filling before chilling. I find using Chinese barbecue pork is delicious in this recipe, but to save time, ground pork is a time saver and is also quite good."

I used the 'lumpia' wrappers as we (and they) like the thin, crispy shell. These eggrolls were absolutely delectable and the varied assortment of veggies, mushrooms with the Chinese bbq pork blended into a very tasty medley. My daughter said they were the best eggrolls I have ever made. We served them with a blend of rice vinegar with a touch of balsalmic vinegar for dipping which are friends loved. Thanks again!"

"reviewBody": "Wow. Just wow. I've been on a kick of trying recipes I never thought I would be able to do right, and this turned out incredible. I downsized the filling to cabbage, bean sprouts, and carrot (all I had in the house), cooked and in oil and soy sauce and fried as directed. Watch the video for making this recipe on the site -- it will INFINITELY make rolling your egg rolls (and possibly other dishes) much easier. My local restaurants charge $6-7 for an order of 4 egg rolls ... never again will I pay that, as this recipe was just as good or better, and at a fraction of the cost. My boyfriend and I intended to make it as an appetizer, and we just put away the entree and ate this as our whole meal. Can't wait to try it with other variations, next time with the mushrooms and green onions in the original recipe! Thanks Mendy!"

"reviewBody": "This is the closest recipe to the one my Vietnamese mother in law has been making for fifty years. She even admitted that the egg is her secret ingredient but that she just scrambles the one egg she uses instead of three into the entire egg roll mixture instead of making the 'pancake' and cutting it up. Also, it's important to remove the stems from the mushrooms after rehydrating them as they are very hard to get soft enough and stay very woody. We also give everything a fine chop not just julienned, carrots shredded. When sealing the rolls, we usually just use cornstarch and water but the egg white worked well. We also use peanut oil for frying so I recommend that if allergies aren't an issue. These egg rolls were full of flavor and the only suggestion to the seasoning is a teaspoon of rice wine vinegar and a teaspoon of sesame oil in place of one teaspoon of soy sauce. Strain the oil and store in the fridge and it can be reused for the same purpose several times."

This is a delicious recipe with all the tastes and texture we want in a good egg roll. I think the time the mixture sits in the fridge to cool, really helps to meld those favors. We have tried many different recipes over the years, but this is the keeper now! It's very good!! Thanks so much for posting a family recipe, and allowing us to enjoy it. :)"

"reviewBody": "The recipe was strictly average, as tasty as spring rolls typically are but nothing out of the ordinary. As for the person who questions the presence of MSG in a 300 year old recipe, you're right... mostly. Crystalline MSG was not invented until the early 20th century, when a Japanese researcher isolated it from konbu seaweed, but the compound is nothing but the sodium salt of glutamate, one of the most common naturally-occurring amino acids (sorry about the chemistry lecture). Soy, tomatoes, seaweed, and many other foods are rich in glutamates, too. So yes, you are right. Ms. Ling's ancestors did not whip out the Accent to make spring rolls, but the salt may have been a stand-in or substitute for another glutamate-containing ingredient. It's as anachronistic as using powdered citric acid as a substitute for lemon juice. I have a harder time believing that a person who lived 300 years ago would have used that much oil (a very, very expensive ingredient) to fry up something to go with tea."

I used the smallest cabbage I could find, 1 large carrot, and left out the mushrooms and MSG. This recipe only used 1/2 a package of wrappers, so I had to throw the rest away :( Also, the package said to use a mixture of flour &amp; water to seal the egg rolls, so I did that instead of using the egg white. And 4 cups of oil isn't really necessary-just use enough to cook about 4 egg rolls at once. These were so tasty (especially with a homemade sweet &amp; sour sauce on the side) and leftovers were easily re-crisped in the oven :)"

Also, I fried the entire batch of egg rolls in about 1/4 inch of oil...it isn't necessary to fry them in 6 inches of oil! I just kept slowly turning them in the oil; they cook very quickly so check on them often. I used unseasoned cooked chicken breast instead of barbequed or roast pork and omitted the MSG, but added a little black pepper--the flavor turned out great."

Next time, I'd add some hoisin sauce or some type of a smoky/bbq flavoring if using chicken. Left out the MSG (absolutely no need for this preserving ingredient, I'd think!), AND, didn't fry them.. but rather, baked at 400 for about 15-20 minutes - until golden. Just make sure to spray the baking sheet with oil and also to spray the tops of the eggrolls with oil. Such an easy, healthy (when baked!), eggroll recipe! No need for any sauce, but I bet a sweet and sour would be quite yummy. :)"
