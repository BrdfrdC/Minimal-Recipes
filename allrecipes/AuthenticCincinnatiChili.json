"reviewBody": "This was a very strange chilie recipe considering where I live (New Mexico). I am originally from Ohio and wanting to make something more Ohio-ish for the Super Bowl I thought I would feature a Skyline Chilie aka: Cincinnati chilie bar to honor the Bengals. I boiled the meat in low sodium Beef bone broth and removed 98% of the fat. I used about 1/2 tsp. ground allspice and cloves because who wants to bite into an whole clove or allspice berry? Not me! I then put it in the Slow Cooker for 3 hours. When it looked a little dry, I threw in some beer. OMG I think I now have a third style of chili to add to my lineup! It was delicious on spaghetti, hot dogs and the NM staple; Frito Pie! Thank you for sharing this recipe!"

The flavor was amazing and the kids all gave it 5 stars. The only trouble I had was that I doubled the recipe and seemed to end up with too much liquid. The result was that it took me a bit longer to cook it down. Never had Cincinnati chili before but it is on the remake list at our house."

I boiled the ground beef in the morning then refrigerated it about 4 hrs then scraped the grease off the top. Although I love the idea of getting rid of the grease, I think I should leave a little on for flavor and to stick to the spaghetti better. It makes the house smell great as it cooks. The onions shouldn't be added in as you cook it. They should be served raw on top."

"reviewBody": "Wanting Cincinnati chili similar to one a regional chain in MD and VA (!) serves, this recipe seemed the best. Hint: after adding water to the beef in the pan, an old fashioned “squiggly” potato masher makes the beef VERY finely chopped very quickly.\n\nTwo small changes for next time: 1) The clove flavor was a bit too strong, although I folllowed the ground clove to whole clove equivalent and even subtracted a bit. 1/8 tsp. should equal about one clove, and I multiplied by 4 instead of 5. Still too much. And 2) no need to keep the ground beef in the frig overnight - just until any fat rises to the top, which is then very easy to “peel” off with a spoon or spatula. All in all a really nice dish. Will make it a bunch. Oh - and I added about 1.5 tsps of brown sugar like some others."

Cincinnati / Skyline Chili has a unique and different flavor and no, it's not for everyone. But please don't give this a bad review because it's not like 'regular/normal' chili!

After I boiled the ground beef, I used my immersion blender to obtain the fine consistency. Followed the recipe exactly, but didn't have whole allspice or cloves so use ground instead. Piled on top of spaghetti, with raw chopped onions and a huge pile of very finely shredded cheddar cheese, this is my idea of heaven on a plate. I could eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner! Thanks so much for sharing. Now I don't have to go to Cincy, so it's a win-win."

I'm from Texas, and thought my husband had lost his mind years ago when he came home with a can of skyline chili from a business trip. Well, I liked it enough to search for a recipe and make it at home. I still like my Texas chili, too, don't get me wrong. But sometimes my tummy can't handle the hot spices of a good ole bowl of Texas chili and just wants warm and comfy chili. Like this. We love it!"

It was delicious and very easy (as long as you remember you need to start the evening before to let the meat chill in the refrigerator overnight.) I may try a bit more chocolate and cinnamon next time as the sweet/spiciness ratio was a bit more on the spicy side and I'm curious what upping those two ingredients would taste like. Great recipe!"

I use to have my parents send me spice packets to make Cincinnati chili but decided to take it on myself. This recipe nails it. I have made a few modifications though. I use 90/10 ground beef and skip the skimming. I feel that cooking the meat with the spices helps steep in the flavor. I only use one large onion finely chopped, don't skimp on the garlic, and add a little additional salt. I have also found that tomato paste give a better flavor profile than sauce."

I was reduced to buying cans or frozen (expensive and not as good!) Until I found this. I've tried other versions, and honestly this comes closest. \n This recipe is so close that I make a double batch, and freeze half. The kids can heat some up for Coney's whenever they want, and I can get my 4-way fix.\nI do, after skimming the fat, use my immersion blender to get that extra fine texture.

Think the kids are going to love it. I am a Cincinnati native who has been gone for many many years, and have experimented with many different recipes. I will say that I wasn't expecting much when I boiled the meat as the first step. The approach was much different from other types of cooking I've done. But it worked and was very accurate.\n\nI made the following adjustments:\nDid not skim the fat or let it congeal overnight. \n1 lb ground beef. 1 lb ground lamb.\nForgot the bay leaf.\nAfter initial boil, transferred to a slow cooker and let simmer for 12 hours, then put in fridge overnight to consume the next day. \n\nThis recipe is LEGIT. Yum!"

I browse this site frequently, though truth be told I'm not a devoted follower of any one recipe site. Still, I find myself here frequently, and it's time I shared my gratitude.\n\nFirst of all, I do not claim to be from Cincinnati, nor even the area, so I can't say how 'authentic' this is. I will say I've eaten at Skyline about every time I've been through that town, and I don't know that I would call this their actual recipe (regardless of whatever had previously been printed).\n\nStill, my experience with Cincy style chilis definitely puts this one up there as a regional recipe, there is no doubt. And my modifications did not hurt the overall final product.\n\nI did not see the part about starting it the day before, so that was problem one. Solution? Simple. Brown the meat without the water, drain the fat off, then go right into the onion saute. BE SURE TO ADD MORE WATER LATER, THOUGH. Since I don't know how much of the original quart of H2O remains after a three hour simmer and chilling overnight, I started with half that amount. I think I added another cup later, so three cups total, but please don't quote me on that. Besides, the nice part about this method is, you get to decide how tight or loose you want the chili to be.\n\nOtherwise, I used the ingredients and method down to the T, and it was amazing. I would definitely make this again!"

Makes it easier to separate. Also be sure to pull out the cloves and allspice berries and bay leaf before serving. \n\nI found that one lb of spaghetti wasn't enough for this recipe. make two pounds or cut the recipe in half. And a little bit of beans goes a long way. One or two cans drained and rinsed would be plenty or abt a 1/4 bag of dry beans."

You lose a lot of flavor that way, and there's no health benefit to it (see a plethora of recent research on the lack of a real link between dietary fat and cholesterol and heart disease). \n\nIt needs a bit more of...something. The flavor balance is right, so I think possibly adding half again as much of every flavoring agent, from the spices to the vinegar, would do it."

You can do about whatever you want ,within reason , to Cincy Chili as hometown folks have got their own best method. To enhance the flavor of your Skyline, be sure to boil the ground beef and chill overnight. It makes a difference. For those of you who wanted to know where the beans and veggies were in this chili, you have come to the wrong chili site. Now if someone from Cincy can give me a Goetta recipe, I would be ever grateful.I lost my great grandmother's recipes cards. ( it took 3 cards to get it all down)"

"reviewBody": "Full disclosure: I'm not from Cincinnati, have never been to Cincinnati, nor have I ever had Skyline Chili. However, a diner in Upstate NY offers this dish and it's delicious so I sought out a recipe, ultimately choosing this one. I measured everything to spec with the exception of whole cloves or allspice berries, which I didn't have. I have ground. Several people in the reviews have stated that 1 tsp ground = 5 whole cloves/ berries and that's the measurement I went with. BIG MISTAKE. The clove-taste dominated this dish. Cinnamon? Cayenne? Salt? Could barely taste 'em; it was all cloves, all the time. Despite that, the outcome was still pretty good. My suggestions for improvements: ease up on the clove use when using ground. If you don't have whole cloves, use 1/2 - 3/4 tsp ground. Also, do NOT use 93% ground beef for this as I did. This chili needs some of that delicious fat, so go 85% or lower. This recipe got me on the right track for what I'm looking for so, for that, thank you."

The flavor was great, but after cooking so long it lost some of its taste. I (liberally) added salt and allspice at the 2 hour mark and stopped cooking at 2 1/2 hours. I'm going to experiment with cooking times in the future, but all in all it was a great bowl of Cincinnati chili more comparable to Empress than Goldstar or Skyline in my opinion. Living in San Diego it was nice to be able to make it without relying on the family to send me packets, and the taste was slightly superior to the packets in my opinion."

I used to make this recipe for years when I lived overseas, Jonesing for Skyline. The one big difference I would make here is that you have to break up the ground beef with your hands in cold water BEFORE boiling with spices. That's how you get a really fine texture that Skyline has. And I use more cumin. Also, no point in using lower fat ground beef if you're going to skim. But my Greek father-in-law would never skim anyway. Here's a link to the recipe postcard I used...\nhttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Ous-nx-eKis/SBNT7bCKX7I/AAAAAAAAAGI/y5Md7Ld_YLs/s1600/postcard+cinci.jpg"

Put in enough water to cover the crumbles and let simmer for 15-20 minutes while the remainder of spices were prepared and used half of the spice recommendation since I was only using 12 ounces of crumbles. Use entire spice recommendation if using 2 bags of crumbles. I then let the mixture simmer for 30-40 minutes which boiled off a little bit of the water and made a nice chili texture. Let sit in refrigerator overnight for spices to absorb and served that following evening. Even the non vegetarians loved the VEGETARIAN version. Halving it made 6 filling dishes. If you want to make the VEGAN version of this, leave out the worcheshire sauce (contains anchovies), use diaya vegan cheese, and make sure your pasta is vegan."

I also didn't add water to the meat when cooking it. Instead I had about a quart to all the ingredients once I cooked the meet and transferred over to a bigger pot. Also make sure you keep stirring the chili because otherwise it will burn quick because of the chocolate in it."

"reviewBody": "I went the uber-lazy route and put all ingredients, plus 1 quart of water, in the crockpot, and cooked it on low for about 8 hours. I also used ground turkey instead of ground beef. The flavor is good; however, not boiling off the water made the end result a bit watery. No doubt, it'll be better if I simmer it, uncovered, on the stove for a bit to get rid of that excess water. Otherwise, I'd say its a solid recipe, and this is coming from someone who has been to Skyline Chili MANY times."
