I used 1 lb of bacon and about 8 large red potatoes. I used green onion instead of red onion and I forgot to put sugar in it. I did however only used 1/4 cup of vinegar and I used Goya perfect seasoning instead of salt. I left the potato on the heat until it absorbed all of the sauce. It came out so good. My family loved the potato salad, even my brother in law who doesn‚Äôt like anything."

I ended up adding more vinegar and even some mustard to cut the sweetness. I also cooked 10 pieces of bacon to have it ready for other things and ended up just adding all of it; but that‚Äôs definitely a matter of personal preference."

"reviewBody": "My husband made this and he is a BY THE BOOK sort of guy. He did it *exactly* as written. I bought the ingredients, so he used red potatoes, cider vinegar, and flat parsley. These are my issues with this recipe: Step 3 is a hot mess (pun intended). It should be 3 separate steps: 3) making the sauce, 4) adding the potatoes, and 5) adding the parsley right before serving. There is also no need to \"heat through\" any of it after boiling, it should only be tossed together. The result of his endeavors was a very vinegary, lumpy, mashed potato mix with brown, wilted weed-looking things throughout. Heating parsley in an acid is going to do nothing good for its appearance. I pulled ALL the parsley out, which was a big hassle. I found it to be a little sweet, but the \"salad\" was a hit at the BBQ we went to, so I'm giving it 3 stars."

I made a couple of alterations so that it was more to my particular liking. I only put in one tablespoon of sugar (just enough to offset the bitterness of the vinegar, like what is done to tomato sauce, not to make the sauce sweet) and increased the amount of vinegar to four tablespoons. Plus, I added a tablespoon of flour to thicken the sauce. Now, I think of Granddaddy when I take a bite. Delicious!"
