There are any number of variations but this has been called authentic by many Hungarians I know. We cook it on the 'bogratch' (phonetic spelling) which is an iron kettle suspended over an open fire. I really believe that there are many legitimate regional variations across Hungary not based on the Hungarians I know, this is the real deal. Remember that this was always an opportunistic dish---whatever you had on hand worked as an ingredient. Give this a try. Super simple and delicious."

Anyway, the caraway seed is the key to this, along with the paprika. Take your time, and let it simmer and you'll be rewarded. I use stew beef cut in bite size pieces and serve over noodles, although I believe it is suppose to be a soup, with potatoes. Delicious, and all the friends my kids bring home with them love it."

For those folks saying that it was too much paprika, DON'T use the stuff you buy in the spice jars in your grocery store here; use Hungarian paprika (buy it online, if you can't find it in an ethnic foods store). The stuff from the grocery store is bitter and nothing like the sweet, flavorful Hungarian paprika that comes in a can."

If you put the paprika right into the hot butter/onions, it will turn bitter."

"reviewBody": "Unfortunately americans mix up Gulash (Gulyas) with Parikas. This recipe is closer to the later. Authentic Gulyas is made as a soup, with meat, carrots, onions, parsley and small dough dupmplings called \"csipetke\". Of course paprika is one of the most important ingredients. Some variations are present throughout the country. Paprikas is made with onions, tomatoe, peppers, garlic, paprika and meat. You can cook potaoesin with the meat, or cook dumplings or pasta to go with it. Some people do use sour cream to make it more creamy, and if cooking with hot paprika,it also cuts the heat. Just thought you neened to know."

I would also make it with a less expensive sut of meat. Stewing for close to three hours would justify a chuck or other stew meat. I wish I had used the flank for another dish."
