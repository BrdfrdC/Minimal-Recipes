Been making this for years, but I used to always use 4 cans of (pre salted) red beans instead of doing the dried beans, so I never noticed that there's no salt in the recipe! When I made it recently I ended up adding two teaspoons of salt and did everything else the same. I'm guessing it was an omission? Anyway, this is a wonderful recipe and it tastes like what we had in Louisiana. It's always such a pleasure to eat. I like to cook half the sausage in the beans and do the other half in the pan to control the spice level and add texture."

I made as directed, except: I am lazy about washing dishes. There is no reason to brown the vegetables in a separate skillet. Brown them first in the pot you are cooking the beans in. Then add the beans. Cook as directed. I also didn't brown the sausage in a separate pan. The sausage cooks in the hot beans."

This should be explained in the recipe. Altitude makes a difference in cooking people. Secondly I have made red beans and rice before and have learned that they taste better if while they are cooking you add either smoked ham hock or smoked turkey leg. It adds so much flavor to the dish."

"reviewBody": "I made this as directed. The first problem was after 45 minutes on the stove I had to add two cups of water to prevent it from burning. In all, in the 3 hours it was cooking, I added 7 cups of water. The second problem was the beans never fully cooked. After soaking them for more than 24 hours and cooking them for 3 hours total, they still weren't done. I tried cooking them for 15 minutes more but ended up picking the sausage out and throwing them into a pressure cooker for 20 minutes and added another cup of water. Third, after putting the sausage back in the beans, I tasted it and it had absolutely no flavor. I had to add 3 more teaspoons of Creole seasoning to finally make it palatable."

Made sure I had the celery, onions, green peppers nicely sautéed, added in some hot hatch peppers just for the flavor and spice, Andouille was there, nicely sauteed with the Boudin. I thought I would add a chicken breast or thigh, but looked like a lot of meat with my beans so decided this time I would leave it out. Didn't have any shrimp, so maybe next time. I did add some Gumbo Filet, added at the end and a number of other spices as I went along. My red beans, not Kidneys, soaked overnight. My husband was born in Bogalusa, LA. I have been given thumbs up! Oh, almost forgot, cornbread in the cast iron skillet in the oven, fried potatoes with onions and other stuff. Put on a small skillet of greens, just for another side. Just the two of us, but going to be eating it for about a month. Just joking. Freezer works just fine."

I tried to boil off some of the water; mashed the bean to thicken it; added a tsp of salt, a Goya chicken bouillon cube, a tsp of gumbo file, a tsp of creole seasoning, and beef hillshire hot links, because that's all I had. And I cooked a pot of Thailand rice. Now, the end result: Amazing, could have used a little more salt, and maybe some Louisiana hot sauce, but, for NJ, I'll take it. And for that, and the base of this recipe, I'll give it a five, because that bowl right there, it didn't even make it to the table. I have 3 grown sons and a husband, it won't last into the night."

The recipe calls for 3 hours of cooking and mine was fine in 2 hours. I think covering it helps keep the flavors together and it cooks faster. I cooked it in 6 cups of chicken broth for more flavor. For the sausage I used a mix of andouille and smoked beef sausage. I also added an extra teaspoon of Cajun seasoning and no cayenne. Otherwise, followed it to a T and it was delicious!! I think I would pass the test with “Hold the Mayo” on twitter. 😂"

If you cannot find them dried, you can use canned. They are usually found over by the chili beans. You can substitute other sausages as well without sacrificing flavor. And thank you to the reviewer who said these were typically served as a meal on Mondays. My husband didn't believe me."

I also boil the beans after soaking them and throw in about a tablespoon of baking soda, then drain and rinse them before I use them. This reduces the gas factor in the beans. If you do this, watch the beans because they'll foam up and overflow the pot if you're not careful."

"reviewBody": "YUM!! I used the rapid soak method for my beans. A couple tips: I used a Dutch oven pan and browned the sliced andouille sausage in the oil first then removed it from the pan to cook the veggies in that flavorful oil. If you want a thicker sauce, cook it towards the end with the lid off. I smashed some of the beans at the end to give it more creaminess. And if you add salt, do it at the END to avoid raising the temp of the liquid so the beans can soften up easier while cooking. I personally thought it needed some salt to bring those flavors out more. We served over rice with bits of green onion on top, a salad, and homemade cornbread. Delish!!"

Crisping up a few pieces of smoked bacon then the sausage and using the the fat to sauté the trinity will help. Add in a scored smoked ham hock and cooking for 15-20 minutes will make the flavors more Smokey. Add broth and simmer until the meat falls off the bone. Midway you can add the beans."

I used the Better Than Bouillon with the water that someone suggested and I even bought the low sodium. IT WAS A SALT LICK. DO NOT do this. I then used 12 potatoes to try &amp; dull the salt.. it was a disaster. In the future, I will do half UNsalted chicken stock and half water. I will NEVER use that Better than Bouillon again, that has SO much sodium in it. After doctoring it I could tell that it was amazing flavor and I cannot wait to make it with out all the salt and just follow my instincts next time. The recipe was really easy and really brings a lot of flavors like traditional RB&amp;R from Louisiana."

Bring just u\nnder a boil, cover and reduce heat to a medium low heat for 2 hours. Drain and use as if you'd soaked them.\nNever add salt ot salted stock to beans until they've cooked until almost done. Salt toughens the beans up. So be careful if you use a commercial Creole or Cajun seasoning since they're prominently salt. Make your own and leave the salt out.\nA stalk of celery is the large grouping made up of multiple ribs. Adjust the recipe accordingly and use 2 ribs of celery."

I used to throw in a couple of ham hocks but they're more expensive lately so I cook the beans in stock made from a ham bone that's been soaked and rinsed to cut back on the salt. The Prudhomme recipe that I base this on called for kielbasa and that's what I usually use since it's much cheaper than andouille (this is supposed to be 'peasant' food after all). I use a little more thyme and a little worcestershire. For heat I encourage the use of Louisiana style hot sauce according to each person's taste."

The heat was much greater than I recall when I ate red beans and rice every Monday night in New Orleans in the late 70s. Tonight's dish is far too hot for children. Perhaps sautéing less cayenne in the beginning would allow taste without extreme heat. Cooking recipes for Indian cuisine always involves frying the spices early rather than tossing them in the liquid."
