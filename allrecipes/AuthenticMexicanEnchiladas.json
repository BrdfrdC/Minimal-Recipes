I have never seen them made this way. even in all my time in Mexico. We don't fry our tortillas, we steam them and then dip in the sauce, add cheese, and sometimes an olive in the center and roll, top with sauce and bake. We use chopped onion sauted, add flour, chili powder, cumin and oregano, then add chicken broth for our enchilada sauce. I add other secret ingredients. This is where the flavor blooms. Easy to make and delicious."

I also only poured a LITTLE bit of the water from the chiles out and pureed it using a cuisinart, then strained it. I dipped corn tortillas in oil and THEN the sauce, fried them in a hot pan (for way more than 5 seconds a side, mine were nice and CRISPY!) and then rolled up the chicken and queso fresco, baking them at 375 for about 10 minutes. HOLY YUM! The tortillas absorb so much flavor; you do not need to add enchilada sauce on these bad boys - sour cream adds moisture and lettuce (I used a cabbage slaw mix), tomato and green onion add crunch :)))"

I asked her to help me and compared the differences-- first, she said to use 4 Guajillo chilis and NOT chile de arbol BECAUSE arbol chilies are VERY hot. I can't do extremely hot food so I am glad I got her opinion before making this. She roasts them along with two tomatillos before boiling also. Otherwise, it was the same. The chili will be MUCH darker red than this recipe. I couldn't even tell these enchiladas had any chili they were dipped in."

"reviewBody": "Tastes great but as a novice to Mexican cuisine I am upset about a few things in the recipe that made it much harder and more frustrating than it had to be! Maybe I got the wrong chiles de arbol but the ones at my Mexican store were tiny so instead of 6, like the recipe said, I used probably 30 to make the sauce. I also drained them like the recipe said, and put them in my blender to find only a paste. DONT DRAIN THEM!! So my sauce was finally made and I dipped the tortillas in the sauce then fried them. As I was taking them out, they totally fell apart! I posted on a Facebook group and the ladies there recommended to fry, THEN DIP. This worked SO MUCH BETTER!! other than that, they are very good and I think my husband will be very impressed!"

"reviewBody": "Yum! A co-worker of mine is of Mexican descent and he shared a secret with me. As many others have done, try subbing Queso Chihuahua cheese for the \"guts\" of your enchiladas. This cheese melts extremely well, but you need to pop your rolled enchiladas in the oven for a few minutes to get the melty, ooey-gooey effect. Now, about the recipe. It's a little vague. I too was confused about the sauce. I ended up adding the full 3/4 c. of water called for to my pot of chiles (de arbol) and simmering as directed. I covered my pan to help minimize evaporation and then added all of the liquid, chiles, salt and garlic to my blender (FYI, this sauce is perfect as is - there's no need to add anything else to it). NOTE: I did not find it messy or difficult to fry my sauce dipped tortillas and am glad I didn't wait until they were fried to dip them. I did have to fry for a tad longer than called for, but it all worked out in the end. My only regret is that I didn't have any sauce left to drizzle over my enchiladas (it was THAT good!). :( Topping these babies with Queso Fresco Mexican crema, lettuce, (chopped) tomato and green onion really hit the spot. Mexican rice and refried beans rounded out our authentic meal. All I can say is this was one FANTASTIC meal. Thanks for sharing your MIL's recipe, Becky! :-)"

But, here are some things that i can say as i¬¥m in mexico and i eat enchiladas once a week in a traditional cocina economica: the chiles doen¬¥t really need to be drained, they are ok with the water, also, you can try them filled with chicken, they taste even better! and they also could not be fried, taste is better and they¬¥re lighter. try it, fill them with chicken, you won¬¥t regret!! But the real enchiladas are just topped with queso fresco and onion. \ni¬¥ve never seen here in mexico an enchilada topped with lettuce and tomato. THESE ENCHILADAS ARE STILL TASTY!"

"reviewBody": "Thank you for posting a recipe for AUTHENTIC Mexican enchiladas! I did cheat and use a store bought sauce....I saw that Frontera released a line of enchilada sauces and couldn't resist, as their stuff is pretty good and I kind of love Rick Bayless. :) \r\nAnyway, I dipped the tortillas in oil, then sauce (which was warming in a pan) and immediately rolled them up with a little bit of cheese. After they were all done, I heated a skillet sprayed with Pam and re heated 4 of the enchiladas at a time on both sides and then melted some cheese on top by putting the lip on the skillet. This is how one of the local Mexican restaurants serves them and I love how crispy the bottom gets and how melty the cheese gets. Delicious. Can't wait to try the homemade sauce!"

You can just heat the tortillas up on a skillet or microwave to get them tender and then soak in the sauce. Frying it does add crispiness but if you want this dish to be healthier, skip the frying."

"reviewBody": "This is as authentic as you can get for Mexican food. I make a very similar recipe, but with a chile verde sauce. You can either dip the tortilla in the oil and then the sauce or vise versa. I prefer to do oil and then sauce, that way I can drain the oil on paper towels without losing any of the sauce. For the sauce, do not drain the water when it's done boiling, use that blend instead of new water. Also, to flavor the sauce, try adding onion and the chicken bullion with tomato flavor--trust me, it makes it taste wonderful! Just throw everything into the blender and blend. You can use whatever dried peppers you have on hand (chile de arbol peppers tend to be more spicier than the other dried varieties). Instead of rolling the tortillas, you can stack or just fold them over (like the picture). Although queso fresco doesn't melt very well, you can't beat the light and delicious flavor. I always use this cheese for my enchiladas. I like to add chopped onions to the filling too. And lastly, before you serve these, pop them in the microwave to melt the cheese a little. My husband, who is Mexican, loves them with either a cheese and onion filling or with cheese, onion, and chicken. Hope this helps!"

I can reassure any one that this recipe is a good one, especially since I am from Jalisco, Mexico...&amp; Queso fresco is the best cheese to use for enchiladas. And I think what she meant by draining the sauce, is to use a strainer and push the sauce through with a spoon and maybe some water."

"reviewBody": "Pretty close to the real thing, lacks a little flavor. Here's how my mom makes them. Roast the chilies on a flat grill or pan till they are roasted on all sides, (watch them so they don't burn, this will be quick; brings out the flavor a little more). This shouldn't take long. Immediately soak them in hot water till they are soft. In a blender add the chilies (remove tops and seeds depending on how hot you want it), water (a bit at a time), add onion, garlic, oregano and salt. (the measurements are small, but you will get them down depending on your taste). My mom also adds Masa Harina (the corn meal used to make tamales) to thicken it a little if it is too runny. Strain the mixture into a warm pan to keep hot. The tortillas are fried a little bit first then dipped in the sauce. If you don't want to fry them I have also heated them in a pan or grill till they are slightly crispy. We make our enchiladas as layers so simply piling them on top of each other with layers of cheese, shredded chicken (to the chicken we add a little of the enchilada sauce first), and onions. YUM :)"

"reviewBody": "When I lived in Los Angeles one of my dearest friends was a lovely woman from Mexico who came to my home evenings every week and taught me how to cook authentic Mexican recipes. This recipe was one of my favorites and it is so simple with pure tastes. However, as with everything I touch I add a twist. A gorgeous combination of Arbol and Ancho chiles makes this sauce sing as well as adding a very scant amount of cumin (don't go overboard as this spice packs a punch with its distinct pungency). I also prefer to make my own corn tortillas as it's the simplest thing in the world and you are guaranteed the freshest possible ingredients. By adding a bit of chopped green onion and mild green chiles to the cheese filling you score big points in flavor and still keep the authenticity alive. I tend to like my enchiladas oozing melted cheese, so after I plate them I add a spoonful of sauce a bit more crumbled queso cheese on top and slip it into a hot oven for a few minutes. Add the crema (or sour cream), tomatoes and lettuce and voila, perfection! These are decadent and so wonderful. Also, occasionally try the same recipe without the cheese and substitute spicey chicken and roasted potatoes. Mmmmmmmmmm....soooo good."

I use my own enchilada sauce and I make my own filling, the queso fresco should only be sprinkled on the top, not used in the filling. Also I don't fry all tortillas at one time and then go back and fill them. I fill them while they're being fried."

"reviewBody": "I loved the sauce, I did add about 2 tsp chicken base and 1 jalapeno to the water for a little kick. I didn't want to fry the torilla so I rubbed a little oil on each side and then heated them up in a pan until crispy. Then I dipped them in sauce (which I didn't drain, I just took out the seeds from the chili's before putting them in the blender) and added the cheese (I mixed the fresco cheese with chedder cheese for more flavor), rolled them, sprinkled them with cheese, and then broiled them on high just until the cheese was melted on top. This is my new favorite red enchilada recipe!"

I never heard or ate enchiladas that were baked in a casserole pan and everytime I eat Mexican I refuse to eat enchiladas cuz they're not made the \"right\" way. LOL. My mom is from mexico too and she taught me to dip flour tortillas in sauce then fry and while frying add ingredients such as cheese, beef/chicken, onions, etc...So delicious."

"reviewBody": "I agree with the other reviewers that the draining of the chiles doesn't make sense. I blended them with the liquid and then strained it back in the sauce pan, put it back on the heat to cook down a bit. Dipping first in the sauce fried out the flavor of the sauce. I also agree that the filling should be a melting cheese like Chihuahua and save the queso fresco for the toping. Over all the flavor was good, but the instructions seem to be missing pieces and vague. Maybe if we could all learn the recipe from her mother in law we'd get it! Thanks for a recipe that is truly mexican in style and not one of those oven baked, drowned in sauce and cheese things most people in the US think of a enchiladas! If you have a mexican grocery in your area, use crema instead of sour cream... lighter and more tangy on the tongue! (Don't forget a few slices of advocado and a sqweeze of lime on top!)"

"reviewBody": "This was great! It's like an enchilada salad-perfect for spring and summer when regular (American) enchiladas are too heavy and hot. I use the Red Enchilada Sauce recipe from this site and change the assembly process a bit. I simply fry the tortillas (without first dipping in sauce)then place a little of the heated sauce on a plate, roll the cheese into the tortillas and place on the plate, and then top with more sauce and the rest of ingredients as indicated. Frying with the sauce was too splattery for me (I'm not that talented!) but this way I am able to capture the flavors and it is very easy. I love it! I added diced avocado the 2nd time I made it. YUM! This is now my favorite way to eat enchiladas-so fresh tasting!"
