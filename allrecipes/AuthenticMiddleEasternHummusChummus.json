,"description": "&#34;Authentic chummus is very different and SO much tastier than its American counterpart. This chummus is creamy and delicate in taste rather than overpowered with garlic or thick and pasty. It is eaten warm, fresh, and as a whole meal spread out in a dish and drizzled with fresh olive oil. It is scooped up with pita, raw onion slices, or just a fork. Do NOT use canned chickpeas (garbanzo beans)!&#34;"

I also used canned chickpeas so maybe that's why I found it lacked flavor. I made it for my friends and it was an instant hit. They were raving about it. Overall it's a great easy recipe that will be a staple in my recipe book!"

Definitely recommend the baking soda pinch, brings out so much more foam. Added hot water midway through the simmer, as water got too shallow. Used same tahini sauce from the first time I made it. Beans were SO soft, and overall the hummus came out SO much smoother, nearly perfect like what you'd buy packaged at the grocery store."

Definitely taste it and adjust garlic, salt, etc, to taste once the flavors have had time to meld. The dry beans make a huge difference. They are very nutty and lend a nice firm bite. I love the cumin addition--I'd never seen that before! Thanks for a beautiful recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Not a lot of flavor. I have to ask my sister and her Egyptian in-laws why their hummus is so much more flavorful. More garlc? More tahini?\n\nNothing against this specific recipe: All recipes I could find on hummus were about the same. \n\nSurprisingly, I think one of the problems was using home-cooked chick peas. The chick peas held their flavor, so the hummus tasted like beans. I learned to make my own chick peas in anything where the chick peas are prominent and one wants a strong taste, like salads. I would also rub the chick peas around in my hands to get the skins off because they made the final product too lumpy."

I had to add more lemon juice a few times to make it taste good to me, but that's probably a personal taste. The only thing I didn't really like was that the flavor of the extra-virgin olive oil was a bit overwhelming. Next time I'll just use light olive oil or sunflower oil. I love how easy the recipe is and I'm so happy that I can now make my own hummus at home! \nP.S. Didn't need more garlic in my opinion!"

"reviewBody": "I'm sure that if I had the right equipment, my life would've been much easier making this hummus (or any hummus). I read comments about using blenders or food processors, and I agree that a food processor--a big one--should be used to get the right creaminess at the end. I used a small processor to begin with, but it didn't do much good. I then tried a blender--didn't work at all. I switched to a hand mixer, which got it almost right--but then I put it back into the small processor in batches to get it all together. For the actual results, I felt like I was a mad scientist trying to figure out the amount of garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, and tahini to mix in order to get it to the flavor I liked. I read so many other reviews about adding more garlic, so I also added more minced garlic. For garlic lovers, it's great. I also read that the recipe called for too much olive oil. I personally felt like I didn't have enough--so I added more to make it creamier. I added the listed amount for lemon juice (freshly squeezed), but I may end up adding more right before serving it. I've only had fresh hummus once, and it was so delicious compared to the store-bought versions. I felt like I ended up with a chunkier hummus that tasted closer to peanut butter. But I may have done this to myself, which is why I still gave this 4 star"

If you don't like cumin, don't add it. If you don't like olive oil, leave it out. Better yet, just skip this recipe and move on to the next until you find one that fits you and your kitchen cabinets. Don't slash a recipe that someone has graciously shared unless you had issues with the preparation of the meal. For those who enjoy trying new flavors, this was yummy. Adjust to your likings.

"reviewBody": "This hummus was different than others I have tried. It didnt have that salty canned bean after taste. I made 1/2 recipe and it really does make a TON! I am not a big fan of hummus, but had some dried chickpeas and soybeans I bought some time ago for a recipe I never made. The mix was mostly chickpeas, so I decided to try this. I cooked them with a carrot, small onion, and a 1/2 packet no sodium broth powder. I reserved 1/4 cup of the broth and used that. The vegetables were non detectable in the hummus. Instead of the dip being thick and pasty, it had a whipped airy texture. Note, have a very strong food processor or blender, because there is a lot of dip to blend. It did thicken up some after 24 hour refrigeration. I stirred in a little olive and garlic salt and served with Cedar brand flat bread. This was the freshest tasting hummus I have ever tried. I am not a big hummus eater, but would recommend this recipe to anyone wanting a recipe for hummus that has more time."

This recipe would be even better if the skins were peeled, also, not sure what the cumin added, never used it before, and couldn't really pinpoint if it was actually needed at all.."

"reviewBody": "This is almost the same recipe I have used for years. Shown how to make by a friend as my family members did not make this. Home cooked beans are far superior to canned and much more economical. Homemade hummus (or just about anything homemade for that matter) is superior to any pre-made full of preservative thing you buy at the store. To those of you who have commented that the texture is coarse, either your beans are not cooked enough and/or you have not blended the hummus long enough, at 5 minutes in my high powered blender it is smooth, silky and fluffy. Blend, puree or process until you have the correct texture! Cumin is an authentic Near and Middle Eastern seasoning, garlic if used it is just a whisper. Remember this is not an American grocery store clone. This is the real stuff, probably a recipe passed from an elder relative to a younger one, including the most special ingredient of all, love! So if you must, add the whole bulb of garlic, roasted red pepper or a hot pepper or two, more or less tahini and lemon juice or whatever else you want to, make it with love and then it will be authentic to you and your family. Oh I almost forgot, my favorite way to eat it is warm on freshly baked, homemade pita bread or soft lavosh, some nice salty cured olives on the side! Yum!!!!!!"

In the USA, you may need more than specified in the recipe since the garlic here in Israel is incredibly strong and potent. \n\nTo the person who \"knows\" authentic chummus b/c you ate it at a few restaurants in Israel and Greece... um, well, which restaurants? Because unless you were eating in a restaurant that specialized in chummus, you were eating industrialized chummus--which is kind of like eating spaghetti at Sabarro (sp?) and saying that you know authentic Italian cuisine.\n\nChummus is an art here and you've got to know where to go to find the good stuff. I'm not saying this recipe parallels Abu Chasan or Bahadonas, but for homemade chummus, it's pretty good."

My hummus ALWAYS comes out light and creamy. Do not use a blender - use a food processor. Even better, use a vitamix and a whole peeled lemon :) I add black pepper and fresh cilantro near the end and pulse just a few times. Roasted red pepper is nice too. If I want it spicy, I will add cayenne pepper."

I used almost two cups of water for half a recipe, I followed the recipe and even added extra. Although it was a thick paste (how is this possible after adding all the water and pureeing for 45 minutes??) I decided not to toss the batch, although my husband recommended it. It was only edible after adding a lot of oil, seasoning salt and I actually added milk. This got good reviews, but I am not sure why!!!!"

Its actually traditional to serve additional tehina (diluted with water to form a sauce) on top of the hummous, with olive oil and colorful spices such as paprika for decoration. Many people also garnish with olives, hot sauce, or if you want to make a meal out of it, ful (cooked fava beans). ps Hummous is not low quality Italian food where you douse it with garlic. It should convey the creamy nutty flavor of chickpeas and sesame. Just a bit is good imho."

It took a whole morning to cook the beans, and unfortunately for me, I made enough for an army. The texture was much too course and it wasn't creamy like the store bought kind. Also, there were lots of chick pea skins that did not get thoroughly chopped that made it pretty gritty. It does freeze well, however, be warned that once you get it out of the freezer, it can only be kept in the fridge for about a week without ggoing bad."
