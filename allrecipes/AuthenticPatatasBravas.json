"reviewBody": "Tried to prepare the salsa today, and it was nothing like a proper salsa brava. It was far too bitter and far less sour than what I remember from Catalonia. And where is the cherry vinegar? That's a must in salsa brava.\nEven after adding vinegar, some lemon juice, extra paprika and salt, and also some sugar to contrast the bitterness - there was still no saving this. Now it just tastes like ketchup."
