Used fresh tomatoes (canned might have actually tasted better), forgot turmeric (not on purpose!), added a generous pinch of saffron, a tsp of rosemary, and used short-grain rice, and a mix of shrimp, calamari and mussels instead of just shrimp. All-in-all, pretty tasty!"

"reviewBody": "This is a nice scaled down version. There is no green pepper in the sofrito to start with and this is key.I think it needs more tomato and garlic.I use Spanish Bomba Rice and lobster stock as well as white wine.I also use scallops and lobster. I garnish with flat leaf parsley and piquillo peppers. Using a Paella Pan really does make a difference. It's hard to scale down Paella. When you make it it usually serves a crowd. I also sneak in a little finely minced celery. What can I say, I'm american. Thanks for Paella for two."
