I'm so glad to have found this quick and easy recipe - all the ingredients came together perfectly, and the batter had the perfect consistency to easily swirl into the pan for an evenly thick pancake. I used a non-stick ceramic frying pan, which made the edges of the pancake have super thin crispy edges - a delightful contrast to the rest of the pancake that my family and I enjoyed. I love Ikea, but I think I'll be making my own Swedish pancakes from now on! ðŸ¥°"

"reviewBody": "This is the classic Swedish Pancake recipe that is in the Better Homes &amp; Garden red checkered cookbook where i leared how to cook them over 50 years ago. These are the only pancakes I like and we fuss them up a lot for Christmas morning with a whipped vanilla muscarpone cream filling. Yum! The only difference I make to them is how crepes are made. You melt all of your butter in your skillet, then pour it into your pancake/crepe mixture. You won't have to butter or spray your skillet again for the entire batch. My mom served these with an orange liquor sauce or maple syrup. I serve them with maple syrup or whipped vanilla muscaropne. Yum!!"

"reviewBody": "If you prefer pancakes over crepes you'll like this recipe. But it's not \"traditional\" in that it's closer tasting to an American pancake, and Swedish pancakes are more closely related to a French crepe. For my taste, it was a too much like a pancake (because of the extra flour) and it needs a tablespoon of butter melted into the batter. What this recipe points out well is to whip the eggs prior to incorporating the other ingredients. Great tip!\n\nI made this to see what I thought of it, but I prefer 1/2 cup of flour (instead of 3/4 cups), a tablespoon of melted butter in the batter, and a sprinkle of cinnamon (definitely not \"authentic\" but pairs great with my Lingonberries)."

"reviewBody": "Very easy. Made as is. Keep in mind, as they are (plain) they aren't much... you need to add toppings to enhance them, much like traditional pancakes. We usually add butter with leftover cranberry sauce (from a previous turkey dinner). red currant jam or, if we can find it, lingonberry preserves. We also top it with fresh fruit - various berries in season, peaches, bananas, etc. We've been experimenting using them with savory toppings, using leftover pancakes for lunch and dinner. It's hard to go wrong since it's just a good, basic pancake. I've even made a bunch on a camping trip where we were acting as 'trail angels' to backpackers hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, making them breakfast as they passed by. Man, can those kids eat! but the best part is that many of them asked for extra pancakes so they could take with them for lunch. Apparently, they all love to use them with peanut or almond butter. Keeping this in mind, I made the batter in large batches ahead of time at home, and we cooked them on site. Worked really well because everyone could pick and choose the toppings they wanted."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is very similar to the one my Mormor taught my mom, and I've been making these now for a little over 50 years! This calls for one less egg, a little more flour, half the sugar---but it's basically the same. I tried to make it with just one tablespoon batter on my cast iron griddle, but I had better luck with two tablespoons. I've never used butter on the griddle, so it took me a little getting used to (I usually give a very light brushover of Crisco). My granddaughters thought these were a little more \"cushiony\" but still very good (they passed the big test!!)! Powdered sugar, granulated sugar, or lingonberry jam are the traditional ways I know of how to serve Swedish pancakes, but we still prefer a little jam with sour cream in the middle with a smidgen of syrup on the rolled up top! My four Swedish grandparents would be proud that their tradition has carried on! Thanks for posting your recipe, Amber!"
