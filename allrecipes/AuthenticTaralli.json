Put back in oven for 10 more min. but they still weren't brown. Took them out to cool anyway. They were too hard and not soft inside. Tasted bland. Need some kind of flavoring. I will try again."

"reviewBody": "Made these for an Italian wine tasting, two days ahead of time, and kept them in a paper bag; they kept just fine and were still crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. The recipe made about 36 taralli. I added just a bit of fennel seed (1/2 tsp), and it flavored the entire batch quite a bit. I also dipped half of them in grated Parmesan after boiling, but we could not taste the cheese after baking. The taralli tend to be somewhat flavorless, which is actually good for a wine tasting... I had to turn up the oven to get them to brown properly after the recommended temp (350 in a regular oven) -- they spent an extra 7 minutes at convection 345 degrees, which did the trick."
