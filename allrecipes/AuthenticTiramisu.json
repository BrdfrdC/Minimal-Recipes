I used the Nespresso double espresso capsules and followed the recipe . I did have two mixing bowls that I used . The mascarpone part I used a blade and one mixing bowl while the second mixing bowl and whisk attachment was stored in the freezer until I was ready to whip the egg whites . The egg whites whip up in no time and then I just folded the egg whites with the mascarpone. I use the Dutch brand Coco and it elevates the dessert . Thank you to the author for sharing such a nice dessert !"

"reviewBody": "Excellent. People gobbled it up! Initially used Kahlua like some other recipes, but that was way too sweet, so I bought some Brandy per this recipe and that was just right. In fact, doubling the amount of Brandy was delicious even to non-drinkers! I pasteurized the eggs using sous vide (134 degrees for 1 hour, per ATK) for some peace of mind. Honestly, it was hard to imagine that raw egg would end up tasting so good, but no one would know that's what it was from the delicious and creamy result. Thanks for a great recipe."

Its exactly like my neighbor, who is Italian, used to make. It brought back soooo many childhood memories. I'm so excited about finding this gem, I am going to make a batch for everyone at work! Everybody should have a true tiramisu and not that garbage you buy at most grocery store bakeries. \n\nI found that many of the comments from people complaining about parts of the recipe not being specific enough for them (causing them to ruin their dessert) had to be made by very novice bakers/cooks. \n\nWith a recipe like this its more of a 'to suit your taste' and the times given for beating the egg whites is merely a suggestion and not the exact science of the recipe. I preferred mine more whipped and that's what I did; someone else may not and that's perfectly fine too. \n\nThank you so much for sharing this incredible recipe. You've made me a very happy girl!!"

Do make sure to use real mascarapone cheese and high quality ingredients though (even for the eggs. Afterall you are consuming them raw.) It may be a little pricey for some people to make but it is way worth it. I make tiramisu for my husband's birthday every year- I think I have found a staple recipe now! =) I had to stop him from eating the whole thing himself! He was in ecstasy. Oh and I also made this one day in advance to let it sit in the fridge and \"marinate\" and it really put it on a whole other level."

This recipe is surprisingly easy to make, and comes together really well once you begin assembling it. The only change I made is to quickly dip both sides of the ladyfingers in the espresso, just to see what it'll do; the taste of the mascarpone mixture is spot on. I didn't have a pretty dish to put it in, since I'm testing it out on my little family. It's presently chilling in the fridge and I will update after we eat it; if the mascarpone mixture is anything to go by, I'm sure it'll be delish. The amount of brandy is just right -- a hint without overpowering my taste buds.\n\n8/16/15\nI just made this again to finish off the ladyfingers I had leftover from the first time I made this dish. Again, this is spot on. The only change I made is to double the amount of espresso because I like to dip both sides of the cookie (so it requires more liquid). I don't like tiramisu, but this recipe converted me! It's actually quite easy to make and the only time consuming part is the assembling, which really doesn't. Take that's good at all. Thank you so much for sharing this user friendly, DELICIOUS dessert!"

"reviewBody": "This was my first attempt at Tiramisu and I'm so pleased that this is the recipe I chose. I just followed the directions and ended up with the most amazing dessert. The only change I made was using regular coffee as a substitute since I didn't have espresso. Also, in the future I will make sure to dip the ladyfingers for just a second because I might have let them absorb a little too much coffee giving it a slight soggy texture. All in all, an awesome dessert recipe. It will be perfect next time."

"reviewBody": "The most amazing tiramisu I've ever had! Thanks for sharing!\nI like that only eggs and mascarpone are used and not the whipped cream replacement that I often see. I find this very important. \nI made a version with strawberries, because I had some pink ladyfingers available, but I'm sure the original recipe is also really good.\nI made the espresso with instant coffee because i don't have an espresso machine and I like to have a good kick of coffee. I think the coffee taste is essential for having a good tiramisu.\nI didn't have brandy available, so I used some chocolate flavored vodka, which I also mixed through the coffee. The alcohol is also one of the key-ingredients and should not be left out.\nI didn't spread the cocoa powder between the layers, because I didn't read the instructions at that moment. I'm not sure if it's traditional to have this in-between layer of cocoa powder."
