"reviewBody": "This was such a hit at our New Year's dinner party, the first dish cleared. Since it was for 14 people I used 4 pears, 4 golden apples, left out the celery. I used plain Greek yogurt, added brown sugar and honey in to sweeten the yogurt. I peeled the apples and pears, chopped them about 1 inch thick (bite size), squeezed 1 lemon over the fruit, mixed and refrigerate. I roasted pecans and sunflower seeds in the oven til golden brown, this gives it a better nutty flavor. I added the cinnamon in the yogurt, then dried mixed fruits (raisins, cranberries, blueberries) also in the yogurt. About an hour before dinner I mixed the fruits in the yogurt then topped with the pecans and sunflower seeds. When the guest sat down to eat I mixed the nuts (last to keep it crunchy) in with the yogurt."

"reviewBody": "Awesome change of pace. Used up my grapes instead of raisins and only had vanilla yogurt in the house so I skipped the brown sugar , the cinnamon and nutmeg make this smell delightful. The first time I made this I followed the recipe and served it for thanksgiving desert, lately I make it for desert or snack. Really love the aroma of this."

"reviewBody": "10.28.16 I liked the option of using yogurt in place of the traditional mayo you always find in a Waldorf salad. My apple and pear were ripe and very juicy, and as I suspected, that juice thinned out the yogurt dressing, making the salad a bit watery. Would recommend making just what you plan to eat because I don’t think this would hold up in the fridge overnight. After one hour, it was already very wet. In spite of the dressing comment, it tasted fresh and wonderful! I used vanilla Greek yogurt (what I had on hand), and included all of the “optional” ingredients, as well. Probably won’t use the nutmeg the next time, but the cinnamon was spot on. ALLIDAWN thanks for sharing!"
