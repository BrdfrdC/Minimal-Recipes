Anyway, I love the creaminess and they're beautiful too. Thanks!"

I followed the recipe pretty closely except I added some additional hot pepper flakes. Even w that it was a little bland. I think there is too much mayo as the recipe is written. I read others skipped the mayo and added more avocado, and I would do that next time if I were to make this again. I’d still use a little mayo but just a little. Also, I served these right away so maybe they firm up more if refrigerated. Regardless, I wasn’t a fan of the flavor or consistency."

Normally I would increase salt, and/or add chipotle or jalapeño pepper, as we both like spicy food, but I was not so sure about our company that would also be eating these. The end result was a fairly bland filling, that I was not totally impressed with. Notably, there were only 3 halves left, so somebody enjoyed them! I gave 4 stars because I'm pretty sure this would have absolutely tasted as good as it looked, and it looked great, with the addition of garlic."

When I took the mayo out of the fridge, it was slightly past its due date... hmm. Take no chances with mayonnaise -- omitted it. Then I couldn't be bothered with the garlic -- lazy Sunday morning, I guess. I used only half of an avocado, again because that's what I had on hand. Fresh lime, yes. So I mashed all in the bowl as required, put a dollop on a cooked egg, and thought it was not too bad, considering I had scrimped and/or omitted ingredients. Will make again -- this time following the posted directions."

I skipped the bacon and didn't have any fresh jalapeños so I used a half cup of canned and added a little more lime juice. I threw everything in the Vitamix for a smooth mix. I also topped with paprika and fresh cilantro. Everyone raved about them! This will be a new staple I believe, especially come summer."

I didn't have lime juice on hand so I used lemon, a little more garlic than called for, and left out the turkey bacon (I didn't have any either), added the pepper to the filling and also sprinkled on top. It had a great flavor, not too heavy, and with just enough kick to make it exciting. Thank you for sharing."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was a great find. I loved the creaminess of the yolk and avocado mixture. The lime juice was also detectable, which we enjoyed. I only made 3 hard-boiled eggs and used all the yolks in the recipe. Yes, I did have extra filling, but I just finished it on a cracker or two. The one change I made was an optional item. Instead of the dash of hot sauce, I added a sprinkle of the cayenne pepper. Eggs were delish, and a definite keeper in this house. Thanks, thehealthyhousewife for sharing."
