"reviewBody": "First, I haven’t reviewed an Allrecipes recipe in years! But the bones of this ovo-cado egg salad recipe are THAT good, I had to. Second, I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because, for me, 2 avocados/6 eggs would have been too much ‘cado and too little ovo. So, I started with 1 avocado (easier to add than subtract), mashed it, stirred it up with all the other ingredients, and, finally, added 7 cubed eggs. For the egg/‘cado sizes I was working with, this was absolutely perfecto! Other than that, I followed directions like a good girl... mostly... and I ended up with the best egg salad I think I’ve ever made. And basically guilt-free, too (I doubt I used 1/3 c. mayo; I just kinda eyeballed it, scooping in a li’l spoonful). I didn’t have a red onion either, so I just used 1/2 a li’l sweet onion I had. I wonder if a red onion would have made it too quacamole-y for me when what I want is egg salad, not guac. I did add a tbsp of balsamic vinegar, and, yeah, YUM! For the salt/pepper combo, I used a Himalayan salt/garlic mill and some celery salt and Penzey’s California Blend Pepper. It was so good, BEFORE the flavors even had a chance to marry. Perfect amount, too: it filled up a 4-cup Pyrex. This will be my go-to for egg salad from here on. THANK YOU, AngelaandJakers, for inspiring me to, at long last, put the two best fats on the planet together, one animal and one vegetable, into ovo-cado salad! Best of both worlds."

Used Vidalia sweet onions as that's what I had (I prefer sweet onion so usually buy that) and sweet pickle relish as I didn't have sweet pickles. The avocado I had was overly ripe but I used it. The taste that stood out was the relish. I probably won't make this again. It wasn't terrible but it also wasn't exceptional."

I took other people's suggestions, left out the Mayonnaise (El Esposo doesn't need the additional calories, nor do I!) and added a bit of Chili-Garlic sauce to kick it up a notch. I mashed the egg yolks with the avocado, and then cut up the boiled egg whites to give it some texture. Another word to the wise (I'm a southern CA gal, so avocados are a staple), yes, DO put a layer of plastic wrap right over the mix, within the container, then cover the container. the lack of oxygen will keep the mix from taking on a gray-ish color. That's simply oxidation on the outer layer, and it looks a bit ugly. The plastic wrap stops that from happening!"

I have also tried it with tuna and chicken as the protein and it works well with all of them. Great protein heavy dish full of green goodness. I did make one change, but it was minor, instead of yellow mustard, I used Dijon and it really gives a bit more bite to the dish. Great recipe."

Like previous reviewer Dana I also half submerge an avocado pit into any leftover mixture before sealing in an airtight container, to prevent the avocado from turning brown."

"reviewBody": "Loved the idea of using healthy avocados to my basic egg salad. Made 1/2 the recipe to try the concept. Used 3 HB eggs, 1 ripe avocado, which made it creamy and easy to mash, no need to dice. Used 2 Tbs finely diced white onion, 1/4 c. Miracle Whip, which has less cholesterol than mayo and sprinkled dry mustard to taste. Omitted pickle because husband does not like them. Certainly easy to serve on the side for those who love pickles. Used lightly toasted whole wheat bread, which yielded 2 thick and healthy sandwiches and no leftovers to worry about discoloring."

While I love mustard in my egg salad, I might leave it out of this recipe next time and see what I think. And adding a diced, roma tomato would be a nice addition. So many ways to tweak and personalize! :)"

"reviewBody": "Green eggs are good! Even without the ham:). I had tried another recipe on this site that was similar but did not include the mayonnaise and it was very bland. The mayo makes a huge difference. Mine ended up very very creamy, perhaps my avocados were big, so I needed another egg. I was looking for an easy way to get more monounsaturated fat in my diet and egg yolks and avocados are full of it. The mayo even has some. This goes down super easy which is important to me because I am looking for a way to keep weight on and it's been hard (due to nausea caused by medication). I added a small amount of very finely minced celery and used a shallot instead red onion. I also squeezed some lime in. Even with the lime and keeping the pit in with the salad, it goes brown faster than I can eat it. Thank you."
