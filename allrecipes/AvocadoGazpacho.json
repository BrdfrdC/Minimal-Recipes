This is not a recipe that my family would eat, so next time I will half it or give half to my mom, since she would really like this as well. This recipe was light and refreshing. I used fire roasted diced tomatoes and add a pinch of chipotle flakes. Next time I want to add a spring of thyme, basil and I can't wait to use fresh tomatoes. I think adding shrimp, as mentioned in another review would taste great."

"reviewBody": "I also really liked this. The V8 adds some extra flavor. I didn't use the canned tomatoes, as the tomatoes I used were fresh from my garden, so I just used more of them. The avocados were a great addition to gazpacho. I also used REALLY good quality olive oil; it added a wonderful richness to the flavor. Best if left to \"set\" overnight; the cucumbers soften up a bit more. But super easy, and oh so tasty. Would serve this as a beginning soup to a nice meal for company anytime."
