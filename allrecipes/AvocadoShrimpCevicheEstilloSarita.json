The only modification I'd recommend is to let the shrimp sit for several hours in the lime juice or just use cooked shrimp (which doesn't seem to affect the results). The first time I made it as written, the shrimp was a bit raw. Also, if you like things a little spicy like me, adding minced garlic and chopped jalapeno to taste works well."

I also double the Romas and use a whole head of Cilantro. Must use fresh ground pepper and either sea salt or fresh ground pink himalayan. Awesome!"

I also added mango for an interesting sweet note and Yuzu Hot Sauce for a little more kick and citrus notes. I would usually use a cocktail sauce for more kick but I made the sauce with ketchup per the recipe and I found I liked the bit of sweetness it added as it married well with the mango . It was a big hit at my event."

By the way, I do wish some of you reviewers would acknowledge that yours is not the only authentic way. So what if you grew up in Mexico and never ate it with saltines? Our local chef grew up in Mexico and ALWAYS had it with saltines. That doesn't make you right or him wrong. But no matter how you eat it, this recipe is the best!"

I chopped the shrimp to about 1/4\" chunks and tossed with all the other ingredients in a bowl and covered it like you would pudding with plastic wrap and plopped it in the fridge for the night. I stirred it a couple of times and yes, it took a little while to cook. I had to alter for ingredients I thought I had....so used cocktail sauce for the ketchup and Worcestershire, and finely minced jalapeno for a spice because, sadly, no hot sauce. I added a bit of chopped English cucumber because I had it. Well worth the wait! I live in South Texas and I have always had ceviche served with tortilla chips, so that's what I did. I would make this again!!!"

A couple adjustments made- 1) I chopped up the large shrimp into dime sized pieces before adding it to the ziplock bag of lime juice, which really helped in reducing the amount of shrimp required. 2) I didn’t buy enough Roma tomatoes for both the guacamole and ceviche I was making, but discovered you can substitute a can of diced tomatoes and forego the ketchup just fine! 3) I used buffalo wing sauce for the hot sauce (I forgot to pickup hot sauce at the store) and it worked out great! I made about a gallon for our boat dock Cinco De Mayo potluck and this was a hit! So easy to make the day before and allow the flavors to set in!"

"reviewBody": "Made ceviche for the first time today using this recipe as a guideline. I didn't have any cooking of my fresh, raw shrimp issues in the lime/lemon juice (I used half of each). I did add some minced garlic, 1 diced Serrano chile, diced cucumber &amp; shredded carrot. Everything looked fine and tasted delicious until I added the Worcestershire sauce. It turned the juice to a light brownish color that I didn't like. It didn't look fresh &amp; appetizing any longer. I tasted it before adding and it was fine so next time I will leave it out only because of the color appearance. I made it a day ahead to insure shrimp was cooked and veggies marinated in the yummy liquid. Very tasty and will definitely make again. Oh, I did finely chop avocados (2) and added to ceviche."

"reviewBody": "As always, before trying a recipe - I read reviews first to get suggestions. I followed recipe as written, but our stores didn't have large shrimp so got the largest we did have. Cut them into bite-size pieces, put the lime juice on them (about 1 cup juice) and they \"cooked\" in about 30 minutes. Added the tomatoes, 1 full white onion, 2 bunches of cilantro (as we love it)! Then comes the Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, salt, pepper, and hot sauce (added much more as we love spicy) ! Added avocado pieces directly to this mixture, stirred and put back in to chill ! So good! Served as a salad and added crumbled Feta cheese before serving."

I did cook the shrimp in boiling water for a min. till it turned pink and curled and then quickly added it to cold water to stop the cooking. Day 1 I cleaned the shrimp, and added the lime juice, tomatoes, onion, and cilantro. I think 1/2 or 3/4 of the onion is good, the whole onion is a little too much. refrigerate overnight.\nDay 2 I added the worcestershire sauce, ketchup, hot sauce, &amp; S/P. Back in fridge.\nDay 3 just cut up avocado and added it to mix poured shrimp in festive glasses and added a lime wedge what a hit! Delicious!"

Not sure if it makes a difference but I did use half uncooked white shrimp and half precooked lobster tail pieces. Next time I may add some diced jalepeno. Definitely do not serve with saltine crackers. Pairs best with tostadas (or in a pinch, tortilla chips) guests can pile high. Serve with a slotted spoon or there will be too much liquid. Also serve alongside a bottle of Tapatio so everyone can choose their own level of fire. I'm going to play around with this some more as it has the makings of an amazing ceviche! Thanks for posting!"

This recipe was better than the restaurant! I left out the ketchup and the crackers, but that's all I changed. I used some tomatoes from my garden and some Romas from the store. I will most definitely be making this again, and probably for guests! It's sure to wow people and can be made ahead of time.

So I decided at that point to just add the tomatoes onion etc and let bit all marinade an hour... After one hour the shrimp were still completely raw! Still grayish blue color and not opaque at all. I kept an eye on it for another hour before we just ordered pizza and decided to try for lunch the next day. Well in the morning the shrimp were opaque finally, whew. And the end result was absolutely delicious! We even had some the next night and it was still great. Served on tostadas with lots of avocado. For sure if I make this again will marinade the shrimp overnight. I don't understand why it didn't work for me as written."

At first I thought it seemed a bit too sweet."

In the interest of saving time, I used cooked cocktail shrimp but this method really didn't infuse as much flavor into the shrimp as the \"cooking\" in lime juice. Definitely get more avacado and cocktail sauce to serve on the side. I prefer tortilla chips on the side over saltines."
