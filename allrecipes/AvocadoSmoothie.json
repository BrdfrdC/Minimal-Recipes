I only had a fresh batch of unflavored greek yogurt so I adjusted by adding back some whey and vanilla and increased the honey. Next batch I added a little Triple-Sec - not bad but not the way to go. I'm hoping to come up with a 5 star 'cuz this was worth it."

YUM!! As if I wasn't in love with avocado's and their nutritional goodness before! I love avocado but was wondering how it'd taste in a smoothie - super yum. \n\nI'm eating mine with a spoon. I will have to either add more milk/almond milk/coconut milk to make it thinner or invest in a cup that has a wide smoothie straw.\n\nTweaks I made: \n* I didn't use honey (will try it in my next one tomorrow) but added 2 tsp of actual sugar, today.\n* Added 1/2 Banana\n* Added a handful of Strawberries\n* Added a handful of Raspberries\n* Added 1 1/2 Tbs Coconut, Flax seed and Chia Protein Mix.\n\nWill be making this again and again! Thank you for the recipe!!"

"reviewBody": "I am dairy intolerant so I took the advise of many on here and made this with half a banana instead on yogurt, and coconut milk instead of dairy milk. I also used stevia instead of honey and added vanilla. It was a little bland (which I acknowledge is probably my own fault for skipping the honey), but for those in the same boat, I then added several mint leaves and WOW! It is so smooth and creamy, and the mint made it feel like a milkshake. So even though I changed the recipe quite a bit, it gets 5 stars for being the perfect foil to personalize for your own needs and preferences."
