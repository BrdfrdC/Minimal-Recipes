"reviewBody": "Great tasting and easy to prepare. I think part of the overwhelming guacamole flavour some reported is because the spinach measurement needs to be more precise. Just like in baking, using weight rather than volume makes for a better outcome. In case you’re curious, 2 cups of spinach is equivalent to about 4 ounces (by weight) or 113 grams. Trying to cram a leafy vegetable into a measuring cup to achieve the required amount is nearly impossible. Be sure to do all your trimming, washing and drying before weighing. \nI’m sure if you measure more precisely some of you who graded the flavour harshly might reconsider"

That was not the thing to do as it overpowered the flavors of the spinach and avocado. I added more avocado to try and balance the flavors out, then added some cilantro when that wasn't quite enough. So the next time I make this, I will measure the lime. My additions made it taste like guacamole which was ok for our Mexican themed dinner but next time I will definitely follow the recipe. We had this topped on Veggie Burgers (the ones made with oatmeal) from AR and enjoyed the flavors."
