Probably would’ve been better with lemon or more ripe calamansi since mine were still green, making it more sour than sweet. I made half the portion. It’s too salty for me... I’d say it better to just salt to taste. Added chia seeds after spreading the avo. Will try to make it again!"

We would go out into the yard and pick an avocado, warmed by the sun, and bring it inside to make fresh avocado toast. The only thing she did different was use less salt and sometimes use a little dot of mayo instead of olive oil. YUM! Thank you for bringing back the taste of my childhood! =)"

I couldn't find my parsley so I added dried cilantro; lime juice would work here if you didn't have the lemon available. It was a nice light lunch on a hot day. I can see adding an egg for protein, as some reviewers mentioned. UPDATE 8/2/17: Liked it better with lime juice, all ingredients except no parsley or cilantro, and topped with a little crushed red pepper flakes. Simple &amp; delicious."
