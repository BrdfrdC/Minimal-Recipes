"reviewBody": "I used 1 box of pudding and cut the brown sugar by 1/2 c. Other ingredients per recipe. Chilled the dough for 30m before dropping. These came out with a light and fluffy texture, kept their loft for the most part even w/ medium scoop, achieved lightly brown edges at 350 (convection) for 12m. Agree with all the comments - 1) def. requires a good mixer with a lot of horsepower (dough is very substantial; my KitchenAid was chugging, even w/ 1 box of pudding); absolutely needs salt (if you're interested in the classic choc chip cookie taste). Generally, they're good, I liked the loft and cake-ness of them and they are not too sweet w/ reduced sugar. But the taste to me is a bit bland. Def. not that Toll House flavor profile. Maybe the salt or extra vanilla as others advise would do the trick. Not sure I'd go w/ this recipe again but they are absolutely puffy vs. flat which is what I was looking for."

It would be helpful to state how big to portion out the dough. I used a medium cookie scoop and only got 52 medium cookies (about 2 3/4 inch diameter), nowhere close to 72! I would suggest chilling the dough before baking, to prevent them from spreading too much. A simple recipe that the kids can help with."

Less than 6 months even better. 3) Important to cream together white sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla pudding MIX (not made pudding), and butter prior to adding other ingredients. 4) Add a tsp of salt. 5) Refrigerate dough overnight before baking. I also more times than not half the recipe."

My favorite way to make them is half chocolate chips and half peanut butter chips. I only make half the recipe, as my mixer struggles with the full recipe."

"reviewBody": "I adjusted the recipe for 36 and got 72 cookies out of this. I must have used a smaller scoop then they did in their recipe. My husband and I like the smaller size. These are the best cookies we have ever made. He loves cookies and I have experimented with tons of different recipes. The only thing I can think is the pudding gives it a richness that the others cookies didn’t have. I was really skeptical at first of using it in a cookie. I baked them in a convection oven for 12 minutes and they were perfect. Light can crispy on the bottom and edges soft in the middle. My husband told me these are his Ultimate favorite I’ve ever made. I made 2 dozen and put the rest in the freezer. So I hope the second batch will be good too. I usually do this with my other recipes. It’s so nice to have a dessert option that you can make in about 12 minutes. Just pull out a few from the freezer wait for the over to heat up and you have fresh cookies. He is always so surprised when I do this. OMG you made these so quick. It’s also one of his favorite smells in the house (cookies and bread)"

I could feel the taste of the pudding mix which to me was not exactly what I expected given that everybody says it won't be noticeable. I digress. Also, they were too cakey and not as soft as I expected them to be. The result is not bad but definitely is nothing extraordinary. Best Chocolate Chip Cookies from this site yields a much better chocolate flavor without the unnecessary pudding/cake flavor."

The most outspoken person initially thought they looked under done and like dough until he picked one up and ate it. He literally ate 1/3 of the batch. I will say that due to the number of people at the party, I cut the recipe in half. Also, instead of all semi-sweet chocolate chips, I used 1 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 cup of butterscotch chips. I also took the advice of previous reviewers and used a pampered chef stone and in a convection oven. Doing it that way had me baking them for about 18 minutes. They ended up perfect and people asking how much they would pay me to make them for birthday parties. Great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This is my go to cookie recipe! I've made it exactly as written and I've adjusted for different flavors! Perfect everytime! I've changed pudding flavors, ½ vanilla½ almond extracts, or/and different chips. I cook for exactly 9½ minutes for my perfect doneness. I will also cook half and freeze half dough balls for cookies now AND cookies fresh later (cook a few minutes longer for frozen dough balls). You can not go wrong with this perfect recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This chocolate chip cookie recipe wasn’t too bad . I read reviews first . It is true that extra salt and vanilla extract helps . \nI’m a toll house cookie fan and wanted these to be a close match . I made the whole batch . I baked a few at a time on parchment paper. I prefer a small soft chewy cookie. These were soft but too many chocolate chips for me . Next time I will put less in. I did need more salt . My first batch tasted bland , I sprinkled salt on a already baked cookie just to taste the difference and it tasted much better. Overall I did like this recipe. I used my Kitchenaid to mix everything and followed the instructions . I also added walnuts and I placed the dough in the refrigerator 2 hours before baking . They taste pretty good! Thanks !"

Here’s what I did: I used country crock plant butter, added espresso and two tablespoons of vanilla. These cookies are chewy on the outside and cakey on the inside. JUST YUMMY"

I made them as-is the first time and they were wonderful, but my personal preference is a little bit of salt and I always go extra on the vanilla, so I did that the second time and they were even better. I just bought six boxes of pudding to have on hand so I can make these whenever I want."

The bakers were intrigued by the unique flavour though. Without the pudding mix I believe these would have won or maybe less sugar. \nBest chocolate chip - these were too dense (I knew even before baking them the amount of flour was going to be too much). \nBest big fat and Hershey - these were the top contenders. And both very good. It came down to texture preference as Hershey is a drop cookie and crispier whereas best cookies were soft and chewy. \nThis was fun and hopefully helps out"

This recipe is delicious, I am not sure for those who got it wrong, but I used butterscotch chips and caramel pudding with white chocolate chips.

I had no issues on the first try and I look forward to making other combinations with this mixture."

I noticed the last two times I made them, they hardly spread out and came out as chunky lumps and didn't spread out. After at least 15 years of making these, I'm in search of a new recipe. My little granddaughter spilled the beans last time I made them and said that \"my mom said you didn't use enough butter\" but I've been making them the same exact way for eons. I I did get a new stove around 8 years ago and I just noticed this difference this past Christmas and when I made a batch a few weeks ago (inJuly). Has any long-time bakers noticed this? I'm wondering if maybe the butter is not the same as it's always been...they add water to everything nowadays to make a better profit in the supermarkets!"

And after all that, in my opinion, they’re “ok”. Definitely not the best ever."
