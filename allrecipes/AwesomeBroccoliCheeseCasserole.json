I added half a block of cream cheese softened as well as instead of a full cup of mayo, I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream. You can add crushed crackers on top for a crust if wanted. I personally used plain cornflakes crushed on top just because I did not have crackers on hand. That was my preference. But, I had made this recipe before step by step and it's great. My husband loves this and wants it at weeknight dinners. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe."

Only having one head of broccoli, I made a few tweaks to turn into a full one dish meal. Modifications: - 30oz of mixed vegetables (head of broccoli[crowned], one bell pepper[pieces], one large carrot[sliced], 6 small mushrooms[into sixths]) - Half cup mayo, half cup sour cream (thanks everyone) - Sautéed the onions with ~5 cloves of garlic and 4 diced boneless chicken thighs I know I diverged a bit from the recipe, but I think this recipe is great as a base and will 100% be making using it again."

"reviewBody": "I made it mostly as written, but made three changes: 1) used fresh broccoli instead of frozen; 2) subbed in 1/2 cup sour cream for 1/2 cup of the mayo; 3) doubled the amount of onions used, added some shallots as well, and fresh minced garlic, all of which I browned in butter before adding to the mixture. Overall it turned out very well, and was a hit at the Thanksgiving dinner where I served it. I would note that I was fairly generous with the \"salt and pepper to taste,\" and I wonder if those who complain that the recipe is \"bland\" just didn't season it enough. When I make it again, I'm going to try some other variations, including: using cream of broccoli soup instead of mushroom; adding some additional herbs to the mixture, like thyme or oregano; adding a few splashes of sherry to the liquid."

"reviewBody": "I've never made a casserole before (I'm in my 20's &amp; live in Southern California where people don't really eat them) but this is BY FAR the easiest most fool proof dish I've ever made! Like many of the other reviewers, I followed everyone's advice of doing 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream and I think that really is the way to go because it gives it more of a tanginess. I also used \"cream of mushroom with roasted garlic\" soup and would have probably added garlic powder if I hadn't done that. If you want it to be pretty cheesy, definitely add more cheese (maybe 4-8 oz more). I did this as a side dish for Thanksgiving where we already had creamy mashed potatoes, mac &amp; cheese, and stuffing, so this dish was supposed to be our \"vegetable\" so I kind of liked that it turned out to be not overly cheesy/creamy and was heavy on the broccoli. My oven sucks but it baked evenly. However, it needed closer to 1hr and 20 minutes to be fully hot in the middle. I actually ended up forgetting to add salt and it was totally fine without it (and that's saying a lot because I usually put extra salt in things!). I chose to top this with French's crispy fried onions and it worked perfectly. Everyone loved it so I wrote it into my recipe book to make again in the future!"

Only thing I'd do different is add more cheese, but I like a lot of cheese. It kills me on some of the reviews that give one star and they say how they made it. How can you rate a recipe one star if you totally change up all the ingredients so it's like a totally different recipe? Rate it by the way it is written and then make suggestions on the way you like it. I'd give it 5 stars. I like it better than any broccoli cheese casserole I've ever made."

At the last 3 minutes I took it out of the oven, sprinkled some of the shredded cheese and broiled for the remaining time. We all scarfed it. It will be a new staple for us and I'm excited to share it at family functions and pot lucks."

I wished I had cooked it a few more minutes (for my guests) although I prefer a little bit of crunch in my broccoli, so for me it was great, and to reheat the little bit of leftovers it should still be great...not soggy. Great base recipe...thank you reviewers for your input also!"

"reviewBody": "It was pretty good, looking for a low carb dinner and this definitely was a good dish. It was a little bland but nothing some spices couldn’t fix. I followed the reviews and did 1/2 cup of mayonnaise and 1/2 cup sour cream. I also didn’t have sharp cheddar so I used a combination of mild cheddar and Colby Jack and it was a really good taste! Next time I will exclude the eggs though because the mixture of “liquids” baked weird, it was almost rubbery or goopy, I believe that is the egg. I topped it with a butter Ritz Cracker mix and cooked it at 390 for 30 minutes and it seemed to be fine. It was definitely a good dinner for my family."

"reviewBody": "This is definitely a keeper!! I used fresh broccoli and steamed it for 5 minutes before mixing with other ingredients. I also used a homemade cream of mushroom soup instead of canned. Since the broccoli was already slightly cooked, I only baked the casserole for about 25 minutes. Per other suggestions, I will likely do half mayo and half sour cream next time. I also topped with a few crushed whole wheat ritz crackers. Excellent recipe and so nice to do something different with broccoli!! Oh, I cut the recipe in half and it was easily 6 servings instead of 4."

I think it would have been just as great with a whole cup. Definitely not too mayonnaisey if that's what you're worried about. My store didn't have 10 oz. bags of broccoli so I used 3 12 oz bags and I don't think it was too much. Per some of the suggestions I crumbled a few butter crackers over the top along with the cheddar. I also added some garlic and onion powder since I add that to almost any dish that doesn't call for any seasoning...but that's just my preference. Yum!"
