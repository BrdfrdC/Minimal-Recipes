I might try the one that calls for buttermilk (on this website) someday. Make sure your cream cheese sits out for a few hours at room temperature and cake batter will be a little runny cause of the apple sauce, pineapples etc."

We used the KitchenAid shredder attachment for the carrots and it worked perfectly. We also used our KitchenAid to mix the ingredients. This will be our go to baked item from now on. So delicious!"

I drained the pineapple (14 oz can) and used half of the liquid rather than all of it, threw in about 1/2 c raisins, used half brown and half white sugar rather than all white, and cut the amount of sugar in the icing by half. I'd suggest lining the bottom of the pans with parchment paper as the cakes were hard to get out of the greased&amp;floured pans without breaking. It turned out wonderfully - one of the best carrot cakes I've had."

After reading many reviews with people reporting that the cake was oily, I did something different. With my hand-held blender, I whipped the eggs until light yellow and frothy. Then with the blender still running I added the oil in very small increments (roughly a tablespoon at a time) beating well after each addition. The egg/oil combination became a thin mayonnaise. The finished product was not oily at all because the oil was emulsified. I added the carrots to the wet ingredients instead of the dry. I baked the cake in a bundt pan for 55 minutes. The finished cake, with the icing, was absolutely delicious! I gave it 4 stars because it needs a little more spice. Next time I make this I'm going to triple the cinnamon and add more vanilla. I may add some maple extract, too. I love this cake. As others have noted, it is better the next day."

"reviewBody": "I remember first making this cake back in 2005. This is the ONLY recipe i use. I've tinkered with it throughout the years. From adding more sugar, more pineapples, more carrots, 1/2 wheat 1/2 white and it always turns out delicious. I only use 3/4 cup of oil, 1/2 might do but I have never tried that. It gets 5 stars because other than the oil it is a really awesome recipe. I've used cream cheese and Neufchatel cheese and I think the frosting tastes better with cream cheese although the other way is good as well. I recommend sifting the flour 2 or 3 times. King Arthur Flour seems to make it a better tasting cake although i have not made two at the same time to compare, It just seems to be less dense. I have recently started tinkering with the time and temperature. 325 degrees for 50-55 minutes has worked well. This seems to keep the edges from \"overbaking\""

The only changed I was forced to make was less carrots (2 cups)and less oil (1 cup), only because I ran out and I didn't have pecans so instead I added almonds. Also I didn't add the nuts to the frosting I just threw all the nut of the top of the cake, to make it look nicer-ish. The ONLY PROBLEM I had was the frosting was very creamy and wouldn't stay put so I frosted it three separate times and I had it in the refrigerator for at least 3 hrs-ish so I guess just add more powered sugar to the frosting or refrigerate for a least 3 hrs."

My old boss used to make a super moist carrot cake that used pineapples and I've been looking for a recipe that used it ever since. I followed the video recipe version since it used 1/2 the amount of oil than the written recipe. But also made a few small changes.. I increased the amount of carrots to 4 cups, added around 3/4 cup of raisins and decreased the sugar to just a little over 1 cup so it's not too sweet. I baked it for 40min and it turned out amazing! Super moist, not overly sweet, and definitely not greasy at all. Next time, I'm going to check it at the 30-35min mark and see if it's even more moist."

Followed the recipe word by word with utmost care and so disappointed with the outcome. Maybe it needs some whipping and then just fold the nuts and carrots in it. Not even motivated to alter it a bit with suggestions. I just wonder seeing all the five stars as where I could've gone wrong."

If \ni made it again I'd reduce the amount of oil used (maybe 3/4 cup) and substitute something like apple sauce to maintain the moisture. Moist is great, but there are better ways to achieve a moist cake without resorting to so much oil. Also I'd increase the amount of sugar in the cake batter (the cake comes out barely sweet), maybe use 2 cups rather than a cup and a half. I'm not one for really sugary cakes, but this one needs a bit more sugar. \n\nIf you had to make major adjustments to the recipe, how can you rate it five stars? Please rate the recipe as it appears, not how it turned out when you recreated the recipe to make it palatable."

I beat the eggs seperately, then gradually add the oil....whisking until light in color. Then I add the pinapple, carrots, and nuts, and mix. I mix the flour, sugar, and spices together in a seperate bowl, and gradually add to the wet mixture. I find this makes for a lighter, fluffier cake. 2. For the icing, I use 1 stick unsalted butter, and 1/2 \"brick\" of cream cheese. Makes for a lighter, creamier icing. Also, because of the pineapple, this cake MUST be kept refrigerated...the moisture from the pineapple will make it go bad quickly if not kept at a cool temperture..."

Even my bf wasn't excepting it to be perfect the first time, he just wanted me to try, BUT it came out SO freaking good. He was in love, the kids were in love, and I myself was in love with this cake. I know a lot of the other reviewers thought it was TOO oily and moist, but we thought it was just right. Maybe it's just a matter of preference, maybe I just got lucky, but , that was some good cake!
