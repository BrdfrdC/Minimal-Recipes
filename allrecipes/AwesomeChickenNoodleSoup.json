The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was that after all of the time and work to make this, it tasted a lot like Panera's Chicken Noodle soup. I will make it again because it lasts and freezes well. I also like being able to make this with my own fresh, organic ingredients. The fresh organic chicken was moister and tasted fresher than Panera's chicken."

I was looking for a traditional chicken noodle soup, no exciting ingredient or flavor, just the basic soup we all know and love that's stood the test of time. I couldn't believe how utterly tasteless this highly reviewed recipe was! Save yourself the time and try a different recipe because this one was a total flop!"

I did not add the chicken bouillon but instead used chicken stock (primarily because I used less than a gallon of water because of the pot size). Like other comments, I prepared the noodles separately. Overall a very tasty chicken soup."

It was very bland with out the salt, which I added along with pepper. I discovered, although others mentioned it) not to cook the noodle in the broth. I cooked the noodles separately from the soup, but had to put them in the pot as it was being served at a church pot luck. They tasted great although they were very large. Received good complements from those in attendance. A definite keeper."

"reviewBody": "I am a bit of a cooking newbie, so I floundered a bit navigating this recipe. But the end results were superb. So I will share some notes in case other beginners want some tips. First of all, I cut up, skinned and trimmed the chicken in the first step, whereas the directions intend you to just cut the chicken, leaving the skinning and trimming for after it's boiled. Honestly, I thought it worked great the way I did it, and will probably do it that way again. (There is a video on here showing you how to cut up a whole chicken, I followed that.) As others mentioned, I boiled the chicken and the stock veggies (the first, uncut, set of veggies) the night before. In the morning, I scooped the veggies out and trashed them, using a mesh strainer. This was very easy, and I had very little skin, fat or anything else to skim. I was able to pull meat easily off of the bones. For the soup, you do use a new set of veggies, which was confusing for me until I read other reviews. These veggies you will want to cut to the size you will want to eat them in your soup. I did, from other recipes I've used in the past, add a few seasonings to the soup: 1 TBSP each of poultry seasoning, celery salt, garlic paste (refrigerated concoction I buy in a tube in the deli and refrigerate) and kosher salt. My family likes strong flavors and salty soups. We added the noodles later. We froze a bunch in individual sized bowls for school lunches, my kids are very happy. Thanks so much for this!"

"reviewBody": "This has to be one of the easiest and most flavorful chicken noodle soups I've made. I used No Yolks noodles rather then egg noodles, and Better Than Bouillon paste instead of granules, but did everything else as written. The way the ingredients are listed threw me the first time I made the soup, I didn't realize I'd need two pounds of carrots total. My husband's favorite soup is chicken noodle but he has become sensitive to all the salt in canned soup. He likes Panera's, but finds he's at the mercy of whoever is ladling it out as to whether it's brothy or chock full'o chicken and noodles. He loves how full of meat, veggies and noodles this soup is. I make this often through the Fall and Winter."

"reviewBody": "I did try this recipe it was close to my own. I didn't add the lemon grass and I boiled the chicken pieces without the carrots onion and carrots. The reason being is when I strain it not only do I have to sort the chicken but now I have to try not to waste the veggies amongst the bones and skin.So while the chicken is cooking I cook the carrots onions and celery in another pot with a few veggie or chicken bouillon cubes. The veggies are only par cooked at this point and can be added back to the chicken broth with the chicken and they will cook the rest of the way. Cooking the noodles separate is a must unless you like no broth because they will soak it all up, trial and error. I read quite a few reviews and everybody's ideas were very good and helpful!"
