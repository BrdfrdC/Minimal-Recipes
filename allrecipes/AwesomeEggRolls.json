I also used the suggestion of wetting my fingertips in the vegetable liquid instead of making a cornstarch slurry; this was a great time saver. What a wonderful surprise addition these were to my dinner! Recipe made about 14 egg rolls."

I only used 3 cups cabbage &amp; 2 cups book choy. I used everything fresh; nothing frozen. When I made the mix per the recipe, minus the corn starch, I let it sit in the refrigerator for a few hours until I was ready to make. I noticed some people said it didn't have enough flavor, but letting all the flavors sit for a bit helped. I took someone's idea to broil them &amp; they came out perfect. I took the leftover ones, flash froze them then put in freezer bags for the next time we want them. Thank you for this recipe, it's a keeper!"

When the pork was cooked, I added the shredded cabbage &amp; carrots and soy sauce and ginger. I added a teaspoon more of soy sauce (to taste). Filling was perfect! When I made egg rolls years ago, I added a teaspoon or so of peanut butter, the these didn’t need it. Back then I used to steam the cabbage to soften it first, but by shredding the cabbage extremely fine and adding it to the ground pork no need to steam it. Came out excellent. I’m waiting now for the filling to cool so I can roll the wrappers. I left out the garlic because I have a sensitivity to garlic."

Also, I didn't have bean sprouts. Instead of frying I followed some of the other suggestions &amp; brushed them with olive oil and popped them in the oven at 400 for 30 minutes. They taste like restaurant egg rolls without the greasiness."

The shredded cabbage should be disgorged OVERNIGHT otherwise it will be way too watery and makes a big mess; egg rolls can fall apart. Also dangerous if you deep fry! Other problem is the shredded ingredients do not stay together and are really hard to work with. \n\nBest thing would be to cook the cabbage mix, let it cool, then add raw egg and make a paste.\nThe paste should be grated in a processor with some raw egg, rolled in cylinders and stay in refrigerator UNTIL NEXT DAY. then you can start rolling your egg rolls.\n\nI used to work in a Chinese restaurant and I know by experience that it takes 3-4 DAYS to make egg rolls if you follow the steps correctly!"

I used coleslaw mix and cooked it down along with the other vegetables, shallots instead of onions. I added 2 tablespoons each of teriyaki sauce, oyster sauce, ginger, sesame seed oil, and Asian Five Spice. Also, increased the soy sauce to 3 tablespoons. After rolling them, I brushed them with sesame oil and sprinkled them with sesame seeds and fried them in peanut oil. Be sure the oil is very hot before you put the rolls in. That is the key. However, be careful you do not burn yourself with the hot grease. These egg rolls tasted absolutely better than the Chinese restaurant. They are wonderful! The basic recipe here needs help."

Makes a good number of egg rolls as well so if only cooking for 2-4 people no need to double up on anything."

Also diced some onion and added some cut up pregrilled chicken strips and a few sprinkles of Simply Asia Sweet Ginger Garlic seasoning. I don't use soy because of the high sodium so I always sub coconut aminos. These came out great-my husband was a huge fan!"

Instead of shrimp I cooked some small pork chops on my George foreman, chopped them up &amp; put those in the mixture. I didn't have fresh ginger but I did use some dry ginger- that added so much to the flavor. I modified the recipe to four servings for 3 people and after cooking 5 egg rolls I still have 5 left to cook!"

"reviewBody": "my sweet little moonkid wanted eggrolls and this was the recipe she picked. I helped along the way to show her how easy it was to put things together from start to finish. The recipe is very versatile. We normally don't carry can shrimp on hand (because of personal preferences) so used ground chicken and made sure IT was well seasoned and cooked prior to mixing all the ingredients together and we used 2 bags of cabbage/carrot mix to equal the amount of cabbage, carrot and celery written in this recipe. From start to finish rather easy. The wetness to the recipe was very good. As you do NOT want overly wet filling in an eggroll recipe, will make your wrappers extremely weak and will cause the wrappers tear and burst in the frying process. As someone that has made lumpia and eggrolls most of my life, this is a simple recipe for those beginners wanting to make them on their own."

Having made egg rolls many times over the years, the second time I also added the chicken, but also added some Asian Five Spice powder 1/4 tsp or so. Quickly sauted the filling until slightly wilted and the cornstarch became more incorporated. Then allowed filling to cool and proceeded. We like the results much better and the Five Spice gives it a very authentic flavor."

Dipped in some spicy mustard and I quickly forgot all about that restaurant up the street. Already made this twice and will make again! (Also, they're good reheated, an unexpected plus!)"
