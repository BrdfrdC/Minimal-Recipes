"reviewBody": "This is my new favorite pasta salad! I did not have fusilli pasta. Instead, I used large bow-tie pasta and the noodles held up well and looked beautiful. The salami and pepperoni make it for me! I had the deli employee cut the salami and pepperoni as thick as possible and cubed it up myself. I like the thick cubes of pepperoni versus the thin, round slices. I also added a cucumber (dried well before adding) and mild pepperochini. I liked the added color. I did dry the noodles very well and added Good Seasons Italian dressing (that you mix up. Instead of adding plain vinegar to the mix, I use red wine vinegar.) I made it all the night before and in the morning I mixed it up. I know that some said they added another 8 oz of dressing in the morning, but I do not like my pasta salad drenched and felt that all of the other ingredients really shined with 8 oz of dressing called for in the recipe. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I've been making something very similar to this for many years. For the pepperoni, the packaged stuff is very greasy! Go to the deli counter and ask for the sandwich style pepperoni. Ask them to cut off a chunk for about as much as you'll need and dice it yourself. It will taste much better. For those who say the pasta was too dry, you must remember that it acts like a sponge. Make the salad and check on it a few hours later to see if it needs more dressing or not. I sometimes add some pickle juice, pepperoncini juice, etc. to the pasta add let it absorb into the pasta before adding the pasta to the salad. It gives it a nice flavor."

I applied once to the noodles after they were cooked and then again when I mixed the salad. I used Italian dressing mixed with a Balsamic garlic dressing. I added some zucchini and parmesan cheese too. I brought the salad to a family dinner and it was a hit! Everyone took some home afterwards too because I made a double recipe. My husband, who does not like cold salads, even ate two helpings. :)"

"reviewBody": "I have been making this salad for years and it is my go-to for potluck dinners. Mine is a little different ingredients almost every time I make it. What is in it depends on what I have for fresh veggies in the fridge. And instead of meat, I use shrimp and/or imitation crab. I use whole grain rotini for the pasta, and the beautiful color comes from the bright vegetables. Just a few colorful vegetables that I use are sliced green onions tops and all , cucumbers, broccoli, green peas( use frozen and no need to cook them), all colors of bell peppers....green red, yellow and orange, red onion, diced, zucchini squash, salad tomatoes, celery,. I have used several different dressings...Italian, Ranch, Vidalia onion. and have even used ranch mixed with a little Roka (roquefort cheese). I always add more dressing before serving as the pasta absorbs a lot of the dressing. I never bring home any leftovers from potluck."

Bottled Italian dressing is a pretty subjective thing and a lot could go wrong there. As many of the commenters say, there are a variety of ingredient combinations that make for a good pasta salad. That said, I did make the recipe just as stated and with Kraft lite Italian dressing. The meat addition is new for me and was nice. All good but I am still looking for a great scratch dressing for pasta salad."
