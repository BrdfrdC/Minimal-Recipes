I eliminated the lemon pepper because of my husband but would be curious to try next time."

I added frozen peas and corn after it came off the stove and let them heat up while the rice sat for 15 minutes. \nI wish that allrecipes would give authors the opportunity to withdraw recipes to make improvements. Not everyone reads the reviews before making the recipes."

It was like someone just started throwing everything they had in the pantry into this recipe without regards with how it would taste together. I think what really killed it was the Worcestershire sauce. Won't be making this again."

I also substituted gourmet frozen sweet peas, which weren't mushy at all. As a result, it turned out to be a very colourful dish, and it was a big hit with my friends! I had increased the quantity to allow for leftovers at home, and my husband is in love with this recipe. I will definitely be making it again."

Young adult commented on good flavor also and suggested adding eggs. will make again and follow recipe more closely, surely it will be even better. Liked the jalapeno addition at the end, as a side to mix in per serving plate. Tried a plate with Ginger, and another with Turmeric. would prefer to use Saffron next time. this first time, used what was on hand, a couple baby carrots, a can of mixed peas and carrots, frozen red pepper, was out of thyme, saffron and soy sauce, used 50% extra Worcestershire sauce, substituted celery seed for celery, forgot the onion, used all other ingredients, lemon pepper and chicken broth, omitted additional salt and pepper. Giving it a 5 instead of a 4, as my adjustments due to what was on hand when I had a craving for good rice has changed the flavor a little. Prep time was 0, just started cooking and adding."

I didn't have lemon pepper on hand, so used lemon pepper oil instead. Also I used a wild rice medley instead of just white rice. The cook time for the rice took a bit longer, but it worked out as I did it. I also used canned corn but frozen carrots and peas, and fresh red pepper. It was a tastie side dish with our grilled salmon."

"reviewBody": "In all fairness, I am the writer of this recipe. It's been quite a few years since I originally wrote this recipe and have made some changes I thought I'd share. I agree with Naples review about using the frozen peas and corn and adding them at the end. This adds a nice additional texture to the dish. The reason I wrote the saffron as optional is because it is pricey and not a typical household staple. I do agree that it is worth using if you can, it does add a rich warmth and beautiful color to the dish. It's best to steep it first in warm broth. This recipe really lends itself well to adaptation because of the simplicity of its ingredients. Adding turmeric, chili powder, curry, ginger, jalapeno etc. Could transform this to your perfect side. Have fun with it! The leftovers are a wonderful lunch the next day!"

I did add the optional saffron and really would recommend not omitting it. It adds a unique and appealing flavor as well as a rich and beautiful color. I used both frozen corn and frozen peas, adding both, straight from the freezer, at the end - no need to cook them with the rice! This, along with Swiss Chard Sautéed with Lime, was an ideal side dish for Spanish Style Albondigas in a Sunny Mediterranean Sauce, both recipes from this site."
