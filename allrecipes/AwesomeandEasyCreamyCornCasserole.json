It doesn’t bring in much spice, it just adds more depth and flavor to it. One thing I’ve noticed is that I usually cook it for more than the 45 minutes mentioned in the recipe. It usually takes about 1 hr. I definitely recommend this recipe."

I made mixed the day before Thanksgiving and refrigerated it. On Thanksgiving Day I took it out 30 minutes before baking to come to room temperature and it turned out great. \n Everyone liked it, especially the plain eaters (aka, children). If you are looking for a flavor punch, however, you may want to consider adding a pinch of cayenne or green chilies."

I saw it in an email and needed to use up some stuff in my pantry, so I decided to give it a try. I made it exactly as recipe stated, but I felt it was still a little bit jiggly at 45 minutes, so I added about 6 minutes to my cooking time. I used Jiffy cornbread mix and it came out creamy and sweet and corny. Delicious. I will definitely keep this recipe around. I will also be using better corn. I had the cheapest can of corn imaginable and it was still super yummy. Can’t wait for corn on the cob season!!!"
