In the future, I will add more BBQ sauce and bacon. The crust (Pillsbury pizza dough) wasn't great either, so I'll go with another brand. First attempts aren't always great, but I would definitely make this again with a few alterations."

"reviewBody": "I must say this was very tasty! \n\nOn a different note, a few tips from my experience. The 3 cups shredded chicken is in my opinion too much. Even with the value sized 13.3oz canned pizza crust, it was still difficult to fit all of the chicken mixture into the calzones. I can't imagine using the recommended 10oz can. I'd scale it back to 2 cups shredded chicken.\n\nAlso, if I make this recipe again, I would probably forgo the calzone casing altogether and use flour tortilla shells instead. The pizza crust just didn't add enough to the dish to justify extending cook time by 20 mins to let it bake when this would be just as delicious wrapped up in a warm tortilla."

Also, the crust was done perfectly after 16 minutes...I think 25 min would have been way too long.\n\nDipped them in ranch dressing and Oh. My. Goodness. Absolutely amazing! My husband and I loved them; I'm betting you will, too!"

Just rolled them out and cut in half. Baked at 325 for 25-30 min. Easy and delicious!"

I also mixed the cilantro in and added some chopped turkey pepperoni and minced garlic. I just eyeballed the bbq sauce b/c I wasn't sure my husband would be crazy about these so I didn't want to overdo the bbq. I also brushed the tops with some egg before I put them in the oven so they would brown nicely. They looked wonderful and my husband said they were delicious. He doesn't like pineapple but I do so next time I think I'll throw some pineapple in my calzone."

I used a lot more BBQ sauce and cheese so the inside would not be so dry. After removing from the oven I brushed them with garlic butter and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. I didn't have cilantro so I left it out, I believe it would add to the flavor but still excellent with out. Great recipe with the additions my kids and husband loved them. This would even be delish as a pizza and would be much less work."
