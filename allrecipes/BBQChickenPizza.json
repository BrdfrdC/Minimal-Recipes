I made my own pizza dough &amp; put some thyme &amp; basil over it before i prebaked it for 10min. As for the bbq sauce I took normal original flavor bbq sauce &amp; added a bit of wostershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, black pepper, some green (jalapeño) tobassco sauce, &amp; a dash of sugar, then heated it for 30sec in the microwave. For th chicken I boiled a chicken breast in some water with salt garlic &amp; olive oil till is was cooked just enough to shred. Shredded the chicken &amp; mixed it in with some of the bbq sauce. Next put the sauce on the pizza, then the chicken, then red onion slices, topped with mozzarella, then put chopped spinach and cilantro, topped with a bit more cheese and some fresh diced jalapeños. Came out really good!"

If you want deep this you really need to let it rise I use cast-iron skillets let the doughballs rise for about an hour. I used Monterey Jack cheese it does really well contrasting between the sweet barbecue sauce. I also use cast-iron skillets to cook them. Turned out delicious. I will be making this quite a bit there was no pizza left!!!!!"

I already had a pound of frozen/refrigerated pizza dough, so I substituted that, divided it into 3 pizzas and BBQ them - see the pictures. By making three, I was able to not add items that others might not like. I also used sliced banana peppers because that is what I had and they worked fine. I followed the remainder of the ingredients, then I BBQ the pizzas and they came out wonderful. I'm sure you could also BBQ using the pre-made pizza crusts and it would be good, too."

"reviewBody": "Excellent base recipe, though I think the ingredient quantities are meant for 2 12\" pizza crusts. I cooked a couple of chicken breasts in the oven and then diced them and coated the diced chicken with bbq sauce (to keep the chicken from drying out). I usually use Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Chipotle bbq sauce with this recipe, but I have also used regular bbq sauce mixed with a little bit of hot sauce. Also, I think adding some smoked gouda cheese brings this recipe to the next level! As most reviewers have said, leave the little peppers as a side. Great recipe, thank you!"

I added sausage to mine and I didn't put the cilantro on it because the cilantro went bad in the refrigerator but next time I will might add cilantro if I remember because the pizza was so perfect that I kind of don't want to change it even though cilantro would be such a small adjustment."

"reviewBody": "We loved it, but I had to change several ingredients because of our tastes &amp; what was in the pantry: No Cilantro- we don't like that stuff. I used VIdalia onions, plain ordinary barbecue sauce and no peppers, and I guess my eyeglasses were dirty so I saw pepperoni &amp; I substituted diced sausage for that- The cheese was a combination of mozzarella, cheddar, and monterey jack with jalepenos. I sprinkled the chicken breasts with \"Everglades\" and something called \"Mojave Fajita seasoning Red\" before sauteeing in a non-stick pan covered with cook spray &amp; a splash of Chicken broth. I had a Pillsbury crust in the fridge so I pre-cooked that according to directions and after browning the chicken I cooled it and diced to bite size. It was set aside and the sliced onions were sauteed in the same pan with a lil cook spray &amp; chicken broth.Last I added the diced sausage. Finally, I piled the chopped chicken, onions, diced sausage, 3/4 cup o BBQ sauce &amp; another splash of chicken broth back into the pan &amp; stirred until the consistency of the whole thing looked \"right\". I spooned that combo onto the pre baked \"crust\" and piled on all that delicious shredded cheese blend. It ROCKED. It really hit the spot.The Fajita seasoning made up for the difference between spicy &amp; \"plain\" BBQ sauce. I'm going to make it again -closer to the recipe (Still no Cilantro) .IT's a great addition to my recipe library! Thanks :-)"

I used two chicken breast fillets and I just cut them up, sprinkle them with season all and threw them in the skillet. I used about 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, half a small red onion, thinly sliced, 1 cup of the Colby jack cheese and about 1/2 cup Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. I only put banana peppers on my slice because my husband isn't a fan but this was fantastic! Super easy to make, it had wonderful flavor and I think it's just as good if not better than California Pizza Kitchen. I'm definitely making this again! I just wish I hadn't spent so much time messing with the amounts but now I know!"

"reviewBody": "After reading all the reviews I was a bit conflicted about how to proceed. So, I reverted to the half and half approach. On one half of the pizza, I followed the basic intent of the recipe. I used shrimp instead of chicken, a substitution I often make. And, I used a mix of colby and pepper jack for the cheese. I also added a bit of freshly chopped garlic to the crust before adding the sauce. The combination of flavors is excellent and for us the amounts are off. I used only 1/2 cup sauce on the entire pizza and it was plenty - one cup would have been way too much for our tastes. I also cut down on the amounts of all the other ingredients. I guess I tend to take a 'less is more' approach to pizza toppings. Adjusted for the half of the pizza, I used only 1/2 the amount of sauce and probably 1/3 the amount of the other ingredients listed in the recipe. On the second half I subbed a mix of mozzarella and colby, and I left off the pepperocini and subbed carmelized onions for regular. That half was also excellent - a far more mellow approach. Of the two, we preferred the original combination of flavors designated in the recipe - just at much smaller amounts. Flavor = 5 star, amounts = 3 star for an average of a 4."

I really enjoy that flavor of Bull's Eye Original BBQ sauce and it doesn't have any high fructose corn syrup in it. The taste of the BBQ sauce really matters. I also sometimes use mozzarella cheese instead, and it is still wonderful! Great recipe, and I get a ton of compliments on how tasty it is!"

I added 3 strips of cooked bacon (chopped up), and I carmelized the onions in a frying pan before adding them to the pizza. Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Chipotle bbq sauce has just the right amount of heat. I used a shredded 4 cheese Italian mix. I buttered the whole crust, slathered in minced garlic, and baked for a few minutes before adding the toppings. YUM!"

The amount of ingredients stated for this made it taste like a pile of hot garbage. I've made BBQ chicken pizza before and it is much easier to gauge how much you put in it by eye. Good ingredients. Awful amounts. Also I recommend \nbuying dough from a pizza shop. I make (great) homemade pizza frequently and this is by far the worst one I've had. Gauge the ingredients by eye."

I omitted the peppers completely and use an Italian seasoning on it before baking instead of the cilantro, which I rarely have on hand. I eyeball all of the ingredients and it comes out delicious!"

Then mix them together with the bbq sauce. (Use a little less sauce to spread on the crust. And GRILL the pizza on your grill...charcoal or gas...for the absolute BEST flavor.
