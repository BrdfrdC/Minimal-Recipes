Instead i used 1tsp each of garlic powder, onion powder, and lemon pepper plus 1/2tsp paprika, a few dashes of salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper. I also cooked for 3 hours on 250, took them out and drained them, added the BBQ sauce, put the foil back on, lowered the temp to 225, and cooked for 1 more hour. They were falling apart, so tender and juicy. The first time was just for my small family of 3. The second time I made for my family and my fiancee's coworkers so i tripled the recipe. They all LOVED these ribs. A crowd pleaser for sure!"

I followed the recipe exactly, which is unusual for me because I don't always have all the ingredients! At first, I wasn't wild about the lemon taste, but I decided it was a nice change. 2 hours at 250 covered tight with foil, and I didn't add any liquid. The thin slices of lemon provided enough with the ribs. 1 hour at 250 with Sweet Baby Ray's. Served with sauted brussels and french fries. Can't beat the easy!!"

After draining and adding the barbecue sauce, I sprinkled with smoked paprika and roasted covered for 1 hour. Added a honey glaze and finished on the grill for about 5 minutes per side. This was a hit and although I made more than enough to have leftovers, there were none. These were so tender!!! Delish!"

I kept the ribs covered in foil for all of 20 minutes of the cooking time. I did not add any water and had plenty of liquid in the roaster pan after first bake. I did not feel the lemon flavor came through overly strong. Also confused why people refer to bones in their reviews. Country style pork ribs are boneless and cut from the shoulder or loin; if you are using bone-in ribs they are not the cut of meat this recipe calls for which may cause poor results. Mine were not falling apart but were very tender! Used sweet baby Rays BBQ sauce-yum!"

It took forever to get them tender and I will never use this particular method again. I knew they should have been covered but I thought I'd go by the recipe. Big mistake. They took over 6 hours to get to the tender of stage of 190°-200°. Be warned ... you must cover them first, especially if they don't have much fat on them."

I however, do not love spicy foods. I did try them, but by the time I had finished that 1st rib My eyes and nose were both watering!! Hahahha"

Set the oven at 375 and it was cooked at 1hr and 45mins. Mixed 1 cup of coke with 2 cups of bbq sauce and poured it all over the ribs, placed it back in the oven covered for another 30 mins. You will have extra for the sauce, you can warm it up for those that want some dipping. Don't forget to check the internal temperature, preferably to hit 180. It was super delicious!!!"

They don't need low and slow. Just cook them until 130º and let them rest. You can stove top them in a pan. Save yourself some time."

Removed lemon slices and drained liquid, added barbecue sauce and rewrapped in aluminum foil and baked for another hour). Turned out tender and delicious. P.S. I used a digital meat thermometer to check that they were cooked to the correct temperature. (The acid from the lemon slices helps tenderize the meat and provides moisture too)."
