I would definitely recommend this change as I felt it gave the recipe gourmet flavor instead of what I think could have been good but everyday supper food. I used 4 garlic cloves, but you'll want to use less if you aren't a super garlic lover like me. Of course you could add a bigger variety of ingredients to the salad and that would be good too, but its perfect as it is and tastes just like an exceptional BLT sandwich. I'll definitely be making this recipe over and over again."

The only thing I did differently was use a little grated Parmesan; maybe two tablespoons; onion powder as suggested by other reviews and some co-jack shredded cheese. I didn’t add the bacon, croutons or shredded cheese until I was serving it and like other reviews suggested, I didn’t mix in all of the dressing at once because I knew there was too much for two of us to eat. I mixed what was left the next night and had it alone for dinner, though I had a little thick cut deli turkey to it. I will make this again, especially the dressing which was very good."

Also kept the bacon separate for those who do not eat pork. Added cucumbers!! Delicious!!! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!"

Not a fan of so much garlic powder. 1/2 t. was fine."

"reviewBody": "I have made this salad for so more years than I can remember. I don't add milk to the mayo since I wouldn't add it to the mayo when I make a BLT for dinner, the bread would get soggy. Depending on the size avocados I have on hand I add between 1 or 2 cut in a large dice to the salad or 1/2 to 1 whole mashed onto the bread for each sandwich. As much as we like garlic I never put garlic powder on a BLT so I don't add it to this salad. I have only home made mayo in the house made from an old recipe put out by the Wesson oil Company back in the 1930s. My Grandmother made it, my Mom made and this old man still makes it. It takes about 1/2 cup total, I think 3/4 of a cup would drown out the taste of everything else. Since I make our BLT sandwiches using a local cracked wheat sourdough I cut the same brand of sourdough into cubes and add them to the salad untoasted when I am ready to serve it. Try dicing your bacon before cooking it to whatever degree of doneness you like it, it seems to cook quicker that way. Since this is all we are going to have for dinner the whole recipe makes 2 nice satisfying servings"
