"reviewBody": "Yum! I LOVE Kahlua and Bailey's (especially Bailey's!), so it's no surprise I liked the two paired together. :) My husband opened a bottled of Guinness to go with dinner. I love the way a stout looks when poured into a glass and REALLY wanted to take a sip... but didn't (I HATE beer). Other than needing to work on my \"technique,\" this really hit the spot. I didn't get a nice \"head\" as I'd hoped, but this went down so smooth, I didn't care lol! Hard to believe, I don't own any shot glasses so I had to use a juice glass instead. I think that's why I didn't get the effect I was hoping for. Thanks for sharing your idea, William. This was really fun to try! :-)"

"reviewBody": "This is a really great idea, fantastic presentation (I always need to pour my cream over a spoon for separation). It's a sweeter shot than we usually take but the novelty makes up for it and most everyone can handle them at a party. I agree with the tip about shaking the liqueur separately with ice (at least the coffee), it's better cold and you don't notice the super-sweetness as much. Thanks for sharing."
