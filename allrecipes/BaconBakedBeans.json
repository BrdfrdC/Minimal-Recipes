"reviewBody": "6.16.18 We’re just not into overly sweet these days, I knew the amount of sugar would be too much for us, so I did modify the recipe by cutting the amount of sugar in half, and used Truvia® Brown Sugar Blend. Not sure why I never thought about pre-cooking the bacon, but I did for 30 seconds on high in the microwave. Wow, what a difference that made, really reduced that puddle of fat you usually end up with when baking beans. The apple does give the beans a little different texture and was an interesting flavor, but subtle. We like our beans kind of soupy and cold, so I cooked only for 30 minutes, cooled them, and into the fridge. These were good, we enjoyed them."

Definitely if using canned beans with sugar or honey, I would also omit the sugar. I too crumbled the bacon up after frying fully on the stove top. I also placed five whole strips within and cooked in oven for 35 minutes. Actually, I would try sautéing the onions on stove top so this way I can add the bacon and onions to the beans and heat up on stovetop, eliminating the time to cook in the oven."

I used onion soup mix instead of fresh onions and added a little bit of garlic powder. When these came out of the oven, I removed the bacon and stirred the beans, as there was a good amount of fat sitting on top. Maybe I didn't pre-cook the bacon long enough to remove enough of the fat? I'll try these again, but probably cook the bacon completely and crumble into the mix."

"reviewBody": "The beans are very sweet and sugary so be careful what you add as a main dish. I made the mistake of making meatloaf which also had a lot of brown sugar and bbq sauce. Other than that the beans were great. I didn't have enough pans to make it in so I did it on the stove and it was still really, really good."

To cut back on the calories, I used Splenda's Brown Sugar Blend. I used half of the sugar that the recipe called for. They turned out great. I'll be eating more baked beans. the apples added a wonderful flavor to them."
