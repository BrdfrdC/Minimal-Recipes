This time I cut back on the sunflower seeds and raisins to 1/2 cup each because the extra just end up at the bottom of the bowl wasted. I also used agave nectar 1/2 cup instead of sugar and splenda because it's a natural sweetener and it's safe for diabetics. I also like to use apple cider vinegar or red wine vinegar and red onion is a must!"

I did not cook the broccoli, added a dollop of the horseradish mayo as one reviewer suggested (GREAT idea), added salted cashew pieces instead of sunflower seeds since I didn’t have the seeds. Definitely skip the artificial sweetener!! You don’t need it. I always cut the amount of sugar for a recipe in the beginning. Taste it and see first before adding the full amount. Great summer side dish in my opinion!"

The only changes I made was quickly blanching the broccoli ( draining well on paper towel), using golden raisins and craisins ( for more color ) , and instead of all the sugar (plenty of sweetness in the raisins and craisins ), I mixed the mayo with a splash of Hendrickson's Sweet Vingar and Olive Oil dressing . Oh my!!! \nThank you, Ruthie Joyce!\nSo many compliments and requests for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Very tasty but sweeter than it really needs to be. I lightly steamed the broccoli, which took the harsh edge off, but it didn't occur to me until it was too late that by steaming it I'd probably reduced the need to use sweeteners to mask its flavor. Also, I've read that you should eat foods rich in Vitamin C at the same meal that you eat foods rich in plant-based iron, because the Vitamin C helps the body utilize the iron, so I had a glass of orange juice with the salad and between the two of them it was a super-sweet little meal."

I had to serve the sesame seeds on the side since hubby can't have seeds or nuts but all the flavors were there. One issue I had...I wish the recipe gave cups of broccoli. I bought a bag. Started with 1/2# trimmed but had to add some more after adding dressing. I would recommend 1# of trimmed broccoli flowerets. I think I would even like to try adding some diced chicken. The recipe is very versatile. Thanks for sharing."
