"reviewBody": "I followed the recipe exactly except I minced some shredded Mexican blend cheese (since it was such a small amount and we keep that shredded cheese on hand) and finely chopped the bacon. I think the textural difference will help. I've only tasted a little of the yolk mix (celebration is later today) but it was delicious! I'm not a fan of normal deviled eggs, made these for my keto-dieting son, but I would take these any day!"

"reviewBody": "Delicious! I used a quart size freezer bag to mash the 9 egg yolks (a sandwich bag is too weak and broke the last time); then I added finely shredded sharp cheddar cheese and 4 slices of turkey bacon bits (equal to approximately 1/4 cup); I added the mustard to the light Duke's mayo then add to the yolk/cheese/bacon mixture. I sprinkled extra bacon bits on top. I have made it without the cheese and was asked to never omit it again. This is definitely a favorite! I have found Oscar Meyer turkey bacon and light Duke's mayo taste the best together."

I needed to use boiled eggs that I'd pre-purchased before they expired. I just sliced in half and popped out the yolks and 10 minutes later, they were done!"

My slight alterations to this recipe is I use 1/2 tablespoon of mustard and I use Dijon. DON'T use spicy mustard...really leaves a nasty taste. And I use 2/3 cup of HELLMANNS mayo......not imitation. Also, chop the cheese and bacon with a palm chopper really well. If you pipe your filling like I do, the finer the cheese and bacon, the easier it will be to fit through the tip."
