I ended up with a pudding consistency so I just kept adding milk until it looked and felt like gravy. I crumbled 2 slices of bacon into it, some salt and a bunch of pepper. It was amazing! I really liked that the recipe was so basic and gave me less milk than I needed. There has been so many recipes that tell you a certain amount and things turn out runny and all messed up. High Five for the person who posted this! It was perfect for 2 people."

"reviewBody": "This is the perfect way to make bacon and sausage gravy. Some meats are pretty lean though so you do need to make sure there is enough fat to match your flour, tbsp to tbsp. This is THE GRAVY recipe. Occasionally I add a tsp of sugar to change it up a little, other than that, this is the only country gravy recipe I ever use. In the cases where there may not be enough drippings just add the appropriate amount of butter (not margarine-EVER). I always use a fork for the stirring but a whisk is the best tool. It does require a lot of whisking and make sure you cook the flour for about 2 minutes prior to slowly whisking in your milk."

You can increase or decrease the amount of gravy you need, but keep your preportions equal....Ex. 4 Tbsp bacon Drippins, 4 Tbsp flour, 4 cups milk, etc.... Hope this helps!"

Stir it to a smooth paste (I like to let mine just start to get a very light tan color) long enough to cook the \"raw\" taste out of the flour. (if you don't have quite enough bacon grease, for the times I use the saved grease .... I stir in just a bit of butter) Add the milk slowly, while stirring, and let it cook to thicken. If it gets too thick... stir in a little more milk ... if it is too thin, just cook it a little longer while stirring. \nIt takes a little practice, and gets to be easier as you just learn the \"feel\" for it!\nI said I thought he was crazy???? It didn't take me long to fight him for my fair share!!!\nNow I am hungry... off to make some eggs and gravy!!!"

"reviewBody": "I'm a yankee girl and don't know much about biscuits and gravy, but this recipe was easy, tasty, and no where near as salty-tasting as I was anticipating. I used five thin slices of bacon that produced a lot of grease. After removing the bacon, I turned off the heat, gradually added the flour, then started the heat up again as I added the cold milk (I eyeballed the milk, not sure if I used more or less than a cup, just watched for the gravy to lighten in color and reach the appropriate thickness). I had accidentally let the bacon cook a little long and worried that it might taste a bit burnt, but it didn't! Used Anne's Baking Powder Biscuits I recipe from this website because of the (lack of) ingredients I had on hand. Though not necessarily a \"traditional\" southern breakfast, it was still tasty and my Texas-raised partner was satisfied."

"reviewBody": "this reminds me of my father in laws gravy, even though he does it quite differently. i've made this several times, if you follow the recipe exactly your gravy will turn out with a nice consistency, if you are like me and add extra bacon it might not from too much grease. If you like it thinner, add more milk because it thickens up pretty quick. nice, simple, and just what i had been searching for, thank you"

Four slices of thick center-cut bacon yielded plenty of grease for the bacon flavor. I added about a tsp of fresh cracked black pepper, and needed nearly a level tbsp of kosher salt. However, we did not crumble and incorporate the bacon - we just ate it =D I think that's why we needed a little more salt than expected. I will be making this again!!"

I pretty much doubled all ingredients to make enough for my family. I had never made gravy from scratch before this and I found the directions simple and easy to follow. Other than accidentally over salting it a bit, it tasted delicious. I added a couple dashes of steak seasoning. Next time I will use less salt and pepper and more steak seasoning. I will 100% use this recipe over and over again. Reviewers claiming their gravy was \"bland\" and/or \"flavorless\": uh, it says season \"to taste\" ??? Right?!"

I also seasoned it with some onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, red pepper, some sea salt, and a lot of black pepper."

Even if you had her sitting right their next to you it wouldn't guarantee that you'd be able to make it! Gravy is difficult to learn at first, but once you've learned it you never forget it. I can't tell you how many times I ended up w/ a skillet of lumpy \"oatmeal\" \"elmers glue\" etc.... It's all in the process of learning. There is no exact amount of flour, oil, or milk to put in. It's just kind of one of those eyeball things. Sure you can have a pretty good gestimation. Oh and there is no set time on how long it takes for the oil/flour to get to the right consistency,or when to remove from heat. If your new to this you're bound to end up w/ a skillet full of lumpy mush. If not way to go you mastered gravy a lot faster than most of us. So the moral of this rant is chill out peeps and quit criticizing her! I give her 5 stars for having the melons to put her recipe out there. You go girl!"

Or when browning the flour put milk in microwave for 2-3 minutes, cooking the flour for at least that long, the more you cook it the more the flour taste goes away. Having the milk teepeed (sp) or slightly warm helps keep the flour from getting lumpy. I use 1 1/2 tbls of fat and flour for every cup of liquid."

I finally mastered the souther baking powder biscuit, and this gravy made him sigh with relief! He loved it, and it plated well atop the fluffy biscuits that I made! I could not think of a way to change it for my southern boy! It has everything that a biscuit gravy needs... The bacon bits to add sustenance, a creamy body, and a simple flavor. I did add freshly ground pepper (a must, never use the pre-ground stuff) and a tad bit of paprika--about 1/4 teaspoon. Otherwise, what a great and simple recipe. Thank you Nikki for this recipe, my southern mother-in-law is jealous and that woman breaths bacon!"

"reviewBody": "I really wanted to like this because my family loves sausage gravy and we love bacon. But we did not care for this at all. The gravy itself was not flavorful and adding the bacon bits just made it very salty overall without adding much flavor. When adjusting the seasoning, taste spoonfuls WITH the bacon, not just the gravy, because the bacon has a huge effect on the overall saltiness. I used 2 T. fat, 2 T. flour and about 1.5 cups skim milk to achieve the right consistency. Let gravy \"simmer\" between stirring to get it to thicken up. I was hoping to get more flavor payoff for the fat+salt price you pay with this recipe. We would have preferred eating our bacon and biscuits solo (more flavor, less trouble and mess). It's a fun idea but didn't work for us."

Many of the suggestions below hold true for any good gravy, particularly about having the same numbers for your proportions: your drippings and flour should be exactly the same amount, so as to make a proper roux, and the milk should be incorporated slowly, in small batches. Remember too that you should shoot for a consistency slightly thinner than what you want your end result to be, as it will thicken a bit on standing."
