I did 1/2 tspoon of garlic powder &amp; 1/2 tspoon of pepper with a whole ranch seasoning packet! i didn't use tomatoes because I dont like tomatoes but used jalapeno and green onions with the addition of the olives! this was so delicious! but after you mix the pasta be SURE TO LET IT CHILL for atleast an hour. it makes it taste way way way better."

I've followed the recipe pretty much but use a pound of bacon and also add one 10 oz. can of white chicken meat, diced, and 3 or 4 chopped green onions - and didn't use garlic pepper. We don't have 4.25 oz. cans of black olives here, so I either use one 3.8 oz. or two 2.25 oz. cans. I think the recipe is spot-on using sharp cheddar cheese. I've become a fan of using sharp cheddar when mixed with other ingredients, but prefer mild if I eat it plain. This is a very tasty dish, and my husband loves it."

I did alter it a little by omitting the olives and adding grilled chicken. I also used ranch dressing in the place of the mayonnaise so it had a ranchier flavor. 10/10, will definitely make it again."

I used 1 packet of ranch dressing and really think it would have been better with 1 1/2 packets. I did add my bacon right before serving so it wouldn't be soggy as other reviews indicated and I added more milk since it became a little dry after refrigerating overnight. Good taste overall!"

I found that were others who did not eat it based on the olives or picked them out. However, there were also many that loved them so I'd rather appeal to both groups and split the output. My wife loved it and had it for lunch twice. I did modify the tomatoes to using whole grape tomatoes as the original author suggested after modifying it herself. I agree that made it hold up a lot better."
