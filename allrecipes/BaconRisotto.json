I wanted this as a main dish for the two of us, so added peas, plus fresh mushrooms I needed to use up. Lots of stirring, but not otherwise difficult. Very tasty for this winter night!

I make it as stated with the exception of the bacon - instead of frying the bacon I just cook it in the microwave and then cut into pieces. It's near impossible to dice raw and I've not found any pre-diced bacon in the store. The first time I cooked I thought I had made a mistake because when adding the chicken stock it looks like soup! But it just takes time for the risotto to absorb the stock. Anyhow, this dish is simple and excellent. Easily a 5-star recipe."

First off I didn’t have the rice so I googled it and exchanged the rice for basmati rice. I doubled the recipe and used 1/4 c. Parmesan cheese and 2 c. Shredded Mozzarellas cheese. I also added peas to the last broth add in, but next time I think I’ll add it at the end. Really great stuff! At the end I served it with crumbled turkey bacon. Yum!"

My pan was not deep enough though and it does need a lot of attention. I used the bacon grease instead of some of the butter, and didn't really measure the onions or garlic, but it was awesome! I made it for me to eat over several days, as I had just had dental surgery and was limited on choices. It was ALL gone within an hour thanks to 4 other members of my family that loved it:-/. This will be a keeper for my family. Is it safe to double this kind of recipe given that I have a large enough pan?"

Our chicken stock was home made, though, so perhaps a little weak and thus needed to add extra salt at the end to give it some serious flavor! Overall, it was a very good recipe that we'll make again. 4 1/2 stars!"

BUT looking through reviews, with folk saying 'hubby went back for thirds,etc', I halved the recipe for 2 of us, but added extra rice, just in case. It STILL wasn't enough for 2. Would make again, but would use the original measures (i.e. for 4 servings!)"

Pancetta is saltier than bacon so ease up on the salt :). Also added parsley with the cheese and parsley to garnish. I tend to have to add an extra cup of chicken broth so I usually up broth to 6 cups."

For my first time cooking, it came out perfect and come on, who doesn't love bacon in almost anything. Great recipe!"

I used brown rice which requires more broth and stirring. I used beef, and vegetables broth instead of chicken stock. Also I added some cream and cream cheese. It took almost 40~50 minutes and a lot of stirring since I used brown rice. But Brown rice is the healthier alternative. It was absolutely creamy and tasty. My husband loved it."

My family loved it when I made it for them. The next night my mom made it again. Use low sodium chicken stock because the bacon makes it salty enough."
