"reviewBody": "Made these to pair with some Maple Bacon Moonshine Old Fashions. Everyone enjoyed this unique pairing. Before wrapping the cherries in the bacon and sticking them on the skewer, I smoked the cherries for an hour on my Traeger @180 degrees. Then wrapped in bacon, placed on the skewer. I upped the heat to 400 and threw the skewers back on. After 10 minutes, I turned them over and let them go another 10. I was using thick cut bacon, so I increased the heat to 450 for an additional 10 minutes before pulling them off the grill. Let them cool, and garnished our signature cocktails. They were a hit!"

"reviewBody": "Overall, i was very surprised with the flavor of this. It actually tasted pretty good. I could see this being served at a wine/cheese type party or just a party with finger foods, as it tasted great at room temp. My oven has broil temperatures so i broiled mine at 475. I checked after 7 minutes and noticed the tops were crisp but the bottoms were soggy so i flipped them and cooked for 7 more minutes(14 min total). I also didn't use toothpicks, the bacon stayed wrapped just fine, and found i only needed 1/3 of a strip of bacon per cherry..and could probably cut that back to 1/4 if you were making these to feed a crowd :)"
