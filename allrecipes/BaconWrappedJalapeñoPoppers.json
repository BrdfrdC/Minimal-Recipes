You can use the tool to cut off the top and core the jalapeno, and then you just rinse out the remaining seeds, stuff, wrap, and either bake, grill offset, or smoke them. I have some in the oven right now, just at a lower heat because dinner is not for a few hours."

We chopped them up in lots of things tuna and egg salad Just cream cheese in crackers lol Wrapped with bacon- these are absolutely the best. You have to like heat! pre cooking bacon helps to make cooking time shorter if serving as appetizers. I saw someone else suggest. Pre-cook your jalapenos some before stuffing and wrapping too. To save you time. Then stuff cover and wouldn't take too long to bake grill or fry when ready. So you can spend more time with family or friends!! Just saying Enjoy the moment Thank you for sharing this recipe Always a favorite in our house!"

Baked a full 40 min with a quick broil at the end to sear the bacon. Served with my homemade salsa ranchera. Bam!!

"reviewBody": "These were delicious, and easy. I learned a few things the first time - the filling may or may not be enough if the jalapeños are larger. If they're larger then they've spent more time on the vine, they're going to be hotter, too, in spite of removing seeds and ribs. Be forewarned. For the comfort of my guests, and to be more of a \"tidbit\" size, I'll look for smaller peppers going forward. Mine were about three bites each.\n\nAlso, without thinking I used thick sliced bacon (which I'd par cooked to be sure it was just right) and it's a little unwieldy for winding around the pepper. I won't make that mistake again.\n\nAnd though it doesn't state in the recipe (that I noticed), I think it helps to secure the little baby with a toothpick. Just don't forget to the guests.\n\nThese were delicious. So much better than any store bought nosh. I'd make again in a heartbeat."

"reviewBody": "I love making Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos and came here to double check the temp and times of my cooking to see if it was good. This was very helpful and the pictures of the dish looked amazing. The poppers turned out great. I did read a comment or two on here stating that the poppers were too spicy. While I love spicy, my husband doesn't as much. So to help cut back on the heat I wanted to write to help others as well.\n\nNot saying no one did these but it helps a lot if you haven't. Normally I open the jalapenos and remove all the seeds and the white parts of the jalapeno (the veins), after that I throw all of my jalapenos into cold water and leave them soaking for 10 minutes, then I get rid of that water and re-soak them for another 5 giving it some agitation to loosen up any seeds and to dilute the capsaicin (chemical responsible for spice) in the jalapenos. and if you want to be extra sure during the first rinse add some vinegar into the water, probably 1/10th of the water used and the vinegar will help further reduce the heat. That will make your experience better, just make sure to agitate the jalapenos a little more during the second soak if you use vinegar to lose any vinegar taste. Hope this helps anyone looking to take out the punch out of these amazing Jalapeno poppers."

Here's my version:\nStuff the jalapenos with salmon or chicken instead of cheese.\nI wanted this as an entrée, with rice, so I lined the pan with parchment paper, then tore up some curly leaf kale and put it on top of the paper. Then I laid the stuffed jalapenos on top of the kale and baked per directions, although I had to bake it about 10 min. longer. The kale came out crispy and made a nice side to the peppers. The kale didn't absorb much grease either, but I did use good quality uncured bacon."

"reviewBody": "My jalapenos were large so it took about 10 extra minutes to bake them. I also like to broil them for a few minutes at the end to make the bacon crispy. Sometimes I add taco or cajun seasoning to the cream cheese mixture and I prefer maple bacon to cut some of the heat. Great recipe. Using gloves during prep is imperative! Enjoy!"

"reviewBody": "These are great. My family always requests Bacon wrapped jalapeños at every family event. I've been making these for over 15 years. I like using either jalapeno cream cheese or chive and onion. The trick to the peppers being too hot does not stop at just removing the seeds and veins, if you don't like overwhelming spicy jalapenos, it is imperative that you run them under COLD water for a few minutes. Trust me this is the trick. It takes about 40 minutes at 350 to make the peppers nice and soft and nice crispy bacon."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe, although IMO the \"12 slices of bacon\" was optimistic. It takes almost a full slice of bacon to wrap half a jalapeno, and the recipe calls for 12 jalapenos -- which is 24 halves. It took me much closer to 24 slices of bacon to wrap all the poppers.\n\nAs others have noted, the 400F for 15 minutes is wildly optimistic. 400 in my oven took almost 45 minutes to cook them. I did make a second batch in a convection oven, and then ~20 minutes at 400 was enough.\n\nOther changes: 1) I pushed a small slice of garlic into the cream cheese of each popper. That worked great. 2) I also made a batch where I pushed a very small chunk of BBQ brisket (1/4\" x 1/4\" x 1\") into the cream cheese (along with the garlic). These things were awesome. My guests preferred them greatly over the ones without the brisket.\n\nI will definitely be making these again..."

If your Jalapeno seems to hot then try this; Clean Jalapeno well under cool water removing all of the insides then soak the pepper halves in chilled water for about 10 minutes before drying them out and stuffing them. This will help to take the heat out of your pepper."
