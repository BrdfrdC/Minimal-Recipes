I used 8oz of cream cheese, a cup of shredded Mexican cheese, 3 green onions, and some garlic powder. I needed 2 pounds of bacon because I used two big containers of shrooms. So Iâ€™d double the shrooms count and bacon to account for all of the stuffing. Thin and long bacon works the best. Boom."

The only change we made - was that we left out the chopped onions and I highly recommend slightly cooking the bacon before wrapping mushrooms. If you don't, the bacon is too soft and it tastes better with a little crunch."

I used 2-16oz containers of white mushrooms and this was more than enough filling. I had to cut my bacon up a little bit to make up enough pieces for all the mushrooms. But it worked. And I bought some garlic and cheese croutons, smashed them up a little bit, and added that to the cream cheese mixture for more flavor. Easy to make app. Would definitely do it again."

The bacon we had trouble wrapping around and in some we just stuffed the bacon into the top. Next time we'll make sure when we clean the mushrooms to pat them dry and not wash them, they took on a LOT of moisture and released a lot of it, but it was delicious. We will make it again but make some adjustments, great starter recipe for a newbie to mushrooms"

Let them soak in this for at least 4 hours before cooking. These can also be cooked on the BBQ grill. I also always use 1/2 strip of bacon per mushroom."

Give a hint to all that think the filling is too much, clean the mushrooms of the inside membranes of the mushrooms. The membranes can make the mushrooms soggy when they are being baked. I also cook the bacon brown but still pliable before I place the mushrooms in the oven. If you place the mushrooms in a cold oven and let everything warm up at the same time, the shrooms cook more evenly."

I found that one 8 oz, pkg of cream cheese will stuff 6 cartons of mushrooms if you do the following. Cut up one bundle of green onions like chives and add to cream cheese. Chop up half the mushroom stems (3 cartons worth) and add to cream cheese. Finely chop 4 de-seeded and de-veined fresh jalapeno peppers and add to cream cheese. Add garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper to cream cheese to taste. I also used the thin bacon and found that while wrapping around the mushroom, overlay the bacon slightly over cream cheese to keep cream cheese in the mushroom. This has been a great hit for party gatherings. Thanks!!!!"

"reviewBody": "I have made stuffed mushrooms simular to these for years. It is always a request that I bring them as an appetizer when we have a family dinner. I always use the small button mushrooms here is what I do differently. I cook the bacon,drain and crumble it. I use the small tub of soft cream cheese with chive and onion to which I add the crumbled bacon. Season with a little salt and pepper. Stuff the mushroom then bake them in the oven for about 20 minutes. It's a real challenge not to eat all of them."

"reviewBody": "These are the best stuffed mushrooms ever! I've been making them for a couple of years, and everyone asks for the recipe. Any kind of onion works, but I prefer vidalia. The trick w/ this recipe is to crunch up the bacon. I usually bake them at around 400 for 20-30 min. (depends on how big the mushrooms are), then pour out the juices/grease and finally put them under the brioler for a few minutes. You can even cook/drain them ahead of time and just rehaet and broil~~they are awesome!!!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe was the biggest hit at the Super Bowl party I went to this year! Everyone was amazed by how great something so simple to make tasted. Two suggestions/observations...\n1) I had doubled the whole recipe because the number of people at the party was extensive. I found that, even with putting a generous amount of filling in each mushroom, I had at LEAST half of the cheese mixture leftover. I would say, cut the filling amount by half, or make the one batch recipe for the cheese and then double your mushrooms and bacon.\n2) I used the thick cut bacon, which turned out really well because there it was easy to roll and you had a substantial amount of meat per piece. However, this increased the cooking time from 20 minutes to about an hour.\nExcellent recipe though! I will make it again and again!!! :)"

My dad declared that they needed more bacon and therefore, he used a whole strip of bacon for each mushroom when he made them. I think they are perfect as is and have made no changes to the recipe. They are extremely easy to make. The only suggestion I have is to use a broiler pan so the grease from the bacon drips down. The first time I made these mushrooms, they were swimming in bacon grease, but they were still very tasty. Highly recommended!!"
