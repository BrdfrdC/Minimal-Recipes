The only thing I did differently was pre-cooked the mushrooms in the oven for 15 minutes, poured off the extra liquid and then added stuffing and cooked an additional 15 minutes. I also used another reviewer‘s tip and used a melon Baller to take out the stems. Lovely idea! Excellent recipe! Will make again! Thank you!"

The original recipe is good, but some people may find it a little bland. If so, try adding garlic, parsley, parmesan and oregano to the stuffing. If you're worried about it being greasy, you can add some bread crumbs, too. Either way, it's a great snack or side dish for a light entree."

So one recipe of the filling for me filled double the mushrooms. They were great, however. Everyone loved them!"

I wanted a little creamier stuffing than just melted cheddar would give so I added 4oz of cream cheese, I kept the same amount of shredded cheddar. I also added a little bit of garlic powder, about 1/8 tsp. Yummy!"

"reviewBody": "Excellent recipe! Made 30 to take to a party. I baked a full pound of low sodium bacon for a consistent doneness then cut that up. As others did, I used the bacon grease to cook the mushrooms and onions. Since some mentioned that the finished mushrooms were greasy, I used 50% less fat cheddar. A handful of Gouda and Gorgonzola were then thrown in the cheese mixture. (About 3 cups cheese total as per the serving size calculator). No need for bread crumbs thankfully. I also added a teaspoon of thyme to the cheese mixture to give an herbier flavor. As someone else suggested, I brushed the mushrooms with olive oil using a garlic infused oil. Very tasty!"
