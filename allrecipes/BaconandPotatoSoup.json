After about 7 mins on low I added the potatoes and broth , after 15 mins, I added a 1/4 cup of pumpkin. Then at the end I added about a cup of milk and the cheese and I used the emulsion blender to give some smoothness. Excellent Served with Bacon sprinkled on top and some Italian bread with a salad of dark greens. Yummy ! Family agrees !!"

The only change I made draining the bacon grease. Who doesn't love cooking veggies in bacon grease! By accident I doubled the amount of cayenne pepper and I think it added a nice level of spiciness. It wasn't too hot considering that my one year ate it all up. When serving I added a dollop of sour cream and some cheddar cheese."

I turned off the heat, stirred in the bacon and cheese, and my wife had just come home from work and said she was starving; meanwhile, I had a migraine and had a rolling tummy. This soup did the trick for both of us. It was great!"

"reviewBody": "Duh people...this isn't milky and creamy because there isn't any MILK in the ingredient list!! OK, rant over. This soup's ingredient list is perfect as written!!!!!!! I changed the procedure a little bit: I cut the raw bacon into small pieces before frying them in the pan; drained on paper towel. Then I removed all but about 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat and sauteed the veggies in the fat then added the potatoes, stock &amp; pepper. I let the soup simmer for about 45 minutes then used my immersible blender to make it a little smoother, but I did leave a fair amount of potato and carrot pieces. Then I added the bacon pieces. I served it into bowls with cheese on the side to add on the top of the soup. NO salt was added, and I used Knorr Chicken Stock...which was not low-salt. Next time I would use a low-salt stock or broth as the husband and I agreed that it was a bit salty (my own fault). The recipe is a keeper...thank you!"

I thought the recipe was delicious as written. I'm not sure why anyone who read the title, description or ingredients would have been expecting a cream of potato soup, so I don't get all the \"the soup wasn't creamy\" complaints. It is clearly a broth based soup and a good one imo. I'm sure there are plenty of cream of potato soup recipes out there and this one could be converted if someone was determined to do so. Will definitely make again."

It's a great soup following the recipe. Different than the typical creamy potato soup. The second time I made it I took the suggestion several reviews offered and added 3/4 cup of mashed potato flakes just before serving. This thickened the broth up so it was more like a traditional potato soup. I then added 1/2 cup of pre-cooked bacon bits and served with cheese and the crumbled cooked bacon on top. \nThis is a great soup as is and is great to modify. A definite keeper!"
