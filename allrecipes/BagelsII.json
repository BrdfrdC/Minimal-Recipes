Creating steam is essential to creating the browned crusty outside to these bagels. I put an empty sheet tray on the bottom baking rack and kept throwing water onto the hot tray throughout baking."

The crust is pleasantly crispy, probably from the sugar in the water during the boil stage. The inside is perfectly chewy. The results the first time making them were so good I shared it with our Grand Rapids (MI) Gluten Free Group. Simple ingredients and great directions, thanks Ann!"

This last batch I used the “poke a hole” method and it is way easier. The toppings hide the flaws."

I added honey instead of sugar, and put honey and baking soda in the water to boil. I boiled 1 min each side, then cooked them at 475 for about 22 min. I turned them over halfway through cooking. \nOh I also sprinkled some salt on top. I want to try them again with sesame seeds next time."

I was not blown away by these, they really tasted like fresh bread to me, but they were very good. The kids have already asked me to make them again, so I guess I will be."

The two ends of the rope would not stay together properly, so I shaped the rest of them by flattening the ball and then putting my thumb through the center. That worked. I loved the way they looked. The taste was a bit flat. I think I will slightly increase the salt next time. I had followed another recipe yesterday where the taste was better but they did not rise properly. They were a bit too dense. Yesterday I boiled the bagels in water with malt syrup. I have no idea how that will impact the taste."

I did although only added 5 cups of bread flour to the bowl and when kneaded maybe only added an extra cup. They smell delightful and I can't wait to try. I do also add either honey or maple syrup to the water to get a better color to the bagels as I have learned from other recipes and suggestions. This by far is the best bagel recipe, moving from NY to FL def satisfies my taste for a NY bagel! :)"

"reviewBody": "This is a wonderful bagle recipe!! My absolute, all time favorite bagle(s) is/are sundried tomato and basil bagles. While this may sound disgusting - which is the usual reaction that I have encountered when describing them - they are actually the BOMB!! They are also virtually impossible to find commercially. Because I love to attempt new and possibly difficult recipes, I decided to explore bagles. Of the several recipes that I have found from Allrecipes and other sources, I think this one is the best. The flavor is great, they are nice and dense but also very soft inside. I achieved tomato and basil bagles by simply adding finely chopped dried tomatoes and basil along with the flour. During the kneading the leathery texture of the tomatoes is worked out some, and by the time they are out of the oven I nearly have to hover over them with a kitchen implement to keep my family out of them! All in all, I have had great success with this recipe on several occasions and would recommend this recipe to any aspiring bagle-baker. One last note, do not be daunted by the idea of boiling and proofing the bagles; these steps are not really out of the way of most bread making processes, are more than worth the effort and couple extra minutes, and I find them quite fun and unique to this bread!! Give it a try, experiment with different add-ins and toppings, and continue to revel in your kitchen's magic!"

I finally took the plunge today after stumbling across allrecipes' recommendation and step by step instructions and am I happy I did! This is good, homemade food. I put in 3 cups whole wheat and made up for the rest with unbleached white, kneaded the whole time in my kitchen mixer (love that thing)and used my 4 year old to make the balls. After boiling and dipping a few in sesame seeds I baked for the recommended time-toasting the bottoms of the first batch to a black (darn oven). So I cut the time by a minute and raised the rack to the top resulting in gorgeously yummy ww bagels!!! Love it! THANK YOU :) My 14 month old has already eaten a whole one-butter free."

The texture is spot on... crusty outside and chewy inside. I followed the recipe, however I used brown sugar instead of white sugar, and only ended up using 6 cups of flour... 4 cups white flour and 2 cups whole wheat, used my kitchenaid mixer and let it knead for 15 minutes. Followed the rising and proofing and boiling instructions then set my oven to 425 degrees, first because my oven runs hot and two because at 500 degrees my smoke alarm goes off... :) I placed a pan of hot water on the bottom shelf of the oven before preheating which created great steam for baking then baked for 10 minutes, turned them over and baked an additional 10 minutes. Turned out perfectly!!! I highly recommend this recipe for authentic bagels."

"reviewBody": "First time making bagels or any kind of bread for that matter and my dough didnt rise for some reason...However i didnt want to waste my dough i tried cooking it anyway and it still came out great!!! Im from NYC so i have a high standard taste in bagels &amp; these tasted as good as the best NYC bagel shops when they were nice &amp; warm! Ill admit they were a lil dense for my taste when i tried them later in the day but probably had to do with my dough mishaps but when they were fresh from the oven they were amazing. Hopefully next time i can figure out how to get dough to rise and can get this recipe perfected for me. O yeah, i think it's much better to poke &amp; widen the holes rather then connect the ends."

I did boil the bagel for about 3 minutes, flipping it several time just to make sure it double in size. I made the mistake of adding the yeast into the flour mix instead of dissolving it in water. Still came out perfect. Also, 0.25 ounce yeast is 1 1/2 teaspoon."

We crouched in front of the oven like children while they were baking, and they tasted fabulous, especially warm! I personally think the inside tasted more like a dinner role, but the outside was the perfect chewyness. Be sure to eat them as soon as you can because they don't save very well!"

I did kneed until it was elastic but when I went to roll the balls parts of the dough wouldn't stick to itself very well. Oh well, they may not be the prettiest but they are the tastiest. I made sesame seed, fennel seed, onion, celery seed and plain salt. My father was skeptical about the whole \"I'm going to make my own bagels\" but he is now devouring them all, so I'd say it was a success!"

I halved the recipe but used a full packet of yeast, and used bread flour. Oh and I gave them a cool water bath before baking. The result was delicious chewy bagels that tasted a little yeast-y (which I love!) and got pretty darn big. This was my first time making bagels, so I formed 2 as suggested, then the other 4 I followed allrecipe's article on bagel forming. I recommend any fellow novices to do it allrecipe's way; the other 2 came apart during the boiling. (But taste wasn't affected :)"

The recipe is great as is...the only thing I noticed was that if you use sesame seeds, as I did, they have a tendency to burn--especially if there's too much oil on your baking sheet. Other than that minor tweak, these were FANTASTIC! I thought these would be much more complicated than they were--a really pleasant surprise. Thank you for a great recipe!"

I tried various toppings, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, onion flakes, chives, and garlic powder. All were great! I used my Kitchen Aid Artisan stand mixer. If you try this recipe with the same mixer, you'll have to divide your dough ball in half and mix them separately. It's just a little too much for this model of Kitchen Aid to handle. Also, steam baking does not mean you spritz water on the bagels while they're in the oven. It means you place a separate baking dish under the sheet with the bagels and fill it with boiling water from the tea kettle. Then you let the bagels bake with the water pan underneath them."

They turned out beautifully. These bagels are so much better than bakery bought bagels. They are dense, chewy and flavorful!! Love them!"

Like others, I followed the directions for \"Forming and Baking Bagels\" from this site. Unfortunately, I am a novice at forming dough rounds: it showed. The tops of my bagels looked great, the bottom- not so much. Next time I will boil the bagels for longer than 4 minutes (2 per side), because I like a thicker crust on my bagel. Also, 15 minutes baking time is perfect."

Next time may used the kneader function in my bread machine instead. Also, rolling the dough into ropes was a bad idea for us: it made it hard for us to shape them into cohesive round bagels. We ended up just cutting the remainder of the whole big loaf into 9 sized cubes, shaping that into a ball (instead of rolling it into a rope and then shaping it into balls), and poked the holes in the middle. Otherwise, yum! Also... if you haven't figured out how to steam bake, we used our cast iron skillet, let it sit in the hot oven on the lowest rack while it was warming up, then right as we put the bagels in we threw some water into the skillet and shut the door as fast as we could to keep the steam in. Worked fine for us!"

I was craving bagels and cream cheese for months. I just had to have one so I saved the cost of a round-trip ticket back to the States and made my own! It was the first time I had baked bagels, and this recipe did not fail! Well, I might need a bit more practice with the aesthetic appearance of my bagel, but the the taste was perfect! I used stone ground flour that comes from a special mill in Meteora! Next time, I will try mixing flours; 1/2 white, 1/2 yellow, for a bit firmer texture. I will definitely make them again. They are especially good toasted. Maybe I should open a bagel shop here in Athens! What do you think?"

"reviewBody": "I have always been a fan of bagels but never thought I could actually make my own. This was my first attempt and they came out perfectly. I followed the ingredients of the recipe exactly along with the directions for Forming and Baking Bagels here on the All Recipes website. (Go to: http://allrecipes.com/HowTo/Forming-and-Baking-Bagels/detail.aspx) I am really impressed with the outcome. The bagels are crisp and toasty on the outside while chewy and yeasty on the inside. After boiling and draining I coated the tops in a mixture of poppy seeds, sesame seeds, sea salt, garlic powder, and fresh ground pepper. (My version of the “Everything Bagels” that I have always loved.) Try making these bagels and I am sure you will not be disappointed. I will definitely be making these over and over again."

"reviewBody": "Wow thank you for this great recipe. I followed a few people's suggestions and added more salt and it definitely helped the taste. I added blueberries in the dough and found that I had to work in at least another cup or so of flour to get the dough to the right consistency. A quick spray of olive oil before baking helps with the gloss without another step and more washing up."

"reviewBody": "I followed all of the specific details, however, I used a combination of one half whole wheat flour, oat flour and hazlenut flour. The bagels came out perfect, though a little dry. I'll try again with white bread flour for about half the flour content and add some nuts and raisins. Trying to come up with a health alternative to the store bought bagels. This recipe worked well as a base for experimentation."
