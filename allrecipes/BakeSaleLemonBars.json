Just put flour and confectioner's sugar in first, then the butter (straight from fridge, cut into chunks) and pulse until combined and the consistency of cornmeal. Don't process until it comes together. Dump the powdery crust mix into the prepared pan and press it into a crust, making sure it's even. Continue as written in the recipe."

I also put crust ingredients into pan while still crumbly not letting it get to a dough consistency. This makes it easier to spread. I used a metal spoon for that as the heat from my hand was melting the buttery crumbs. I will be making this for Christmas gathering. It is delicious!"

If you do not like your deserts sour but want some lemon taste this is for you. I read lots of reviews for this recipe and some suggested to double the crust, I wouldn't do it. There is plenty of a crust in this bars, almost as much as filling (I made it in 15:9 pan) If you have a trouble to spread the crust, cover it with the piece of a plastic wrap and roll over with a small rolling pan or press it with your hands or spatula.\nAnd I am not sure why some added a yellow food coloring, my lemon bars were very yellow without it. \nAlso, when i make it again, I will reduce baking time of a filling by half. My oven overcooked it a bit.\nThank you for sharing the recipe"

People will always pick up and extra few as they're leaving and even ask if they can take some for someone who's not there.

They're delicious and people go crazy over them to an almost odd extent."

"reviewBody": "So my sister and I decided to make this due to our extensive collection of lemons. We started off strong, but we messed up badly when we forgot to add the flour in the first part of the recipe. Then, we re-did it and then we burnt it. But the next step of the recipe went well until we put it in the oven for twenty minutes. It was puzzled us that it was still gooey after all that time, but it turns out that the oven was never on. I imagine, with the proper skills required in baking, this would a great treat to sell or serve. However, this disappointed our mother."

I added a little more flour. I felt the filling was plenty with 3 eggs. Just tart enough without being too sweet. I would make them again. I don't like altering recipes but in this case, I thought I had better try lowering the temp and adding more lemon juice. They turned out great."

"reviewBody": "1st of all, when life or friends hand me lemons, what do I do?? Make lemon bars of Course! 2nd of all these were FAB U LOUS! !! I made no changes food wise other then doubling the filling, adding the zest of three Meyer lemons and juicing them. I read to drop the temp to 350, I really think this was the Right call, if you cook those eggs too fast, you might get a rubbery texture and that was something I was Loathe to have hapoen. I did add some salt, just a pinch, to the crust n lemon. Also, not sure why all the fuss about the crust. I made it exactly and just pressed it in the pan. It wasn't sticky either, just crumbled fine. My pan was an aluminum one that was about 9-11 maybe, perfect bar size. So GLAD I doubled that filling too cuz there would have been basically more crust then filling, that would NOT have been good eats! I took the time to line that pan with foil and sprayed it with grapeseed oil. The bars slid right off the foil, no trouble. My hubby n DS really loved them too. Heck even the Dog liked em! Lol These are a keeper for sure! Thank Elaine!!"

"reviewBody": "I have to admit that I have never enjoyed lemon bars, and would have never thought to seek out this recipe if I had a say in the matter, but sometimes to get ahead you just need to know to do what you are told and my brother never learned that lessons and we all know how well he is doing still looking for work in Kentucky. I guess Scott was right. If you are feeling bold, consider drizzling salted caramel over the tops of these bars and adding a hint of mint and lime to the mixture. Admittedly, it is a wide departure in taste, but I have found that variation is at least on par with the original recipe if not superior along another spectrum. I also find these burn easily if baked for longer than 90 minutes, even at lower temperature."

"reviewBody": "I've made this a few times now. Twice according to the recipe, and a few times with some alterations (include Gourmet Mommy). I actually find many aspects of this recipe fine as is but: 1) Definitely decrease the temperature of the oven to 350 and remove your crust at 10 minutes, remove the filling at 15-17. 2) I find the filling ratios (sugar to lemon) fine as is. I do think that the technique needs to be modified though because the bars are a little thin. Make sure to use room temperature eggs. Separate them and keep the yolks to the side. Whip the whites until they form soft peaks. Then cream together the flour, sugar, lemon juice and yolks. Fold the yolk mixture into the whites. This will help give some volume to the lemon part."

"reviewBody": "This is four stars for the changes GOURMETMOMMY mentioned, since most reviewers tended to go with her suggestions. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't as amazing as I hoped they would be. Maybe it's because I only have whole wheat flour and I only used 1.5 cups of lemon juice (I ran out), and I didn't douse the top with tons of confectioners' sugar--I added a thin layer to it, which was absorbed by the filling part and did not end up looking like the picture; I'm just not sure. I think if I make it again, I shall use some actual lemons to get some pulp in there, and maybe not use whole wheat flour. Still good, just not perfect."
