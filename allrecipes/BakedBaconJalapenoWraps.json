Recipe says turn it cream cheese side down first 10 minutes that doesn't work second time no face down a tad better. However still issues. Tried just on grill nope as well."

I also used a disposable aluminum container, poker holes on it and place that on top of another aluminum container using balls of aluminum to raise it so that the grease dripped down a bit. With two minutes left on the timer, I uncovered it, added Monterrey Jack cheese on top and placed it on the top shelf with the broiler set on 550 for ten minutes. It came out perfectly delicious!"

"reviewBody": "Everyone liked them, but I wanted everyone to LOVE them. That was my fault. I added a lot of shredded Mexican blend cheese and 2 cloves of fresh garlic to the cream cheese mixture. It did NOT need the garlic and less shredded would have been better. I used a WHOLE SLICE OF PEPPER BACON per half jalapeno. The bacon shrinks up when cooking and pulls away from the pepper. I baked them at 430 degrees on a cooling rack set inside of a cookie sheet for about 22 minutes. The bacon crisped up in the oven without having to turn them and no need for the extra step of adding to the grill."

I tried these 2 different times to be sure with the same result. The peppers themselves lost all flavor and tasted like a soggy green pepper with NO kick. Sorry, I really tried, and even being super careful, they weren't good."

"reviewBody": "I made these for my husband; he LOVES them. (They are really filling though. After having 2 of these as an \"appetizer\", he didn't have room for dinner.) For the first time, I made the filling exactly as the recipe states. I was surprised the cream cheese filling didn't melt and drip all over the oven, especially because you place them cheese-side-down on the sheet. I didn't have jalapeños in the garden (they were not ready yet), so I used Big Jim and Anaheim peppers, and they worked wonderfully. Will use the jalapeño next time for friends who like that extra \"zing\" in their food. (Note: others have added different kinds of cheeses; I can see where a real sharp cheddar would be a great addition, especially if you use a more mild pepper.)"

I was running late so instead of baking I used the broiler, about 10 min then flip and 10 min more. It worked out, I just had to watch it like a hawk to make sure they didn't burn. I would highly recommend baking or grilling instead! I would also recommend using gloves while cutting and cleaning the peppers, you don't even realize that juice is on your hands until your eye itches and it is too late."

The only problem I encountered is that the amount of bacon listed is incorrect. 12 jalapenos cut in half makes 24 jalapeno halves but the 6 pieces of bacon sliced in half the recipe calls for only give you 12 half-pieces of bacon to wrap them in. I didn't notice this when buying ingredients and wound up having to cut a few pieces of bacon into smaller pieces to finish the recipe up."

I tried these on a hinged top grill like a George Forman, I don't recommend it, it oozed out everywhere, but a grill pan works great also thick cut bacon tastes great, but the slices do not wrap well and I recommend keeping with normal bacon slices. I dip them in warmed raspberry jam."
