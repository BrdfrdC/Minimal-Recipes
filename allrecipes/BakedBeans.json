I ran out of the pork and beans cans from the first attempt. I soaked pinto beans overnight. I had pork shoulder chunked up and deforested so I took about 3 oz and cut it into about 1/2 inch bits and cooked that and 1 lb of bacon in the same cast iron until nearly crispy. I added the onion to the mixture and when the bacon was crispy and onions caramelized, I removed the heat and added the brown sugar, about 1/4 teaspoon of chipotle chili pepper, 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika, 1/8 teaspoon of Mexican chili powder and 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne. I put this mixture and the rest of the ingredients into my instant pot so as to not take chances with raw beans. Pressure cooked for 1 hr 20mins. Very delicious, a huge hit."

Since I did not use the bacon, I didn't have to be concerned about it crisping, so I didn't have to keep it in the oven for an hour. I've found similar recipes on this site, and 35 min or so (without the bacon to cook) worked fine. You get the same or better quality with preparing beans this way then using the dry beans. Saves time and effort. Thanks for this great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I didn't actually make this but I thought I'd chime in on the \"soupiness\" issue. My mom makes the best pork and beans-based baked beans on the planet. She has no written recipe, she just takes a zen-like approach to it. When it comes to the \"soupiness\" of the finished product the one thing you need to keep in mind is that different brands of pork and beans often contain different amounts of liquid. Even the same brand can vary from can to can. Mom's able to eyeball it and drain enough liquid (or not) to compensate. It's almost a sixth sense she's developed over the years, and her baked beans always come out perfect! It's just one of those many variables that cooking throws at us and we need to learn how to adjust. Hope this helps!"

We eat “less sweet” these days, so I would cut the brown sugar back the next time. I typically add a little O.J. or pineapple juice to my baked beans, and today, I added some juice from my fresh pineapple. I scaled the recipe down to 3 servings and used a small dish. Had I used a larger one, I also would have added a bit of the fresh sliced pineapple on top to cook along with the bacon. No complaints here, good recipe and good beans."

So I kept adding more of everything else and at the end of the day the beans were gone and everyone loved them. So you can just use a teaspoon of mustard and add as you like. Thanks for the basic recipe Jackie, I've never had vinegar in beans but that was a secret ingredient that was amazing, thanks!"

Mine weren't runny at all and I didn't drain the beans, which were Bush's. They were in the oven for a good hour and I did stir them after half an hour."

I found that by baking the 'baked' beans made them thicker and flavorful- \nI did add more bacon- ( i always have cooked bacon pieces in freezer to add to dishes) \nI added some molasses \nDid not find this to be too sweet \nI did do - as others mentioned- drain and rinse beans."

I had this HUGE can of baked beans sitting in my basement for quite some time, and I ended up using this recipe to prepare it a take it with us to a rental house down the shore we were sharing with my wifes's family for a week. Had to quadruple the recipe for the size of the can, and even with 10 people in the house we ate beans for a week. But everyone seemed to really enjoy them. Very easy to make as well. I would make it again (in a few months when I'm ready to at least look at a baked bean again....)"

I've already tasted them and they are way too sweet. I would definitely use this recipe again because they have a wonderful flavor, but I would have to cut the amount of brown sugar in half or less. I fixed them for a cookout we are attending in about 30 minutes. I hope our friends like extra sweet baked beans.\n\nReally good recipe overall."
