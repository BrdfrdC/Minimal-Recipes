If you only have access to smaller poblanos, you may want to increase to a total of 9 or even 12. When no poblanos are available to us, we've often substituted zucchini \"planks\", sliced maybe 1/4\" thick, tossed with olive oil and seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic &amp; onion powder, chili powder, cayenne and cumin. Jalapeno powder adds a yummy, slightly spicy, twist!"

"reviewBody": "Very spicy and loaded with flavor. I have to agree with others that this is a smaller recipe than indicated. You will want to use a small casserole dish if made as written. I’ve made this recipe many times and use an 11 x 8 oval casserole dish. It takes 9 or 10 large poblano peppers. I also use 2lbs of ground beef and slightly heap the tablespoon/teaspoon when measuring. I don’t measure the cheese, but can say with certainty that I use more than stated in the recipe. I like to cook the ground beef first and drain off the fat. Then I proceed with adding the onions, seasonings, and tomatoes. I will drain off all of the liquid again before layering in the casserole dish. If you don’t, you will end up with a watery casserole. In my opinion, poblano peppers are the hardest to roast and peel. I find it is easier to roast the peppers whole, then cut in half and remove the seeds. Either way is messy. It is worth the effort."

My daughter loves tajin spice so I added just a pinch to tang up the beef mixture a bit. But not necessary it’s perfectly delicious as is. Next time I will buy more poblanos as 6 didn’t get me but 2 layers. Would do in a small casserole for 4-6."

Not a fan, but I made some changes so not going to ding it. I also used turkey, more garlic as recommended, but cut back to 2 cups of cheese. Chipotle seasoning was $6/bottle, no thanks, so I skipped that."
