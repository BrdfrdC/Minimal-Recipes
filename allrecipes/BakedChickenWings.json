I added Morton's salt to the seasoning, which made it to salty. But the flavor was really good, I also added a little cornstarch to try to crisp them, but I don't think that did anything. I then broiled the wings on low for about 10 minutes to get them to brown a little after the 40 minutes at 400 degrees. My five year old loves them and that's who I cooked them for, so win win!"

Montreal chicken and steak seasoning garlic and herb and smoked paprika topped with fresh Italian herbs. Made them a year ago today at work during a nasty snow storm. Making them now at home. Great taste. Great crisp. Perfect recipe to doctor up to your own likeness."

"reviewBody": "I was surprised and thrilled at how easy this recipe was and how tasty the wings are! First time I ever made wings in the oven (and I've been cooking for over 30 years); now I make them often. I somewhat double the recipe, putting about 20 wings in a bowl. Then I drizzle olive oil over top, no measuring (no need to use as much as recipe calls for). Next I add the spices, tweaking amounts a bit according to personal preference, then garlic and stir it all with a wooden spoon; lay them on parchment paper on a cookie sheet and turn them over half way through baking. Total bake time 45-50 minutes. These are great in the winter when you don't want to grill in the cold. Takes minutes to prepare but tastes like you spent all day making them. Love this recipe!"

She tried them fresh out of the oven and deemed them worthy before slathering them in Red's Hot Sauce and eating most of the wings....I got 3. I did not change the recipe at all, nor will I when I make these again and again."

I also used garlic salt in place of garlic powder. I cooked them on a foil lined cookie sheet and turned them after 30 minutes. They were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. This recipe will definitely become part of our weekly rotation. My husband said these were the best wings that I ever cooked. Delicious"

I cut the olive oil to 2 tbsp since I’m adding more liquid with the wing sauce. Another trick is after baking put them under the broiler on low for about 3 minutes, turn wings and broil for another 2-3 mins. Crispy and perfect."

Baked for an hour, but they were not crispy yet (probably because of the large quantity). I raised the temp to 425 and baked an additional 10-12 minutes and it turned out perfect."

I used a bowl and mixed them by hand and added other spices for more flavor. I also used cayenne pepper for the chili powder and decided to put in half the amount which was the perfect amount of spice. Can’t wait to make these again."
