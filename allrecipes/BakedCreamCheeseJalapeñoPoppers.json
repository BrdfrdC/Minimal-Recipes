I have made these several times, and to save energy I add other foods to the oven as well. After experimenting, I have come up with this chart: 350°-30 minutes, 360°-25 minutes, 375°-20 minutes. Enjoy!"

If you’re not a fan of too much spice don’t use the seeds and try to find a taco seasoning without spicy spices, or make your own by using cumin and paprika."

Maybe it was that I had to use a cheese blend? (It had cheddar in in though). Maybe I’ll try it again when jalapeños are out of season and weaker."

If you are overly sensitive to hot food, consider using a mild jalapeno such as Senorita Jalapeno or Tam Mild Jalapeno 2. We used the peppers my wife grew in her garden and they were HOT! The cream cheese mixture was good, though some, such as my wife, may prefer straight up cream cheese."
