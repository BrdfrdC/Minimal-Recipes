I ran the ingredients through an app designed to estimate the calorie content of a recipe and determined that the recipe as written is off by more than 100 calories per serving despite using reduce fat cheddar and 1% milk instead of whole. It is probably off by more if made as written. \nThese numbers should not vary by this much. It got me questioning AllRecipes methods on nutrition values"

This is especially true if you are feeding more than 1 or 2 people because you don't have to worry about your first omelet getting cold while you are making the others. \n\nOne thing to note, I made this is an oven safe skillet. This cuts down on dishes as you need to sauté the vegetables first anyway. Also, this will puff up when you make it so give yourself room in the pan."

"reviewBody": "I have made this for years and it is so good! You don't really need to saute the onions and bell peppers though. I just put them directly in with the rest of the ingredients and they still cook. Doing this also eliminates the need for the butter. I usually don't measure the ham, cheese, bell pepper or onion, I just put in what I have (and I must confess that I add much more than the recipe calls for). I usually use a full dozen eggs and just slightly more milk (my recipe calls for half and half, but I usually use milk...heavy whipping cream works well also). I usually have to bake it a little longer than the recipe says, but you can easily tell when it's done. The great thing about this recipe is that it is equally good reheated, and can even be eaten cold. It's definitely a keeper. Everyone I know who has ever tried it has loved it. Even those who don't really care for bell peppers and onions. I like to put those in a food chopper and chop them up really fine. It tends to give the final dish a greenish color, but it is really good."

What is quicker is to cook it on top of the stove (I use a cast iron skillet, well seasoned) and cook the bottom to about 3/4 thru and then put it under the broiler to finish cooking the top. Its really easy and yummy."
