"reviewBody": "Great recipe! I read several recipes before settling on this one. Mostly bc it does not use bread crumbs and I am limiting my family’s carb and starch intake. I can do a Tbsp of AP flour. Changes I made to this recipe include hand mashing the chick peas and putting the onion in the blender with the garlic/parsley blend. I also added a dash of cayenne. Mashing the peas gave the parry more texture. I was very happy with the browning method in the frying pan using some avocado oil. I got it toasty on both sides then popped into the oven to finish off while I cut veggies for our lentil bowls. My kiddos and hubby loved this recipe and it is a new “go to” in our house. Next time I am going to try wheat flour instead of AP. Thanks for the inspiration!!"

I'll continue to tweak this recipe. Stand by ...."

They held together very well and I didn't find them to be runny like others mentioned. Servng them in pita bread is a great tip.

I also didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and just baked them at 400 degrees turning them over after 30 minutes. They were perfect!

"reviewBody": "Made this tonight for the my Husband, myself and my 3 year daughter and we loved it! \nI didn't use a cheese cloth because I didn't have one. I just chopped the onion small and dabbed off any moisture with a paper towel. Lightly browned the falafel in a pan and then stuck them in the oven for 10 minutes. Served them in warm pita bread with my homemade tzatziki sauce and side tabouli salad over some arugula! Healthy and delicious!"

I just used the back of a fork to mash the chickpeas and cut up the parsley. I love that I had very few dishes to clean at the end. I served this with a tahini sauce and tzatziki. The tahini adds some liquid if you find falafel a bit dry."

Update almost three years later: Hadn't realized I'd made these before and made them again. The batter was runny; I did not add more flour and it cooked to an okay, firm consistency. Just doesn't really taste like much. Probably won't make again. Took my rating down a star."

"reviewBody": "I was surprised this turned out as well as it did, considering the changes I made and my inability to read directions. I substituted light red kidney beans (blasphemy, I know, but it was that or black beans) and a tablespoon or so of dried parsley for the fresh (working with what I had on hand here). I also just mashed everything together with a potato masher since I don't have a food processor. And by everything, I mean I included the oil, since I didn't pay attention to the directions. Speaking of which, I let the mixture sit for 15 minutes prior to shaping it instead of after. I decided to skip the baking part, since it was too hot out, and just scooped heaping spoonfuls onto the skillet (ungreased) and cooked them like pancakes, a few minutes apiece. Tasty! But they were best when piping hot, and seemed to lose flavor as they cooled. This made about 8 silver-dollar falafelcakes (really 6, plus about 2 more worth of scraps and broken bits)."

I used whole grain flour..it made me feel better!! I made smaller patties, fried them up in a frying pan as instructed and finished them in the oven for the required 10 minutes...this helps alot with expelling more moisture. I paired this with Chef John's Tzatziki sauce and soft warmed up pita bread....OMG, it's a staple now at our house."

I cooked them for 3 minutes on my pancake griddle before transferring to the oven for 15 minutes."

"reviewBody": "After making this many times I've settled on the following changes, which I highly recommend: 1) Pulse half an onion and several cloves of garlic in a food processor, then sauté until the onions are tender and most of the moisture has cooked off. 2) Double the cumin and coriander, and add onion and garlic powder. 3) Add 1/4 cup breadcrumbs, preferably panko. 4) Form 8 smaller patties rather than 4 big ones. This has proven to be essential! 5) Spray Pam, also essential, on a baking sheet and bake the falafel at 400 for 20 minutes. Then spray Pam on the patties, flip them, and bake for another 10-15 minutes. This actually results in a crunchier crust than when pan frying this recipe. The first picture I uploaded of this recipe is the pan-fried version and the second is completely baked."

"reviewBody": "I had an awful falafel at a high end restaurant last weekend and thought to myself \"allrecipes.com can do better than this\" and sure enough, this recipe pulled it off. I found like other reviewers that they did fall apart but that was remedied by making a more fine chop in the processor instead of a coarse chop. I followed the directions to a T but doubled it and stuffed it inside pita pockets with red onion, spinach, cucumbers, tomatoes and tzatziki for a vegetarian gyro. I also misted the patties with olive oil before baking so they didn't dry out at all. \nMy recipe for tzatziki: seed and grate 1/2 q cucumber and blot with paper towel, dust with coarse salt and let sit for 10 min. Combine 1tbsp minced garlic, 1 1/2 c greek yogurt, 1 tsp fresh mint, 1/2tsp dill, 1-2tbsp olive oil and half a squeezed lemon. Add cucumber and refrigerate for several hours for flavors to full merry. \nI think this was by far the best falafel I've ever had. Thanks so much for the recipe! Awesome!"

As the cook, I thought the prep took considerably longer than 20 minutes. The wet mixture was difficult to work with. Patties didn't retain their shapes and clung to my hands as I tried to transfer from plate to pan for cooking. \n\nAlso, it would have been helpful to know in advance that spices could all be measured into same bowl, to avoid using (and having to wash) multiple vessels."

Today, when I warmed up the leftovers, I lightly fried them in olive oil, and they were absolutely delicious! Sitting overnight probably helped the flavors merge better as well, although I may add more garlic and spices next time. Served the falafel with the Tzatziki II recipe and lettuce and tomatoes on a warm pita. Yum."
