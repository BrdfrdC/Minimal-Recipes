I made a ton... used 7 med russets, and so I used around 1/3 cup oil, and 1 2/3 tsp of each ingredient (other reviews mentioned upping the seasonings and I upped the portions anyhow)...and I mixed everything in a ziplock freezer bag. I followed other suggestions to bake at 400 for 15, turn, and another 15 minutes. I think my wedges were on the thicker side, I could have used a higher temp and longer time to get them crispier on the outside... but they’re great - great base recipe that could be tweaked with adding more garlic and Parmesan or cutting the potatoes thinner to fit whatever you making with it! Will definitely do this again!"

"reviewBody": "I went on line to find the temperature to bake my fries at and came across this recipe. I had already planned to spice it up with the suggested spices but added cayenne pepper...LOTS of cayenne pepper (I'm a \"heat-aholic!). I used 6 small - medium Russet potatoes and cut them in a 1/4 inch french fry; skins on. I used a generous amount of Canola Oil and put all my spices, oil and potatoes right on the baking sheet and mixed there. I divided the potatoes in 2 batches so they would all lay in a single layer. the first batch came out perfect at 450 degrees and 45 minutes cooking time (large batch approximately 3 small to medium potatoes). Second batch, a smaller batch, I did not add extra oil but added extra spices; cooked them for 40 minutes and they nearly burned. Keep in mind I like my fries on the well-done side and the first batch had many small edges of potato/skin pieces that were crunchy little morsels of goodness.\n\nLessons learned: Temperature is fine. Less potatoes, less baking time and I think more oil is better.\n\nI hope this helps people who felt the times and temps were wrong. You have to experiment."

"reviewBody": "Simple and easy to make! We've made it three times now and like the seasoning for the fries. The first attempt was made as written--bake temp is too high and time to cook is too long. Keep an eye on them to avoid burning, which happens very fast! I'd decrease the amount of oil used, which we did the second time around. These came out much better on convection @ 400F (just hit convection bake and punch in 425; our oven auto-decreases the temp by 25 degrees for convection). They were done at approx. 20-30 min. (I sliced mine thinner instead of having them thick). The last time we made them, I did the above with decreasing olive oil a little and convection baking, but also put them on a rack on the sheet pan and flipped them after 10-15 minutes. Some were still a little soft, but they turned out fine and no complaints. Rating of 3 stars only because we had to play with these a bit to get them right. Otherwise, it is a good recipe! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"

Preheated oven to 450, coated the fries in oil, put them in the oven, and they were burnt after 22 minutes, not even halfway through.\n\nSince so many of the reviews are saying the directions are too hot for too long, CAN SOMEONE PLEASE JUST UPDATE THE RECIPE? As written, this is an example of the blind leading the blind into a pit. How can all the other reviewers give the recipe a good rating when they know the recipe if followed will burn the food to a crisp?!? All my time preparing this was wasted. (Yeah, Google Home didn’t read me the reviews before it gave me the recipe.)\n\nHere’s a picture of the fries after 22 minutes of cooking. Totally inedible."

I also added minced onions rather than the onion powder. We both ate every fry! I only had small golden potatoes, but they were fine. This will definitely be used again and again. Can't wait to try sweet potatoeswith the recipe. A very easy dish to prepare. \nMike Hinshaw \nNomadic Texan"

Then I read online that you should never use olive oil to cook fries on high heat because the oil's burn point is very low. Did anyone else have this problem? We ended up having to turn off the oven, open all the doors, and switch everything over to the frying pan. :/ I'll be using ghee next time."

I can't stop making them now! I put them on a sprayed aluminum lined baking sheet and shook them gently half-way through. No trouble getting them off the pan. Made some sriracha aioli to dip in - TASTY."

I later put them on at 400 degrees F, with only about 30 minutes, not even, and I did flip them. \n\nI was originally excited about this recipe because of all the many ratings being positive, but I see that's only because they modified theirs. I found these fries to have very little seasoning and most of them ended up burnt. Also, very little flavor, add some salt!\n\nSince I made a big batch, I was left with some that were eatable, but not plain, so we made them into nacho fries, piled with other tasty things. \n\nGood luck!"
