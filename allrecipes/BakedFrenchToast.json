But we did use some no dairy whip cream and it was fantastic! Also, I only used a half loaf of bread and dipped then soaked the slices and only let it marinate for about 2.5 hours before baking. I took it out a couple of times to rotate the bread to make sure it was evenly coated and soaking as well. *my son is allergic to eggs, nuts and milk but I love French Toast so we had to make it work!"

I too added cinnamon and used 1/2&amp;1/2, I added 3 Tbl of 1/2&amp;1/2 to the caramel mixture as well. Otherwise the family loved it!!"

It was soggy AND burned (how that's possible, I'm not sure) I tried to salvage it by cooking it through on the stove top and what I got was a sticky, undercooked, burned-sugar, smoky mess. What a complete waste of time and energy! I would not recommend this, even with the fixes suggested in other reviews. I ended up making pancakes after spending at least 2 hours trying to make my family Sunday morning breakfast. I would recommend Eggo waffles over this recipe."

I used just 6 eggs, just 1 1/4 cups milk, just 2 Tbslp. corn syrup, increased cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. , and added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. I also did turn the bread slices over after a couple hours per reviewers' suggestion. I made 2 for a bridal shower. One as above and the other I added chopped pecans to the sauce before pouring over bread/egg mixture. The one with the pecans went first....bigger hit so I will likely always add the pecans.

My pan held only half a loaf, so I reduced the butter &amp; brown sugar substantially: 1/4 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 Tbl. corn syrup. It was the perfect amount of sweetness! It was a tad soggy after coming out , but after sitting for 15-20 minutes, it was much better. Thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This is one of my favorite brunch dishes to make for a buffet crowd, and I’ve made it about a dozen times over the past several years. As usual for me though, I made a few minor changes........I use white/oat/cinnamon/and or raisin bread cut into cubes that I leave uncovered a few hours to become “stale” rather than French bread, because the French bread is a bit too chewy for some of my family. I cube it because I cut and serve this in squares rather than whole piece servings. I cut the melted butter back to about 6 T. because it doesn’t all get absorbed by the sugar and is too greasy, in my opinion. \nRemember to use a foil lined pan beneath casserole while baking, in case the topping bubbles over. If you halve the recipe, it fits nicely in a loaf pan. Written as is, it’s still a five star recipe and tastier than others I’ve experimented with."

"reviewBody": "I love this recipe exactly how it is, however my husband thinks it is \"slimy\" in the middle, so I made a few tweaks. I only used 6 eggs instead of 8 and I also used Dunkin' Donuts coffee creamer in lieu of the 1/2 and 1/2; OMG AMAZING!!! I also took some above advice and baked it uncovered for 30 minutes without the topping, and then added the topping and baked for an additional 30 minutes. If you don't like it \"soggy\" drain the excess egg and milk mixture off after you turn the bread and let it set out waiting for the oven to preheat.\nI also added raisins to the topping mix a few times when I felt like having raisins in it; delicious!"

In the morning some of the pieces of bread still looked too dry, so I did 2 more eggs plus another half cup of half and half. Also used a bit of almond extract in addition to the vanilla. \n\nIt turned out great!"

The bread is to soggy using all of that liquid causing the sauce to just burn to the bottom of the pan. Next time I am going to use 2 cups of liquid (1 c milk &amp; 1 c heavy cream) and add the sauce on during the last 10-15 minutes or just sprinkle the bread with cinnamon and brown sugar mixture. GREAT method for cooking French toast for a crowd."

No half-and-half, but I used whole milk and added cinnamon to the caramel sauce on top. I like a quick morning breakfast like this, and probably will let the bread and egg mixture sit in the fridge overnight, but this first time, I let it sit about 15 minutes and it turned out great!! I particularly like the sauce on top, as it didn't need anything else but some fresh fruit to go with it."

I used 16 eggs, 3 cups of half &amp; half (no milk) 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 3 tsp of vanilla and 1 lb of Italian bread (it came sliced, so I cut the slices diagonally in about 1\" pieces and stuffed them into the pan). I followed the directions otherwise. I also left it in the oven and turned the heat off and let it sit another 20 minutes. For the topping I used 2 cups of brown sugar, 2 sticks of butter and 3 or 4 tbs of dark corn syrup ( I had it already). This came out awesome! Topped it with strawberries cup up with sugar mixed in for the juices. No extra syrup was needed and all the kids loved it. One of the kids called it cake. So good!"
