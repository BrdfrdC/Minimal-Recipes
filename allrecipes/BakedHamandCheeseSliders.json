Also spread a thin layer of blackberry jam on the bread before I compile them. Also, put a tablespoon of brown sugar in the butter. Mixture before putting it on top. Delicious. Sidenote. These burn pretty quickly at the bottom if not watching what you’re doing. I put a piece of parchment paper to line my pan before I put the sandwiches in the dish."

I thought for sure these seem too easy and can't be that great - you are basically just putting a sandwich together and baking it, but I was so wrong! They are so simple, but the few ingredients mixed together and the little crispy edge on the roll from baking make these exceptional!! I did play around and use turkey and provolone on half and I didn't use onion because of some picky people I know, but they were still fantastic! Also, I did keep mine covered the entire time I cooked them and even left in the oven on warm for a while. I will definitely be making these again and maybe even for dinner - not just a party!! I would love to try using different rolls, cheese, etc. Great recipe!!!"

I did spoon a few tablespoons over the meat/cheese mixture before I put the top half of the rolls on, and I covered it in foil for 15 minutes. I ended up needing to bake it a little longer w/o the foil to let the topping absorb. But once it did, the sliders tasted great!"

I also used Everything But the Bagel Seasoning and didn't mix it in with the butter but sprinkled it on about ten minutes before they were done. We split the sandwiches over two pans and froze one--Without the butter on top! We also froze the extra butter mixture. The frozen sandwiches kept well and were just as delicious as the first batch. This shows that you could prep the sandwiches ahead and freeze them. These were absolutely delicious!"

Everyone agrees that the taste was perfect but those that were salt sensitive complained. (I used everything bagel instead of poppy seeds). i will tweak it to make it less salty in the future. Also I originally made it and immediately froze it. Thawing and reheating was incredibly easy. I'll definitely make this again when I have deli meats to use up."

I don't vary anything from the original recipe other than to double or triple the ingredients, or to occasionally sub out turkey and provolone for the ham and swiss. A huge hit and definitely a well-worn recipe card. This one is a keeper!!"

I know all these slider recipes call for rolls but I usually don’t have them, I did however have lots of leftover hamburger buns from a cookout and was trying to think of ways to use them and immediately thought of sliders. They turned out so good. I didn’t have Dijon mustard so I just used the same amount of yellow mustard, and also covered them with foil for 10 minutes and then left them in just a couple more minutes uncovered, since I was unsure if they would cook differently than rolls. Also added 3 tablespoons of brown sugar to the sauce like a review suggested and it was amazing. I tested the brown sugar version on half the buns and kept the original recipe on the other side and I definitely prefer the brown sugar side, it adds a delicious sweetness to the recipe. Will definitely be making again!!"

Things I've added are honey, honey mustard, brown sugar, Chick-Fil-A sauce, the world is your oyster (or slider as the case may be) Enjoy and be blessed!"

I made the full amount of butter sauce and was worried it would be too much for my 12 rolls, but it wasn't. Even my picky husband liked them. The hint of Dijon flavor along with the other ingredients was delicious . I followed the advice of other reviewers and covered with foil for the first 10 minutes of baking. I would definitely recommend doing this. Overall a very simple and tasty recipe."
