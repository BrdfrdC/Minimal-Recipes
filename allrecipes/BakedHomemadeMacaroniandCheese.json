"reviewBody": "It was ok. I had wayyyyy too much cheese sauce. Thankfully I added it to the pasta a little at a time and only used half of it. The milk and roux never thickened when it simmered, but the cheese did make it thicker. I knew it would set more while it baked, so the consistency ended up being ok. It would have been soup if I’d used all the sauce. The cheese sauce also had a somewhat grainy texture even though my roux was smooth and I used a block of cheddar that I shredded myself. I used sharp cheddar and then added some Parmesan and Monterey Jack that I had on hand because it tasted bland when I sampled it. I would make this again but use half the milk, add different cheeses for a stronger flavor, and add some mustard powder and pepper."

"reviewBody": "This is based off a very old recipe that I've seen in a 1920s cookbook. We've made similar in our family since at least the 1940s. As others have mentioned, it is excellent with some dried mustard added. Many leave it out, but I think it is actually in the original recipe. It is also excellent with a couple of tablespoons of very finely chopped onion, cooked until soft in the butter before added the flour. I don't always add the onion when I make it, but it is an alternative I use sometimes. Also, I know some people who have picky children with problems eating certain textures of food sometimes leave the crackers off the top. We prefer this old fashioned recipe to many more modern, complicated ones."

"reviewBody": "Thank you for a classic and very forgiving recipe with amazing results. I messed up my flour measurement and had to add half of it after the milk with no adverse result. It just took a little longer to thicken. I halved the recipe and added a few shakes each of garlic powder, ground mustard, and smoked cayenne to the butter and flour. Wonderful. Thank you."

"reviewBody": "My first attempt at homemade Mac &amp; cheese and I’m very happy with it. Next time I rotate the baking pan halfway through, as my oven must have a hot spot to the back left. The sole change I made was to use a half box of pasta instead of the recommended amount, only because I didn’t want boxes of pasta with odd amounts left over (ocd). The measured amount would been somewhat more, but it came up to the rim of the baking pan anyway, so it was probably for the best."

"reviewBody": "I made this for second time. the flavor was good. Serve it after setting only 10 minutes, otherwise it goes dry, not creamy. you could add more milk to the roux. or not add an extra 1/4 lb. of cheese like I did. I loved the topping with parmesan cheese and a bit of Panko to the crackers. Perfect, crunchy.. I had taco seasoned \"Mexican blend\" shreaded cheese to use up, and it was flavorful, not too much. Added the 1/2 tsp. of ground mustard as others suggested. Liked it better. The best suggestion I can give you is to disregard trying to brown up the topping. Cooking this longer to do so dries it out. Stick with the suggested cook time in the recipe and you should have a creamy mac and cheese."
