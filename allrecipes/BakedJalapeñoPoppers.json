I parboiled half of the peppers to see if I liked it that way better, but the flavor was bland and way too mild either way. I like medium salsa. Next time I'll mix some sriracha sauce into the cream cheese and probably leave the ribs in the peppers for more kick &amp; flavor."

I bought some jalapeños, cut and seeded them, then used cold from the fridge Rotel dip for the filling. By the time the peppers were cooked through, the dip was bubbly hot. This recipe is for people who like hot, they were all gone in short order. I'll use the panko next time for more crunch. Skip these if you don't like the heat, give them a try if you want a new taste treat."

After reading the comments I decided to blanch my jalapeños for 3 minutes (boil then ice water bath). The jalapeños, now that the recipe is done, are quite soft. They are incredibly spicy. My eyes are watering and I can’t see my phone. I’m not sure I could serve these for game day. There would be a bunch of crying men clustered close to the TV. The taste is great though!"

I used the greek yogurt cream cheese and added garlic powder and a pinch of salt as recommended by some other reviewers. I also blanched some and cooked others raw. I preferred the raw cooked ones because there was a little more spice without being overly spicy. I LOVE this recipe and look forward to making them again!"

I did nothing different from what the recipe said, except I had no panko.... so I used plain bread crumbs which were pretty fine. Panko might have given them a little more crispness, but these were pretty good and really easy. I like that they were baked not fried, but i think a sprinkle of garlic powder or paprika might have been a good addition."

These baked ones are just as good and a lot healthier. And I don't have to drive to Sonic to get them! I use reduced fat cream cheese and fill up the pepper halves with the mixture, about a tablespoon in each pepper half. Then I spray the bread crumbs on top with olive oil to make sure they brown and crunch up. Bake these in my toaster oven about 350 degrees for about 15 minutes. Yay, I can have cheddar peppers again!"
