I followed the instructions and baked at 300 °F, BUT I baked mine for 15 minutes and they were perfectly crispy, not burned, and completely yummy! I have a Maytag gas oven, so I had to do the chips/crisps in 4 batches due to lack of oven space. Of note there were a few kale leaf shreds that were maybe \"soft\" while everything else was crispy due to density of leaf curliness, but don't worry. As it cools, it crisps up. But be mindful: these are so tasty and easy to eat that they go fast!"

Twenty minutes was a good enough cooking time. I used sunflower oil (what I had) and they were tasty. Olive oil might be a little tastier, but I liked it. The taste of the kale is a little weird, but it was good. The texture is brittle, and they crumble easily into dust."

I drizzled them with oil in my salad spinner and kneaded and tossed them with my hands. Then I spun them. This way they were all completely lightly covered with oil. Next time I will cut smaller pieces as they did not shrink very much. And I will use less salt."

More of the kale turned brown at 15 mins, and I don't like the burnt flavor that results. But it's all personal preference. In all, a solid basic recipe. Not to mention, so much more economical than buying kale chips in the grocery store. I recently priced one 2 oz. bag at $39.99 a pound. Yowzah!"

The whole family loves them. 350 is definitely the perfect temperature, and I just take them out when they're sizzling and feel crispy. (Someone had a great tip - try to lay the curly side down, so you get good air flow on both sides of the leaf/chip). Also, I've been using garlic salt in place of regular salt - highly recommend. I just rip the leaves, rinse them, then toss in a large bowl with some tongs in olive oil and garlic salt before laying on the baking sheet and they come out ~PERFECT~ every time."

What I did to get her to like it was after 5 minutes in the oven I sprinkled fine grated quality cheddar over the top and put them back in. I checked them after 5 minutes and started pulling out the chips that were done. I set a timer for 2 minutes and continually pulled out the chips as the finished. With a little cheese these are so addicting we couldn’t get enough."

They didn’t make it off the baking sheet!\n\nIf you have issues with irregular baking or chips not being crispy you didn’t do it right. Make sure at the kale pieces are small, washed and dried completely and put on very low in the oven while stirring periodically"

"reviewBody": "I might rate these higher if I had a better experience with cooking them. \n\nFirst, Kale definitely has a taste that you need to get used to. I'm pretty sure this is something I would get used to fairly quickly (and like) if I had made these properly. \n\nSecond, If I make these again, I will change two things: 1.) don't load up the baking sheet with every piece of cut kale from the branches you bought from the store (I guess I was thinking I could squeeze them all in on two baking sheets). While there was no kale on top of one another, they were definitely densely populated! 2.) I was NOT a good \"Sprinkler\" of the oil! Some places on the sheet had TOO much oil. Because of these two factors, the kale baked unevenly. I had to bake it longer than indicated on the recipe to get them crunchy. I didn't burn any of them but some of them were soggy. \n\nIn all, I ate the ones that were crunchy and threw out most of it that was soggy either due to my over populating the pan or the excess oil. \n\nI think I would really like them if I cooked them right."

Just a teaspoon or so is enough, and rub the kale between your fingers to distribute oil evenly. \n3. Spread kale leaves out on parchment paper coated pan so they aren't folded and leave lots of space between leaves for air circulation.\n4. Set timer for 5 min, check\n5. Set for another 5. Move trays around if using multiple, and turn all kale leaves over once\n6. Set for another 5 and watch very carefully. You want crispy, but not burned. A tiny bit of brownish around the edges is ok"
