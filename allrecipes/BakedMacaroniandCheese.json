After reading other reviews about there being to much liquid, I agreed, so only used 1 1/2 cups of milk. I did add an egg, but after eating the mac and cheese, saw no point in it, so won't be adding next time. The cheese flavor wasn't what my husband and I were looking for, so next time I will use another cheese, maybe shredded mac and cheese. I melted the cheese with the milk, butter and egg. 1 1/2 cups of milk was plenty, there was not too much liquid, it all blended together very well while baking. I covered the casserole dish taking the cover off 15 min before the mac and cheese was done."

"reviewBody": "While this is most certainly easy to make, I probably won't be making it again. The shortcuts (such as not taking the time to make a cheese sauce) just aren't worth it. It would be easier to just mix everything together in the bowl instead of the dish. After baking, the mixture separated, with the butter settling next to the noodles, and the milk curdled. It wasn't the most appetizing dish to look at, but at least the flavor, while bland, was decent. Some added seasonings would have helped. Baking it COVERED, instead of uncovered, probably would have helped prevent it from drying out too much. This just wasn't cheesy-tasting like other mac and cheese I've made. I even added some extra cheese on top to try and making it cheesier."

My oldest son recently turned 24 and asked me to make this for his birthday dinner because he loves it so much. The only change I made was to melt 1 tbsp of butter into one cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs and sprinkle them on top during the last five minutes of baking. It is so easy and delicious! I have taken it to several potlucks and everybody always asks for the recipe! I just sent it to my daughter's best friend from elementary through high school, she remembers eating it at my house over the years and now wants to make it for her own little girl. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe so many years ago, Meredith!"

"reviewBody": "This turned out VERY tasty! To the egg/milk/ butter mixture I added garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and old bay (key ingredient, but dont add too much - a few shakes will do). I used 4T butter and 3.5 cups of cheese. I also layered noodles and cheese 3 or 4 times, ending with a cheese layer and then poured the mixture over top, per another reviewers suggestion. Salt and pepper on first 2 layers of noodles only. baked covered for 20 mins then uncovered another 20 mins. \n\nI will note that there were white chunky curdles all throughout the dish when I dug into it. Im guessing that's a result of adding the melted butter into the cold milk/egg mixture (I let the butter sit to cool before adding it). Is it supposed to be this way? Next time I will take another reviewer's advice and warm the egg/milk mixture on the stove then add the melted butter to the already warm mixture to see if that helps. Otherwise, the flavor was 100% restaurant /catering quality. This is the first time I made this recipe, so if someone knows how to avoid the white chunks please let me know! Will definitely make this again, and likely for holidays as well!"

The top still ended up dry, but once stirred was fine. I forgot to add salt, but it still tasted good. I did have sort of a wet bottom. But once stirred wasn't an issue. Maybe I'll try some of the other tips people mentioned. Will definitely make again."

Seasoned with onion powder and added little pats of butter. Two layers each of macaroni and cheese. Pour milk over the top, just barely covering. Cover with foil and cook 20 minutes. Uncover, top with crushed bbq chips (adds sooo much pizazz!), and continue cooking until bubbly and browning."

The noodles at the top crusted over and i had to add a lot more cheese to it. I seasoned it correctly for what its worth... its helped my cooking abilities because at least i know now how to fix/save my dishes. I recommend covering when you put it in the oven and add maybe another cup or two of cheese, i used a whole brick."

I did make a few modifications to make it not quite as dry, more cheesy, and flavorful. I use milk and half and half and use more of it than the recipe calls for to keep it form being dry and make it more creamy. I also add an egg or two. I use Velveeta original cheese and 1 extra bag of it than the recipe calls for. I add a little sugar and Tony Chachere's spice for a Creole flair. Enjoy!!"
