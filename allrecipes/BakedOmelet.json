Because I cut the amount back to one serving (there's just me) it cooked in half the time, just under 20 minutes in my toaster oven on regular bake. It probably would have been even faster on convection bake but I wanted to keep to the recipe as much as possible.. The only change I'll make next time would be to use green onions instead of dried minced. It was nice and fluffy just a bit brown on top and still not dry at all, just right."

This is absolutely fantastic and I will be making it on a regular basis."

"reviewBody": "4.17.19 It was breakfast for dinner last night, and Baked Omelet was the star of the meal. I thought a sprinkle of paprika might give the omelet a little more eye appeal, but instead, all it did was make the top way too brown…my bad! It really baked up similar to a souffle, climbing up the sides of the dish, so be sure your dish has enough room to allow this to happen. I followed the recipe except for adding a little chopped red bell pepper which was in the fridge, and instead of 8 eggs, used one container of Egg Beaters® plus one egg to get the cholesterol down. It was light, fluffy, and cooked up beautifully. No fussing or watching the omelet cooking in a skillet on a stove top, this just goes into the oven, and then you can focus on the other things you’re planning to serve with it. Quick and easy and most important delicious!"

"reviewBody": "Amazing! I took someone’s advice and used muffin tins to pour them into rather than a casserole dish. Only took 30 mins to cook in my convection oven and we each ate about 3-5 pies. I learned for next time however, that I’ll put the egg &amp; milk mixture into each muffin spot first, and then sprinkle cheese and ham into each spot one at a time. What happened when I did this the first time, is that I mixed all ingredients together and used a large spoon to scoop them into the muffin spots. The result was that a some had mostly egg and others were loaded with cheese. The sizes of them were all different as they were weighed down. Trust me, they taste much better being weighed down!’ So this new way will ensure that it’s even."

"reviewBody": "Very yummy! This is what I did. I cooked three strips of bacon and set aside to crumble. I then cooked half of a diced onion and a 1/4 piece of diced yellow bell pepper in the bacon grease. After beating the eight eggs with the cup of milk, I added a small shake of salt and some freshly ground pepper. Next, I added in the cheese and the onion/pepper mixture.Mixed in the crumbled bacon and baked in the glass pan for 40 minutes adding a bit more cheddar on top for the last couple of minutes to melt. This was a very good breakfast. Served with some southern grits."

A few shakes of hot sauce perks it up a bit. I like it topped with a little salsa and sour cream or yogurt. It's a regular with variations at our house."

I used 5 eggs each, in 8x8 Pyrex and this took only about 25-30 mins. Could easily have fit the 8 egg volume in this size dish as well.\nI prepped my \"mix ins\" the evening before. In the morning, it was quick and simple to prepare and get everything in the oven.\nThis was a really nice simple accompaniment to a small buffet which was otherwise heavy on sweets, breads, and fruits."

One airline served it for breakfast on a cross country flight I frequented. \nI separate the egg whites and whip them up just a bit. Not enough to make a souffle. Add to mixed yolks any cheeses, meats, veggies, herbs that strike your fancy. Gently stir in whites. Butter baking dish well and bake on middle rack. So creamy/fluffy on inside and just barely browned on outside. Baked and served in individual dishes with mixed fruit and oven browned cubed potatoes makes a special breakfast."

Fresh onions instead of dried, and back bacon instead of ham. I also used lactaid free milk, but no issues in any other areas. I served this up as a late supper, with a bottle of Riesling. I will be making it again for sure. I like being able to get it ready, put it in the oven, and only checking it periodically. Great method."

I cut it into 4 squares and put each one in a ziplock bag in the fridge. To reheat in the morning, I unzip the bag, but leave the omelet inside. Heat for 1—1.5 minutes at about 70% power. We like it served with salsa."

In my case I used sausage vs ham, cut up sliced Italian blend cheese vs the cheddar, diced small 1 T sweet onion vs the dehydrated onion, added 1 cup of cut up fresh baby spinach, used 2% milk vs reg milk, added some fresh ground pepper. It came out excellent per myself and my husband. On the second day I added 1 T water to baking dish, covered tightly with aluminum foil and reheated second half of the omelette in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes, then removed from oven and let rest for 5 minutes. This was a great first day and also second day leftover breakfast. Thanks for the great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Between three and four actually, but I'm giving it the benefit since we changed it up-though we added lots of tastey ingredients.. My mom made this for me when I wasn't feeling well. It was pretty good. She made it vegetarian by replacing the ham with chopped mushrooms. She also added red and green bell peppers and chopped marinated artichoke hearts (my request-along with the mushrooms, because I'm not a lover of ham in my souffles). She used the cheddar cheese, but substituted a Parmesan mixture for the mozzarella. It was alright, but we all felt it could use more salt, perhaps because the ham was left out, even though Parmesan cheese is salty. With all my favorite ingredients it was still bland and salt would definitely help. I also really didn't care for the fluffy texture of the eggs. I think I would have preferred more cheese, so with the leftovers I might warm it up with melted cheese on top, extra salt, some fresh chives, sour cream, and chopped tomatoes to boost the flavor- it needs it. The good thing about a recipe like this is that it is super easy to customize. For us it made more than 5 servings when served with a salad, but perhaps that was because of the load of ingredients we added."
