"reviewBody": "Thank you for posting. Like any cook, I made some modifications. Use your knowledge and what you have on hand to make good food. The reason I return to all recipes often! I had a monster size zucchini from the garden so I cut into big nuggets instead of fries. I did use flour in my dredging process but some breading still came off. I added garlic powder. 425 is the key otherwise the zucchini is soggy. At this temp and for 15 mins, the breading was brown and zuc tender. Since zucchini is basically tasteless, I would use a little more salt or another spice to amp it up next time. I put out an array of dipping sauces. Great lunch."

"reviewBody": "These were actually really good and crispy! Since I had only two small zucchini, I sliced them into rounds and decreased the amount of panko and parmesan cheese. I also dredge using the flour-egg-panko prep, as I believe that's what helps to hold the breading together and make them crispy. I did add some onion/garlic powders into the panko and replaced the Italian seasoning with basil. They were a good side to the main meal, and these would be a great, healthy snack too. I liked dipping them in marinara, but my 8 year-old DD enjoyed hers plain. I will definitely make these again!"

I added a bit of garlic powder, onion powder and paprika to the breadcrumb mixture, as well as dredged the zucchini in flour (also with a bit of salt, pepper, paprika, and cayenne in it). They came out perfect! I will definitely make this again, though I didn't use up all the breadcrumb mixture so I will probably start with half so as not to have so much waste at the end. Otherwise, I wouldn't make any other changes."

The bread crumbled off pretty easily when you tried to pick them up or dip them and I think they needed a bit more flavor. I think I should've kept them in the oven more than 15 mins, that probably would've helped them keep together better. Overall, I enjoyed them for making them for the first time."

I used about 2/3rds a cup of Panko but kept the cheese and seasoning amounts the same (and ended up with enough left over for another zucchini). I used a Cajun seasoning blend instead of Italian since we had a spicy spinach and feta turkey burger with them but am sure the Italian would be just as tasty. We will definitely have again."

I salted the zucchini before breading. However, I did not have regular Italian seasoning on hand so I used salt-free Italian seasoning. This may have been why the zucchini fries did not seem quite salty enough for my taste. The next time I make this recipe, I will try using regular Italian seasoning or use Panko bread crumbs with Italian seasoning added. I think a little garlic powder would also add additional flavor."
