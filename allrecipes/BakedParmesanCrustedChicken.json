I used dried herbs instead of fresh (1 T fresh = 1 tsp dried) and Italian breadcrumbs instead of regular (I prefer panko but didn’t have it). Infusing garlic into the butter gave the chicken another layer of flavor. So delicious and really tender."

I read the reviews while it was cooking and seen the suggestion to cook it on a rack so that both sides are crispy so half way through I turned and put it on a rack. Definitely a good idea. Didn't really taste the cheese, would probably add some mozzarella next time. Will make again."

"reviewBody": "Made this a couple times in the last month. The first time I halved the recipe because I just had two large chicken breasts and didn't want to make the trip to get more. It doesn't half the best. It was tasty but the flavours seemed too strong. I still really enjoyed it so I knew I'd have to try it a second time following the recipe properly, and of course that time turned out much better. I think it doesn't need quite as much better as is called for, and I'd be inclined to throw in a little extra cheese into the coating, but it was a very tasty meal, and made great leftovers as well."

The cook time is pretty accurate, but I did need more of the butter and bread crumb mix to prep the chicken. I also used fresh grated parmesan. Bottom line, this recipe will make everyone happy! My husband isn't even a parmesan fan and he loves this recipe, and the kids gobble it up.\nThanks!"

I patted my chicken dry and salt and pepper them, added lemon and white wine to the butter garlic mixture, then added the breadcrumbs and parmesan to the butter mixture. OOPS! Rather than throwing it away and starting over I spread mayo on the breasts then pressed the butter- breadcrumb mixture to adhere. Baked them for 1 hour. Came out fantastic!"

Instead of using a baking dish I melted the butter with garlic in my favorite cast iron skillet. After coating the chicken I placed in back in the skillet and put in right in the oven. Gave it a little extra crunch. Also, for the last minute I melted some mozzarella and put it under the broiler to melt down. Served with marinara and angel hair pasta and a caesar salad."
