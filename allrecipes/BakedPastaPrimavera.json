I did not add carrots, tomatoes, or almonds and had to use feta in place of the goat cheese, but it still came out perfectly. My family raved over it, and my husband, who generally doesn't like pasta, went back for seconds. I would make it the same way again but add mushrooms next time. It seemed to be screaming for mushrooms."

I used veggies I had on hand, vegetable broth instead of chicken, feta cheese instead of goat cheese, dried herbs instead of fresh, and omitted the almonds. I ran out of time and wasn't able to bake it either, but it was still very tasty. Next time I'll bake it though."

"reviewBody": "Easy to make, and a very adaptable recipe. It really does make about 8 servings. It did take longer to assemble than the 25 minutes, though. I had to make some minor subs based on what I had: a different form of pasta, dried oregano, avocado oil in place of butter, veggie broth rather than chicken, regular parchment paper. And some more significant subs: celery in place of asparagus, queso fresco in place of goat cheese, sun dried in place of cherry tomatoes, fresh celery leaves in place of basil. My dish resulted in some milder flavors but was delicious none-the-less. With advance preparation, I'd definitely make it with goat cheese and basil next time. I think the possibilities are broad for the types of veggies one could use."
