The second time, we added 1.5 TBSP of horseradish sauce to add a little extra kick, which was perfect for DH. For us, this makes about 12 mini sandwiches."

Maybe a sharper cheese to mask-don’t know but we couldn’t finish it. I love cheesesteaks. Lived outside of Philly for 8 years and this is a miss in my opinion."

Nice idea for a change, but I for sure want red peppers not pickled ones. The cream cheese didn't do anything for it either."

Cooked the meat and onions the night before. Also prepared the bread. Brought the mixture to room temperature before adding the remaining ingredients the next morning. Prepared the sandwiches before the guests arrived covering with plastic wrap and refrigerating. Judged when we may like to eat, slipped away and preheated the oven. With short baking time everyone was able to enjoy a warm sandwich."

I followed directions as is, although I could only find an 8 oz block of provolone at the grocery...which seemed like plenty enough in the finished sandwich. A 1 lb steak made enough for 2-3 sandwiches on a regular bolillo/hoagie-size roll."
