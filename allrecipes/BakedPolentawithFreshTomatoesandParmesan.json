Then covered it with chopped fresh yellow squash, diced tomatoes from the garden, green onions, black beans and covered with parmesan and mozzarella for 20-25 minutes. It was delicious. Also, I had run out of basil and substituted dried oregano."

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe as is (except I diced the tomatoes and subbed chicken broth for water), and I really didn't like it. However, I think it has a lot of potential. Changes I would make: use maybe a half cup of heavy cream in place of 1/2 cup of milk, use chicken broth in place of water, dice the tomatoes, use more basil. Do not sprinkle the basil over the tomatoes, put it under. If you put it on top, the basil will get dry and crispy. Lastly, and most importantly, DO NOT stir the polenta/cornmeal right into the boiling liquid!!!! I did this part without thinking and the dish was extremely lumpy. You must whisk the polenta into the cold liquid, then bring to a boil. Whisk often as you heat it."

Polenta is made with a 3 to 1 ratio of water to polenta. You can always add water, but you can't take it away is how I was taught. Butter is a must, and maybe a little more cheese (I use Asiago.)"

"reviewBody": "This recipe was awesome! I made a few tweaks by using half vegetable broth instead of all water to boil the polenta. Also, in addition to the sliced tomatoes, I topped with thinly sliced red onions and probably used more than the recommended fresh basil. And added just about 1/4 cup of shredded cheddar / mozzarella cheese to the shredded parmesan sprinkled on top for the last 10 minutes. I served this as main dish with a green salad and it was a great combination. Next time I'll dial down on the calories by trying low/no fat substitutes, but had to try it this way first. Too yummy!"
