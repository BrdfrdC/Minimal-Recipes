The only changes I made was to half the recipe and mix the butter with the italian bread crumbs ahead of putting them on the salmon (they browned easily this way). Personally, I loved the bread crumb mix with it. I'm not a big fan of dijon, but have tried it in other recipes and liked it so this was still worth a shot and I think the concept of the recipe is still good. I think I'd like to try it again, but with a little bit of honey mustard mixed with mayo (maybe just 1 tbsp for a full recipe). That might fit our household tastes better."

I melt the butter, brush on a thin coat (over salt/pepper), then the mustard, then I mix the rest of the butter into the bread crumbs and pack it on. This is a lot faster/easier for me and I’ve never had a problem with the bread crumbs getting soggy. Tonight, we were out of mustard so I mixed “Chef Paul Blackened Redfish Magic Seasoning Blend” into the panko crumbs and it turned out very bit as good so I might try others."

Actually it was not enough mustard for me so I put a little on my plate to dip the salmon in. I used honey dijon mustard. Will make again.\n9-1-19.. I made this again with a few changes. I spread some honey on the fish, THEN I spread on the Dijon mustard. After the 15 minutes was up, I put it under the broiler fo 2 min to put a crust on the topping. This was really good!"

It was a little overcooked and I think I should not have used all the butter. I will definitely try the recipe again, but next time I will season the salmon with salt and pepper first before spreading the mustard on top. I will also try reducing cooking time to 12-13 minutes, as I do like it a little bit pink; and I will use a little less better."

"reviewBody": "This was amazing! Our absolute new favorite way to eat salmon. I had a 1.7 lb long single piece of fish, so I doubled the toppings, skipping the salt since we are trying to be lower sodium - it truly wasn't missed. I melted a whole stick of butter in a small bowl in the microwave, then added all the other ingredients (mustard too!), along with some garlic, basil, oregano, and parsley since my bread crumbs were unseasoned. Topped the salmon entirely, and baked the 16 minutes at 400 degrees, top rack, and checked. The thicker side of the salmon needed more cooking, so I flipped the foil over to cover (without touching foil to fish) the skinny side and stuck it back in the oven for about 7 more minutes. Perfection! Thanks for this great recipe! P.S. it's even better the next day."

We often grill salmon with dill, a taste that goes great with salmon, but nothing compares to how well mustard accents the flavor of salmon. It's also way easier to bake the salmon than to grill it. I use an instant read thermometer and take it out at around 125° and let the carry over temp finish the cooking. Five stars all day long"
