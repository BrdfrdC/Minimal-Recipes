The most positive responses coming from \"my crew\" have come when I dress this up more to resemble my bake lasagna by adding pepperoni. During the final step, I also sprinkle with finely chopped green onion."

Jarred sauce is waiting in the cupboard....I don't always have time for 'home made, and find certain types quite satisfactory. Add some extra seasoning (garlic, herbs) and we are off to the races. I too cook nightly. In a small rural town, with plenty of activities following my workday. This and a salad, and some garlic toast...bam!"

I make this for my son, daughter in law and 3 teenagers and they ALWAYS love it! I change it up a bit: I use angel hair pasta, 2 jars of spaghetti sauce because I use 1 lb. Of hamburger and 1/2 lb. Spicy Italian sausage and I add one green bell pepper and mushrooms and simmer for an hour. I also use a large carton of cottage cheese and twice as much of cheese...whatever I have. I use a large foil pan and it all fits perfectly. This is a super good recipe, that can be altered according to family taste. I do like to sometimes make it more Mexican style using pepper jack cheeses and cumin and chili powder, or, Italian style with oregano. Pluse, I always cook with onion powder and fresh garlic. Definitely a keeper!!!!"

It also took me an hour of prep not 25 minutes. I’d also like to add that a 9x13 was not big enough, I had to separate the layers into two dishes. I didn’t realize this until after I had already started with the second layer, so it made a mess and the second dish turned out mixed instead of layered. I also noticed a flaw in the recipe it says do pasta, cottage cheese, mozzarella, and then meat sauce. However it should be pasta, cottage cheese, meat sauce, then mozzarella, because otherwise it’s meat sauce on top. Thank god I had enough cheese to put another layer otherwise the fish would of looked odd without it. All of that aside it was delicious, and I have plenty of left overs! I’d recommend this recipe to others, but not without warning them of the mess and stress that comes with this recipe."
