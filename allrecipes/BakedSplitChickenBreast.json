Perhaps the reviewer garnered helpful clicks when the incorrect information prompted browsing cooks to reread the actual recipe."

The recipe states to switch the oven to broil the chicken breasts ONLY for the last 5-10 minutes of final cooking (nothing more!) This should yield an extra crispy skin. switch the oven to broil on high heat for the last 5."

Maybe they changed it after posting, but who in their right mind would ever try to fully cook whole split chicken breasts under a broiler? Doesn't even say to crisp it up under the broiler. Color me confused. As it stands, it's a decent recipe. Simple, quick and repeatable. Perfect for Mondays"

There were 4 organic big breast halves and I wanted to make something really good. This was so succulent. I did a few changes, I lanced each breast twice worked in OO, then I worked in my homemade SPG (salt,pepper,garlic), then sprinkled each with the Rosemary and Basil. I also refrigerated it for 3 hours. When I cooked it, I covered the pan with foil for 30 min then uncovered for another 30 min. It was perfect. Made fresh mash and steamed veggies. Everyone had a happy belly."

Or heat slowly on a stove and stir until the cubes and seasoning are mixed and fully dissolved. Remove from the heat and put this aside for now.\n\nHeat butter in another saucepan over medium heat until fully melted. Add flour, and cook this mixture for 1 minute, constantly stirring. The butter will easily dissolve in the flour leaving no lumps\n\nPour the broth mixture gradually into the flour mixture, while constantly whisking everything together.\n\nWhen it comes to a boil, reduce heat and simmer.\n\nContinue whisking until gravy is thickened."

I made it exactly as written but I rubbed the oil mixture under the skin as well as all over. The breasts I had were very big but 60 minutes in the oven and they were baked to perfection. The skin still crisped even without the broiler."

As I ate mine, I thought it was really rubbery so I asked my husband how his piece was and he said, “this is terrible!” Not sure why it was so rubbery, but I won’t make this again."

"reviewBody": "This turned out amazing! My chicken breasts, even split, were too big for one serving, so I sliced across the grain for a nicer presentation. I love using bone in chicken recipes. Leaving the skin on for cooking, and tucking some of that good rub underneath, makes for moister and more flavorful meal, especially if you don't bypass the brief sitting time before cooking. It's so much tastier than bonless breasts, and as a bonus, makings for homemade chicken broth. Thank you, Prospective PhD (I hope you've got it by now!)"

Roasted in the oven as directed for 50 minutes and the skin was a lovely brown, no need to broil. I only refrigerated the seasoned breasts in the pan for 20 minutes, short on time. That didn't seem to affect the outcome!"

But fortunately I checked it at 45 minutes and it was almost done. I put it under the broiler after about another 10 minutes and almost forgot about it. It was pretty crispy and was delicious. Very juicy inside. Will definitely be making this often."

Add thick sliced carrots and potatoes to the leftover marinade and tuck between or under the breasts. \n3. Serve it boneless with crispy skin by slicing off the top half of the (big) chicken breast, leaving the bottom bony half to cool and shred later for leftovers. \n4. Your house will smell like garlic, but the chicken won’t taste garlicky. Omit the garlic if you object to the scent. Your house will smell awesome either way."

The juice in the pan ended up being so nice. \n\nMight also benefit with just a touch of citrus, maybe orange or lemon zest to brighten it up a little."

The rosemary version is top notch. but I also have used a generous shake of McCormick's grill mates Montreal Chicken Seasoning.. I'm going to try also their Rotisserie seasoning. My tip would be, if the breast are frozen It can take about an hour to reach 165 f. I just keep checking and always let it rest 10 minutes before serving. Keeps it juicy and tender."

I doubled the marinade (added a bit of cayenne and paprika) and rubbed it under the skin and on top of the skin.

Crispy skin and moist, tender meat."

I freehanded the measurements and used avocado oil and it was a nice combination. I added oregano and used regular salt instead. I heeded some advice and broiled the last 10 minutes to get a nice crispy chicken. Would make it again with smaller chicken next time and less salt."

I do this for everything I cook, it's what experienced cooks do......experiment, it's fun and it's how all cooks learn!
