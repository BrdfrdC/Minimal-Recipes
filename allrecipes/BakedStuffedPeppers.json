I may add garlic next time but that’s just because I LOVE garlic. A keeper for sure!!"

"reviewBody": "Made this last night and it was very good. Five stars easily. Based on my own likings I did some changes. I cut the amount of burg down and added hot Italian sausage to make up the difference. I squeezed the sausage out of the casing and fried it separate from the burg. Made sure to drain the grease well from both. Fried the onion &amp; some chopped garlic in olive oil. Used already prepared rice that I had. Added all ingredients except the cheese together in a bowl reducing some of the tomato juice so the mixture wasn't too wet because the rice was already cooked. Put it in the fridge for a few hours. Then I stuffed the peppers half way, put in a bit of the shredded cheese &amp; finished the stuffing then added a bit of the cheese on top. Baked them for about an hour @ 350deg. May try it next time with some bacon bits instead of the sausage. I can't add my photo because it's larger than 2mb. :("

"reviewBody": "I am partial to recipes that give the basics, while leaving room for cooks to add whatever, if they want. This one fits that bill. I made approximately a double portion, because someone had given me five HUGE bell peppers. I added more onions, proportionally speaking, and used garlic salt instead of plain salt. The next time I make these I will likely double the cheese, too. Oh, and I used more Worcestershire, because I love Worcestershire. My changes weren't so much in the ingredients, though, as in the manner of preparation. Owing to health related limitations, I can spend only short amounts of time cooking. So I browned the ground beef one day, cooked the rice two mornings later, and that afternoon put the chopped onions and pepper in the microwave. All the ingredients went into the iron skillet and I let them heat up for about ten minutes, giving some time for the flavours to blend. Then I stuffed the peppers and baked them for 15 minutes longer than suggested, since these stuffed peppers were so big. They turned out so good that I doubt my method of preparation detracted at all from the outcome. I'm going to be making these on a fairly regular basis."

I hollowed them out and I blanched them. (Preserves color and texture). I minced up 2 cloves of garlic and half of a white onion. I sautéed that in olive oil until translucent and then added my 1lb ground beef with some butter. When brown, I drained the mixture and put it back In the pan. I didnt have worsurire sauce unfortunately. But I added in salt, pepper, garlic, basil, Italian seasoning, hot sauce(to flavor). For the tomatoes I used fire roasted canned tomatoes. I then cooked everything as directed and it came out fantastic! Thanks for the recipe."

Used 6 red bell peppers rather than green, ground round beef combined with chopped-up left-over vegi-burgers (about half &amp; half) , 1.5 cup red onion, 1 cup beef stock, 1 can Rotel diced tomatoes, white rice left over from a few days ago, 1/2 lb shreaded mozzarella cheese (only marginally past the ex-date) and 1 tea salt, 1 table Italian spice and some left over soy sauce from last week's Chinese take-out. Worked well, they ate it, and I got the frige cleaned out at the same time. (Wife took the left-over one for lunch the next day - and never picked up on the vegi-burger.)"

I added an easy 2 tbsp minced to the cooked meat, along with 1/2 tsp of Italian spices. I enjoyed the fact that they were not coated in sauce, though they were a little dry, IMHO. I think maybe 1/2 of a tomato juice would easily remedy that....or, add that extra cup of shredded cheese in the 2 cup bag. I heaped and packed my peppers full--there was more than enough to go around, which made the non pepper liking people very happy. All in all, this definitely goes in my keeper box, and after 15 years of marriage, and begging on behalf of my hubby to make this...I will concede and say this is the recipe that fits our bill!"
