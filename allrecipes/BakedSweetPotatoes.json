The temp and timing were great though. Crisp and chewy corners, perfectly soft inside. Hub asked that we make this a regular in our vegetable rotation. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because I made minor adjustments."

After eating it, I can't imagine using oregano instead. I also followed another reviewers note to microwave the potatoes to soften them for easier peeling... and I nuked them too much. (I did 3 minutes, all 3 were still solid, so 3 minutes more - partly mushy and I burned my hand. Note: I did poke holes before nuking because you don't want them to explode. ) \n\ntl;dr - They were good and I will make them again (with rosemary)."

I put them back in the oven to see if they would slightly crisp (which they didn't). They had brown marks that weren't there when I cut them up (perhaps from the oregano?).

I love to bake sweet potatoes on a regular basis but I always find that my family wants them sweetened in some way. These came out perfectly seasoned. I did not have to change anything in the recipe and they actually enjoyed them. I did add an extra teaspoon of olive oil to coat the potatoes because I did not have any medium-sized sweet potatoes on hand. All of mine were super huge, so I had to accommodate the oil measurements to make sure they were coated well. Great recipe! We will definitely be making this one again!"

But these were surprisingly good! Based on other reviewers, I cut into smaller 1\" pieces, used ground Rosemary (personal preference), and covered for the first 30 min, uncovered for the last 20 min and were cooked perfectly! Will definitely make these again when I want a change from my favorite regular potato. Thanks for the great recipe!"
