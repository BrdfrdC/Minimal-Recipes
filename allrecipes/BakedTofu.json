I have a tofu press that easily gets rid of excess moisture and poke holes with a fork to allow the marinade to be absorbed. I then allowed the marinade to dry on the tofu in the refrigerator. I then baked the tofu on a wire rack sprayed with canola oil over a sheet pan turning after 20 minutes and cooking for another 20 minutes. We think it’s great and can be used in sandwiches, salads, a ‘mock’ BLT or just served with vegetables and a starch. It’s perfect in our book"

I didn't read carefully how long it had to bake--surprised it needed an hour. Luckily, I was able to cut the time using my convection oven. As it is, we didn't eat dinner til 8:45 PM! Will try again with fresh ingredients."

I first cut a nice green squash into even slices then boiled it till just tended then removed from the stock and chilled it along with even slices of tofu and kept them in the fridge. The only thing that went into the oven were the sesame seeds to toast lightly. Plated the chilled tofu and squash topped the sauce, green onion and sesame.\nDidn't have time for a photo."

Adapted the recipe using Powdered Ginger instead of Fresh Ginger using 1/8th quantity for due to concentration as recommended: Work Great. Adapted recipe NOT Using Sesame Seeds, since our ancient Seeds were Rancid: Worked Great. Evaluation: Seasonings made the Tofu taste very much like it had Teriyaki Sauce on it, so try instead Teriyaki Sauce. Seasoning Mix was too thin, so needed applied every 15 minutes, instead of 30, to use it up. I believe the Agave Nectar is just for sweetening, so sugar might sweeten it up better by also thickening the sauce. Corn Syrup is an exchange as well."

It spends too much time in the oven, it absorbs way too much oil, and all of this for not enough flavor. I have used a similar marinade for tofu (differences: it had grated lemon peel and lemon juice, no sugar or agave syrup) I would quickly sautee in a pan for 5 minutes and the texture was better, not to mention it was ready in minutes."

I drain my block(s) of tofu between thick kitchen towels, and I took one commenter's advice and microwaved the tofu slices for 2 minutes between some paper towels. I also use parchment paper so I don't need to add the calories of oil. The sauce is so delicious that I make extra for when I make tofu in pita sandwiches - with onion/tomato/hummus. The recipe is so good and foolproof that two batches are usually made at a time (one where I add some red pepper flakes for me and none for my husband), and there is some in the fridge at all times. So versatile for a sandwich, to add to soups, etc. This is definitely a keeper."

I did two tweaks from the comments: I pressed the tofu and then microwaved them in paper towels for 2 minutes, and I threw them under the broiler for 2-3 minutes after baking. I could eat this tofu every day for any meal!"

"reviewBody": "I just made this and one thing I would say is to add a bit less soy sauce. My tofu came out really salty. My technique for tofu is to drain it and than freeze it. When I want to use it I just thaw it out in a cup. All the water basically comes out and It becomes a sponge. It literally absorbs everything you put on it. I think that’s the reason my tofu became salty. This recipe was good and I’ll most definitely try it again. One more thing I would note is my tofu only took 30 mins to bake as opposed to the 1 hr."

"reviewBody": "The grownups in our family loved this, but the grandkids I’m still working on to get their full approval for tofu. I made two batches; one with firm tofu and one with frozen, defrosted, firm tofu. Both were great but we like the frozen version even better – little crumbles fell off and baked up crispy, Yum Yum. Also, the frozen version, which is chewier, absorbs the sauce thoroughly and looks a bit more like meat. Be aware that after freezing and defrosting that the block is fragile, thus difficult to slice. The crumbles that broke off were so good that I plan to make my next batch all crumbles to serve on top of rice or toss with noodles and/or broccoli."

I tried with different sweeteners because of what I had on hand - real maple syrup and another time used 2 packets monk fruit sweetener. Both turned out great. I also substituted garlic powder and ginger powder because I had those on hand. Very tasty! They're a great on-the-go snack :)"
