The next time I make them, I might add a little extra seasoning - Italian seasoning, garlic, and pepper - because these meatballs have a mild taste. (This makes them kid-friendly, but as we are only adults, I feel the need to dial up the flavor a bit more.) These freeze nicely; so, I will probably stop buying the frozen meatballs from the grocery store."

I put in fresh diced onions, several cloves of fresh garlic, and made my own bread crumbs from seeded toasted organic bread. I am pretty sure the pre-packaged items, including the Italian dressing, was what made some of the other commenters’ food so salty. My version had a nice crunchy outside with a very moist inside and was deliciously light. I served them over wild rice risotto."

"reviewBody": "I find myself looking for ground turkey recipes as we transition away from beef, this one will be in my regular rotation. \n\nI made some changes by halving the onion and garlic powder, I also used a big handful of fresh spinach. When chopped, it was almost a cup. I also used 20 oz of ground turkey from Aldi. Somehow it worked because I got raves. I will also turn the meatballs in the oven next time. \n\nI may experiment with frozen chopped spinach and possibly use minced garlic and onion to replace the powder. But this is a very quick prep and cook time, so it’s perfect for weekday meals. I did allow the meatballs to cool at room temperature for a bit before I added them to a pot of jarred spaghetti sauce."

One tip to remember that was passed along to me by my Italian great grandmother: When mixing everything together, use a light touch. The more you handle the meat, the tougher the meatballs will be."

Added half a pack of cream cheese, and about a 1/4 of a cup of three cheese italian shredded cheese. Baked it as it was suggested, covered half the time and uncovered for the remaining time. I finished them by cooking for 15 min. in low temperature on a pool of spaghetti sauce. They turned out AMAZING!!!!!!"

According to tips, sprayed the pan and the meatballs with olive oil spray, covered with foil for 15 min, uncovered for 10 min, while boiling two cans of crushed tomato sauce, and when the meatballs came out, we stuck them in the sauce and continued to simmer for about 5-10 min (since we weren't sure if the meatballs were ready). So soft and juicy and flavorful. First review on this site after years of using. Thanks for getting me started. :) Healthy-ish turkey meatballs."

Additionally, I am not a fan of Italian seasoning, so I added a tspn of smoked paprika. The temperature I baked at was 400 and I followed a suggestion of another reviewer (to prevent dry meatballs, &amp; they came out nicely moist): I placed the balls onto a piece of foil and covered with foil for the first half 12 minutes and then uncovered for another 15. The total cooking time was almost 30 min for me. I put in for longer bc I'm in the mountains (Denver) &amp; also bc I made them large. As big as my palm. They do taste great and thanks for the great base recipe!"

I used 1/2 c. though 1/4 would be great if you have to hide it from the kids, but 1/2 c. was not overkill. One review mentioned dryness so I cooked half the time covered with foil, then removed it second half to brown. I used an 8x8 baking dish and the result was 16 meatballs. They were juicy and tasty. These were even better for lunch the next day. Will be a regular at our house!"

I did think some of the ingredient amount seemed a bit off. I halved both the seasonings and used 1 cup of chopped spinach. I added 2 pinches of salt and 1/3 cup shredded parmesan cheese. I realized it called for Italian seasoning after making them and so I rolled them in 3~4 pinches of Italian seasoning. I used 1/4 cup measuring cup to divide the mixture. It made 10 meatballs. I baked them on a foil lined sheet sprayed with cooking spray. I also sprayed the meatballs with olive oil. They took 30 minutes, to bake, turning about every 10 minutes. The meatballs came to 99 cal each as made."
