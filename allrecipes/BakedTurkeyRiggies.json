"reviewBody": "Good taste, turkey goes surprisingly well in the mix. Omitted mushrooms and olives, and just used pickled hot peppers and roasted red peppers. I used my homeade chicken stock that is geletin at room temp. Despite following the directions and using a good stock, this came out with too much liquid. Not sure what happened. I was hoping it'd tighten up while baking, but I still had the bottom third to half of the dish swimming. Ended up pouring liquid down the sink, and not enough tomato sauce coating the noodles. Next time I'd probably use a half cup of the pasta water, and one cup of chicken stock. Double the mozzarella too! I think with all the liquid, the cheese just dissolved. Overall, the flavor made it worth it for me to try this again when I have turkey left overs. Just with a few intuitive changes."

"reviewBody": "Made it. Ate it. Happy. Smelled good when preparing but smelled better when baking. Reminds me of Sunday at my grandparents when I was a kid. Donâ€™t worry about the peppers and kalamata. They mellow when cooked but still a good counterpoint. I was a little loose with the measurements, a little heavy on the liquids but still perfect. Used lots of turkey and a whole pound of mozz and was just right. Thanks John."
