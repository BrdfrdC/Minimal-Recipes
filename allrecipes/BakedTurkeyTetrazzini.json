I thought it had a vaguely sweet taste that I didn't care for - not sure if that was from the cream cheese or maybe the Worchestershire? My husband didn't notice that, but he added hot pepper flakes.\n\nAnd to whoever said they didn't make it because the recipe doesn't state the servings, it does - 6. But I agree that it's hard to find on the page AND the number of servings does not print with the recipe."

"reviewBody": "To clarify the ingredient list: Use 8 ounces of egg noodles and 4 ounces of cream cheese.\n\nThis recipe was good -- certainly not spectacular -- and it used up all the leftover Thanksgiving turkey. The topping, if made as written, is very dry, so if I ever make it again, I'm either going to use more butter or do something else to improve that.\n\nIn my case, I followed the recipe exactly. I'm pretty sure that you could increase the amount of turkey if you have more to use up. Four or even five cups would probably work just as well.\n\nAs others have mentioned, this requires a lot more time and effort than you'd expect, and you have a lot of cookware to clean when you're done. Overall, I feel that if I'm going to do that much work, I want a bigger reward. We enjoyed it, but honestly, it's just OK."

Lots of garlic power and put mozzarella on top instead of bread crumbs. The turkey was roasted with an herb crust and the additional flavor was welcome. 4 stars is only because I altered it so much. Don't really know how the original would have tasted."

It seemed to lack flavor, even with the addition of more worstershire sauce, and the nutmeg gave it a taste I disliked. Another change included doing spaghetti noodles instead of egg noodles. If I make this again, I will have to tweak it a bit and maybe make half the amount."

I made it exactly by the recipe except I didn't have celery, mushrooms or cream cheese. So I made it exactly as written except I omitted the mushrooms and celery, and I substituted 1/2 cup of shredded parmesan for the cream cheese. I did everything else as written.\n\nIt's absolutely delicious, and it would have only been better if I'd had the celery, mushrooms and cream cheese and followed the recipe exactly. But if you're missing a few ingredients as I was, just use this recipe as a guide and make the best dish you can. We all loved it!"

There was nothing exciting about the flavor, though. \nThis took much longer to assemble and prepare than I expected it to, and I dirtied so many dishes to make it. I was glad that I read through the recipe before I started, or I would have taken even longer to make the dish. All ingredients need to be chopped, measured, etc., before you begin."
