Next time we will fry some chopped red bell pepper with the onions and add italian seasonings to the sauce. The 10\"x13\"pan was too small for all the noodles so next time we will cut back on how many we boil."

I added some extra mozzarella cheese on top. Turned out great! The pan was FULL. Definitely a good potluck dish. We will have having left overs for sure."

"reviewBody": "This is a hearty and easy dish to prepare. Our family is health conscious, so I opted to make this dish with whole wheat pasta and ground turkey. We love garlic, so I added 3 cloves of minced garlic to the ground turkey and onion, while I was sautéing them in the pan. Low sodium one jar of sauce was used instead of 2 regular pasta sauce jars. I added a bunch of dried basil and oregano, and it worked great for us. I think this dish is great, because it's so versatile and easy to tweak for personal preferences. Our family likes a lot of spice. Next time, I am going to add a layer of fresh spinach, which won't change the flavor much at all, but it will sneak in some green veggies."

I simply allowing it to rest after cooking it reabsorbs any extra liquid. In fact we're recently I have started making mine the day before and then reheating it. It is so much better on day two!!"

I always forget how to layer it so I look for a similar recipe to make sure I'm getting it right, I'm pretty sure this one closely matches it. I use the Safeway brand Vodka sauce, cover it for all but the last 10 minutes with tin foil and it turns out prefect!"

"reviewBody": "Ok 6000 + reviews got my attention. I have a recipe I use for my baked ziti but to honesty critique this one I first try the recipes exactly as posted for an honest opinion. Saying that this is particularly good as is. But like so many others I made again with my adjustments. First off instead of buttering the dish use a ladle or two of sauce. It won’t make the noodles stick and you can get sauce in every bite so it doesn’t dry out. Next provolone is fine but sour cream in my opinion is better not used instead season the ricotta and use it for authentic taste. Finally the top layer gets Parmesan and mozzarella. Enjoy"

Gave it a great flavor and added a creaminess to the dish. Next time I’ll follow the recipe and leave out the ricotta/cottage cheese. Will make again and again!"

It really doesn’t add anything, and will make this very hard to eat. Without the provolone this is a great version of ziti. I took others suggestions and put the sauce mixture directly on the pasta, that part turned out great. And cover the dish while cooking."

I like the sour cream over ricotta bc its not as heavy. it was a hit among family served up with toasted Italian bread and a salad. thank you. p.s. sauce on bottom then pasta and cover with foil for 30 mins and then uncovered for 5 mins if you like browned edges like me.

I also used less cheese since i only had 8oz bag mozarella+provolone mix, and about 2oz leftover shredded mozarella. It was still flavorful enough, i want to think its a little healthier!

I just made it again and it was a bit too acidic this time, so might need to add in sugar or a little cream (I did use private selection marinara instead which is different than usual). I love love LOVE this dish and will make it for my future kids one day. My siblings and I (3 of us total) managed to eat it for dinner 3x in a row before it finished out. We didn't get tired of it at all. I followed the recipe exactly, except I seasoned the sauce/meat with stuff in my\npantry. I also cover it with foil and cook it for maybe an hour, and also broil it towards the end to crisp up the top. So yummy"
