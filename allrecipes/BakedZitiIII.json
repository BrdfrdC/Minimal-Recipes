I have since used it to feed guests at funeral luncheons, an anniversary party and countless meal deliveries to those in need of a meal. I was told to mix the sour cream into the pasta before layering, and I have never veered from that piece of advice. It is creamy and cheesy. My personal preference for sauce is Prego Traditional. Enjoy!"

Taking the advice of tossing the pasta in some of the sour cream is a great idea. A hit in my home."

I was just looking for basic pasta dishes, because I don’t cook much Italian food. But this ended up being a delicious “poor man’s lasagna”. If I closed my eyes, I couldn’t much tell the difference, from a flavor perspective. The sour cream combined with the provolone cheese really does end up tasting like ricotta cheese.\n\nThe only thing I would say is if you are using a 2 quart dish, it will overflow. I used a 3 quart glass pan and it was full to the brim.\n\nEnjoy!"

With that being said, I used 1 1/2 cans of sauce to simmer and the other half I put a big scoop of sour cream in the remaining amount and mixed. I spread that over first layer. I put the rest of the sour cream and sauce in skillet with the onions and let that simmer. I doubled the meat and the cheese because we wanted meaty and cheesy and we got just that. The flavor that the sour cream brought to the dish was so good."

"reviewBody": "I highly recommend this recipe but do have some comments. I found sauce in our grocery store only comes in 24 oz size so I bought 3 of them and used 2 1/3 to get to exactly the 56 ounces total the recipe calls for. That was probably a little too much, will stick to 2 jars next time. Typical of recipes in this app the total time required is understated some. And despite simmering the onions as directed (length of time) they ended up a bit crunchy. Lesson learned - taste them next time. Which is fine but will just lengthen the total time a little more. I also subbed in low fat versions of cheese and sour cream and it turned out just fine in terms of taste and texture."

"reviewBody": "A KEEPER!\nA delicious meal. I didnt use provolone cheese because I didnt have any. I used mozzarella and parmesan in the dish and on top. I also used whole wheat pasta. I didnt think I would like the whole wheat pasta in this dish because of the texture but took a chance anyway. I couldnt tell the difference so I'll keep this substitution. I used a 11×14 dish and both jars of spahaghetti sauce. I know many people said its too much but my family love cheese and I knew it would be on the drier side without extra sauce. It was prefect! So if you use the amount of cheese listed in this recipe, you will not need 2 jars but I used 6 oz shredded parmesan and nearly 4 cups shredded mozzarella Also, the suggestion to add the sour cream to the pasta first is genius- it makes the dish nice and creamy! I topped with dry basil- didnt have fresh. Even with the larger 11x14 dish on 350, it was still done in 30 minutes. Next time I will make sure I have provolone. I think it will be more delicious but even without it, it's a 5 star recipe."

I usually double the recipe and put half in the freezer. It is unbelievable how well this freezes. This has become a favorite of our large family gatherings."

Thank you for the base recipe. Excellent dish. This is definitely a keeper."

I added a good amount of minced garlic and Italian seasoning to the sausage. I also mixed in the sour cream with the cooked noodles. This kept the noodles from drying out. I’ll be making this again!"
