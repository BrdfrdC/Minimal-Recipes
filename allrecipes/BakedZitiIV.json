"reviewBody": "This recipe is definitely a keeper with a few changes that I made. I used one and a half 28 oz. jars of Rao's Marinara Sauce. As some others suggested, I mixed the meat sauce and noodles together. I used a 15-16oz. tub of ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and mixed that with the sour cream, mozzarella and parmesan cheese. I then layered half the meat/noodle mixture on the bottom of a 13x9\" pan, spread the cheese/sour cream mixture on top, layered the rest of the meat/noodle mixture and then topped with the provolone cheese. I baked it covered for about 30 minutes and then uncovered it for about 5-10 minutes. Everyone LOVED it! I served it with a green salad and garlic bread. Next time I might add some fresh italian parsley to the cheese mixture."

"reviewBody": "I've made this a few times and it's a good recipe. I always add basil as well. The only other change I strongly recommend is that you put the provolone in two different layers and spread it out more, don't cram it all together. Provolone is potent and If you don't spread it out it can be way too concentrated and overpowering in some bites. I put half of the provolone on the first layer, and had it more spread out and then put the rest of it on the second layer below the remaining sauce, that way you can taste it but you don't get anymore bites that sting your tastebuds lol.\n\n(Yes I used the proper baking dish and quantity of cheese)"

I’ve never made ziti this way, and I was skeptical. But, wow, it was good! It does make a lot. It’s just the two of us empty nesters here. Enough for a family of four or five, or enough to share with a neighbor if you like yours. Hubs is on plate #2 so you know it’s pretty darn good. He can be a picky eater! I wish I had taken a picture when it came out of the oven, it was pretty, but we were hungry! I will definitely be making this again."

"reviewBody": "this recipe tastes too good for being this simple to make. due to the quarantine I had to use large elbow macaroni instead of ziti, grated mozzarella in place of the provolone, and substituted dried rosemary for fresh since that's what I had on hand. and tbh, I don't think it could have made that much of a difference (when using dried herbs, always crush them between your fingers a bit before adding them in to release more flavor). but other than those minor changes I stayed true to the recipe. don't skip on the sour cream or substitute ricotta for the cottage cheese either. it just won't be as creamy. even if you don't like cottage cheese, trust me. you'll love it in this. and every other time I've made baked ziti the recipe called for mixing the pasta with sauce, the cheese mixture, or both. this recipe didn't call for that so I left it dry. IT WAS SO GOOD. and probably why it was very close to a lasagna (but half the work). if I could give this recipe more than five stars I would. I took a few photos but I'm having problems loading them right now. I will come back and try to post them again later."

I used 1/4 package (80 grams total) of shredded old cheddar and 1/4 package (80 grams total) of shredded Italian blend cheese instead if the provolone.\n3. I added 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning.\n4. I added 1 teaspoon of dried basil.\n5. I sprinkled shredded parmesan as well as grated on top to my desire without measuring.\n6. I added 1 medium red pepper, diced, and cooked with onion.\n7. I mixed all the cheese (aside from parm) together in a bowl.\n8. I took the advice to put a small amount of sauce on the bottom of sprayed baking dish, then layered noodles, cheese mixture, meat sauce and repeated."

So it kinda made it gross for me. But I'd make it again without. \n\nOH! And I pre-made my own sauce. There's NO way I'd use jarred sauce"

The instructions didn't state to drain meat after it's been cooked, but likely because it's a no-brainer. Liked this better than the other versions I've tried. I did end up using two jars of sauce."

I would recommend changing pork sausage for Italian sausage and swap the cottage cheese for ricotta cheese. I understand the jarred sauce helps speed up the process, but the sauce is an area where some of the flavor comes from."

The only things that I do differently is use smoked provolone versus the regular and add some italian spices to the cream mixture. We also do not eat beef so I use ground turkey as well as ground turkey sausage."

A bit healthier alternative without sacrificing flavor! Also, we had some fresh smoked sausage on hand, sliced it up, browned in a pan, and it was AMAZING! I'm sure it is also fabulous with the recommended recipe protein. Sweet and smoky ziti was the best comfort combo we could have asked for. We can't wait to make at our next gathering! Yummy! Thank you for sharing ??"

Only used sausage (a pound), and eyeballed everything else. Used Italian cheese blend and the provolone, and a pretty good dose of parm on top. Used one quart of sauce and 1/3 C pasta water. Added onion, garlic, and mushrooms; all fresh and put in w/ the sausage to cook. Hubs didn't say a word while eating, then asked for seconds! Makes alot, which we like, so we have leftovers, and some to freeze for down the road. Thanks for the great recipe!!!"

"reviewBody": "I make this all the time and it's really quite tasty. I've made it as written and it's good, however over the years I've came up with my own recipe. First, I use high-protein pasta as not only is it healthier, it holds up better in baked pasta dishes I've found. I also use an 11x15 casserole dish - this makes a LOT of food. Third, I use 6 cups of sauce (I use my own) and use 20oz hot Italian turkey sausage (which I take out of the casings and crumble). Like others have mentioned, I prefer to mix (1 cup) sour cream and (1 cup) cottage cheese and the mozzarella in a bowl and mix the pasta into the sauce (under cook the pasta by 2 minutes). \n\nLayer pasta/cheese/pasta and top with grated parm and provolone &amp; bake for 20-30 mins at 350. A little work but it makes a ton and is quite tasty!"

IMPORTANT: Only need about 1/4 of the amount of sour cream mixture called for or will be wayyyyy too rich. Add all to greased pan. Use any combo of cheeses.
