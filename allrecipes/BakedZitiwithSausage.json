I'm on the website now because I had several people Ask Me For the Recipe! I tweak it a little each time of course. Today I added a little more garlic, and used turkey sausage with the gluten free dish. Also some red pepper flakes. But that's why this recipe is so excellent! It's never failed me . I'd give it 10 stars if that was possible."

"reviewBody": "This is a very good basic recipe as is, but a little bland. After reading other reviews, I made it again with the following changes. I used two pounds of Italian sausage and sautéed the onions with the sausage. I added more garlic and a 14.5 can of drained diced tomatoes with garlic to the ricotta cheese mixture. As others suggested, I doubled the amount of Italian cheese, using an 8 oz. package with each layer. Finally, I topped it with the basil as recommended and sprinkled shredded parmesan on the top. Spraying the underside of the aluminum foil so it doesn't stick to the cheese worked very well. Finally, we let it rest for 5-10 minutes while we tossed the Caesar salad and baked the garlic bread. Delicious! Next time, we are going to add mushrooms and sliced black olives to step it up even more."

I think too that this recipe could also be a jumping off point for fancier versions with the addition of mushrooms, red crushed chili, olives, etc. I will be making this again and possibly trying some variations.

Only changes to this recipe was to add a pinch of fresh nutmeg and pepper flakes to the pasta, sausage, ricotta mix. Instead of bottled marinara, I used the \"Best Ever Marinara\" sauce recipe from this website as I had a batch frozen. Yum! We loved this. It was delicious. Thanks."

It was perfect and delicious - maybe a little too saucy - but still great. No one noticed less noodles and I think I'll stick with it that way. It made less and didn't cause me to open another jar. We are a family of 5 and still had a couple of servings of leftovers."

Used Italian Sausage and since the package was 19 oz. that’s what I used. Browned the onions and garlic with the sausage. Sprayed the foil with Pam before covering the pan. Baked for 30 minutes before removing the foil and baked an additional 15 minutes. Quite good and easy to put together so will make again."

The only changes I made was 1/2 jar more sauce because my boyfriend likes his pasta saucy and I used 3 tsp of italian seasoning instead of the basil and oregano (because I'm lazy and adding one spice instead of 2 was easier). Also I sauteed the onion with the sausage so it was soft and tender. But my boyfriend who is picky about pastas loved this!"

I ended up going up 400F for about 15 minutes after instructed cook time because it wasn’t cooked all the way through (barely hit 100F internally)—gotta cook that egg thoroughly! Outside of the temperature adjustment, the meal tasted awesome and was well liked by my picky husband and six year old. I used Mazzetta basil and garlic marinara sauce to kick up the garlic flavor and I’ll do it again in the future!"
