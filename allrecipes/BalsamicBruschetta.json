Raw garlic can be pungent as well as raw herbs (but dried herbs can be added directly), so cook that up quickly to incorporate it together, let it cool, and then mix it with the tomato mixture. But still a good recipe to get started with a solid bruschetta!"

"reviewBody": "This one is tricky. Bruschetta is definitely more of an adult dish, as the kids didn't really enjoy it, but they ate it nonetheless. I swapped out fresh basil for dried, as the supermarket had again run out of it in the produce section. Definitely prepare the tomato mixture the night before you plan to eat it. It allows the mixture to chill and to soak in its own juices, and it creates a very pleasant experience and also works to moisten the bread. Definitely a keeper, but sadly the kids weren't fond of it."

Anything with balsamic vinegar will always catch my attention. No need to peel or seed tomatoes - I cry a little each time I see that in a recipe. Such a needles step. I ended up warming a chopped garlic clove in some olive oil over a low heat - then used the olive oil for the bread and put the warmed garlic clove with a little of that olive oil in with the tomatoes. A great end of summer treat."

I added the cheese when I broiled the bread and served it immediately. I am not sure why some people refrigerate this before serving. Tomatoes lose flavor when they are chilled. FYI, I left the tomato seeds in and used a slotted spoon to place the mixture on the bread. The bread remained wonderfully crisp."

In the “off-season” I make this and use it like a tapenade on my sandwich with lettuce and bacon and some Mayo. It is SO delicious. One slight trick is to make sure you scoop out the seeds and watery part of the tomatoes and only dice up the outer flesh and skin or you will have a soggy mess. I also like a very small pinch of sugar. It just counterbalances the acidity nicely, but literally just a tiny pinch."

I made just a couple of adjustments, I used a mix of tomatoes instead of just Roma and I added just a small sprinkle, maybe about 1/2 teaspoon, of sugar to cut the bite of the balsamic vinegar."

My husband and I tried one as written , then for the rest I sprinkled some shredded mozzarella on top and drizzled with a balsamic glaze ( purchased at Kroger) and popped it in the oven to heat up . This put it over the top! It really balanced the flavors and made it 5 star. He wanted to know if we could have this all the time and he is extremely picky."

Just let it sit on top of the other mixed ingredients. I think it looks better without the balsamic all over the white cheese for presentation. Really tasty and easy way to do caprese appetizer. Glad I found this one."

(what others suggested to do with french bread below) highly recommend this recipe cause it was absolutely delicious and super simple!!!!!"
