"reviewBody": "Not horrible but could use more flavor. I made the marinade into a glaze/gravy since it doesn't thicken up even on a boil. Let the chicken sit for 25/30 minutes only put 1 tbs sugar &amp; 2/3 cup balsamic vinegar. Used oil and a bit of butter to cook the chicken medium rare/medium then cut into strips and set aside. Put marinade in and it would not thicken so I added flour so it did eventually thicken then added chicken in when it was almost thick enough to my liking. Reminds me of sweet n sour chicken but in a balsamic way. Good over yellow rice."

I normally like to make this with green beans and sun-dried tomatoes, but the way the chicken is marinated and cooked in this recipe doesn't work well with vegetables. The flavor of it was good, but the texture of the chicken was rubbery. I can barely eat it. Such a waste."

"reviewBody": "I made this on this past Saturday. It is now Tuesday, and my husband is begging for it again. He LOVES it! I served it over Rotini pasta that had a little butter, onion powder, and garlic powder on it only. That's how we will have it tonight also, however, we were trying to decide between pasta and rice. I ended up marinating the chicken for a few hrs doing other things and had made thin strips, not breasts. I used med high heat as suggested, but I think this stove cooks hot. I just went with it. I seared he chicken on both sides and let it cook a few minutes on both sides. Because they were thin, it worked out brilliantly. The chicken had a wonderful caramelized seared outside due to the sugar and inside was very moist. The chicken was so flavorful! I highly recommend this dish, but marinate as long as you can. also, I did not make a sauce out f the remaining marinade. I thought it would be overkill. Just the chicken pulled from the marinade, placed in a hot pan, and put on the pasta."

"reviewBody": "There was nothing wrong with this recipe that I can point out. It tasted okay for me, simple to make with everything I usually have in the pantry. My Husband didn't go nuts over it but he had no complaints. \n\nI did make enough for leftovers. Although I didn't serve them as a main dinner protein again, they made an EXCELLENT add to my individual meal planning. I.E., salads, brown rice and veggies, egg white scrambles, etc.\n\nI portion and measure most meals for myself as part of my weekly health/fitness routine and it gets difficult to prepare chicken breasts in ways that are creative.\n\nThere's a good probability that I did something wrong when following the recipe. I'll try it again."

No changes needed as far as I was concerned other than I would let it marinade for longer than 20 mins. Also it's helpful that all recipes gives a general nutrition label and a host of low sodium recipes"

I reduced the balsamic marinade (boiled it down until concentrated and a bit thickened) , baste it on the chicken and baked it another 10 minutes or until juices run clear from the leg joints. Cut up tye chicken into pieces, sprinkled some salt (tasted a little weak without it) and served this with fresh raspberries. My teens really enjoyed this!"
