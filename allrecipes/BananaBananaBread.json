"reviewBody": "Overall it was good, not great. I added a 1/4 cup of olive oil to moisten it. I also also add chocolate chips and walnuts, which is pretty typical for my banana bread. I normally like to add a little cinnamon and nutmeg which I forgot to do for this recipe and I think that made it a little more bland that I’m used to. It took 90 minutes instead of 60 minutes to fully cook. It’s a basic banana bread recipe and as such is easy to follow. I have no real complaints other than it needs something to bring it up to the next level."

My only complaint is I can’t get the baking time accurate and I’ve had some mushy spots; second time I baked a bit longer, still had mushy spots and then a bit burned on the top. However, the recipe is super super tasty and simple!"

"reviewBody": "This is an easy and delicious recipe, but beware that it's not sweet as it is. Here's a tip if you like your banana bread tasting sweet: -Put one cup of brown sugar instead of 3/4 cup. If you don't have enough brown sugar, you can use whatever brown sugar you have left and substitute the rest with regular sugar. Additional Tips: - Make sure to poke the center of the bread a few times once the bread starts forming. This is so you don't have a doughy center. -You'll need 7-8 bananas for this recipe. It doesn't make a difference if you put 8 instead of 7 so use what you have. -It doesn't matter if you Light or Dark brown sugar. Mini Loaf Tip: 1. If you're baking mini loafs (6.29 \"W 1.77\"H), I suggest baking them for only 25 minutes. I've made this bread several times already, and everyone loves them!"

"reviewBody": "If you’re looking for a sweet, dessert type bread - avoid this recipe. This is a very well made bread. None of the ingredients are overpowering. Actually, other than the bananas, you won’t taste anything. Not a pinch of salt, butter, or sugar. A little on the bland side, but I think that’s the intention, and the recipe produces a well made bread. This is the recipe for you if you’re a banana bread purist. I like fruit breads to be on the sweeter side. I’ve made this 6/7 times now. The first, I followed the recipe exactly. After that, I always make sure to double the salt, add white sugar, and 2 more tablespoons of butter. I also add in some well mashed pineapple and mandarin oranges. I know that it’s not the same recipe, but I’ve made the original. It’s a great base for me to make something sweeter and to my liking. Again, great basic banana bread."

Because of diabetes, I also cut the amount of sugar to half and add in wheat germ and or ground flax.

To each their own though! -But this recipe is a great starter or as is recipe, which is my kind of recipe!"
