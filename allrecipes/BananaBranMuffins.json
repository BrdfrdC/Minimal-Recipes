Second time I used whole wheat flour with the bran, added a basic autumnal spice mix (cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice), some chopped walnuts, and lastly a small sprinkle of mini cinnamon chips on top. Wanted to pump up the fiber content and flavor profile. Very yummy, and the added wheat flour only made them slightly denser. All the banana helps keep them moist. I think it would work very well with pumpkin instead of banana, too."

Worked well! I also added in a half cup of raisins instead of walnuts, so we still got the boost of fiber. I would definitely make these again!"

The recipe does not call for molasses which makes me wonder where the attached picture of the muffins came from. Also since the amount of bran is so small they taste more like a muffins only made from flour - very dough-ie"

"reviewBody": "This is a wonderful and easy recipe. I always make a new recipe exactly as the recipe says to, then if I want to tweek it I know where.My second batch I only changed the sweetner, but I did add a couple things. Butter? Of course, I'm not going to eat the whole batch. Instead of brown sugar (I don't know why folks think it's better for you, it's just white sugar with molasses added to it) I used organic sprouted barley malt syrup at 1/3 C. I soaked the bran in the milk while I prepared the batter, and, I added a cup of thawed cranberries that I gave a couple pulses in the processor and sprinkled a tablespoon of flour and a teaspoon of sugar on them before adding to batter. The flour keeps them suspended in the batter. I love the tart berries with the bananas and they came out just as wonderful as the original recipe. I normally use a scale for baking so I weighed the cup of cranberries I wanted in case anybody wants to add them.\nCranberries can be any size but weight is weight, chopped, whole, big or small. They weighed 5 oz.\nOh, to compensate for the extra moisture I used I simply used bread flour in stead. A cup of bread flour weighs a 1/4 oz more than all purpose. I made these in the giant 6 to a pan muffin pan."

Chia seeds (grounded up) 2 tsp. all spice and 1 tsp. cinnamon. I also soaked the bran in the milk and added an extra 1/4c. milk (for added moisture because I added the extra flax and chia) I also did 2c. whole wheat flour and 1c. All purpose flour. (I usually take 1/2 butter and replace it with applesauce but didn't have any this time.) I didn't add the nuts as I wanted to send these to school for the kids lunches. Made 3/4 of the recipe plain and added Chocolate chips to the last portion. These Were Great. Will be keeping this recipe."

These are the only substitutions I made to make them healthier: substituded 1/4 cup coconut oil and 1/4 cup applesauce for the butter, decrease the flour to 1 cup and added in 1/2 cup oat bran, used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 2 tablespoons truvia baking sugar, and added a couple chocolate chips for good measure. HOLY MOLY. They are dense, moist, delicious and incredibly healthy!!!! And the batter made enough for about 16 muffins. I'll be making these as often as I have a sweet tooth (every single day).

I used a whole wheat self rising flour (pancake flour actually) to reduce the number of ingredients I had to fool with (self rising allows you to skip the soda, powder, and salt). Otherwise followed recipe exactly. But next time I will try applesauce instead of butter - probably a 'heavy' 1/2cup to ensure moist muffins."
