Off the top of my head i thought about Russian tea cakes/Mexican wedding cookies that cook at 400 although I think off the top of my head it's only 9 minutes. I only went through a few reviews and didn't see others having a problem with it so I decided to go with the 400. It worked out fine! Also, I used a silicone baking mat instead of greasing the pan. I also love a variety of different kinds of cookies from shortbread to chocolate crinkle (like a brownie) so a cake like cookie is fine with me but I'm glad i was warned. It is very cake like. I think it would be a great cookie to serve at a family brunch."

I found another recipe that was very similar the only changes being that it was 3/4 cup butter and called for 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar - which I had done in this recipe anyhow. And 2 tsp vanilla, I put 3 in. This recipe may have worked better if it was at a lower temp. The new one that I tried used a temp of 350¬∫ rather than 400¬∫ and they did not burn. Baked at 12 1/2 minutes."

"reviewBody": "Not a bad recipe, but needs more details. Def use less baking powder. I reduced to 1 1/2 tsp and they were still very cake-like, almost like a pancake. I also recommend making these very small, maybe silver dollar size, so they can get an even enough browning to get that cookie-like caramelization. 200 C is a little high, but the heat is necessary. I also did half brown sugar half white sugar but all white sugar might be necessary for a crunchier texture. Definitely needs a little tweaking before I'd want to make them again."

Everything else as written. They were delicious. I had no trouble with the 400 degrees, it all depends on the amount of time. Let me mention it again, the addition of the coconut was DELICIOUS."

I made two minor changes to use what I had on hand: substituted 1/2 cup liquid egg whites because we were out of eggs and used 1 cup of mini-morsel chocolate chips, which was all I had, but that ended up a perfect amount, because the smaller chips distribute well and there was chocolate in every bite still."

"reviewBody": "Okay recipe. Had to make a few adjustments based on other reviews, including using only 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 cup white sugar, and a little over 1/2 cup of the semisweet chocolate chips instead of the 2 cups it calls for. I added a 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. I used three very ripe bananas and that came out to a little over 1 cup of mashed. I always substitute vegetable shortening for butter in every recipe, so that was a norm for me. I reduced the cooking temp to 350 and cooked them for about 13 minutes.\n\nThey turned out delicious!!!!!!! I am very happy with this cookie and will use this base + my alterations again and again, but I will probably lower the sugar amount just a tad next time and see how that turns out."

Baked the second batch at 350 and they were better. Could also use some more banana."

I also used 2 cups of whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour as in the recipe. They are so good! Needed a few extra minutes in the oven as they're quite fluffy, but the extra time added a bit of a crunch to the bottom which is nice. Next time I'd want to try with even less sugar because they are quite sweet. Maybe use dates instead. Would definitely make again!!!"

"reviewBody": "As mentioned by someone else, these are very cakey, not sticky or chewy. That was ok for me, but they also came out very bland. They don't taste bad, but they're kind of dull, and barely any banana flavor. I often do lots of substitutions, but as I hadn't made them before and need to bring them to an event, I went by the recipe exactly as is. I will try them again in future but will substitute brown or coconut sugar for most of the white, and maybe also use a more flavorful flour blend with coconut and/or almond flour. I'd also use a lot more banana. But they are fine to have as a simple snack with coffee or tea."

Two changes I made though, I did turn down the oven temp to 350 degrees and used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. You really do have to watch , because the tops stay very light, but the bottom gets brown quickly, so parchment paper works better for these. Also I did add 1 cup chopped pecans. Very soft cake like cookie."
