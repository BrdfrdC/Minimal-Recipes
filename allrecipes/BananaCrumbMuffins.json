"reviewBody": "This recipe caught my eye because it called for 3 bananas (i see many with only 2) and that's what I had to start with. The crumb topping sounded extra yummy. The recipe I did not change at all. However, I think it is for jumbo muffins and I used regular. So to my surprise, I had a lot more mix and broke out a second muffin pan and made 18. In doing this I did adjust the cooking time so they wouldn't burn. The prep time (let's be real... 15 minutes is having everything premeasured and in front of you ready to go) it's more like 30-40 minutes and that's me cleaning as I go - putting dirty things in the dishwasher, not actually washing. I had a cooking time of 16 minutes (I like my muffins on the light and moist side). It was exactly 1 hour from start to finish turning the oven off. Cooling time was additional. I took them out of the muffin tins after 5 minutes so they wouldn't keep cooking. And they were deeelicious!!!"

I too like using white sugar and brown sugar together best. (1/2c white sugar, 1/4c brown sugar instead of 3/4c white) Also, I remembered the review where someone commented on how their topping burned.....so I lowered the oven temperature to 350 for 18 minutes and they came out perfect. The crumb topping really adds to it too!! Can't wait to make these again and get creative!!"

SUGGESTION: Maybe a little more butter to the crumb topping as it was a bit drier than expected. Also, double the crumb topping (you'll have leftover topping, but it will cover all the muffins depending on how much topping you want)."

And if you saw my picture the topping didn’t stick. Awesome food but only if you’ve made it before and know the changes it needs. So that makes it a 4 1/2 rating if not 4. But still best recipe I have found on AllRecipes."

"reviewBody": "The recipe is great for these muffins, and has been added to my trusty recipe book with the following modifications. To intensify the banana taste I baked my bananas in thier peels at 350 for 10 mins or so. They went from a couple of spots to completely brown. I subbed in 1/4 cup brown and 1/2 cup white in the batter. I took other viewers suggestions and doubling the crumb topping and adding vanilla, fresh nutmeg and cinnamon to the batter. In the end, it made 12 very full muffins in a standard size muffin tin. Happy baking!"

"reviewBody": "Great recipe. I tried making it a bit healthier by making some changes suggested by others. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 C and equally split it between white an brown sugar. I added 1tsp vanilla, 1/2tsp nutmeg and 1/2tsp cinnamon. I replaced butter with 1/3C of vegetable oil. Only had 2 bananas and added 4TBLS of unsweetened apple sauce. With the flour, I split it 3/4 white and 3/4 whole wheat. Didn't add topping because I don't like overly sweet muffins for breakfast. I did add chopped walnuts. They came out perfect."
