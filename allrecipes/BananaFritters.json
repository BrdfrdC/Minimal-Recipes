Glazed with 1 cup of powdered sugar mixed with about a tablespoon of milk to get the right consistency and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Lots of flavor to complement the banana."

They taste good but no matter how I cooked them, they were not appealing to the eye. I won't usr this recipe again."

I tripled the recipe (plus the one extra banana). I don’t have a thermometer so I just dropped them in with a serving spoon when the oil was sizzling. I had to get my timing right because some were still a little doughey inside but I eventually figured it out. The sugar didn’t really stick to the outside but my family enjoyed them even without sugar.\nIt made a lot but I know they won’t last long! Will definitely make again."

I made subtle changes; I used 4 bananas instead of 2 and for the 2 cups of flour I did 1 cup regular flour and 1 cup wheat flour. They came out a bit greasy, but I wonder if I made them smaller; they'd cook faster and I wouldn't have to leave them in as long. Something yummy to accompany them instead of powered sugar...try sugar free raspberry jam. It was so good and cuts the sugar even more and adds a bit more fruit to it."

"reviewBody": "Deep fried banana bread drops are how I'd describe these. Tasted fine, but I think for the end result to taste pretty much like banana bread, I'll just skip the deep frying and make a banana bread loaf. I did roll them in sugar after frying and lightly dusted with powdered sugar for effect. Would suggest to only fry about 1 TBSP drops at the most at a time so that they cook throughout. And the suggestion to just let them turn themselves is a good one! Not my favorite recipe, but always fun to try something new."

"reviewBody": "These were really good! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I added about 1 tsp of vanilla and 3 tbsps of sugar, so I'm not sure how the unchanged version is. The important thing is to allow the dough to turn on its own in the fryer. If you just watch them as they are cooking, you'll see that they turn on their own, and when they are a nice golden brown, just take them out. I had no problems with doughiness or being undercooked with this method, nor did they burn. I didn't have any powdered suger, so I omitted it, but they were good on their own, and sweet enough. My hubby and 2-year old loved them!"

It helped to have two people frying/turning because they browned quickly. After the oil temp was right, we had to turn it down because they burned quickly. Our bananas were old and yet we thought they needed to be more sweet, so we dipped them in syrup! Wonder if another banana would've helped?"

I added about an 1/8 cup white sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla, and a few shaked allspice. They were delicious. I am not sure how they got so picture perfect in the photo though.

"reviewBody": "This recipe is workable once you figure it out.\r\n\r\nFirst it cooks best in a deep fat frier that has a temperature control. I cooked them on 300. If you don't have that a low pan of oil on the burner would probably do.\r\n\r\nWhile you are cooking them though I found that you had to poke them in the middle after they were half done to get them to cook the middles so they weren't goopy.\r\n\r\nAnd they don't have much of a banana taste. If you like them more banana I would add a banana or two."
