That was an easy fix, though, with about a cup of oatmeal in a double batch. I found out that this is a very forgiving recipe.

I also always use a wooden spoon when making muffins so that they never get over mixed. I love to eat one when they have only been out of the oven for 10 minutes or so and are still warm!"

My bananas were frozen and I read on another receipt that if you peel the frozen banana and put them in a strainer with a bowl underneath, the banana will produce a juice. In one batch, I wanted to put walnuts, so I used 3/4 of the juice from the bananas, so it wasn't dry. I also put the reminder of the juice in the other batch because my family likes them moist. Both batches came out great."
