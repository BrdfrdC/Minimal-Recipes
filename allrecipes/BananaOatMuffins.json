I added a squirt of Agave syrup to the wet batter and it was just perfect for me, perhaps even the oats helped regulate glucose, along with the fiber in the bananas., but ANY sweet bread I make make my face skin \"crawl\" anytime something is too sugary or salty. (I think is from my MS infusions causing that) but these I have ZERO that happen with these!:(, will def put this on my rotation and recipe book!"

I made these changes: used turbinado sugar, added a tablespoon of raw honey, added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/3 cup chopped walnuts. Next I will reduce the oil by 1 or 2 tablespoons, and omit the chocolate chips. Overall moist, good chewiness from the oatmeal, banana flavor was good but not overpowering. Good solid breakfast muffin. Definitely making this again."

"reviewBody": "I think this is the best banana muffin recipe I've made by far. In reading about how ingredients work in a recipe, butter at room temperature, whipped until light yellow with the eggs and the sugar make for a light and fluffy muffin (a light and fluffy anything - for that matter). Plus, you can't go wrong with butter as your fat. The taste is far superior to any other fat you can use. The muffin is great alone, with cream cheese icing, or a beautiful butter icing. Definitely a family favorite. They don't last long. I like to bake them in silicone molds, just to make them that much more appealing ;)"

"reviewBody": "Very good and a huge hit with the kids! I made this recipe almost exactly as described, except I used oat milk instead of regular milk. I doubled the recipe using the adjustment tool, and it made a ton! I ended up with 28 standard size muffins, and 24 mini muffins! I gave it 4 stars because I did feel like the recipe needs some added flavors, but is a good basic recipe. I dropped in a few chocolate chips to some and blueberries to others after I divided the batter. With the remaining batter I had left, I added cinnamon and raisins. Next time, I think I will do as others suggest and use 1/2 white and brown sugar, and keep the cinnamon and mix-ins."

I added semi sweet chocolate chips 1/4 cup and sprinkled walnuts on top and baked them. They turned out soooo delicious , dense and moist and perfect level of sweetness. I did share the muffins with my friends they loved it too. This is going in my recipe book permanently. Thank you so much for the great recipe."

I am also going to try a keto wheat flour and a tropical mueslis. \nFun experimenting!"

When I want to get wild, I sometimes sprinkle sugar on top. They turn out moist and delicious, and they can be stored in the refrigerator for a long time. Not sure if these are \"healthy,\" but definitely a healthier use of those brown bananas than, say, banana cake. :)"

I did add 1/2 cup of raisins, powdered ginger and nutmeg to the flour mixture. I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup of dark brown sugar. Used fat free milk. Baked beautifully. Without the raisins and the added spices for me, this would be have been too bland and baking powder-y. I will make this again but cut the baking powder to 1 tsp"

I substituted a third of the flour with whole wheat, and used a quarter cup brown sugar along with a quarter cup maple syrup. Some said their muffins were turning out dry, so I baked for 20 minutes at 375, and, as hoped, they turned out very moist. All in all, I would definetly reccomend this recipe."

I’d recommend adding a streusel type oat topping for extra yummy goodness!\n\nMakes a great snack and a healthy dessert alternative."
