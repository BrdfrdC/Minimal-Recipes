"reviewBody": "I've got an 18 month old who loves bananas and I've been questing for the bananiest banana pancake recipe. This is not it, but this forms the foundation of the recipe I now use. Instead of two ripe bananas, I've increased that to around 3 or 4 depending on size. I decrease the milk a bit to accommodate the extra banana liquid. I'll also throw in 1/8 tsp of vanilla for oomph into the liquid. And the coup de gras is I chop up a banana into really small pieces and fold that into the batter after the initial mixing. And that is how I now make my child the bananiest banana pancakes. The banana content is so hi that perhaps they are more like banana fritters at that point, but there's no questioning, no matter how unsophisticated a palate you might have, that what you are eating has banana in it. I hope these adjustments help other parents who find themselves in my situation."

"reviewBody": "Great way to use up overripe bananas, which it seems we always have. I had 4 bananas so I doubled this. Used 1 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat. Used a 3.9 oz container of Mott's unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil. Used 2% milk. Beat the liquid ingredients till smooth; I don't like chunks of banana. Then added the dry ingredients and beat just until moist. Cooked these on my griddle, scooping out 1/4 cup for each pancake. These were great! Next time I might add some vanilla and cinnamon. I put 12 in the freezer; hope they are good! With my changes these are 153 calories, 29g carbs, 5g protein, 3g fiber and only 2g fat for 2 pancakes. A very healthy breakfast!"

The pancakes are delicious and so easy, I felt I made so many substitutions based on what I actually had and needed to use: I used one frozen banana to mash and one ripe that I had left, for the milk, I had half a cup of heavy cream that needed to go so I cut it with half a cup of hot water for proper substitution and to mash the banana into, I only have Costco's \"creamy canola oil\" which I used in direct replacement for the veggie oil, also I added 1-2 tsp vanilla extract to my wet mix. I followed all the rest. They were bomb delicious! My toddler cannot get enough and she's going through a picky phase of independence. I saved this recipe and had to come back to rate it, I wish I could give it more. On top of that, it's one of the only hearty breakfast items I've made while in my last trimester that hasn't given me indigestion! Absolutely outstanding, highly recommend."

Very Good!)\n- 1 tsp of cinnamon\n\nOverall, the recipe is good, but we don't like thin pancakes (reason for giving 3/5 stars). Great banana flavor, especially when the bananas get lots of black spots on the outside. If you like thin pancakes this is a recipe you shouldn't change much and would likely get all 5 stars :)"

So yummy though! Also, I decided to bake them for 380 F, for 10 minutes and they smelled so good! No matter, they were pretty good and even picky-eaters in my family loved them. Would make again! Thank you! Also the banana pancake smell is amazing!"

The first time, they were 10 star pancakes, looked like they belonged in a food magazine photo layout and were the best tasting pancakes I ever had: fluffy on the inside, with little crispy edges on the outside. I made them again today and it was like all the bad reviews came true: kind of wet and spongy on the inside, and fairly tasteless. The first time was with smaller bananas, today they were much larger and while overripe, maybe a little less than the first time around. I'll give it one more try one of these days, because I know these have great potential!"

They turned about amazing. Another healthy alternative to syrup is low fat vanilla yogurt"

Great for when we have too many bananas that are going ripe. This yields quite a bit, perfect for 3-4 very hungry people. We once added Milo powder into it (didn’t turn out that well). Stick to the original recipe. Overall a great, easy recipe."

The bananas I used were on the smaller side. Texture was very soft, like an enjoyable cloud. I will definitely make these again and Next time lll be making enough for me to have a real serving!"
