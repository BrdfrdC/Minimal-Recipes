I‚Äôve played around with this recipe &amp; subbed Greek yogurt for the sour cream &amp; it was just as good. I‚Äôve subbed buttermilk for the sour cream &amp; still tasty but not as dense. Could 1/2 the sugar &amp; sub applesauce for other 1/2 but then use 5 (not 6) bananas. Not as sweet but is somewhat fruity from applesauce. I usually have at least 6 bananas in my freezer.üòè GREAT RECIPE!"

"reviewBody": "I've made this recipe for years and each time it's a hit. But I alter it a bit. I replace 1 cup of sugar with 1 cup of light brown sugar to make it a bit richer. We like to have muffins so I make a dozen muffins - or less so they're high and puffy. I do not use the cinnamon sugar mix on the pan, instead I sprinkle the tops of the breads just before baking. I also add finely chopped nuts to the topping and press it gently into the tops of the breads and muffins. To bake the muffins, I preheat the oven at 450 degrees and lower it to 350 degrees when I put the muffins in. They are perfect after 25 minutes when tested with a toothpick. For the 3 remaining loaves, I set my second oven at 350 degrees instead of 300 degrees. The loaves are ready in 45 mins. - again tested with a toothpick. Of course, if you only have one oven, you can cover the unbaked breads with a lightly greased sheet of plastic wrap so the dough doesn't start to dry out while you wait for your oven to be ready."

It didn't seem to make the bread taste any more banana-y, so next time I'll just do two tsp. of banana extract and leave out the vanilla extract entirely. I sprinkled sugar and cinnamon on top of each loaf before baking. The recipe made 2 large loaves and one smaller loaf of bread. I baked them at 325 degrees for exactly 1 hour and all three loaves were perfect, totally cooked in the middle but not crunchy on the edges or burned on top."

It made one loaf and about 10 cupcakes (I didn't have a second loaf pan) but the cupcakes cooked a lot faster so be sure to watch them. I also added a 5.3oz greek yogurt that I had in the fridge, thinking it might be too much with the sour cream but the end result was moist and delicious. Will definitely use this recipe again!"

"reviewBody": "Great recipe, but I did make a change on the temperature and time and I have some info for those who may not want to make it in a loaf pan. First off, I changed the temperature to 135 and baked my loaf for 70 mins. I also made (because I didn‚Äôt have several loaf pans) 12 muffins-baked at 135 for 50 mins AND I baked the remaining batter in a round non-stick cake pan for 30 mins. - this cake pan ‚Äúloaf‚Äù turned out the best to me. I did make extra of the sugar/brown sugar mixture and sprinkled on top before baking (you could also put it on after baking by buttering the top of the loaf before sprinkling with the sugar mixture). On another note, I used an electric hand mixer on slow for all of the mixing and it turned out great. Lastly, because my family loves chocolate chips, I use those rather than walnuts."

"reviewBody": "My 3 teens all said this is THE best banana bread recipe EVER. I did reduce the sugar to 2 cups, added a crumble on top, and spread the batter between two loaf pans and a large muffin pan. The great thing about that is that the muffins were done in 30 minutes, so we got to sample them early. The loaves did take the full 75 minutes at 325, as other reviewers suggested. I placed a big foil roasting pan over the loaves to reduce browning during the last 20 minutes of bake time (just had it hanging around, but will remember it next time because it was way easier than fighting with a foil tent in a hot oven!)"

It was so well received with some saying it was the best banana bread they‚Äôd ever had. The first change is that I used a Bundt pan instead of two loaf pans, which I sprayed with coconut oil and dusted with a cinnamon/sugar mixture. In terms of recipe changes, I did cut the recipe in half, but I only had 2 bananas which worked out fine. I used only 2 tablespoons of butter along with 1/2 cup applesauce. I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. I used 2 eggs, and substituted plain nonfat Greek yogurt for the sour cream. I used pecans instead of walnuts. I mixed pecan into the batter but also laid pecans in the bottom of the Bundt pan before pouring in the batter. I baked the bread at 350 and set the timer for an hour but the tester came out clean at about 50 minutes. Next time I‚Äôll check it earlier. I‚Äôll definitely make this my ‚Äúgo to‚Äù banana bread."

The only advice I have for this recipe or any other baking of sweets is adding a wedge of lemon. The acid breakers the protein down and makes it silky smooth. Even after a day or two on the counter, it just doesn‚Äôt dry up (partially because of the sour cream.) try this once and it‚Äôll change you..."

After 1 hour, with Gluten Free flour and with traditional wheat flower... WOW what a treat for everyone!!! Moist, flavorful, delicate, just can't go wrong!!! Bravo.

I put 1 1/2 cups white sugar and about half cup brown sugar. I replaced half the butter with about 3/4 cups applesauce - mostly to conserve my butter stash and use up the last bit of applesauce in the fridge. Made 36 muffins and one small loaf. Since I have a convection oven, 300 degrees was perfect, and of course the muffins were done much sooner than loaves of bread. I dove into one of the muffins as soon as it came out and was almost too hot to eat, but super delicious!"
