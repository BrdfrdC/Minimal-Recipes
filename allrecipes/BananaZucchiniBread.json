"reviewBody": "This was a great recipe. I added an additional banana and an additional cup of zucchini which I partially squeezed the water out of. I used 1 cup coconut flour, one cup rolled oats, an 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour. I didn't have walnuts so I used pecans in their place. I did not use the white sugar and I substituted applesauce for the oil. This made 27 muffins that I baked 22 minutes on the first batch and 25 for the next batch. Even though the toothpick came out clean on the first batch, they needed to cook a little longer. Taste is flavorful and healthy. Look forward to making again!"

Decreased oil slightly to 2/3 C. Added frozen blueberries. Not sure how much due to baking in large muffin pans and just submersing 7-8 berries on top of batter. Baked perfectly at 20 min. Very yummy!"

"reviewBody": "I kept the ingredients almost the same, minus cranberries or nuts as I didn't have any on hand. I dramatically changed the directions and believe it made a big improvement over some of the concerns expressed in other reviews. \n\n1. I used one very ripe banana previously frozen and one fresh banana, sliced about 1/2\", then quartered. Combined that with a heavily packed one cup grated zucchini, and 1/4 cup of homemade Madagascar vanilla rum. Set aside. \n\n2. Separated eggs and whipped the whites with some cream of tartar to stiff peaks, and set aside. \n\n3. Added all dry ingredients into a bowl, whisked together, and set aside. \n\n4. For oil I used butter and creamed this first with the white sugar, then added the brown sugar until frothy. Added in egg yolks and whipped until fully combined. I then gradually added the dry ingredients until the mixture became a crumble (mind you I am using the whisk attachment and kitchen aide mixer) \n\n5. Gently fold egg whites into zucchini/banana/rum mix, then gently folded in crumble 1/3 at a time. \n\nIt came out very light and moist, but held together perfectly for serving. The flavors were delicate, but present. \n\nIf I were to do it again, I would add some nutmeg and allspice, sprayed the top with simple sugar, and cooked it for 1:15 @ 300F°. \n\nI will absolutely use what is here as a guide again."

Add 1 or even 2 more bananas. Increase the amount of zucchini by a half cup. I also have doubled the amount of raisins and nuts. This bread is so easy you really can't go wrong but these changes are what makes it over the top good. You will be suprised at how forgiving the recipe is. Just make it to your taste!"

I think the amount of banana needs increased for sure, a lot of banana breads have as many as 6 so 2 doesn't lend nearly as much moisture, and you end up with a much airy and drier than typical banana bread. Also, three cups of flour is enough. I only used 1 cup of sugar in this, but the sweetness was still ok for me. It was not bad toasted with some homemade jam, so we ate it anyway! But wouldn't make it again."
