I am use to cooking bananas down with 1/8-1/4c sugar, constantly stirring, until the bananas caramelize (it takes a VERY long time) then I pour rum over it and light it on fire. I was excited to see a much shorter version of the recipe. I will likely make this again but with a fraction of the sugar because I genuinely appreciate the saved time."

I cooked it a little longer to burn off the alcohol since I wasn't going to set it on fire-- maybe 5 mins, just until it didn't taste so rummy. Then I sliced the bananas up on a diagonal and just warmed them like another reviewer mentioned. The second time I made this, I added a tablespoon or so of butter and it was even better. This is so impressive just to whip up in 5 minutes!!"

Make it flaming to impress your guests. 1st tell them to get their cameras ready; stand back just a bit, you don't want to burn your long hair or the sleeve of your favorite blouse. The last ingredient to add is the rum and a little banana liquor is great too. Increase the rum to 1/4 to 1/3 cup and tilt your pan enough to catch the flame. Wola, you have flambe!"

Lol), 2 bananas instead of 3 (all I had on hand, but it was a dessert for only two so that didn't matter), and pecans instead of walnuts (because I prefer them). It came out lovely, buttery and decadent and I saved the leftover sauce to have in a day or two. I'll take pictures next time. I forget to prepare to do that before the food is ready. I'll definitely make this again."

This was an amazing dish. I highly recommend it!"

I also wanted to have a flambé experience so I added the rum at the end and lit the skillet on fire which was cool!! I’d make it again with the banana liquor as other recipes suggest and I’d try dark rum. I just used regular rum because the grocery store didn’t have dark rum."

"reviewBody": "So delicious and easy to make! Even overly ripe bananas work here. I had one of those and just sliced it regular and scaled the recipe down a bit. In place of the rum I used rum extract (less than if using rum). This time, I also added a few shakes of salt, which I liked. Cooks up in a minute or two, as the recipe states. I just have to have this with vanilla ice cream! It's creamy coolness really complements the banana mixture. Just like something you'd get in a fine restaurant. Thanks for the recipe! UPDATE: If you have sugar issues, I found a recipe from another site that used NO sugar. It was delicious! You sprinkled the slices with cinnamon and it called for using coconut oil in place of the butter. A ripe banana will have it's own sweetness. I wouldn't change the vanilla ice cream, though!"

I do use real rum and don't burn it off, though I've seen that done in restaurants, and it's really beautiful. I'd probably just start a kitchen fire, though. Cooking burns off the alcohol, too. My favorite way to serve this recipe is over french toast for brunch, and it gets rave reviews!"
