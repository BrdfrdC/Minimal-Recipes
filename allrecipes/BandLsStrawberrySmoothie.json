I never buy skim milk or plain yogurt so I used whole milk and strawberry Yoplait. My only complaint was that I had to share with others instead drinking it all myself...but that's not the recipe's fault. Five Gold Stars! Thank you!"

It's a lot of substitutions, but I wanted to make it healthier. It was amazing so I know it will taste amazing if you make it as written. Also, it was runny the way I made it, but I wanted to be able to down it quickly."
