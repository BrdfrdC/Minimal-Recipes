If you can prep the veggies and the marinade ahead of time, it makes it even faster when your want a quick meal! I always regret not buying more bollilo/ hoagie rolls at the store, I can keep eating these if my belly allowed me!"

I lightly blackened some Cod fillets and pan sauteed them. So much flavor and spice and I just think blackening spice is wonderful. Also, I couldn't find any radishes for my pickled veggies, BUT I did find Organic Baby Bok Choy and just cut the wilted ends and up the stalk to length of other veggies. Sliced lengthwise down the ribs and tossed it in the vinegar mixture. It was GREAT and nice presentation! I drizzled my mayo with Soy sauce and some used Sriracha, we all raved. TIP: Instead of cutting my veggies into matchsticks, I shaved them down with a potato peeler. Made the veggies lay nicely :)"

Ok now for the changes: I didnâ€™t realize I didnâ€™t have rice vinegar so used what I had which was coconut vinegar. I left the veggies in the marinade bc why not! They stayed crunchy. For the meat, I had some deer meat I needed to use SO I used the SAME marinade (overnight as well) and cooked it using the broiler for a BBQ look, feel, and taste and wow everything worked so well. I will add a dash of soy sauce to the mayo next time around like the reviewers suggested for an extra KICK!"

I put a little water on the outside before putting in oven. Some remove the soft inside, but I love bread so i leave it. A couple of key things missing from this recipe is salt for the pickled veggies. I don't bother boiling any of it. I just marinate for an hour or so. Also, THE SOY SAUCE. the combo of the mayo and soy sauce together is what makes this sandwich so awesome."

I used broiled pork loin chops in place of the chicken. After making this once with the radish and once without, we all opted to forego the radish in the next batch. I also doubled the veggies to reuse again. Or I would decrease the liquids, there is a lot of waste. I found this to be a great weeknight dinner by making the veggies the night before and then broiling up the pork and compiling the sandwiches at dinner time."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is a nice base for Banh Mi and those who are not familiar with Vietnamese subs/food. Adding additional ingredients could make this a much better a more solid Banh Mi. One key ingredient that was not mentioned here is the soy sauce which is typically added atop the mayo and for those feeling a bit more adventurous, duck/chicken pate. As far as meat goes, the most popular/common filling is the cha siu (xa xiu) pork which is a sweet BBQ pork that is grilled/fried (my personal favorite as it goes well with the pickled veggies). Chicken can be used as well, Vietnamese cold cuts, pork meatballs or even firm fried tofu for a vegetarian option."

"reviewBody": "I used this recipe as my inspiration &amp; only made the marinade, adding 1/4 tsp. kosher salt. I'd had pork to use from a slow smoked butt roast which was moist &amp; wonderfully seasoned so I think any good flavored pork or chicken might work just as well. I let the veggies marinate 1 hour &amp; they were great - lots of flavor but still fresh &amp; crunchy! I lightly toasted just the crusts of my bagette, &amp; I used all the veg &amp; garnish suggested but added a dash of soy sauce over all because the mayo just didn't do enough, so I'll hafta figure that out next. But try it - it's a great sandwich!"

"reviewBody": "I've never had a Banh Mi before, but decided to look it up and try it because I watched The Great Food Truck Race with Nom Nom and it peaked my interest. So, I can't attest to whether or not it is authentic, but I will say, I followed this recipe pretty closely and it was delicious and very fresh. The only changes I made were I used a whole grain hoagie roll instead of a French baguette, and I mixed in Sriracha with my mayonnaise. My husband thoroughly enjoyed it and we plan on making more meat tomorrow to eat with the left over veggies I prepared. I'm letting the slaw marinate overnight as well, and expect it to be even more fantastic tomorrow. Definitely would recommend trying."

I added siracha chili paste to my sandwich, instead of using jalepenos, as I felt the siracha would complement the flavours better. I will definitely be making this again. A wonderful summer time meal."

"reviewBody": "This was very easy and tasty! It reminded me a little bit of cole slaw, even though I love this and dislike slaw. I bought daikon at the farmer's market for the first time this week, and this was a great way to use it! I mixed a bit of sriracha hot sauce, a little garlic powder, and some dried cilantro in with the mayo. I don't care for cucumbers and didn't have any, so I skipped those. Unfortunately, the bread I used was not that great - my local grocery store's baguettes are somewhat unfortunate. I'll try and find a better bread for the next time, because it makes a huge difference! A word of caution: Be very careful when toasting the bread - mine was too close to the broiler and smoked up my kitchen in under a minute! Oops!"

I marinated the chicken in soy sauce and chili paste for a bit before cooking, and made a cilantro mayo instead of putting cilantro on top (dont like the bits in my teeth) Just personal preference, I made the sammich open faced. ALl in all, a great try! Only 4 stars because the one at my local VN place is better."

I like the marinade for the veggies in this recipe, although I think the mayo needs to be infused with something to make it more authentic (at least, they do at our VN Baguette shop...) I tried adding garlic powder and a little Chinese 5 spice just to see. We loved it. Next we're gonna try the Asian BBQ Pork from Costco as a sandwich filler."
