I think it would be great just as written, too. Everyone LOVED it. Spectacular!"

The only change I made was I made individual pavlovas in 2.5\" circles. I didn't realize that they retain their shape. Next time, I would flatten the tops, I couldn't bring myself to invert them, they were so pretty ( shaped like a Hershey's kiss). So good! Thanks for the recipie!"

I had never tried making any type of meringue before but it came out great. I didn't bother tracing a circle on the parchment paper, I just eye-balled it and it came out to be around 12\" around. Also, I baked it at about 200 degrees not 300, which I think would have cooked it too quickly. I didn't have castor sugar so I just blended regular sugar in a food processor until fine. This came out super rich but my husband went back for seconds. Also, I tried making just a regular banoffee in a pie crust. It doesn't compare. The pavlova MAKES the recipe. I will be making the more traditional fruit pavlova in my next attempt."

Today I did not have a clean glass bowl, so used a plastic bowl. DO NOT TRY IT! When it says use metal or glass, it is true! So-I did have to switch over to a glass bowl to get my meringue stiff enough but it still turned out fine."

Will definitely make again, but next time, I will make it when guests are over, this is way too much for just me and hub. So I will over eat, and my diet will be out the door for today!!

"reviewBody": "I didn't make the pavlova part of this recipe because I started making a different pavlova recipe on this site. But after it finished baking, and turned out the perfect light shade of brown with just the right texture, I changed my mind about doing the cream and berry topping like I had originally planned. I came across this recipe and had perfectly ripe bananas in my pantry and caramel sauce in the fridge. The only drawback - a daughter who hates bananas, but loves pavlova. So, the family took a vote, and bananas beat berries. I promised her that even she would like this with all of the caramel, cream and chocolate, she wouldn't even taste the bananas. I served and she poked at it and then tasted it. Not much later, I was finishing my piece when I noticed her at the counter cutting herself another piece - yeah - it's just that good that a banana hater will have seconds. Thank you for an easy and delicious recipe!"

"reviewBody": "SWEET! A friend &amp; I made this... tasty, definitely. We triple 'dashed' the vanilla (never too much vanilla), and did do room-temp whites (it does make a difference). We just blended regular sugar in a magic bullet - instantly superfine! The thicker of a round you mound, the better - next time I may make individual serving rounds... As for the caramel... since we had 2 hours' free time, we made the caramel from scratch. I'm terrible with caramel, so I used a fairly fool-proof recipe. DELICIOUS and thick - you'll have leftover caramel too, use it on banana pancakes or french toast tomorrow. SO much better than a jar of artificial topping. Not to sound hypocritical... but we overchurned the cream into butter so we used Cool Whip Light. It helped balance how heavy the caramel flavor was. It was indulgent, and hard to stop eating. Two thumbs up!"

When speaking to the author of this recipe the other day, she encouraged me to follow these simple steps of, mixing the salt with ROOM TEMPERATURE egg whites prior to following the remaining steps. She knew what she was talking about. Only change I made was using regular white vinegar rather than the white wine vinegar. Didn't seem to make much difference. Highly recommend this for anything you need an impressive dessert for."

I was sooo worried abt getting an eggy taste which sometimes happens with meringues, and also because I tasted the pieces that I trimmed from the edges of this one to fit into the plate, and after an hour or so, started having that eggy smell to them. I don't know why that happens! However, The dessert itself was wonderful with no egginess whatsoever! I did cut down the sugar to 3/4 of a cup, because a whole cup seemed wayy to sweet. I am glad I did, it was perfect like that! Also, I used regular white vinegar, and worked just fine. Thanks for sharing your great recipe!"

I followed the directions exactly, using room temp egg whites and they whipped to great volumes. My problem was with forming the shell. After doing a little research, I only spread the egg whites to within an inch of the circle lines and baked as directed. This turned out great. The first one I baked, I spread out the full diameter of the circle, upon baking it expanded and made a flatter shell that cracked alot. Once you get this part done, it is so easy to complete. This is fabulous!! Very sweet but oh so good!! It looked absolutley beautiful on the serving plate. Next time I will add more bananas because we love bananas and they go so well with this. There were no leftovers. Thanks for sharing this recipe."

The crispy meringue blends beautifully with the soft, gooey caramel and bananas and the fluffy whipped cream. YUM. I served this a little differently because there were just 3 of us and I didn't want the leftover meringue to get soggy. I cut the meringue into pie slices, spooned the bananas and caramel on each slice, and then topped with whipped cream and chopped chocolate. Oh boy. Straight to my fanny. :) Thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Wow! Talk about impressive! This looks like something you'd buy from an upscale bakery. And to think... I made it! The boyfriend went ga-ga over it - he loves banana and caramel together. The only thing I may do differently next time would be to slightly cut back on the amount of caramel topping; I loved it, but I think I'd love it even more with less. I made homemade whipped cream from this site, also for the first time and that made this so much better than Cool Whip. Thank you so much for posting this recipe! I'll definitely be making this again!"

I'm not a huge fan of meringue or caramel, but they just \"work\" in this recipe! I didn't have any chocolate to shave, so I used mini chocolate chips instead. I will absolutely make this again and again and again! Thanks for a great dessert, Trish!!"

I think next time I make it I will cut the sugar though cause both me and my son are sugar wimps and we both wanted more and were a little sad we couldn't keep eating more like everyone else! Thank you for this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This is my recipe and I need to correct the steps in this recipe as published by AR:\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and trace an 8 inch circle onto the surface.\n\n2. In a metal or glass bowl whip the egg whites and salt until soft peaks form. (The salt helps break down the “stickiness” of the egg whites)\n\n\n3. Gradually by tablespoon add the sugar while continuing beating until the mixture is stiff and shiny\n\n4. Sprinkle the cornstarch &amp; cream of tartar over the mixture add the vanilla and white wine vinegar and mix in for a further minute.\n\n5. Mound the mixture into the traced circle on the baking sheet. Flatten the top and smooth the sides using a spatula.\n\n6. Place in the preheated oven, and immediately reduce the heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Bake for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until a pale golden brown. Turn off the oven, and leave the door slightly ajar with the pavlova inside until completely cooled.\n\n7. Just before serving time, invert the cooled pavlova onto a serving plate, and top with slices of banana. Cover banana with caramel sauce. Top that with whipped cream and sprinkle with grated chocolate.\n \n\nIt should also mention in the ingredient list that the eggs should be at room temperature (this maximises the eggs whites’ ability to whip up properly) \n\nIts also normal for the \"meringue to crack\" once cooled but when you have the toppings on you wont even notice!\n\nThanks for trying my recipe!"

This was my first experience with pavlova, and before I tried it I thought that the meringue part would be just kind of tasteless, but to those of you who don't know like I didn't, it is a rich, warm, toasty, delicious flavor! Combined with the caramel and bananas, it becomes something absolutely fabulous that is sure to impress all guests! I just made this for my family today, but next time we have guests over, I am making this! Thanks Trish, love it!"
