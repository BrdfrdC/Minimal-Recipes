"reviewBody": "I've been cooking ribs for 50+ years and this without a doubt the best recipe I've found on line. Excluding Korean, Hawaiian and other \"themed\" type recipes this is #1 in my book. You can use southern comfort in place of rum. I'm going to use this for 30 pounds of ribs I'm making for a celebration of life gathering in honor for our son and I expect the same greatvrrdukts I always get. My only change is that I place an entire slab on heavy duty foil and season it with dried minced onions and garlic and seasoned salt and cook it at 275 for a couple of hours the drain the juices off and put them on the marinade for 24 hrs. I put the drained juices I'm a bowl and put it in the freezer so the fat solidifies and can be easily removed. Then I save the rest of the flavored juice to add to BBQ sauces. It adds great flavor."

"reviewBody": "Many years later and still making it, for my 2 cents worth, in my circle of friends, we are concerned with aluminum products in relation to cooking and food and the studies made to the close relation to Alzheimer's and aluminum, for this reason there are no aluminum products in our kitchen, when aluminum is heated above a certain temperature it releases aluminum oxide the whitish powder it forms, this is the bad one to ingest, so we look for alternatives. Boiling the ribs, when i spoke to people about this, it became apparent it's been done this way for hundreds of years around the world, I've done it both ways, boil and oven, the boiling method is superior to other methods because a lot of the fat is boiled off and the flavors are re-introduced by marinating, great recipe."

"reviewBody": "I made this per the recipe except for using only 3/4 cup of sugar. Marinated the ribs overnight in the sauce after baking. They came out pretty good. This recipe brings out more of the meat's flavor with the sauce being a nice accent. There is more meat flavor because the ribs are precooked in the oven instead of being boiled. If you like your ribs falling apart before you get them to the grill or if you like ooey-gooey ribs with a thick slathering of sweet sauce, this recipe is definitely not for you. If you want more of the meat flavor to come through with only a touch of sauce flavor and accent, this is the recipe. After baking, the ribs are still solid and easy to move to the grill after marinating and for serving after grilling."

While they were on the grill for 30 mins (15 mins each side), I simmered the remaining marinade down to a thick sauce and poured over the ribs when they were done. The meat was super tender and the sauce was finger licking good!!! Will make this over and over and over."

I recommend that when on the individual plates where you cut up the rack to single ribs, that you have a side of the sauce to coat the newly exposed cuts otherwise you lose a bit of the sauce flavor. The whole family raved over this recipe and we will make it again many times."

We have used store bought bbq sauce one of the times because we were so busy and they came out amazing as well. A great all around rib recipe- oh, and grill them at the end of at all possible- we grill corn at the same time and it’s all done at once! So easy! Very happy with this recipe and will be using it for many years!"

"reviewBody": "I’ve never reviewed a recipe, but man... My wife and son and I devoured these. I made a few changed as needed. I didn’t have chile sauce so I used 1/3 cup ketchup and ¼ cup yellow sriracha. \n I boiled the ribs(refrigerated, not frozen) gently for 30 minutes with a little liquid smoke. While they cooled, I prepared the marinade. Poured marinade into a gallon freezer bag with the ribs. Into a bowl, into the fridge. \n I left out the brown sugar for the first day of marinating, and on the second I added the sugar, dissolved in 1 cup of water, to the marinade. \n On the third day(grilling day), I pulled the ribs out of the marinade and set them in a bowl to get up to room temp. Put the marinade in a small saucepan to reduce it. Lit up the charcoal grill, and got it up to about 350°F. Put the ribs in a lightly-oiled cast iron pan, covered the pan with foil, and baked them on the grill for about 20 minutes. Finished the ribs over indirect heat on the grill; no basting, extra seasoning, etc. \n Sauce reduced down a good bit, but I brought it back to a quick boil And added arrowroot to thicken it a little. Liberally doused the ribs with the sauce— this stuff came out AMAZINGLY. \n Ribs were tender, slightly-caramelized, and not “fall-off-the-bone”. The meat held on just enough for easy eating. \n I’ve been all around this world and these might be THE greatest ribs I’ve ever had. \n Thanks for sharing this recipe, and for commenters’ ideas on boiling the ribs."

We do not boil our ribs and on the grill or in the oven you need to cook these for hours."

I had a houseful of people, so I made a batch exactly as written here; and the second batch I made in the crockpot (browning in the oven first, as described in Crockpot Ribs found on this site). I used this sauce on all the ribs. They all tasted totally awesome, thanks to this incredible sauce. They all voted the crockpot prepared ribs to be the absolute best, though. Both batches I ended up basting more sauce on the ribs and grilling in order to carmelize them. I love the ooey gooeyness of the carmelized sauce. Just want to point out, the is the BEST SAUCE ever!!!"

"reviewBody": "Iv'e been making this recipe for over a decade. My son DEMANDS these for all special occasions. I season the ribs with garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper, and Beau Monde Seasoning. I bake the ribs at 320 for 2 hours. Make the sauce as the recipe directs with extra garlic and I use Dark Rum. Depending on my mood I'll use hot sauce, Liquid Smoke, mesquite seasoning, cinnamon or any thing else which catches my eye in the cupboard. I marinate over night in a tub that allows me to flip the contents upside down for full coverage. Then put the ribs on the grill on low until the marinade caramelizes on the ribs. I can't imagine boiling the ribs. My wife had a get together with appetizers only but needed a protein because of the cocktails being served. So I went to the butcher and had him cut the ribs cross ways to make the ribs more of a finger food. It worked perfectly for her needs."

Our recipe calls for Chile Sauce OR Hot Salsa, which is what I use since I seldom have Chile Sauce on hand.\nAnother option is to put all in a slow cooker on High for 4 hours, drain, defat the sauce, then boil it to thicken. (Can do all this in advance, so it's all quick and easy at dinnertime). Brush with sauce to glaze under a quick broiler or barbecue. Delish."

"reviewBody": "I did wrap my ribs and bake, but not at the temperatures and times in the recipes. I also rubbed my ribs with salt, pepper, onion and garlic powders. I also did not marinate with the sauce before finishing them off. Instead I put some sauce in the bottom of my baking sheet, then topped the back side of the ribs with the sauce and baked at about 350 for 15 minutes, stopping every 5 minutes to reapply sauce. Then I flipped and did the same for the top side of the ribs. The sauce soaked in very nicely and also created a nice glaze like we all like. The sauce itself was excellent. It cooked out really nice and flavorful. My only thing that gave me pause at all about this sauce is that the soy sauce gave it a bit of a teriyaki flavor, which is ok. The recipe calls for chile sauce with an e, and some are interpreting this as chili sauce, which of course is sweet. I instead used 1/2 sriracha sauce and 1/2 Frank's Red Hot. I think next time I would use perhaps 2/3 sriracha and 1/3 chili sauce. Excellent overall recipe and I will make this again. Thank you!"
