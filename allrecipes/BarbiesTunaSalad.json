This saved on fat and calories. Dill relish for sweet relish For a less saucy salad I used two 5oz cans water packed tuna. We used hot dog buns. Because I haven't been to the grocery store. My husband was skeptical, but his response after his first bite....Mmmmm that is good! This is a keeper. I have been using this recipe since 2018. It is my go to for both Tuna and Chicken salad. I add more onion and dill, the amount varies to our taste on that day. Make changes to meet your family's taste. We also use tortilla,casava root chips or celery in place of bread or buns."

I made about a 1/4 of this recipe to make sure it really was as good as the reviews said. The curry powder gave it a Smokey flavor and all the other ingredients just meshed to give it such a unique &amp; wonderful taste! \nI decided this was the recipe to make for my daughter in law’s baby shower.....It was a hit! \nThanks for a great keeper!"

"reviewBody": "Correction to my previous review. Mistakenly gave one too many stars. There is too much going on in this recipe. I really wanted to like it but there are too many competing flavors and the strongest of them didn’t do much for me. I found the dill and parsley over powering and I normally love both herbs, just not in tuna salad apparently. I was excited about the Parmesan and grated it fresh but unfortunately it and the garlic powder were lost amidst the other flavors. I did like the subtle taste of curry in this though. I’m not sure how most people make “boring old tuna salad” but I’ve always made it with mayo, pickles and onions. Simple and delicious. In this recipe I missed the pickles. The sweet relish didn’t cut it for me. If I want a twist on tuna salad from now on I think I’ll just add a bit of curry to my normal recipe."

"reviewBody": "I rarely give 5 stars but this was close. I used a nice tuna called Wild Planet Albacore Wild Tuna. I used a total of 20 oz because I'm feeding my husband and 3 teenage boys. I guessed pretty much on all the quantity of the ingredients according to my/our tastes. I didn't want too much of a relish flavor so I poured the relish into a small strainer and squeezed it down to get as much liquid out of it as possible. I think that was a great idea. I also didn't add quite as much as relish as it called for. I couldn't BELIEVE I was out of dried parsley, so I added a little chopped green onion and mined celery that gave it a perfect crunch. Also a tiny bit of fresh cilantro because we all love it. My husband was SO adamant for me NOT to add the curry powder, but I did anyway and not too much. Ha, he liked it just as a thought. I also added red pepper flakes to kick it up. I'm going to put it on English Muffin Bread and melt cheese over the top for a tuna melt. And I will serve this with a homemade tomato soup and this will be our dinner. Yum."

"reviewBody": "I didn't love this as it was written, but with some corrections, it came out good. The parmesan was a good addition, but the dill relish could have just been pickles added to the top. I could barely taste any garlic powder, and the tuna lacked any bright acidity. To improve it I added some pepper, and something with vinegar (mustard, salad dressing, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice). Mayo could be substituted for avocado, olive oil, pesto, hummus, or anything that is a healthy fat and can add some creaminess to the tuna. For crunch, shredded carrots, radishes, or even celery would work. For toppings, I would use pickles, lettuce, tomato, and fresh red onion, not minced onion."
