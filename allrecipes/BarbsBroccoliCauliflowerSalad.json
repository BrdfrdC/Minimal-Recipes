Second, I had HUGE red onion and half of that was way more than necessary, so I eyeballed what I mixed in with the broccoli and cauliflower. This was just fabulous. I plan on snacking on it all week and serving it to my husband with his marinated chicken thigh dinner tomorrow night (and take-to-work-lunch tomorrow). I will try it with the bacon another time, as it would lend a different texture and level of flavor. But, in my opinion, as a vegetarian dish, it needs nothing."

"reviewBody": "For my creamy dressing I used Kraft lowfat creamy ceasar. For those that said this was to much dressing for the dish need to keep in mind the size head of your broccoli and Cauliflower. If they seem smaller than the rest of the pile at the store ..make a little less of the dressing...if they seem larger than the average in the pile...make a little more. Just use common sense and modify if necessary. I used less vinegar than the recipe calls for because i know my creamy dressing had plenty in it already and didn't want it to be to over powering. So I used about 3/4T. I used maybe 4 pieces of Turkey Bacon (baked till crispy in the oven prior). My husband loved it!"

I bet it makes a difference in how it incorporates with the dressing. I made sure to add equal amounts of broccoli and cauliflower. probably around 4 cups of each, give or take a little. used white instead of red onion, added a handful of Sargento shredded cheddar and went with it. awesome stuff and I think I'm going to throw in a small handful of dried cranberries or raisins."

This is a great base recipe because you can tailor it to your tastes and it will come out wonderful every time! \n\nI didn't have all the exact ingredients, so I made some substitutions and I also added some ingredients. I made a cole-slaw dressing instead (light mayo, milk, sugar, red wine vinegar); I only had dried, chopped onions and onion powder; the bacon I had was \"maple\" flavored which added a great richness and sweetness to the flavor; I added honey-roasted almond slices and plumped raisins (just soak them in super hot tap water for 3-5 mins); also, I only had the frozen broccoli and cauliflower, so I steamed them first to get them soft, then chilled the whole dish. Lastly, we were curious about how the dish would taste warm so we heated up the last couple bites and it was even better! I'm making it hot next time, I can't wait!"

Made 50% more of the mayo dressing, so it was nice and creamy, and left everything else the same. Don't leave out the bacon; it makes the salad. I brought it to a party and had two of the 6 women give me their email addresses so they could get the recipe. It was the only dish brought to the gathering that was completely devoured. Highly recommend."
