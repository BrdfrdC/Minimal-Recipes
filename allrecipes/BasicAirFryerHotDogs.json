I browned my rolls on both sides with a spray misting of canola. Took about 3 minutes in my fryer. Made four slashes in my skinless hot dogs, and air fried them for six minutes to get them golden brown and crispy on the outside, flipping half way through. Served them with vegetarian baked beans and a tossed salad with fresh watermelon. Perfect meal for a hot summer's day. Just as good, if not better, than wilting outdoors over a hot grill. Yum!"

It worked like a charm and I am branching out with new recipes! Thank you it worked like a charm. We made 2 hot dogs and 2 hot dog buns. Hubby liked that the bun was crispy on the ouside and soft on the inside."

The second time I cooked the hotdogs first at 400 degrees for 6 minutes, checking them at the 3 minute time frame and continued to cook for the full 6 minutes. During the last 3 minutes, I prepared each bun by opening it up. Once the hot dogs were finished I put one in each bun then cooked 4 at a time for 2 minutes. They were delicious using the original recipe but we liked the way I cooked them the second time better. Very quick and easy dinner. Used Ballpark Bun size wieners."

"reviewBody": "I‚Äôm still new to the air fryer... so basic is a good way to start! And, I was using the basic Oscar Meyer weenies. I opted to cook those solo. And, it definitely took a little longer than 3 minutes. I had them in there for approximately 5-6 minutes, solo (for 2). From there, when they began to bubble &amp; ‚Äúpop‚Äù, I removed them &amp; placed the buns in for approximately 3 minutes. That crisped the buns perfectly. I then placed the hot dogs on the buns, added some shredded cheese, placed back in for about 2 minutes to melt. They turned out well! I just think the cook time for the dogs is a little too short, but that may also vary depending on the appliance being used. This was certainly MUCH better than boiling or microwaving! Can‚Äôt beat a grill, but it definitely works for the better results."

Potato salad and baked baked beans were done, and instead of frying hamburgers and making yet another mess to clean up, decided to try this recipe for hot dogs using the air fryer. It works folks, enough said! Seriously, I don‚Äôt know that you get that much more flavor grilling hot dogs, and it‚Äôs doubtful I‚Äôll even bother again. Being able to toast the buns in the air fryer also is a plus, it makes a difference. Admittedly, this one surprised me, it‚Äôs simply good!"

Steaming, baking, boiling, frying, half-boiling and half-frying, shaken, stirred, and ala mode. Nothing has come close until now. Completely juicy and cooked through.\n\nI put some cheese on the bun before I fried it and it came out perfectly melted, I would add a minute or two next time to make the dogs and bread a bit crispier as a good dog should be, but this is my new go-to for sure. I basically inhaled them."

"reviewBody": "Got a new air fryer and had to try it out. Figured before I tried something more substantial, I couldn't possibly ruin a hot dog. I was right. The hotdogs tasted just like we had grilled them outside and the toasted buns were wonderful. Great first outing with the air fryer. Now I have some confidence that I can make something more expensive and not ruin it. Thanks for all the reviews that gave me the angst to try it myself.\nKathy Acord"

"reviewBody": "I just made my second meal with my small air fryer. I had 2 long all-beef wieners that were frozen. I put them in the microwave on defrost for 2 minutes, which thawed them just enough for easier cutting. I cut them in half and placed them in the air fryer at 400 degrees. I set the timer for 5 minutes. Then because I really like them really browned, I turned them and cooked them for another 3 minutes. They were perfect for me and my husband."
