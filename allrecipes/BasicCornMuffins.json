I also used avocado oil in place of canola because that's what I have on hand. Muffins baked for 15 minutes in 12 silicone muffin cups. They were excellent with just a pat of butter. Will surely make these again!"

In my next batch, I plan to stir in a cup of currants for a little additional sweetness."

I the toothpick will never come out clean because corn meal is grainy Don’t let it fool you I use paper liners and make 6 large. People love a nice big breakfast muffin with Finally once you get the recipe right try orange or lemon zest and maybe a turn or two of fresh ground black pepper in the batter Good luck"

I also substituted melted butter for the oil. I had stoneground \"blue\" cornmeal which makes a nicely speckled texture."

"reviewBody": "I loved these. I'm bringing them to my daughters for dinner.\nThis recipe made 12 muffins . I substituted coconut milk for cow's milk and apple sauce instead of oil. Then I added 1 cup of canned corn to the batter. This was my first time ever making corn bread muffins and I have to say they were moist and delicious. I'll have to put them away or I will be tempted to eat the entire batch \nDefiantly a delicious addition to any meal."

As I understand cornbread muffins are simply cornbread baked in a muffin shape, and I planned to eat them with soup. They were too sweet to eat with a savoury dish, however, so we ate them after the soup with butter and jam. Very nice, but not what I was expecting."

"reviewBody": "Excellent recipe and agree its easily altered for personal taste! Only have grits? --clean out your coffee grinder, (dry only--then grind 1/4 cup of your grits to clear out coffee leftovers) and grind your grits for about 15 - 30 seconds, to make the muffins less gritty, and hold together more. I personally liked a little salt-1/4 teaspoon did it for me and mixed it onto the dry blend. Had bacon fat around, so melted 2 TBS of that and made up the remaining with oil for the full 1/4 cup. Buttermilk helped hold them together better and keep them moist. Not much more time to make this over the boxed mix--which yes often times gets infested with moths (or sometimes comes that way). Keep your grits/mix int he fridge to prevent infestation. Moths love whole grain flours and corn meal..."

I've never had to do that before if I use paper liners for muffins, etc."

"reviewBody": "I made this as written a couple of times already, and they were good! But this morning I was making bacon and felt inspired- so today I subbed bacon grease for the canola oil. Also, because bacon is super salty, I omitted the salt called for. Even the smell of them has become several times more enchanting! It did make the initial batter a bit thicker because the fridge cold milk and egg sort of set the fat a little bit. But they came out beautiful and the flavor is really nuanced and lovely. As written this recipe is amazing! But if you want to treat yourself, use bacon fat! (I would imagine schmaltz would also be as good or better)"

I will definitely make these again."

I exchanged gluten-free flour for the all-purpose, used Sweve (sugar substitute) in place of the white sugar, coconut for the oil and coconut milk. The batter was very thick and I worried how they would turn out once cooked. I cooked the muffins for 15 minutes and they came out perfect. They had a nice moist cake texture in the middle, with a crisp top, but not too dry. A definite keeper!"

They came out wonderfully and I have this base recipe to thank!"

I used Jillian's suggestion of 1 1/4 cups cornmeal and 3/4 cup flour. For the milk, I used the dry buttermilk blend that you add water to. I made these into six jumbo muffins that were ready at about 16 min. I couldn't resist having one (half!) right out of the oven....delicious with a little butter spread. Will be good for breakfast. I would try adding shredded cheese or pickled jalapenos another time, but these are great as they are! Easy recipe, too. Thanks!"
