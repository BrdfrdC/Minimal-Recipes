"reviewBody": "Amazing! I don‚Äôt have a mixer, so I put all ingredients in a ziploc bag, I microwaved the butter for 20 seconds, then added the cream cheese to the bowl and microwaved another 20 seconds because I‚Äôm impatient and didn‚Äôt want to wait for it to get to room temperature. I then mixed the butter and cream cheese a bit and added the vanilla, then while it was still lumpy I put it in the ziploc bag that held the sugar and squeezed all the lumps out and squeezed until it was mixed, it was runny and yellow, so I added a 5th cup of confectionary sugar and squeezed some more. It was the consistency of playdoh, nice and soft, I then snipped off the end of the ziploc bag and squeezed it onto my Duncan Hines dark chocolate fudge cake that was cooled. \nWow! It tasted just like Entenmann‚Äôs chocolate marshmallow cake! \nIt piped out of the bag smoothly and looked amazing! Really held its shape. As for the sweetness, I don‚Äôt like things too sweet and for some reason this wasn‚Äôt too sweet, it actually complemented the cake perfectly! \nI crumbled some cake on the top and bought an Entenmann‚Äôs chocolate marshmallow cake and compared the two with my friends, they all said they were the same cake!"

I also always add the powdered sugar 1 cup at a time and generally end up adding less than the recipe call for. I'm sure that makes it softer and a little harder to work with (although still able to be piped), but my family and I like it less sweet. This one is a keeper!"

First added almond extract (ratio I used was half of the vanilla), which I quadrupled the recipe, and then I added the powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and almond extract incrementally until flavor were perfect to me. It came out amazing. My son said he'd eat that on bagels and other stuff. It reminded both of us of the cheese in cheese danishes."

I did have to add 1 teaspoon of milk just because I thought it was way too thick. Also since it didnt specify what kind of butter I used salted butter. It's still sweet, just perfect for our chocolate cake."

I‚Äôve used different icings for different things for over 45 years now and this recipe is delicious the way it is. You can add different flavors like lemon, orange, strawberry coconut , cocoa chocolate , so many different ways to make different varieties of this and never loose the cream cheese flavor."
