Using non-stick pan, you only need to understand how thin the batter needs should be to make delicious crepes everytime. Make enough batter to be prepared to throw away the first one if it is too thick or thin. Adjust accordingly. The batter should just be thick enough to coat a spoon like a sauce you'd eat but not much thicker. Adjust with liquid or more flour as needed and Viola! You are a creperie"

There’s no sugar in this recipe, so fair warning : these are savory crêpes to people who are looking for a sweet breakfast or desert crêpe? This is not it. Also, the consistency isn’t right. They do not flip easily out of a crate pan and made a mess! As I fed them to my family, they commented what’s with the weird texture?! Our family is very familiar with crepes and this is the least preferred crepe recipe ever. Search further. You’ll find a better recipe."

They were so delicious. My second batter was for my sweet crepes so I added a little confectioner sugar and vanilla extract to the batter. Those I stuffed with Nutella and strawberries. I then topped them with some additional strawberries and blueberries. I added a dollop of whipped cream and sprinkled confectioners sugar. My entire family has now asked that I add this to regular rotation. I cooked them in the tiniest bit of butter brushed on the pan instead of oil. They looked like they were from a magazine. Thank you for this recipe."

"reviewBody": "The proportions in this recipe are way off for true crepes. The results are WAY too thick and not crepes at all. For example, in Martha Stewart's recipe (and many others) 1 cup of flour calls for 1.5 cups of liquid and 4 eggs. There is simply much too much flour in these. If you added at least 1/2 cup-3/4 cup more liquid, you will have much thinner and authentic elegant crepes. Trying to blend 1 cup of flour with 2 eggs is also a bad choice. Wisk the eggs, add the liquid bit by bit and finally add flour gradually...that is just basic cooking knowledge. You can also add a pinch of sugar for a bit more flavor, but it's totally optional. Obviously, for savory crepes, you'd pass on that!"

This recipe is a keeper."

"reviewBody": "The recipe seemed thick. There were only two of us, so I halved everything. The batter didn't seem runny enough, but I dropped in a smaller first \"crepe.\" It was almost as thick as my pancakes. I put a good splash of water in it, which made it better, though still not quite as thin as those I've had dining out. Not quite as flexible, either. Two minutes per side is wrong. Around 30 seconds worked for me. I tried There were only two of us, so I halved everything. First and second ones were stiff and didn't want to bend. For the rest, I went with the old pancake adage. When the bubbles pop on top, it's time to turn it over. This works quite well here, too, and while still a little thick (a little more water or milk next time), these folded without much problem once I dolloped cherry preserves into them. Taste was decent. Probably better thinner and with more condiments, but this was a spur of the moment when my son asked for them. I'll play around with the liquids more. From the video, it needs to be more soupy. It definitely didn't spread like in the video."

I added a little sugar like others suggested for dessert crepes, they were wonderful with some strawberries and Nutella. To get them nice and thin I really suggest going light on the oil, they need a little traction to hold them in the place while you tilt to spread out the batter."

I ended up with a very bready crepe, weirdly thick and sort of rubbery/dry. Very pretty to look at but not a pleasure to eat. I'll try this again as I'm assuming the ingredient proportions are right, but I'll be mixing the wet ingredients first and then adding the dry slowly. Hopefully I'll end up with a much lighter result."
