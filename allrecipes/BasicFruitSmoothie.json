I use a half cup of orange juice, a half cup of mango nectar, one half a very ripe banana frozen in chunks, frozen pineapple tidbits, 4 oz. peach low-fat yogurt, several frozen strawberries, and some frozen raspberries. I make coconut water ice cubes and use only a couple in this smoothie. Everything's frozen, so it comes out very cold and icy....almost like a sherbet! A good smoothie-maker blender makes it perfect. Using less ice makes it very sweet....adjust the amount of ice the way you like it."

We have been making smoothies for years and have found that adding yogurt to the mix helps smooth out the texture and adds to the nutritional content. We have also added other nutritional supplements to the smoothie such as spirulina - with strawberries for a purple-ish color - my daughter thought it was great. Get creative and enjoy! One other thing - we do not use ice. We use frozen fruit instead."

This recipe is perfect as a starting point to alter to one's tastes. Try different fruits, different juices, different amounts of everything to your taste. Another alternative is to add vanilla flavored soy milk for a hint of vanilla or cream. But remember, if you alter a recipe too much, don't blame the recipe, blame the cook. ;)"

I used half a can of pineapple chunks and its juice instead of peaches and just plain orange juice instead of the mango-orange juice(didn't have any of either ingrediant on hand). Will make many mornings to come. And this is very \"basic,\" you can add/subtract fruits you prefer or have around the house."
