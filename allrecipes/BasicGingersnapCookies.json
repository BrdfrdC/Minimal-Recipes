"reviewBody": "I used all fresh spices and topped the cookies with lavender vanilla bean sugar from our local Savory Spice Shop (brushed on olive oil and sprinkled sugar). I used white pepper instead of black. I refrigerated the dough overnight. I cut very thin, small cookies and baked them for 10-12 minutes instead. They were crispy ginger snaps and I got the most compliments on cookies that I've ever received. Very tasty! Thanks for the recipe!"

They didn't last long, so I'm giving them 4 stars, but if they'd been more like ginger snaps they would've gotten 5 stars. Thanks for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "This cookie is tasty, but holy muscles! you get a work out with this dough! I added more liquid for it to come together, but it was still really difficult to roll out. I played around with it then decided enough was enough and my exercise was over for the day. I froze the rest for pie crust or another cookie exercise day. This bakes up very nice in the oven and you can end up with crunchy cookies if you bake longer or have a thinner dough (yeah, mine wasn't so thin) or soft if you have thick dough and cook a bit less. They are full of ginger flavor, so if you like that, odds are you'll like this cookie. Thanks for the recipe!"

I was looking for a recipe that was like what my Gramp used to make. This was almost exactly the same. I baked for 6 to 7 minutes and checked. They were usually done. They were great for dipping in tea!!! :)"
