(You can never have enough guacamole, and I have a couple of real guacamole lovers in the famile!) Put a pit in the center of the leftovers before storing in the fridge and it will help keep the dip from getting so brown."

I used this recipe as a home base but with a couple alterations and it was fabulous: 3-4 cloves of garlic, minced; and 1 Tbsp squeezed lime instead of lemon juice. I had the family over for dinner and they loved the dip and asked for the recipe. I guess I'll hand it over... I'll stay on top of the game though by next time mixing some sweet white corn and black beans... mmmm."
