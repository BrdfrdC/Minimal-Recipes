Keep working at it, homemade is so worth it and rewarding."

"reviewBody": "I made this today. I don't have a pasta machine or a dough hook etc. I made the recipe as stated. I used a bowl, a rolling pin, and a sharp knife. I didn't read enough of the reviews to realize that in order to actually have a dough that can be worked with I would have had to add more than 2 tbsp of water, or even oil, and rest the dough in plastic wrap for 30 minutes or so. My dough was very crumbly and dry, and it took alot of effort to knead the dough into a workable ball or roll. I also didn't realize it would be nearly impossible to hand roll the dough thin enough so that the fettuccine noodles would cook up properly. Instead I ended up with very tasty noodles that were too thick, large and chewy, and not what I was expecting. I like the recipe. I will try again. If I could afford a pasta machine I'd like to pick one up, maybe at some point in the near future. But for now I just want a nice pliable dough that I can work with and figure out a way to roll ot thin enough so that it's eatable. It wasn't a fun, enjoyable experience lol. It was discouraging. However, I remain hopeful. I am anxious to experiment more with this recipe employing some of the tips mentioned in the reviews."

Just wish I had a pasta sheeter because hand rolling it was hard and I didn’t get it as thin as I wanted. \n\nI served it with a garlic butter sauce, bacon, Parmesan, and broccoli."

I did the best I could but the end result was definitely thicker than a noodle should be. \nIn the future I may add some oil as has been previously suggested to see if it becomes easier to work with.\nNo complaints about the flavour however, but it could benefit from some experimenting as well. \nGreat recipe to start with."

"reviewBody": "This is a good fundamental recipe to build on with personal preferences and modifications. I made pasta sheets and stuffed, rolled, and cut the into cannelloni al forno (oven baked). I doubled the batch and used 2 tablespoons of EVOO and more water to balance the moisture, and facilitate the compression of the dough. Resting the dough wrapped in plastic is essential, and having the cooked and mixed stuffing made before you fill the pasta sheets is also essential. I blanched the pasta sheets in salted boiling water for 90 seconds, then shocked them in ice water, and patted them dry before stuffing and cutting them. I used commercial General Mills “Sperry” Extra Fancy Durum flour number 57602."

"reviewBody": "My first attempt at making pasta and the family and I LOVE it. I read and followed others suggestions. Thank you all for the helpful hints. Less salt, olive oil and let it rest. I bought semolina flour months ago so I could make pasta. I used half and half, plain flour and semolina. The recipe and directions are simple and easy. I made ravioli stuffed with Italian sausage and cheeses. So good. I don’t have a pasta machine but I will soon. Using my rolling pin the first time I didn’t get the pasta rolled thin enough and my ravioli were a bit thick and chewy. I rolled them really thin (pasta swells as cooks) next batch and they were perfect. This will be my go to recipe. Most every time I google a recipe, an All Recipes, recipe is one of the top ones and they are always good."

This recipe is my go-to if I'm low on cash and want a nice easy meal for me or my family. Simple ingredients, multitude of ideas and fashions. I would really recommend just spending a while to get to know the dough. It's easy to start and maintain. As an inexperienced pasta maker, this is my Go-To."

I used half olive oil and half water and did have to add just a little more water to it. i boiled the pasta for about 8 minutes. I melted 1 TBL of butter and squeeze a little garlic paste in the butter. Added a bag of steamed broccoli florets and the pasta. I added a little of the pasta broth and added fresh ground pepper to the top. It was a delicious meal for 1. For me this recipe makes 2 servings."

I added some olive oil, still crumbly, then a tbsp of water, still crumbly. I added a bit more water but was concerned I was going to end up with leaden noodles but nothing I was doing was coming near a dough. I finally doused it with some water knowing I was probably already giving up. Then I had glue, so I threw the wad in the trash. I'm not used to failing in the kitchen, so I'm sort of at a loss on this one."

I did not let the dough sit at all. I did however hang the strips of spaghetti on a wood pasta dryer for about 15 minutes. I boiled it one minute, turned off the burner and let the pasta sit in the water for another 30seconds. The quantity was perfect for my husband and I.\nI will definitely be making this again !\nOh and I won't be buying spaghetti any time soon!!"

I tried this recipe based on those proportions (1 egg to 340g flour) and it didn’t work at all. The dough was far too stiff. After further research I used a recipe based on a ratio of 100g flour per egg (plus a healthy pinch of salt and a glug of olive oil) - a two egg recipe feeds 4 - which was a great success. Although, I might have got the measurement translation completely wrong!"
