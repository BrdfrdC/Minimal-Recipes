Crisp, tasty, and so pretty. I wouldn’t use a packaged cheese and the parchment paper is important. You can use about any fresh cheese, but Park is about the lowest cal cheese there is. Bon apetite!"

Opened the bag up, added some taco seasoning, closed and shacked the bag to get the seasoning mix with the cheese.

Over all easy recipe and they taste good."

Add favorite topping including fresh herbs, red pepper flakes, jalapeño pepper slices, whatever you like. Somebody posted their’s stuck to the parchment paper, I’ve never had one stick, maybe they didn’t let them cool long enough. After cooling I move them to a paper towel to soak up residual oil."

I cup pre sliced sharp cheddar into quarters , place them in a parchment lined baking pan and bake them at 350 for 13 minutes.. Try sprinkling them with our Favorates herbs They all come out uniformly sized and snapped and are always a party favorate"

Cooked mine a little over 7 min, they were much darker than the ones pictured, but tasted great! Lots of crunch, no burnt taste at all! For the ones saying they stick to parchment paper, you must not be using parchment paper. I tried them before with wax paper, and yes... they did stick, but mine came right off the parchment paper, no spatula needed, just picked them up with my fingers. Highly recommend!!"

The best part of scrambled eggs with cheese are those little areas where the cheese gets toasted into little crisps, but trying to make them directly in the frying pan never worked out. \nBaking and parchment paper is this answer !\nOne note - the dryer the cheese (such as Parmesan), the less you need to bake them."

"reviewBody": "I have been making keto cheese chips for a while now, and what plagued me was how to keep them crisp past one or two days. Due to a happy accident I just discovered, (discovered being an over statement cause im sure someone else has done it), a solution to keeping your cheese chips crisp over time. Mine lasted 3 weeks and were as crisp as the day I made them. The secret is to use a glass baking dish, no foil or parchment, but lightly oil the bottom with your oil of choice; I use olive oil. 400 degrees like normal for 10 min depending on the thickness. My glass pan holds 8 medium size chips. The problem you have to look out for is that in my glasse pan the cheese doesn't brown so if you leave it in the oven too long beacuse you don't see it browning it will have a burnt taste.... but still crispy. Hope this helps make your experience much tastier."

"reviewBody": "I enjoy the store bought cheese crisps but they can be crazy expensive! These are so quick and easy to make, not to mention - a perfect snack option for those following a keto diet. I used a non-stick mini muffin pan. I noticed less is more and you really only want to put a pinch of cheese in each - no need to spray if it's a non-stick pan! Grease pooled on the top of each and I gently dumped it onto a paper towel (the crisps stayed put!) I gave it a few minutes to cool, took a spoon and pressed the edge of each and they popped right out! I put them on a paper towel to absorb a little more grease and tried to keep myself from eating them quicker than I could make them! I used a small block of sharp cheddar, grated it and that's what I used - cheap and delicious!!"

You can go bigger and make taco shells in exactly the same way, just fold them into taco shapes (over a wooden spoon handle or something similar) before they cool.\nNote: This recipe also works in the microwave. Depending on your microwave, it takes about 2 minutes to do a platter. But you do need to put baking paper on the microwave turntable first, otherwise they'll stick."

"reviewBody": "Perfect little snack. This recipe is more technique than recipe, but it works very well.\n\nSome tips:\n\n-Use a 24 cup muffin tin to make perfect little chips. No need to use paper if it's nonstick, or use cupcake liners.\n-WEIGH the cheese, then divide by 24. Now you have even portions that cook at roughly the same time. Put a little potion cup on the scale, tier it out, then add the correct weight of cheese.\n-Cook only ONE cheese at a time per pan. I found that some cheeses (harder more aged) cooked faster, while others (the mozzarella especially) took longer. Mixed pans make it impossible to time things.\n-Drain on paper towel. Yes, they will be soft when you turn them out, but the added fat absorption will make them crispy and a bit less caloric. \n-Eat them soon. From past experiences with the microwave technique, I know these will only last a few days before the cheese gets 'funky' when stored at room temp. I'm not sure why, but it tends to go off fast. You could refrigerate or freeze them, but they get chewy. If that's what you're going for, have at it."

"reviewBody": "I have been looking for a snack that fits with my Keto Diet... Found It! Cheese Snacks of just a few Oz. are expensive! Sure they are made with \"Just Cheese\" and \"Artisan\" Cheeses to boot, but the price is like Prime Rib Expensive!\nI made one change, since I used hard/block cheese, I cut slices, then halved those, then thirded those.. so a tiny rectangle about 3/4\"X 1\" , it made tiny crisps, but that makes it more like a snack, and less like a meal. \nI cooked them @ 400*f for 8.5 min. any longer and they got a twinge of over doneness taste to them... any less and the centers were slightly chewy. \nI also experimented with seasonings, like Cheddar and Taco Seasoning, Mozzarella and Italian Spice, Pepper Jack Cheese(by itself), and Jack and Ranch Dressing seasoning. All were great, and only took a bit of tweaking with amounts of spice, and time in the oven. It was a fun day. With loads of snacks to show for my time!! Equivalent amount of Store Bought snacks would have been prohibitively expensive! And I had FUN! You just can't buy that kind of feeling of accomplishment. BE"
