"reviewBody": "I have been making mashed potatoes for over 50 years - following my mom’s teaching me the basics. My sister-in-law brought the use a whole stick of butter when cooking for 8 servings. We have used the hand masher in the 1960s but once mom bought an electric beater that has always been how we mashed the cooked/boiled potatoes. I slice the butter and place them around the bowl in an inverted pyramid style. So once my butter has softened a tad then adding in the hot drained potatoes the butter melts into the whipped potatoes. I only use 2tablespoons of milk or sour cream. Some family members don’t like garlic so I may not use any. BUTTER is the key flavoring."

"reviewBody": "Decent enough recipe, but… First, not enough butter. Use at least half a cup. Second, if you want fluffy MP, after draining the salted water, put the potatoes back on the burner on low heat for a couple of minutes stirring with a wooden spoon. This dries the potatoes. Then, put them through a ricer and add hot milk and butter slowly to the consistency you like. If you use a ricer, a masher is not necessary, just a wooden spoon. The use of a ricer and drying the potatoes are the secrets to great MP whether one uses milk, half &amp; half, cream, sour cream or cream cheese with the butter. Salt the water and let others add extra salt if desired."

I ran out of pots so I microwaved the milk and butter and it turned out fine. Yey! I finally made good mashed potatoes with this recipe! Thank you!!!"

"reviewBody": "This is an okay recipe and I liked that they tried to keep it simple. But even then they made it more complicated than necessary. I've been making mashed potatoes for 50 years and everyone loves them. It's about this easy. Go ahead and use the cheaper russet potatoes, even the kind you get in a dirt cheap five pound bag, they work fine. Peel and cut them up in similar sized pieces. Boil until they are falling apart tender, not \"firm\". Beat them with an electric mixer, it works far better than a potato masher. The real key is to beat them while still hot, just after draining the water, and beat them until smooth without ANY of the other ingredients. Beat them a lot. Then just add a fair amount of butter, and start adding some milk, you don't have to heat the butter or milk first, that makes no difference. Also salt and pepper to taste. Add more milk as necessary (half and half is even better) until you get a creamy consistency, not too stiff, not too runny. If you want to get fancy and like it, add a few cloves of crushed garlic. That's it."

I decided to look for another recipe that used milk and this one gave me a much better idea of what to do. I can't say I followed the measurements exactly. I really just added milk and butter until they looked the consistency I wanted, but they turned out fantastic :)\n\nThanks for helping out a newbie in cooking from scratch!"

"reviewBody": "Thanks Esmee Williams and each of you that commented,\nLast week I made these and added too much milk. Ugh. Cream of Wheat. Yesterday, June 16, 2020, cut back the ingredients for only my wife and me. I steamed seven small Golden potatoes. Heated and added half a stick of butter, half cup whipping cream, four dabs cream cheese. Success. Served with Cajun pork loan, and corn on the cob (microwaved wrapped in plastic smothered in mayo). Delicious. Thanks again. Blessings, Jack"

Creamy, smooth mashed potatoes indeed! We are a family of 4, we had no leftovers. The kids wanted more. My kids (12 &amp; 10) made this recipe themselves."

I used 1 stick of butter and 1 cup of cream to make them extra rich (forget counting calories on this one.) I'm thinking I over mashed them. BUT the upside is the family loved them and went back for seconds. Even the kiddo who usually doesn't like mashed potatoes (who doesn't like mashed potatoes?!) ate them right up."

Mashed and mixed.\n\nTexture came out lovely."

You don't boil the water and then add the potatoes I learned this from a professional chef. Starting them in cold water ensures they cook evenly and they don't get gummy. Happy cooking"

The potatoes turned out creamy and smooth, and I had plenty of leftover. They were the envy of my office lunchroom. My wife loved them as well. She told me she is now spoiled. I will never go back to the boxed potato flakes again. They are well worth the slightly extra time. Excellent."

Of course I don't know how much my potatoes weigh either so it's a little guessing game.\nI used salted butter once since I ran out of unsalted. Surprisingly, I got a compliment that it was soooo good. So I been using salted butter ever since. Salt in water as well. Today i used 75% whole milk and 25% cream. Yum!"
