Subtly sweet and salty. Not overly either. Just a great flavor. Juicy, tender… I’ve made some good food over the years, but this is top 5. Thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe has changed pork for me forever. Basically it has changed my life. I've been marinating and seasoning pork and it's always turned out really good, but this takes boneless country ribs to a whole other level. I combine the brined pork with a carnitas recipe I've been making for awhile and it turns it into some of the best pork I've had in my life. It's a simple brine but I don't have to salt the pork while cooking anymore. I've made it in several times and in different variations. One I added liquid smoke, one a touch of soy sauce, one with added onion powder, and one with all the above with powdered thyme. The original is perfect though. Thank you for sharing this."

And I heated the brine in the microwave to make sure the sugar and salt dissolved. Then I added some ice to cool it down so the chops wouldn't start cooking in the fridge. The pork chops were very moist. They tasted just a bit sweet to me."

"reviewBody": "I added: 1/2 tsp powdered ground ginger &amp; 2 tsp sesame oil. I made 4 thick (approximate 1 1/2\" thick, bone-in) pork chops, placed in my vacuum type Marinater, (using 28 pumps). There was plenty of the marinade for 4 thick cut pork chops. Marinated for 24 hours. Then grilled to 155 degrees F., using an instant meat thermometer in the thickest part of the pork chop. Remove and platter, loosely tent, with heavy aluminum foil, for a full 10 minutes. Excellent flavor!"

The meat was juicy and tender and it looked like meat that had been smoked all day.\nMy kids were all but licking their plates and were begging for more! Thank you for sharing this!!! We also decided that it would be an excellent salad dressing."
