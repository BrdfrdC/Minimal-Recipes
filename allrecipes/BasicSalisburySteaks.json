The only changes I made were subbing in cream of mushroom soup since I couldn't find the golden variety and I added about 4-5 shakes of Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture and let it sit, covered, for about 20 minutes before forming into patties. Paired with garlic mashed potatoes and didn't have any leftovers, even my picky 7 year old said to add it to the rotation."

Then pattied and put in the pan and browned each side.\n\nI made the gravy from lipton box soup. I melted 2 tbs butter and then added 2 tbs flour slowly and let cook for a minute or two over med high heat.. I then added 3 cups beef broth slowly until smooth (whisking constantly). Let it heat up a bit then whisked in 2 packets of the soup mix. turned the heat up to high and brought it to a boils whisking often. Once it came to a boil, I turned the heat down to medium and let simmer uncovered until it thickened. \n\nI sauteed some onions and mushrooms in a pan and placed them aside.\n\nI placed the patties in a foiled baking dish and covered with the onions and mushrooms then added the gravy mixture on top and covered the dish with more foil then placed in a pre- heated oven at 375 degrees for 45 minutes.\n\nServed it over homemade mashed potatoes and green beans. Delicious."

Did not fry the meat patties, smothered 1/2 of the soup mixture in the bottom of the slow cooker, set the raw patties on top &amp; poured the rest of the soup mixture on top of the patties and spooned it over them, so they can be covered. Added few dashes of Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture and some to the sauce. Also added 2 cups of sliced baby bella mushrooms to the sauce mixture. Cooked it on high for 3 hours. Next time, might cut the dried onion soup to 3/4 packet, as was a bit salty. Thank you for sharing your recipe."

"reviewBody": "this recipe was delicious! made it just as the directions said (with the exception of adding my own mushrooms sautéed with a little garlic). I usually make a much more fancy and complex salsbury steak, that takes much longer than this recipe. frankly, this one was almost as delicious as my usual recipe. I think i may make this one from now on due to the simplicity of it. \n\nNote: if you look at the photos, all of the photos have a much darker gravy than one particular photo (mine). I think this was because I used a very lean ground beef, so there wasn't a lot of grease. this is one of very few recipes that call for ground beef that I actually think a higher fat content may make for a better meal/gravy.... although it still tasted amazing! \n\nthank you for the easy recipe and the full tummies!"

"reviewBody": "I had to make changes because of my food allergies. I used portabello mushroom soup &amp; brown gravy mix for the sauce (squirt in a dollop of minced garlic). Cooked the brown gravy in the microwave first before pouring over patties. Poured some of the mushroom soup in with the burger mix &amp; also added almost liquified onion (run it in the blender since my bf hates chunks of onion but likes onion flavor &amp; chopping onions sucks)."

"reviewBody": "To be honest, I have never had Salisbury steak before, so I have nothing to compare it to. with that being said, I made this recipe exactly as instructed, and I thought it was great! I will definitely make this recipe again, very soon! However, I will do a couple things a little bit differently. First of all, I will not cook the steaks as well done as they were. I will only cook them for 4 minutes on each side at just barely above medium heat. And, since I prefer my sauces to be a little thicker, I will add about a teaspoon and a half of corn starch to the sauce to let it thicken a little."

"reviewBody": "We all LOVED this! I used a little more than 1 pound of ground beef and got 5 patties out of the recipe. Also, I doubled the sauce, but only used 1/2 the water b/c we wanted the sauce to be on the thicker side. I had an 8oz. pkg. of sliced mushrooms to use up, so I cooked them and added them, which was a wonderful addition. I lightened this up a bit by using whole wheat seasoned breadcrumbs, extra lean ground beef and Healthy Request Golden Mushroom Soup. This was very flavorful and comforting for a chilly fall day. I will def be making this again and again~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)"
