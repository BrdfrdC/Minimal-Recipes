"reviewBody": "Amazing for cinnamon buns, and exactly what I was looking for. \n\nI didn't have fresh yeast cake, so I used the equivalent of two packets of regular red star dry yeast (4-1/2 teaspoons). I also used butter instead of shortening. \n\nIn order for the recipe to work with dry yeast I changed the method as well. I used warm water and put the water, sugar, and yeast in a bowl together. While that sat for a few minutes, I put the milk in a pan, scalded it, took it off the heat then added the butter. Once it had cooled enough to not cook the eggs (below 60C/140F), I poured it into the eggs I'd beaten in another bowl, then poured that whole thing into the yeast mixture. Then I added the flour and salt. \n\nI ended up using less flour than the recipe called for, probably because I wasn't using moist yeast cake. I had over a cup left over, so I would suggest starting with six cups for this recipe and then using the seventh on the counter while kneading. \n\nI found this dough quite tough to knead and work with, but I think that's a good thing because I can see how easy it would be to use the dough for braiding and shaping. It also baked into the perfect texture I was looking for: dense but not chewy or heavy. It was also not too sweet, but left a nice aftersweetness in my mouth. \n\nI used one recipe of this dough for two batches of cinnamon buns. On each rolled out piece of dough I spread about three tablespoons of butter, then sprinkled half my cinnamon mixture which was 1/2 cup of brown suga"

"reviewBody": "This dough was awesome! I goofed a bit and only had one egg so added a little more water to incorporate all the flour. It was a shaggy dough and I maybe kneaded it 2 min. or less. It rose beautifully and working with it was a dream--no stickiness and was able to roll out easily. I divided the dough into 3 pieces and made sweet rolls with one and froze the others. Hope they do as well as the first batch."

"reviewBody": "I live in Mexico, at 5200 feet above sea level. The sweet rolls here are fairly tasteless and finding this recipe was a godsend! I made two adjustments for the high altitude suggested in the Joy of Cooking. #1 added fake buttermilk (3 Tablespoons of unflavored yogurt to 1 C of milk). I re-measured the 1 Cup of milk but the dough was still too wet. No problem, I just continued adding flour until the dough didn't stick to the bowl. #2 high altitude trick - don't let the dough rise to double it's size; punch the dough down when it has only risen half of it's size, but, let is rise twice before punching it down and rolling out. The brown sugar here is very grainy so I wasn't sure how the cinnamon rolls would turn out but everyone raved about the end product."

I used my baking stone, so the oven had to pre-heat for a hour, so the stone could heat up. It's great plain or with extras, but my favorite is to brush the crust with honey as soon as it gets out of the oven. This bread is also perfect for french toast."

We are eastern European and my grandmother used to make a cake called cocosh. It's basically a sweet yeast dough that is filled with chocolate, rolled and baked in log form. The other more common known version is with poppy seed filling sometimes called mohn roll. This dough was perfect! Baked up light, fluffy and soft. Very simple to make and even easier to work with. Thank you so much for this recipe. I can't wait to try and make a challah with it."
