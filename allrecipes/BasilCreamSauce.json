Also, I used Half and Half instead because it's what I had available and it truly turned out amazing. We really like things to be extra garlicky, so I used six cloves of garlic rather than four, but I'm sure four would've be absolutely yummy for those who don't go crazy for that extra kick. Definitely will be making this again."

I measured 2 cups of basil leaves but maybe I was supposed to pack them in the measuring cup tighter.\n\nAlso, there wasn't enough sauce to properly coat 2 lbs of noodles. I will have to triple the recipe next time and only cook 1 lb of linguine to get the proper sauce to pasta ratio because I can taste the potential. \n\nOverall, this is a quality recipe. I just need to work out the kinks on my end because I'm new to cooking this dish and cooking in general as you have probably already noticed. Ha"

I made the mistake of planting the basil with tiny leaves, so it took forever to harvest enough -- next time, I'm going for the giant ones, lol -- but the sauce is well worth the effort. I served it over farfalle with blackened shrimp, and my husband and I both loved it. My only changes were to add a bit of oregano and using cornstarch to thicken it a bit. Thanks!"

The ground nuts act as a thickening agent, so if you choose to skip them, you'll need to thicken the sauce a different way."

I followed the instructions and it turned out great. It's light, creamy and very 'fresh' tasting (thank you, basil!) \nThe perfect compliment to my oven baked salmon- so yummy!\n\nOh, Caution- this makes a HUGE amount of sauce! Not too much of a problem for us, because it Does reheat without issue and, it turns out, is also tasty on rice and chicken :). Maybe next time I will halve the recipe or just be ready to freeze the leftovers for later.\n\n**And yes, this *is* a basil sauce- naturally the primary flavor is basil, so if you're not looking for that, I'd steer clear. (Not sure why you'd make a basil sauce if you don't like basil, but hey- no judgement here! :) )."

"reviewBody": "This was a very tasty, easy sauce to make. I followed other suggestions here and thickened the sauce with a rue of melted butter and flour. I also used half and half instead of light cream simply because I didn't have the cream on hand. Very similar in flavor to Maggiano's Basil Cream Sauce that they serve over ravioli in their restaurants. I'll be honest and say that next time I believe I will roast the garlic cloves before adding them to the basil since the raw garlic flavor was a bit overpowering at first. My family loves fresh grated parmesan cheese so I added extra to the sauce and then grated some over top of our ravs. I could see serving this to guests with pan seared chicken and pasta."

I will be making this again and again. Perfect for company-just add shrimp or chicken, top with fresh diced tomatoes, chopped basil and a bit of fresh parmesan! Like I said...Yum!!!"

I mixed the remaining half of the liquid in the pan with a bit of flour and cream cheese to thicken it up. I also added another garlic clove, a few dashes of onion salt, pepper, oregano, and dash of sugar.\r\n\r\nI divided the recipe in half and still had plenty for 5 or 6 servings, due to the fact that I kept adding milk and half and half in an attempt to thin it out a bit. . . still very thick. I served it with basil garlic shrimp over spinach pasta from this site. This is one of those meals that makes me wonder why I even bother going out to eat. . . it doesn't get better than this! Try it! Thanks for an amazing recipe! :)"

"reviewBody": "I'm only giving this 4 stars because I had to make some adjustments since I didn't have some of the ingredients and so I was never able to make the exact recipe. However, I used most of the ingredients and did the directions and it was very delicious! I didn't have any nuts so I omitted the nuts. I added more parmesan cheese. I didn't have any cream so I ended up making a rue with flour and butter, heating it with a tbsp of cream cheese and added 1%milk. I also added a little cornstarch to thicken it up a little more and it turned out great! I put it over noodles and chicken. So, in the end it was the base recipe with just a few adjustments. I definitely recommend this!"

I wanted to double it for 2 boxes of pasta, so I used about 1 1/2 pints of half &amp; half, (I also cheated majorly and bought premade pesto) 2 containers of pesto, 1/2 a container of ricotta cheese, about 1 cup grated parmesan cheese, and then after stirring it FOREVER and it not really thickening, I threw in enough flour for it to thicken to my liking. I put this over some sauteed eggplant, onion, mushrooms, &amp; peapods and tossed it with fettuccini and it was delightful... especially for my lactose intolerant hubby :)"

I like others had to thicken the sauce with a flour rue but this is a suject of personal preference. Although in doing this I should have put in additional garlic clove, more basil and a touch more parm. My boyfriend and I put this over homemade pasta for lunch the next day. He really liked it and this man doesnt fib when it comes to food. YUM"

I used a blender, and it was a bit time consuming, as I had to keep shutting it off and pushing the leaves down to try and chop them up."
