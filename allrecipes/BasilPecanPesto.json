I put everything into the food processor except the oil, chopped it all up, and then added the oil through the tube as the processor was running. Made a double batch last weekend and will probably do that again this weekend (storing in the freezer). Food Network has a page of 50 things to do with pesto which has some great ideas. Thanks for sharing your recipe; I never liked those pine nuts!"

I didn't have parmesian cheese so I subbed pecorino romano and it worked out fine. The recipe is silent as to which kind of olive oil to use-- I decided not to use EVOO in favor of lighter olive oil. This pesto has a lovely delicate flavor that my family enjoyed served with crispy gnocchi. Glad to have a delicious affordable alternative to pinenuts. Thank you grettagirl for the delicious recipe."

(Melt 2 tsp to 1 tablespoon butter or margarine in medium bowl; toss in 1 1/2 cup nuts. Spread nuts out evenly on large microwave safe plate and toast 1 minute at a time, stirring at those intervals until a nice toasty smell develops ~2-5 minutes. Check often as microwaves differ of course. Also, if the nuts seem too crowded, toast in more than one batch.)"
