"reviewBody": "I had a big first crop of basil so gave some away then made a half batch of the pesto with most of the rest. I used hazelnuts instead of the pine nuts because they have a slightly resinous taste similar to pine nuts. The batch was very flavorful and I had to resist the temptation to eat it right out of the blender. I froze approximately tablespoon portions in an ice cube tray to store for later use."

I highly recommend cutting the oil in half to start with and then add more if needed. Super simple and great flavor but the amount of oil needs tweaking."
