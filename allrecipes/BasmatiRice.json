I rinsed the rice in cold water first, and then cooked it in chicken broth with 1 tablespoon of margarine in the microwave (the easiest way to cook rice perfectly.) I didn't have any cumin seed so I used 1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin. I also added a little turmeric for color and flavor and garam masala to intensify the Indian flavor. This recipe was so simple and went great with my garlic and herb chicken breasts. I will definitely make this again!"

This was also the first time I'd ever used cumin seeds. I've used a lot of ground cumin in Mexican recipes, and found the cumin seeds here to be a very nice taste. One problem, though; the rice developed a stuck-on layer in the bottom of the saucepan, so I wish I'd stirred it a little during cooking. Overall, though, a very nice recipe, and worth remembering for future meals."

"reviewBody": "This really does taste like the rice I've had in middle eastern restaurants. I used Texmati rice and the proportions were perfect (and in fact matched those given on the container). I toasted the cumin seeds before adding them as suggested by another reviewer; I find that whole cumin seeds have a distinct, fresh flavor that ground cumin doesn't have, so I wouldn't recommend substituting ground for whole. I was surprised at how much the cumin flavor permeated the rice! I served it with grilled chicken, but I think it would be wonderful with something saucier, like a curry."
