Simmered for 20 min."

I added more stock and cooked it longer but it still didn't seem to cook thoroughly. I ended up burning it and threw it out. The basic cooking instructions on the bag said to cook it 40 minutes and this recipe said to cook it only 20 minutes. Either I needed more stock or longer time. Not sure but will definitely try again as I did like the flavor."

I added some minced garlic to the onions and bay leaf, and a touch of black pepper. I used chicken stock this time, and plan to use the beef stock in the future if it goes with a beef dish. Many thanks, Carol, for sharing this with us."

"reviewBody": "This pilaf makes a wonderful side dish. Its flavor will not overshadow the main dish, but can easily be adjusted if you would like a pilaf with more jazz. This is a good, basic pilaf. I used my homemade chicken broth which is more flavorful than the store bought kind, and used butter instead of vegetable oil for sautÃ©ing the onion. I chose this recipe to use up some nearly empty packages of rice, so this was a combination of basmati rice and long grain white rice, and it worked out very well. Thanks Carol for sharing!"

I followed the recipe and luckily checked on it while it was simmering and found that all of the water was gone and the rice had started to burn. I added more liquid and was able to save the dish. It took much longer to cook though also. Lesson learned. I would give it more stars if not for this mishap."
