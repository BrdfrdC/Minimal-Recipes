"reviewBody": "Made this recipe and it came out perfect. Best pretzels I ever had. Some notes about the issues voiced in the other reviews: I believe the issue is in the inexact measurements. I used weak (11% protein) flour and not bread flour, and I used 130g for a cup, which gave me a dough of the correct wetness. I suspect if you use bread flour and use like 150g for 1 cup (also stated in some sources) that this may not turn out. Additional info - used 120g each for 1/2 cup water/lager, and 28g for the 2tbsp butter. The results are worth the hassle! Give it a try!"

"reviewBody": "As someone else stated--I had the same issue with this recipe giving me extremely shaggy dough that came together very dense. I used King Arthur bread flour, which I'm thinking has a higher protein content than what Chef John uses for this recipe because I also followed it to the T. Very sad because I love all this recipes and was stoked about pretzels."

"reviewBody": "I absolutely adore Chef John, but this is another recipe where I follow it precisely and it just does not turn out. All my ingredients are fresh from the store. I mix the dough together and it's extremely dry and clumpy, can't even form it into a ball because it is just so shaggy and dry, and I follow the recipe exactly as it is written. This is so frustrating."
