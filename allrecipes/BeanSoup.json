The only change I've made to is it doubling the amount of onions, carrots, and celery, and if I've got extra ham, I'll use that, too. It's definitely better the next day, but if I make it in the morning, it's almost got that leftover extra by suppertime! And, yes, I just noticed because it's for supper tonight!"

Very sad as I was really looking forward to the flavors from when I was young. Won't make this again."

In another pot I boiled the beans two packages for 10 minutes and then repeated the process one more time , draining each time. After removing the ham from the ham hocks I also added more ham that I had in the freezer from a previous ham that I had cooked. Add your miraqua and the ham to the pot that you cook the ham hocks in then add chicken stock. You will find that there is more flavor in your broth and your bean soup will taste wonderful. Salt and pepper to taste."

I just add diced leftover ham which lends a ton of flavor. You don't need to add any extra spices, except for the bay leaf, salt and pepper in the recipe. The ham has all the seasoning you need. I use all of the leftover meat from the ham, I don't measure. Towards the end of the cooking time I take a stick blender or potato masher and mash up a good 10-20% of the beans to give the broth a rich hearty flavor and texture."

"reviewBody": "I used Barb Maxwell's \"Appalachian\" advice with the baking soda... that was excellent. I used 3 small ham steaks from a butcher and just the bones from those steaks. I trimmed most of the fat but each steak had a rim of \"rind\" which i threw in while cooking. I used half water and half chicken stock. In the end I probably had more like 3+ cups of ham in it overall This is a very flexible recipe. The pot is still on the stove and I think it's excellent but will probably be even better tomorrow!"

"reviewBody": "Best Navy Bean Soup ever. My husband made this soup this AM after soaking the beans in water over night. He dumped that water out, then covered the beans with fresh water, boiled them and then rinsed them with cold water, doing this twice. This is to cut down on the gas that beans produces, especially at our Denver altitude of 5280 ft. He then made the recipe as stated but did use a ham bone and 4 cups chicken broth and 3 cups water. All was put in a crock pot on High for about 8 hours. Again that is because to cook dried beans here, they have to cook longer so adjust your time and temp. This is without a doubt the best recipe we have tried or eaten. Thanks so much for this great recipe.\nColorado Karen"

I should have mixed the flour with some water or something, because, at first, the flour created some lumps that i had to try to break them up. I added two ham hocks, and i usually make more than the recipe calls for. Very yummy! Thank you so much for this hearty, healthy recipe!! And thanks to all recipes dot com for teaching me how to cook. If it wasn't for all of the ratings and tips for each recipe, i would be lost."

I tend to slow cook and the style of ham as well as the way it's made makes a difference. I used celery salt instead of celery and no carrots. I cooked over 4 pounds of beans so I used a whole yellow onion. I even diced pineapples from the ham and added them to the mix. Talk about feeding an Army. Love it! GREAT JOB!!"

I boiled and simmered the ham bone alone in the broth for 30 minutes. Then I added everything to it, all veggies at the same time, and added one clove of garlic. Boiled and simmered everything together for another 30 minutes. Comes out tasting great."

I had several half-bags of different beans, (kidney, navy, pinto and another small bag of mixed, dry veggies/beans) and it was fabulous!\n\nOh yes, someone mentioned using soda, which works great, too, but my grandma used to put salt in her beans when she soaked them overnight. It was the easiest way to ALWAYS get the beans done properly, as sometimes the skin seemed tough. Amazing what 3 tsp. of salt added to the cold water did.\n\nNancy S"

I also added just a touch of brown sugar. I put everything in the crock pot on high (about 4 hours for navy beans and 5-6 hours for great northern beans), and didn't need to soak or precook the beans at all.
