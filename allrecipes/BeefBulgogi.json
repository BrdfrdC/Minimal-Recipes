I also think I'll scale back just a bit on the garlic as it was strong. I did add 1/2 a grated pear to help to tenderize the meat. I wasn't able to grill the meat so I cooked it on the stove in a fry pan and once cooked there was a lot of liquid so I made a slurry of cornstarch/soy sauce/water and drizzled it in. It turned the liquid into a wonderful gravy. Will definitely make again!"

I let it marinate for about 30 minutes. I don't have a bbq so the meat was cooked in batches on the stove. It was so good! I stir fried sliced zucchini, red onion, mushrooms and green onion for the side and some plain white rice. This recipe is a keeper!"

I was trying to recreate a burrito from one of my favorite restaurants that closed, this bulgogi recipe was spot on. \nI made a couple adjustments from reading other reviews. I froze the meat for a half hour which made it very easy to slice thin, I used brown sugar instead of white and also cooked it over the stove top on high heat. Marinated the meat for 6 hours. \n\nI put this in a warm tortilla along with lime and cilantro infused rice, diced onions, lettuce, kimchi and of course the bulgogi. I also drizzled some of the marinade over the meat after. My husband had TWO freaking burritos! Next time I will try it with a fried egg and avocado. This is definitely going to be one of my staple recipes. Thank you!!"

I made a few adjustments for his tastes: I used brown sugar, half a smashed kiwi, and I added some grated ginger, Sriracha and red pepper flakes to give it some heat. Since I added the kiwi, I cut the marinating time down to 4 hours. I seared it in a hot skillet and it was perfect. So tender! We paired it with an egg roll, white rice and Mac salad, plate lunch style. Yum!\n\nThanks to the other reviews for the tips on sugar, kiwi, and partially freezing it for easier cutting!!"

Added just a splash of rice vinegar, and I'm glad I did for both flavor and to tenderize a bit. Overall, this is good and I would make it again. Great weeknight easy meal served with rice, broccoli, and a side salad."

After slicing, I put it back in the marinade so that it sits for at least 6 hours or so. I usually just make this on stove rather than the grill and it turns out great, very yummy with rice. Will try the brown sugar instead of white sugar next time."

Saves so much time in slicing super thin. I can do four steaks in two minutes. It does resemble ground beef but once you cook it you’ll see it cooks up in super small strips. This method allows it to absorb the marinade really well. Great marinade."

So this time, I doubled the marinade. After removing the meat from the marinade, I boiled it up and let it thicken a bit so that he could pour a little over his rice. AMAZING!!!!"
