If I want the sauce to have extra flavor I add cumin. I like it when someone gives 5 stars and then tells you what they did for personal touches. Thats why I read the comments. So what do ya'll think about a gluten free tortilla lol. Who knew there would be so much controversy over a corn vs flour tortilla."

Since I used chicken, I compared it to a very similar recipe from this site that used canned chicken. The nutritional values are almost the same, except that this one says one serving is one enchilada while the other said one serving is two enchiladas. It would be nice to know which is correct. \n\nI'll definitely make this again!"

If you make these and wonder why they don't taste like the enchiladas at your favorite Mexican eatery, it's because they never make enchiladas with flour tortillas. It's a completely different taste! That said, this was an easy, tasty recipe - for smothered burritos. I was really offended by comments such as \"not all of us are Mexican\" and \"keep your comments to yourself\". No one who questioned the use of four tortillas was being unkind, but some of the responses to them certainly were."

We are a Mexican family and we are not surprised at recipes made by those north of the border and passed off as Mexican leaving people to believe that the recipe is Mexican. This may be considered Tex-Mex which should never be confused with Mexican. Traditional enchiladas do not need to be reinvented. I am happy that people like this but it is in no way an enchilada. Why don't you try traditional, old school. They are easier, more delicious and don't contain canned sauce or packaged seasoning"

The meat mixture does not fill 10 tortillas, more like 8. Unless you want them super thin. All in all, I think it's definitely a versatile recipe. I can see using with shredded chicken or shredded beef (like left over pot roast or short ribs). And next time using corn tortillas as I normally would."

I will make it again!!!!\nI followed the recipe with these two tweaks (not really deviating from recipe), which turned out excellently. We like our food a little on the saltier side, so beware of following my tweaks. \nI used one packet of El Paso taco seasoning when browning the beef. This made it extra tasty, but again, we like our food on the more flavorful side. \nThe tortillas I bought from Whole Foods horribly broke apart as I was following directions and trying to roll the enchiladas. I then decided to deconstruct it and layered enchilada sauce, the tortillas next on the bottom , then meat mixture, then tortilla, then sauce, then cheese, and finally a can of black olives. No rolling!!! \nIf you’re not great at rolling or don’t want to roll, just layer like a casserole or lasagna type dish. It works wonders."

Anyway, yes authentic enchiladas are made with corn tortillas but 1. Why are you on here if you already know how you want your enchiladas 2. If you know how to make authentic enchiladas you’ll know that it’s a little more time consuming and you have more steps to take 3. This is allrecipes (not your grandmas cookbook from Mexico). Just because it’s not the “real” thing doesn’t mean it’s bad. I did like them btw. Thanks OP for sharing and sorry some people are so rude. As a Mexican, you other Hispanics should also know that part of the culture of our cooking is sharing recipes and adapting them to suit your families tastes."
