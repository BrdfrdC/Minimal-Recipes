I added Salt and Pepper to the meat. Also, I added some sesame seeds and a dab of prepared horseradish on my gyro. For the kids sake, I put the onions, cucumbers, and tomatoes as a salad on the side with oil &amp; vinegar."

Try running the cucumbers through a food processor, blender, or grate really fine on a cheese grader first then put on a terry cloth or a lot of paper towles and ring out the extra mosture form the cucumbers. This will help remove the extra liquid and make the tzatziki thicker."
