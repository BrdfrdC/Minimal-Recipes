I used a cabernet instead, because that's what I was drinking while I cooked. I was out of tomato sauce, so I used 1/2 cup of tomato basil spaghetti sauce. I pureed it in my mini food processor, because it was a little chunky. I added a tablespoon of worcestershire for depth. It turned out beautifully! I will definitely make this again."

I used red cooking wine because I didn't want to make a run to the liquor store for only 1/2 cup of wine I wouldn't use again. And I used salted butter because I didn't want to buy a lb of unsalted butter just for this recipe, I did omit the salt in the recipe to compensate. I also added just a bit of heavy cream at the end with the butter and oregano and it was awesome. It just gave it a nice creaminess to the sauce. I will definitely be making this again and again!"

I attempted to follow this up with Chef John's Chocolate decadence with raspberry sauce (which got modified a little). No one else wanted desert, so I had to forego as well. I think this would pair very well with a sweet red wine. I was considering Yellow Tail Sweet Red Roo (or something like that)."

Additionally If you slim down on the butter for caramelizing and finishing the sauce it still tastes decadent, I've got non stick pans so fats are mainly for taste. Enjoy!"

"reviewBody": "OVER THE TOP! I made this for a Valentine's Progressive dinner for 16 and it came out absolutely perfectly. I received rave reviews. I did decrease the salt whenever I could after reading a couple of the reviews. Due to the number I was serving, I first off made the sauce in two batches--doubling the recipe to serve 16 before I seared the meat. About three hours before guests arrived, I went ahead and browned the meat, then simmered the beef in the broth mixture--- cooking it to medium rare. I found it took about 5 minutes per batch, so I did it four times. I then refrigerated the meat in an enclosed Dutch oven pot. I used the \"warming\" setting on my oven and put the pot in the oven for an hour at 155 degrees while we went to the appetizer house. Came home and heated the broth gravy, then served the meat and sauce on individual plates! We couldn't have been more pleased. This had to be the most difficult way to prepare this fabulous entree to serve 16, but next time serving four will be a \"piece of cake.\" Patty"

"reviewBody": "This is probabaly the closest I have come to making steak as good as a steak house. It was easy and you can keep the wine for another dish, as it is called for frequently in sauces. Beef tenderloin is expensive, and I found with everything else served one tenderloin was enough. I made Chef John's classic rice pilaf with this and becaase that recipie is very easy, this fabulous meal was much less work than you would think.Watching the videos helps too!"

"reviewBody": "This is an outstanding recipe, and it works with Marsala as well as a good cabernet (ie: Powdered Keg). I have prepared this recipe several times, each scenario with grass-fed beef, and with incredible success. Why go to a steakhouse when you can have something of this caliber so easily made in your own kitchen. My husband does not typically like mushrooms, yet he has repeatedly told me that this dish is \"outstanding!\""

"reviewBody": "This is definitely a special occasion meal. Having to buy a specialty bottle of wine to make the sauce is worth it, but hard on the budget for a weekday meal. I increased the recipe to 6 and had to use two pans, a bummer. This also seemed to increase the \"carmelization\" time of everything. The recipe took much longer than expected, but it came out perfect. Next time I will invest in higher end cuts of meat (I did not use tenderloin) and the texture will be perfect too!"

I wasn't sure I would like the tomato sauce in this but it came out delicious! I'll definitely be making this again, including for company. Thanks for sharing this recipe - YUM."
