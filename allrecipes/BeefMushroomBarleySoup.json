Browned the beef, sautéed whatever onion, carrot, and celery I had, a lot of garlic, and threw everything into an Instant Pot with fresh thyme, parsley, and bay leaf bouquet garni. Cooked for 30 minutes, removed the bouquet, added a ton of mushrooms (I used 8oz sliced cremini and 5oz sliced fresh shiitake) and cooked for 20 minutes more. Added some chopped fresh parsley to finish. Amazing."

It's cooking now and I'm in the other room salivating!! I often change things up as I cook.. Sometimes I add a little cream but this time I had a small packet of truffle powder..

I seasoned the stew meat with salt and pepper ( 1 lbs only ) and browned in my dutch oven with a bit of canola oil. Once the meat was browned I then added the carrots, onions, celery and 2 large cloves of garlic. Once the onions were translucent I then added beef broth instead of stock and let everything cook until the last hour when I put in the mushrooms, barely and some corn that I cut off the cob that was leftover in my fridge. I did add some extra water during the whole cooking process because the soup itself was getting a little too thick. Everyone ( even my picky eater ) enjoyed this recipe. Will make again"

I use pre cut stew meat but use poultry shears to cut off all fat and gristle. Since I don't use salt, I make my own beef broth by boiling the meat, which tenderizes it, too. For flavor, I use baby bella mushrooms, not white ones, and vidalia onions for sweetness. I make plenty and freeze it in individual plastic containers for quick meals. Yum!!"

Much better flavor and texture IMHO. I would have given this a 3 and a half star rating if I could have as I found it too \"beefy\", if that makes any sense. I think that using just beef broth made it too heavy tasting for me. Next time (and there will be a next time) I'll try a container of chicken broth and a can of beef for a little lighter flavor."

I could only find quick cooking barley, so I added it with the mushrooms in the last half hour of cooking. It seemed ready at this point, so I turned off the heat. The meat was tender and the veggies were cooked perfectly. Another half hour would have been too much. Overall this is a good recipe."

This will be good to make again and freeze.\nNext time I make it, I will add any vegetable I think will go well in the soup (like green beans). This would work well with noodles if out of or wanting a beef noodle vegetable soup. One more ingredient I will try the next time I make this is adding a touch of red wine or a very small amount of sherry. Thank you for this recipe! It is great feeding the family a hearty, hot soup in the middle of winter. I am making this again."

I didn't cook the prime rib, but sauteed the veggies then added about 2t. minced garlic and cooked another minute or two. Then I added the mushrooms and once they started th release their juice I added the broth, some rosemary, salt and pepper. I used sodium free broth. Then added the barley, brought it to a boil, added the meat; reduced heat to a simmer, covered and let it go for about 45 min. Hubs kept telling me how good it smelled as I cooked. Glad it makes lots! Will definitely be making this again!"

I started the pearled barley while I prepped and cooked the beef and vegetables. I chose to also add 4 cloves of garlic and used a mix of baby Bellas and porcini mushrooms. By the time I had mixed everything in the pot, the barley was ready to add. All in all it took about an hour and 15 minutes. Great soup. Added salt and black pepper along with onion powder. Go by your taste. It actually was much better with grated Parmesan."

"reviewBody": "I loved this recipe. It is easy to prepare, uses easily accessible ingredients &amp; isn't 'finicky.' I did make a couple of *very minor* changes (i.e., added 1 additional stalk of celery &amp; 1 additional carrot, for a total of 4 each, &amp; only used one onion, as that was all I had on hand). Other than that I made it exactly as written. NOTE: save yourself some $$ - don't purchase pre-cut \"stew meat\"; instead purchase the same amount of chuck, and cut it yourself. You'll save a couple of dollars at least, &amp; it's easier to cut to the size you prefer - especially if you put it in the freezer for an hour before you cut it. Oh, yes, one other minor change: I tasted the broth when adding the mushrooms and found it not quite \"beefy\" enough to suit me, so I added 1 beef bouillon cube. But that could easily just be me. I'm sure it would have been just as good without it. I do recommend tasting it at that time, though, as neither salt nor pepper are included in the ingredients(likely due to the beef stock).\r\n\r\n This is a very filling dish which refrigerates/reheats easily. I was going to see how it did with freezing, but I honestly don't have enough left to freeze and test. It would make a lovely meal served with a green salad, crusty French bread &amp; a nice red wine. \r\n\r\nI will most definitely be making this lovely soup again, and soon!"

I have made it with quick- cooking barley added at the last hour as another reviewer suggested, and also with regular barley according to the original recipe. Both ways are great, so don't be afraid to make it with either method. If using the regular barley you might want to have extra beef stock on hand to add as it tends to be a thicker consistency.

I also add two cans of beef consomme and 2 Tbsp Worchester Sauce, both of which give the broth some extra ooomph! Throw everything EXCEPT the barley, into a crockpot for about 6 hrs. Add the barley about 1hr before serving. Easy! \n\nA note to new cooks: Taking the time to brown the meat &amp; veg in a skillet is the key to developing flavour base for most every soup or stew. It takes a few more minutes &amp; dirties another dish BUT your taste buds will thank you!"

I cooked mine for 11/2 hrs. at a simmer and all my veggies and barley were cooked, I only cooked the mushrooms for 30 mins. before serving.
