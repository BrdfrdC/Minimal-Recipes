You can play with the vegetables that you put in- so far I've found a simple can of mixed vegetables and the frozen peas creates the easiest preparation and the best tasting pie. As it says, salt to taste... I haven't needed any at all so be careful before you shake a lot on. Love it. Thanks!"

I made it as written, with the addition of onions, celery, and minced garlic, just because we like that combination and I rarely make a dinner without onions. However, I'm sure it would be fine without my additions. The beef broth and carnstarch made a tasty gravy for the filling. I don't think it needs a gravy packet as some reviewers have used. I did make sure to season with salt and pepper each step of the way, meat, potatoes, and gravy, and it turned out perfectly seasoned, needing no adjustment in seasoning at the table. Great recipe. My husband will be requesting this quite often."

Also added some onions &amp; celery and only used top crust. Excellent base recipe."

I added a lot of seasoning, including Emeril's Essence, Italian seasoning, parsley, paprika, Montreal steak spice. I added puréed onion and garlic to the broth to enhance the flavour. This had a bit of heat. Delicious!"

Instead of the cornstarch I added 2 tblsps. flour to the vegetables before the broth and combined it well. I added 2 tblsps. red wine and 1 tsp. herbs provence, baked in a 10 inch pie pan at 375 for 40 minutes. This made 4 generous servings. Would definitely make again."

"reviewBody": "I had a whole ribeye steak left over from yesterday's BBQ dinner and looked for a recipe to use it in today. The idea of a beef pot pie sounded fabulous so I printed this one off! I thought that a beef gravy sounded tastier instead of corn starch and beef broth; just a personal taste. So what I did was use a beef gravy package! I steamed some garden fresh chopped carrots and onion, small cubed potatoes and sliced celery. I salted and peppered those veggies once they were tender. Then I cubed up the BBQ'd ribeye which had already been seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder when it was BBQ'd. I placed the chopped steak and the steamed veggies in a bowl and mixed them up and then after stirring the dried, crushed thyme into the hot gravy, I put the veggies and steak into the deep dish pie plate and poured the gravy on top and then placed the pie crust on top. Baked as in the recipe at 400F for 35 minutes. Let it rest for 20 minutes when done. The flavors were scrumptious and a five star, for sure. I don't normally change recipes and then rate them but I just wanted to share this outcome as it was just so good."

I used a combination of chicken gravy I had and some beef soup base and a bit of leftover pot roast mushroom gravy with a little corn starch and had about 3C thickened gravy. Everything had already been well-seasoned when first cooked with garlic, bay leaves, thyme, salt and pepper, so I just heated everything on the stove to a slow boil, dumped it in the crust, added the top crust, and baked for 45 minutes. It's much quicker to throw this together from leftovers, and it is very delicious!!! It's also very easy to change based on what's on hand or individual preferences."

"reviewBody": "Loved this. Did not use the canned beef broth. Since the roast is getting cooked in water, it's easy to make gravy from this rather than canned broth. I threw in bay leaves, some dry onions and garlic (the last 2 cook down to mush, pretty much, but help flavor the meat as it simmered.) When I made the gravy, I removed the bay leaves. You could strain the liquid and remove fat, if you like. Figure a thin gravy ratio of 1 TBL cornstarch to thicken each cup of roast-cooking water you'd like to turn into gravy. \n\nOnce the gravy thickens and I salt/pepper/season it to suit us, I combine with the meat and vegetables so I can make sure I have enough gravy before putting it in the shells. I follow another poster's suggestion to make from-scratch crusts and to pre-bake the bottom shell. I like to make this as a multiple-meal dish (ie Once a Month Cooking.) It can be done without crust if you can't be bothered, or with biscuit for a top crust. \n\nWhen freezing this for later meals, I PRECOOK until crust just starts to brown before freezing. This means that I only have to bake until hot (165 degrees in center) before serving. This also allows me to use the dish from frozen if I need to. There is some time penalty from frozen, but nothing like it would be if it had to COOK as well as thaw in the oven. Thawing first works better, but life is busy. \n\nNote: a layer of parchment paper under your bottom crust will allow you to remove the frozen pie from your baking dish for storage."

I used cooked, cubed london broil that I had in the freezer so it only took a little over an hour to prepare and cook the pot pie. I don't like peas so I left them out and added one stalk of celery and three green onions, sliced. I also reduced the cornstarch and added three tablespoons of brown gravy mix to help thicken the broth and make it richer. It is a very adaptable recipe that allows you to add and delete vegetables to your taste. It was perfect comfort food on a cold, snowy day."

I used leftover prime rib from our Christmas dinner, so I did not have to go through all the meat prep - I would probably only make this using some sort of meat leftovers. I also added 1/2 yellow onion, diced very finely and did not add the carrots to the broth until the last 5 minutes so that they did not get too mushy. A full cup of peas was a bit much (and I like peas!)\nI used 16oz water and 2 boullion cubes rather than beef broth and did find that I needed to add more liquid when I made my gravy (I actually ended up just adding some leftover gravy from Christmas dinner).\nThe bake time ended up being more like an hour; when I make it again I will raise the heat just a bit and aim for a bake time of about 45 minutes.\nAll in all, really, really good!"

I've made Shepard's pie, enchilada pie, and every kind of quiche imaginable (including about 8 original quiche recipes, like my Reuben quiche). I already had a good idea about what to put in a beef pot pie, &amp; how to season it to our taste, but wasn't sure about how to thicken the gravy so it isn't too thin or to thick. I just found this site last week, when looking for a recipe for a Barbie Doll Cake. Everyone was so helpful I figured I could get some info here. This recipe was most helpful regarding thickening, so I based my beef pot pie on this procedure. Admittedly, I also added some veggies I like, like celery &amp; mushrooms, and more seasonings, but it came out perfect with respect to the sauce, and we all loved it!"

My husband had seconds so I know it was really good because he hardly ever has seconds. I did make a few modifications: used a beef bouillon cube when simmering the steak and added some red cooking wine. Then when the carrots and potatoes were cooking, I added garlic, onion, thyme and fresh rosemary. I had to add some water to the gravy mixture because there wasn't much left after cooking everything else. I might use 2 cans of beef broth next time. The one thing that annoyed me a little was that it made a lot, way too much for 1 pie pan. So I used a bigger dish, which the pie crust didn't exactly fit but I stretched it out to fit. Baked it for 50 mins and it was perfect. Definitely will be making this one again; it's a keeper!!"
