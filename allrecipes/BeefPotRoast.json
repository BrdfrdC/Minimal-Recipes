"reviewBody": "Great recipe--used ~2lb USDA Choice chuck roast from costco, and generously salted/peppered the meat and let it sit overnight in the fridge prior to cooking for dinner the next day. Seared in a cast iron pan, and then transferred to a covered, 1.75 qt oven-safe ceramic sauce pot since I didn't have a Dutch oven. Followed the recipe exactly, and was pleasantly surprised how tender, juicy, and flavorful this recipe was. The surprisingly amount of juices generated from cooking the meat made a wonderful sauce with the onions/garlic/bayleaf mixture. Thank you very much!!"

Not only did we let our pot roast cook for extra amount of time, but we ended up covering it, WHICH THE RECIPE NEVER STATED TO DO. The hostality stated in these comments as well were uncalled for. The title of this recipe is easy pot roast, do you think experienced cooks are following this recipe??NO. This recipe is misleading, a waste of time, and a waste of money. I hope you have a better day because this recipe did not make mine better. As I am still waiting for my pot roast to be done after starting this recipe a total of four hours ago."

We make this dish monthly, with the only difference being adding a half-cup of liquid (broth, bone broth, blood from the roast + water) after browning. You can try other spices on the roast, too. It is a favorite!"

"reviewBody": "The recipe is amazing and I have been making it for years with electric and gas ovens. The trick is to cook until soft. If you over sear the meat the outside will have a crunchy crust. If you want completely soft then do not over sear. Your choice, cook dry though and do not add veggies and it will interfere with softness of the meat. The dry breaks down the sinew. Finally if onions and garlic burn, it’s ok add red wine and sugar the strain sauce, will be like a fine restaurants sauce, but strain. It will also clean your post. Born Apetit!"

I was, however, leery that it would not have enough flavor. The cooking method plus the simple ingredients created an easy, faster pot roast option. My husband is avoiding carbs so I made the gravy with a dollop of butter and full cream. I will make this again."

"reviewBody": "This recipe turned out great! We added 4 cups of broth plus 1/4 cup red wine because we live in Colorado where it is very dry and foods need liquids to keep from drying out. The next time, we’ll use a little less liquid because it was so much. We seared the roast as recommended and then removed it from the Dutch Oven. We boiled the broth and then poured it into Dutch Oven to deglaze the bottom and get up the brown bits and added the wine. We put the roast back in and set the onion quarters around it. For an almost 5 lb. roast, it was done in 2 hours (145 degrees), but we had to keep it warm because the rest of the meal wasn’t ready yet and it got up to 160 degrees internal when we finally cut into it. But still the tastiest roast we had made. The gravy came out great as well with lots of liquid to work with."

I made sure to give the meat a good sear. I am only cooking for two, so I used a 2 lb. boneless chuck roast. Being that small, I checked it an hour after I lowered the heat. It was already done. I let it rest 15 minutes. I think cooking the vegetables on the side made the difference. Plus the gravy right out of the pan on mashed potatoes was superb."

"reviewBody": "I followed this exactly using a 3.5 pound Blade Roast (I'm from Canada) that we got in our purchase of a 1/4 cow. I know some people said to put in broth and other things, but this recipe is perfect as is. I wanted a pot roast recipe that didn't taste like fat soaked vegetables. Used a dutch oven with a heavy lid and that keeps all the moisture in. The onion really helps keeps everything moist as well. I cooked this the day before so I was able to slice the meat very thin the next day. After cooking, I removed the onions, put them into a strainer to let the juices drain and then just reheated them the next day. I let the juices cool overnight in the fridge and scraped the fat off. Using some of the fat and the left over juices, I made a pan gravy with some homemade stock. Served everything with the leftover onions and some roasted potatoes and a veg. I would make this recipe over and over again."

I added 6 carrots and 6 red potatoes, with salt and pepper, as sides - all in the roasting pan. Celery would be another option. Make sure you seal the pan well with aluminum foil so everything turns out moist. Best roast recipe I've made yet!"

I seared the meat with the onions and then, after I seared all sides, I did a rough chop of some carrots (in biggish chunks), layered them on the bottom with the bay leaf and then put the roast on top. All of the juices cooked into the carrots. SO GOOD! My husband asked to keep this as the 'go-to' roast recipe. So so delicious! I did extend the recipe a little by making gravy with the following gluten free recipe: After taking out the roast to rest on a platter, I add 1 tsp. Xanthan Gum to the leftover beef au jus, whisk well. Add 1 c. water and then a beef bouillon cube (or granules), bring to just to a boil and then spoon over your roast!"

The only things I did differently was add this Chupacabra Rub before I seared it because I was in a rush and didn't read reviews until after I did. I also added chopped carrots and celery with the onions. My chuck roast was a little less than 5 lbs. I used a 2 piece lodge cast iron combo cooker (3.2 quart) together it's like a Dutch oven. I had plenty of juices left over, I want to say around 2 cups? The meat was tender after the last 1.5 hours. I served it with sautéed asparagus and steamed potatoes ( in the Instant pot).
