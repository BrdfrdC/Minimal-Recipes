We dipped them in a sweet chili sauce and will look at a few other sauces to dip them in next time. I will say this recipe start to finish was 2 hours. A bit different than the 40 listed. Next time I’ll use a food processor to speed up the prep. Thank You - Amazing"

I did however reduce the salt to 1 tsp (good thing!), omitted the green chilies and reduced the chili powder and black pepper (we like foods mild-moderately spicy). I also tried making the dough wrap from scratch (recipe from one of the reviewers here) which made larger samosas that were hardier. I would make these more often if I had a deep fryer. Otherwise, I'll make them on special occasions for appies (using the phyllo) or as an entree (using the dough from scratch)."

I bake at 400 to 410 F till lightly golden. My guy requests these all the time now, so I make a big batch and freeze them (vacuum sealed) so we can just nuke one anytime we want.

"reviewBody": "The filling is very good, with strong, bold and aromatic flavors. It's better when made ahead and it has time for the flavors to really set in.\n\nI didn't use phyllo as most are made with hydrogenated oils, so I made my own with flour, salt, oil and water. I also baked them instead of frying, as I wanted to see if they tasted similar. They were good, but I would probably fry them as they're a little chewier. I'd recommend making your own dough or buying the uncooked flour tortillas from Costco."

It was good, in case anyone needs a leftover idea."

"reviewBody": "I have made these many times .. been fiddeling with this recipe for over a year.. each time I was disappointed with not the way they tasted, but the way to wrap them ... I have tried phyllo dough, eggroll wrappers, and a few variations of dough. I have pan-fried them, baked them, and deep-fried them ... the best results came from using a dough (something like a pie crust dough, or a pierogie dough)(DO NOT USE PHYLLO. it does not work and is too flaky for this kind of thing . I have tried many times!! the samosa becomes LIMP as it's too heavy of a mixture.. 'real' samosa is like a dough/puffed thing anyways) ... and to DEEP-FRY them (don't pan fry or bake .. the results are mediocre) ... I follow the directions exact for the filling, but I don't mash the peas, and I also add 3 tbsp's lemon juice, and 1/2 tbsp green chili chutney... I make the filling a day or two ahead, just keep it in the fridge until I make the dough/wrap them ... I wrap about 15-20 of them, and freeze the other half of the filling for another time... 'paste' the edges of the dough well, with a flour/water mixture, lay on a floured baking tray to keep the bottoms from sticking, which causes holes in the dough, then they ooze apart when cooking. deep-fry at 180 degrees celcius for 6 minutes."

I just put 2 tbsp of the filling into each egg roll wrapper and wrapped it up like a regular egg roll and fried them about 3-4 minutes flipping half way through. I ended up using about 1 and a half packages of wrappers (made around 30 total samosas). To save time I made the filling the night before while making a quick dinner, refrigerated it and added the cilantro and chilies the next day, wrapped and fried them. We tried a variety of dipping sauces that we had in the fridge and found that dipping them in light sour cream tasted really great. I think it was well worth the time and effort. Will make again."

I used the method of melted butter and layering the dough, then cut it into lil squares...filling them and folding them over. At the very end I took a few sheets of the dough, without using the melted butter and rolled the filling up in that and fried it real quick, and that turned out much better. A lot less oil. So next time that is how I will do it."

"reviewBody": "Years ago I worked in a natural foods store that received a weekly delivery of freshly made samosas from a local Indian woman. They were so delicious but I never considered attempting to make my own. Recently I got to thinking about them, and now that I don't have access to that natural foods store, my only option to was to make them myself. This recipe had all the ingredients and flavors I remember about those samosas. I followed the recipe exactly but before stuffing the dough, I tasted the mixture and found it to be bland. So I doubled all the spices. I didn't care for the mashed potatoes and probably should have followed my instincts to leave them in small pieces like the original ones I had enjoyed. I also should have used an authentic dough recipe. The phyllo detracted from this because it isn't anything like samosa dough. Overall, these were ok but very time consuming. I served them with the Tomato Chutney II recipe from this website."

For the skins, I used spring roll skins - each one cut into three strips. I then placed a small amount of filling on one end, folden the skin over forming a triangle, and kept rolling up until I made a little football shaped samosa! To seal the edges, I made a paste out of cornstarch and water - just moistened the edge with it. I then deep fried as the recipe calls for."

We diced then boiled our potatoes and did not mash them. In addition to the peas, we added boiled diced carrots just cause they were around. And not having fresh green chiles, we used a red chile paste instead. It all came together great, especially when you add the lemon juice that was also suggested. For the dough, we opted for AUNTWEBBIE's tip. The dough is so forgiving to use and quite light after they are fried. We can't get enough of this dish, so much so that we have made it twice already. And if you got leftover filling (which we made sure of), it's great with a bowl of rice. Thanks to all for the recipe and tips."

I opted to bake mine instead of frying (I know, crazy!!) to keep them out of all of that oil, although I realize that's not typical for samosas either! Regardless, thanks so much for this recipe, I will certainly make again as these were fantastic! So glad there are leftovers!"
