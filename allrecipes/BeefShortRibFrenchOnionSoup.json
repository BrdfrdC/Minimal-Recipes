"reviewBody": "A chef once told me to use only a few veggies while cooking. He was correct. Finely strain the vegetables from the liquid after cooking. Throw these veggies away keeping the liquid. The veggies have lost their unique favors after being cooked for several hours. From the strained liquid you can make a wonderful au jus with a couple tbls more wine. Our old friend Justin Wilson said never use a wine you would not drink. \"An', you don't get dat at da grocery store, no.\" I use a good Marsala. Cook fresh veggies separately to serve with your meal."

"reviewBody": "With the exception of only using 4 meaty short ribs (because that is all that I had), we made this recipe exactly as it reads and we really enjoyed it. It would have been even better with the 4 extra ribs that it calls for. The flavor is delicious and our children who are under 4 devoured it…probably because of the french bread with cheese on the top:). We do not have crocks, so I just broiled the bread topped with cheese and placed it on top of the soup bowls before serving."
