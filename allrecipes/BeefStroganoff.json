"reviewBody": "I have been searching for a particular taste in a beef stroganoff. This is it! The person (Beezlys) made some great modifications that I mostly followed. Here is my adjustments to that. I used already smoked brisket so it was cooked and tender and has a nice strong smokey beef flavor. This is a perfect recipe to use left over beef brisket!! 1/3 cup cream cheese is also a must. I would add that white wine is exactly the flavor (just a little bite) that really goes well in this. I don't think red wine would have the same twang. I had some shiitake and chanterelle mushrooms that needed to be used. And why not throw in some home grown leaks too! Very tasty."

It turned out to be very tasty! Both of my parents and I really enjoyed this. Absolute comfort food! Like a few others, I marinated the beef for 1.5 hours in white wine and Worcestershire sauce. Next time, I'll try red! It really made the meat flavorful and tender. I also marinated the mushrooms in Worcestershire sauce in a separate bag. I added a few teaspoons of minced garlic when cooking the onions and I added the mushrooms to the pot while it was simmering. I also added 1/3 cup cream cheese along with the sour cream. I'll definitely make again! This went great with cornbread too :)"

I’m a single dad in grad school and don’t have a lot of time for meal prep. This recipe was good because it had an hour of simmer time that allowed me to work on other things. I definitely added some garlic powder and a little bit of the greens from the onions. I used beef fajita meat because that was what was available. But it turned out amazing! Very solid recipe!"

Doubled the sauce so I added 4 tbls of corn starch to one can of condensed soup and 4 tbsp of flour to the other, stirred that in then added the mustard and Worcestershire sauce. Cooked it a bit to thicken the sauce then added 1/3 cup cream cheese (doubled) and 1/3 sour cream doubled. Served it over brown rice, the boys loved it, so good!"

I added some Worstershire sauce and beef broth to beef, and instead of condense beef broth I used cream of mushroom soup, i didn't have green onion so i used a yellow onion and 1/4 tea of paprika. I also did the rue separate. I was afraid tge flour would clump up as I didn't have much room in my pan. Lol. This was delicious!! However, I will add less butter next time. But definitely great recipe."

My 12 year old didn’t complain about it, which is unusual, and my 17 year old didn’t eat it because she’s a vegetarian. I asked my husband if he hated it too, and he quickly replied “yep”. \n\nHe told me that something was missing but he didn’t know what. \n\nI thought it was pretty good- especially after I added a little more salt and pepper. I’ll enjoy the leftovers tomorrow."

You can replace the butter with another fat but you can’t remove it because then the flour won’t have enough fat for the roux especially if you use a leaner cut of meat. Usually equal parts fat and flour. There are other methods to thicken a liquid so maybe research those if you don’t want to use butter."

Looking for something to do with it, I found this highly rated recipe, which turned out very good, scaling it in half. I didn't cook this for the full hour stated, as the pieces were small. I tested them during the cooking time and also didn't want them to dry out. Probably cooked for around 35 min. The pieces do shrink, too. Delicious over some noodles. Very hearty and satisfying dish. Thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "The first time my stroganoff wasn’t a disaster! I did make a few mods but not because of the recipe - more because of my family’s needs. I, similar to others, marinated the meat in red wine - smelled sooo good while I was prepping the other items - I also used Italian herbs in the marinade. I used gluten free flour - was an easy swap. Rather than adding all of the flour to the pan, I used 2T to mix with the salt and pepper and tossed the meat in this mixture before I added the meat to the pan. The last thing I changed was using dairy free sour cream. Everything worked great and even my picky teen gobbled it up."

I turned this into a Gluten Free recipe by substituting equal measure King Arthur Measure for Measure, it came out very tasty with some of my own flavor modifications (below). However I will do the thickener different next time and not use the KA flour. It has Xanthum Gum in it which I rarely use in GF cooking because it has a tendency to get things a little slimy."

Diced onion and several cloves of garlic smashed and diced. To cheat Wehrmacht I don’t have time to roast a tri-tip or a pot roast, I used deli Aviles roast beef from the deli counter and just cut it up and mix it in just before serving so it warms up. Add some beef bullion in the sauce as needed to boost the beef flavor if the beef stock doesn’t give enough. And must sprinkle it all with paprika!"

Sliced the onion rather than chopping, Added horseradish and worchester sauce. Used mini bella mushrooms which were added at the same time as the cream cheese, so they were not over cooked. Delish... Recipe only fed 4 people."

A few of the changes I made in doing so was using one yellow onion instead of green onions, adding a bay leaf during the hour long cooking period, and doubling the amount of mustard. I used whole grain mustard and I feel like this is a must, it added such a great flavor to the dish. I also substituted plain Greek yogurt for sour cream to cut out some of the fat and honestly couldn’t taste the difference. Very rich and tender!"

"reviewBody": "Delicious and easy to make! The positive: the instructions to brown your meat, then push aside and brown your onions, then push aside and add flour to make gravy all in the same pan worked! I really didn't think it would - I thought the gravy would get lumpy - it came out silky smooth. The cons: the recipe called for way too much butter. I prepared the amount asked for but it became clear after melted that it simply butter overkill. After reading the rest of the recipe, I just didn't see how it was necessary, so I used half. Lucky for me, that worked out just fine. Also, the chuck was still a tad tough, so maybe I needed a bit more simmering time. Another change: I didn't have white wine (recipe asks for 1/3 cup) so I used a 1/4 cup white wine vinegar. It all turned out great! I'm keeping this one in my favourites for sure!"

"reviewBody": "We really liked this recipe. I didn't have any wine so omitted that ingredient but since we rarely have wine or cook with it we didn't miss it at all. I did take the advice of other reviewers and added 1/3 brick of cream cheese in addition to the 1/3 cup of sour cream near the end which made the flavor so rich and delicious! Oh and I also used cut up sirloin tip steak instead of chuck roast because that's what I had on hand and it was so tender. I browned my meat with my diced onions and seasoned with salt, pepper and bottled minced garlic which adds tons of flavor to your meat. I used diced yellow onions because I had no green onions which I admit would have added more flavor but still this tasted amazing. I will be adding this recipe to my favorites file. Don''t be afraid to substitute what you have on hand because it will still turn out very good. This dish reheats well in the microwave and amazingly tastes even better the next day! I have made this dish for years using lean ground beef and it's good that way too!"

"reviewBody": "This is a good springboard for inspiration; I made this recipe twice. I made it the first time following the recipe. Beef chuck is a tough stew meat, you can't really get away with just cooking it one hour. I even tried to cook the meat low and slow longer for almost 2 hours to compensate. The first time I made it, flavor was just OK, and the meat was tough, very dissatisfied.\n\nI decided to use the recipe again as a base but heavily modified this recipe, using a slow cooker and changing ingredients/amounts around, and it turned out amazing the second time (total cook time was between 5-6 hours on high). Beef was fall apart tender. \n\nIf you want to follow this recipe, you are probably better off using sirloin or a more tender meat, otherwise you're likely going to end up with tough beef no matter what you do."

And I only use a nice cabernet sauvignon.....mostly so I can enjoy a couple of glasses myself! Its definitely a favourite in my house. And so rich that it's a treat only a few times a year."

I cooked pretty much as presented with some slight modifications most of which were so I could cook in pressure cooker. I removed meat from skillet after browning and sauteed both the onions and mushrooms together, added back the meat then stirred in flour to coat the meat. This helped to prevent lumps. I used 1/3 cup flour in order to have more gravy. Once thoroughly coated and browned, I added 14 oz can of beef broth stirring constantly and added additional water as it thickened to thin appropriately. I then added the mustard and white wine and brought back to slow boil. Transferred to pressure cooker and cooked for 10 minutes under pressure. Removed from heat and allowed pressure to release naturally. Removed lid and continued simmering until thickened then added sour cream. Served over egg noodles. With the pressure cooker, my cooking time was dramatically cut but meat was VERY tender and flavorful. My husband said it was a keeper!"
