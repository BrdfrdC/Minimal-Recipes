"reviewBody": "This recipe is good. I followed the recipe fairly close except that I made it gluten free by using potato flakes instead of flour (works great) to thicken the sauce and put in garlic powder instead of fresh. I didn't like the idea of using chicken broth in a beef recipe, however I decided to try it and what do you know, the broth was quite delicious. I only had two cups of fresh mushrooms and it wasn't enough. It definitely needed more mushrooms. I didn't cook the noodles in the Instant Pot, so I had a lot of gravy. Some would say too much. I liked it more soupy, but you could leave out one of the cups of broth."

"reviewBody": "Tried this for the first time in my InstaPot Duo 8, making dinner for 8 (did the 2 pounds of stewing beef option). Definitely modified it - must add 2 tablespoons of worcester sauce on top of the soy, as others have done. Used almost 4 cups of beef broth - don‚Äôt use chicken. Also used corn starch instead of flower. My only complaint is the salt was way too salty for me and my family - will likely cut back from the recipe‚Äôs suggested 2 teaspoons to only 1 teaspoon - maybe 1.5 at most. Finally, I used an entire 1 cup container of light sour creme. Otherwise, it was a fantastic recipe and the family loved it. Stew beef came out melt in your mouth tender, which is exactly how I like it."

I browned the meat (beef shoulder) in two batches. I seasoned the meat with Badia Complete Seasoning. I added the mushrooms and thyme and onions and garlic and cooked for a couple more minutes. Added 4 cups of beef broth and pressure cooked for 18 minutes with a quick release. Added most, but not all, of the 16 oz package of noodles, and stirred them in so they were covered. Pressure cooked for 7 minutes more, with a 4 minute natural release. Added sour cream and cream cheese and a slurry of 2 TB of corn starch and beef broth and I let it saut√© for another 5 minutes. This was the best beef stroganoff we've ever eaten!"

"reviewBody": "Recipe was excellent and a snap to make. I would add four cups of mushrooms and four cups of chicken stock so there is more sauce/gravy. I would also bump the flour to 2.5 tbl. I used a 2.8 lb chuck roast. and 13 minutes of high pressure\n\nDefinitely a keeper!! Word of warning on opening the valve on my Instant Pot Duo. Both steam and the sauce came out. Best to do a \"controlled release\". Takes a minute longer, but you will avoid the mess. Enjoy."

"reviewBody": "First of all, I've made it three times and the overall recipe is fantastic. If you only make it by the recipe, it works.\n\nI do agree with others that using beef broth makes a lot more sense. But I went further. I replaced one cup of the broth with a dry red wine. This made the finished product taste PRECISELY like the old Russian recipe I had always used.\n\nThe finished product also benefits from a rest after completion. Use your Instant Pot's \"keep warm\" function, put the lid back on after mixing in the sour cream and let it rest while you fix a salad and pour the wine."

I also used whole wheat noodles.\n\n2. Natural release is needed after the meat cooks, not quick release. If you want to spend time cleaning up a huge mess, then do the quick release. The sauce spewed out the top of my IP and made a huge, greasy mess.\n\n3. Flour as a thickener needs to be added AFTER the meat cooks. I had to thin out the mixture because I got a burn notice so either increase the amount of liquid when adding the flour OR add a flour slurry after the meat cooks.\n\nOtherwise this was pretty good."
