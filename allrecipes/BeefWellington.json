I followed other reviewers who seared the beef first for about 1 1/2 minutes per side and then cooked on an over rack at 400 for 25 minutes. Unfortunately, that resulted in over-cooking. I was hoping for medium rare, but got medium +. Served with au gratin potatoes, garlic green beans, and of course a great Cab."

If I managed to get my hands on the right size fillet I think this would have been great. I do like the idea of adding whole mustard to the beef before the mushroom mix - this would add a lovely flavour to the finished dish. Will play with this one and likely make again. Not bad for my first attempt at a Wellington."

I definitely recommend it. \n\nI had sous vide cooked some petite fillets ( they look like tenderloins but cost about half as much) the night before and needed something to do with two remaining fillets so they wouldn't become one of those leftovers that stayed in the fridge until thrown out. This recipe was perfect. \n\nI was able to skip the searing step since the fillets were already cooked to perfection (rare-medium rare) the night before. The only other substitution I made was that I used chopped liver (from my local bagel store) instead of pate' . \n\nMy family loved it and we practically fought over each bit of the leftovers the next day."

The only thing I did differently, I chopped the mushrooms in a blender to make them like crumbs. Also, I didn't cook the whole tenderloin, I cooked individual filets."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was amazing. I haven't tried to cook a Beef Wellington before, so was a little nervous, but it came out great and the family raved about it. I did modify a bit. I thought it might be too rich with the Pate, so I whisked some melted butter with dijon mustard and used that instead. I also used 2 tbsp. chopped scallions from a jar and sauteed with about 1 lbs of chopped white button mushrooms. I layered prosciutto on plastic wrap, set the roast on top, covered with the dijon mixture and then the mushroom duxelles and wrapped the roast with the prosciutto. This helped to keep it all together before wrapping in the phyllo dough. Cooking also took about 10 mins longer than recommended time, but it came out super delicious."

"reviewBody": "Outstanding. Like other reviewers, i made individual filets rather than a whole beef tenderloin. First i sauteed the mushrooms and onion in some butter then sherry until absorbed, removed from pan, added a bit more butter, and then seared the filets (seasoned with S&amp;P) about 2-3 minutes on each side. Rather than pate, I used prosciutto based on some online replacement recommendations. Prosciutto on the bottom of the pastry, then the seared steak, then the mushroom/onion mixture on top. i chose 425 the whole time, cooked about 1/2 an hour and covered with foil for about 20 minutes. It was a PERFECT medium. Oh definitely use a rack so that the pastry doesn't get soggy on the bottom, my toaster oven rack fit nicely into the 9x13 dish i used. thanks for a fabulous recipe with rave reviews!"

"reviewBody": "My first attempt was just okay. Some thoughts... Novices, know that beef tenderloin is expensive. 2.6 lbs at Sprouts, was $50 at $19/lb. Be prepared. Also, allocate more time.\n\nI merged this with other methods. I didn't use the pate, I used English mustard on the beef. I diced the mushrooms really fine and added green onions, a shallot and garlic to the mushrooms. I also I laid down prosciutto and put the mushrooms down on that. But I didn't have enough prosciutto - mistake #1, have enough prosciutto to cover the beef. I had all of this on cling wrap which I used to help me roll the beef... but I had standard size wrap and I should of had a longer one, so that was mistake #2. Result left me with a soggy bottom that broke when I tried to move it. Had I had more prosciutto that covered the mushrooms, I think I would have avoided this.\n\nThis was also my first time working with puff pastry and I need more practice. My ends were thick and lumpy. And after baking it one side had ripped open exposing the mushroom filling. I'm not sure what I did wrong to cause this. I need more practice.\n\nMy review is mostly an account of what I learned from my mistakes. My presentation wasn't that good but the meat cooked well and was tasty. I want to try this again, it was a nice cooking adventure."

Then used the juices with mushrooms and onions and added a few spices. By far the greatest meal I've made."

Followed recipe very closely, just used a little smaller cut and browned a little longer in the beginning as I didn't want it too rare and have the puff pastry get too brown if I it needed it in there longer. Cooked it to an internal temp of 140 F when I took it out to rest at the end for 10 minutes. The pan jus was also good, though pretty salty since the butter I used in the browning process was salted...so added a bit of water then thickened with wondra flour for a bit of a thicker consistency. I didn't have a wire rack, so just used the one from my grill and put that over a cookie sheet! Worked perfectly!"

I read MANY reviews and came up with these changes: onions, mushrooms, garlic, and parsley sauteed, drained and cooled; cut loin into fillets and seared in cast iron skillet for 3 mins all sides, cooled; brushed a mixture of dijon and spicy grain mustard all over fillets; egg washed inside of pastry (hoping it would hinder the sogginess), added mushroom mixture, and a few tbsps of shredded parmesan; egg washed the outside; placed sheet pan and rack in oven during preheat; baked at 425 for 15 mins then lowered temp to 350 for another 10 mins or so. Even after doing some of the \"preventative\" measures the puff pastry was still soggy on the bottom, but it didn't hinder taste at all. I'm glad I went with a quality cut of beef. It didn't need sauce/au jus at all! Served with potato stacks and asparagus."

I followed the cooking time exactly to the recipe and the meat was cooked perfectly. As all of the other reviewers note, the star of this recipe is the meat itself so it's important to use a very high quality piece of meat."

I didn't use live pate and instead coated the filets with spicy mustard before topping them with the mushroom and onion mix and rolling them up. I used the same pan filets, onions and mushrooms cooked in to make the red wine sauce. Wellingtons came out perfectly pink and delish!"

I made it twice in a week, once with a 2 1/2 lb tenderloin and the second time with a 6 lb tenderloin. It was perfect each time. The first browning in the oven is key. Resist the temptation to keep the beef in longer than 10 minutes for the small roast. Cooling between each step is essential as well. The assembly is quick and the final roasting is 25 minutes regardless of how big the roast is. (because the thickness is the same) Once the pastry is uniformly brown, take it out and let it sit for at least ten minutes."

I find that the hardest part of this is getting the pastry to work. Here's my tip: have plenty of puff pastry. Roll it out and place the bottom part in the baking dish, which has been buttered. Spread pate on pastry, cover it with mushroom and onion mix, then place meat on top. Cover top and sides of meat with pate, then mushroom and onions. Finally, place a separate piece of pastry on top, and connect by crimping the sides. Much easier than trying to cover the whole thing with one piece then transferring to baking dish."

The recipe is relatively easy to prepare if you watch the video a few times, read the allrecipe reviewers comments, and start with a quality tenderloin. We used a meat thermometer, cooked the Wellington on a rack in a pan, and did use the pate. The flavour was exceptional - the slices weren't the easiest to cut so I might let it stand a tad longer the next time, or make individual servings as others have suggested. From another site, a suggestion was made to put the uncooked but prepared Wellington in the fridge for a few hours, which we did - so the times given (needless to say) were off, but that's another reason why the meat thermometer was so helpful. A great recipe for a reunion dinner club - all the people in attendance raved!"

(I officially don't get what all of the intimidation is about). It was juicy and absolutely bursting with flavor! If you think this is bland, you must have left out some of the ingredients. \n\nI took the advice of others below and used two individual fillets (about 6-8 oz each). I then followed the steps above (pate is a must), but before wrapping in the pastry, I wrapped in prosciutto. I also added pastry hearts on top of each wellington for a special (corny) touch. I cooked on a rack and placed a sheet of vegetables below to cook at the same time (asparagus, red pepper, cubed red potato, and carrots). Finally: YOU MUST USE A MEAT THERMOMETER! Check EACH fillet throughout cooking because they may need different timing depending on thickness and position in the oven (mine did). Enjoy!!"

I saw a video that had Gordon Ramsey cooking beef wellington and he mentioned mushrooms hold a lot of water so instead of cooking off the liquid I just drained it. \n\nGreat, simple recipe!"

Everyone loved it...even said it was the best dish I had ever served,and I pride myself and never skimp on my cooking. Prepared as noted except the pate...didn't have it, but it didn't seem to make a difference with the like factor. My hubs wants to try it next time with the pate to compare. Thanks!"

The pate makes a huge difference don't skip it even if you have to buy it canned (which i did). The packets were so pretty before and after you cut into them. I was so proud of my presentation that I facebooked the pics :)"
