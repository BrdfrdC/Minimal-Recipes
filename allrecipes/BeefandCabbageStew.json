But if I had been able to add the cabbage, it might not have needed the sugar. I was really bummed about being out of cabbage. How can a Hungarian LIVE without a regular dose of cabbage (or sour cream for that matter. Four stars only because this was not a knockout dish - very good but just not 5 stars."

It was so flavorable and delish!!! I would also like to add that the time can be condensed a bit by putting the celery, potatoes and carrots in earlier so that the beef can tenderize at the same time that the celery, potatoes and carrots tenderize. There is no need to do each separately."

I had to add a little more liquid when I added the veggies. I liked that I could get the meat and onions in and cooking then take my time getting veggies prepped. Meat was tender and flavor was excellent. I was happy with the dish. It was as good or better the next day. Thank you for submission!"

For those of you who think it is wrong to rate when you've changed a recipe, I ask you - is this a contest with a grading system? Or, are we helping others with our tried and true changes -take em or leave them? Anyway-Used, 3 bouillon cubes with 2 cups of water in place of broth and bouillon, more than 2 potatoes, hands full of baby carrots, 15 oz can tomato sauce, a splash of Worcestershire sauce, can of cream of chicken soup, and sprinkled a packet of beef gravy powder on beef before browning. Also, added portabellas, ground, to the mix! Yummy stuff - thanks for sharing"
