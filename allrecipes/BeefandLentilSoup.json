We changed the chicken broth to beef broth (why chicken when you are cooking beef?) and added 2 cups more since the lentils absorb so much of the broth. 2. We also halved the lentils put in to make the soup more liquid and less lentil thick. 3. We added kale and red cabbage at the end to add some really nice crunch and texture to the soup."

A can of crushed tomatoes worked well since I was out of diced. I also used fresh cilantro and a splash of red wine in my bowl just because I had some. A good Balsamic vinegar would also be tasty. The parm on top was excellent. Leftovers for tomorrow! Yeah!"

"reviewBody": "Yummy! Omitted celery. I used a pound of dry lentils, only because when I measured out 2 cups it only left about 1/3 cup in the bag, and what am I going to do with 1/3 cup dry lentils? Used beef broth. Did not have oregano or cilantro; used thyme and marjoram instead. Next time will probably add more meat, less liquid, and serve more as a stew. Lentils were good, but the meat was outstanding. Will make beer bread next time - seems like this would be a great pairing."

I also used rehidrated onion as I forgot onion at the store and 1 T. fresh oregano, fresh parsley. 1 bay leaf. Made a double batch w/ large crushed tomatoes, I will only use one can next time. It made two pretty good sized pots. Next time I will use my 9qt. cast iron pan on low. Cooked for about 2 hours and could not keep the kids away from it. It freezes beautifully."

I do make a few alterations when I make this but I stick pretty close to the over all idea of the recipe (I use veggie broth vs. chicken, do not like cilantro or celery, use veggie meat instead of real). This recipe shows me that some of the real winners on this site do not necessarily have hundreds or thousands of reviews. This is a real hidden gem!"

"reviewBody": "I gave this 4 stars because it took about 12 hours on \"hi\" for my lentils to become tender. I actually had to scrap this for dinner that night because it wasn't done. (Next time I will follow another reviewer's suggestion to add the tomatoes later in the process.) I saved this in the fridge for another night and the leftovers were definitely 5 stars! This is the best lentil dish I've ever made. Next time, I will either cook it on the stove, so I have more control over the heat, or I will boil my stock and water before adding it so it doesn't take so long to start cooking the lentils. The smoky flavor of the kielbasa really blends with the spices and lentils to make a delicicous stew!"

I did not use the cilantro - only parsley. I only added 1 cup of lentils, which was plenty for the amount of stock that I added. In the end, it was more like a stew. I served it over ditalini pasta with crusty french bread on the side. Delicious!"

He and his 9 year old, \"I'll eat SOME veggies unless they're green\" brother both loved the smell as it cooked. I had my 11 year old \"try the soup\" to see if it was done and he LOVED it. I added more veggies including chopped fresh spinach and a can of beef chunks from Costco instead of the regular beef. I'm trying to eat more legumes and this will be on the top of my legume recipe list now! If the kids will eat it, it's all good!"
