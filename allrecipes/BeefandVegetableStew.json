I used regular beef broth vs low sodium, low fat. 1st time I did not have tomato paste so I used tomato sauce. 2nd time I used tomato paste and between the both I prefer the tomato sauce. I will make this again. I like it. Didn't really make any other change except to add additional seasoning to our taste as well as red and yellow bell pepper."

As one other reviewer suggested, I added 1/2 cup marsala at 45 minutes from the finish, and 1/4 cup Sherry toward the end. This would be a good recipe to make a day ahead as the flavors get better the next day."

I used a newly purchased induction burner since that came with a big stew pot. I had to do lots of research online to determine the correct temperatures to carry out the various steps in the recipe. I was surprised at how low the temps needed to be to do the job! The only change I made was omitting the rosemary sprig since I really don't like rosemary. It took some time and effort but was worth it! Will make again now that I have figured out the correct settings on my induction burner. Thank you so much for the recipe!"

I drop dumplings right onto the stew so they can soak in the flavors of the stew. The dumplings thicken up the stew a lot, so you won't need any thickener other than dumplings. You could also put some of the stew broth into a pot and cook them separately on the stove top. They cook faster in a pot than slow cooker.\n Enjoy your dinner!\n Roseann"

"reviewBody": "This was quite different than the stew I normally make - and I knew going in that it would be since the base was tomato paste. I definitely discovered that I prefer a more gravy-based stew, not the tomato, but that's a matter for my tastebuds, not the recipe. And this stew was actually quite good. The only real change I made was to add some fresh garlic - I can't quite conceive of a stew without it. And I did a mix of peas and corn (mostly because I only had a partial bag of peas left). But I followed the rest of the recipe rather closely. I used a large sprig of freshly picked rosemary and didn't find it overpowering at all. I did wind up adding some salt and pepper toward the end of the simmer time, but again, that's just my tastebuds, and my responsibility as the cook to adjust seasoning to taste."

"reviewBody": "I doubled the recipe, so I'd have leftovers to freeze for a quick dinner. I seasoned my beef stew meat with salt and pepper, before browning. The first thing I noticed there was no garlic, I can't cook without garlic, so I added about 1 Tbls. minced garlic with the onions. I always add tomato paste to my stew, but only about 2 Tbls., but I added 2-6 oz cans since I was doubling the recipe. When I added the beef back in, I realized this is normally where I add my seasoning/herbs, so I added salt, pepper, the rosemary, thyme and red pepper flakes here, rather than later. I added 3-cups of homemade beef stock and 1 cup red wine. The addition of the red wine just seemed a natural fit. Everything else I left alone. While it was good, it had too much tomato paste in it for me. The use of the red pepper flakes was interesting, but I'm not sure I'd use it again. While I like rosemary and thyme, the stew was predominately rosemary flavored. I'd cut back on the rosemary. I also needed to thicken the stew at the end with some beurre manie, to create a thicker gravy."

I kept all other ingredients the same, and seasoned the beef first and it came out great! \nI started with a roux to replace the tomato paste, and added some chopped tomato to keep the flavor in. I also added the potato and carrots in earlier to give them more time to cook. \nThis is great as a thinner broth for a more soup like feel, or a thicker broth to put over rice. Would make again~"

That's something coming from a 96 year old that thinks no one can cook anything better than his mother. The only changes I made was to use a handful of little red potatoes instead of regular potatoes and fresh green beans instead of peas. I put the green beans in at the same time as the potatoes which I cut in half. The herbs and seasonings were just fine. Just watch how big a sprig of rosemary you use, and if the bay leaves are small, throw in an extra."

I added about 1/4 cup of red wine, a couple shakes of garlic powder, and some black pepper, and it seemed a little thin after I added the potatoes and carrots, so I added 1 tbsp of four to thicken it. I'll definitely make it again."
