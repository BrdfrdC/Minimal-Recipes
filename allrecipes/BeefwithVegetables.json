Also, forgot to add ginger, which I wish I had remembered. \nDefinitely a repeat recipe."

Using fresh ingredients would certainly make a difference. Next time I will make it with fresh ingredients and add a bit more cornstarch as the mixture never really thickened; in spite of all that, it was good. Husband really liked it. Just wait 'til he tries it using the correct ingredients!"

(Heated slightly, removed from pan then added back after all the veggies so it didn't end up over cooked) I used Zucchini, onion and carrots. Very easy to make, felt like it was missing some extra spices and that spicy \" kick\" but can easily be added to suit your preferences. As written, it's a solid 4 stars."

"reviewBody": "We enjoyed this, but I improvised with the recipe, particularly in the technique. I used a sirloin steak that I sliced very thinly against the grain and on the diagonal when it was still in a semi-frozen state. Because it was so thinly sliced, it needed a very brief cooking time, just a minute or two on high heat. I removed it from the pan, then cooked the rest of the vegetables, little by little and being careful not to crowd the pan, on high heat and again, just a minute or so until they were crisp-tender. As I cooked each ingredient I dumped it in a “holding bowl.” When the meat and all the vegetables were cooked I returned it all back to the pan where I added the sauce ingredients, omitting the sugar and ginger, and enough broth to get it to the desired thickness. I like very little, if any, sauce with my stir fry, so the amount of it was just right for me – in fact, I didn’t even use all of the broth called for. Stir fry requires no simmering, so I returned it to the heat just long enough for the cornstarch mixture to thicken. Served over hot, cooked rice, this was so tasty, and just to our liking - without the sugar and ginger, and with nothing overcooked in order to retain each ingredient’s flavor and color. I’ll be “hitting the road” again, so this was an ideal and delicious way to make use of the baby bok choy, sweet onion, zucchini, mixed color bell peppers and mushrooms I had in the fridge."

I did not have any carrots, or ginger but did use bell pepper (red) and all the seasonings. I adjusted the seasoning for more flavor by adding more soy and oyster sauce. In the future I will add water chesnuts, maybe sprouts, multi color peppers and even tofu. A little extra cornstarch wouldn't hurt (the recipe calls for \"corn flour\" in step number 2). The title should be \"Asian Beef and Veggies\" maybe... Regardless, this was YUMMY. We served it over yellow rice (weird but it seemed to work well)."

I added some sweet chilli sauce, but it would also be nice with other ingredients. It was a decent base recipe."

"reviewBody": "The combination of flavors were good but it wasn't strong enough. I added my own veggies (broccoli, squash, zucchini and carrots) and increased the amount of sauce. I also had to increase the amount of soy sauce and oyster sauce to help the flavor. I also added 1/2-1 teaspoon of fish sauce to try and enhance the flavor as well as hot chili oil to add spice. In the end, there was more flavor, but I didn't completely find the combination to feature the oyster sauce. Would make again with some adjusting in sauce proportions."

"reviewBody": "I agree with Katherine. Flavor was a bit on the plain side for me, too much beef broth. If I make this recipe again, I will have to use less broth. the beef was overcooked and hardened by the time to finished the dish and the sauce never thickened. But it is a basic recipe and can be easily revised to desired liking."

"reviewBody": "I took the advice of the recipe submitter and used our vegetables of choice. I used broccoli instead of the carrots, mushrooms, and I used 3 different variety of bell instead of just the green. I gave this a 4 instead of 5 because I think the sauce really does need doubled to flavor your veggies and coat your rice some. I will make this again and next time I will try it over noodles. Thanks for a great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I don't think this recipe gets enough credit for what it is. It's basically like a beef and broccoli recipe. It has a really good flavor and is great with rice. I ALWAYS double the sauce paste because it thickens better. I would definitely use oyster sauce if you can find it because it adds another good dash of flavor to the sauce. I only use broccoli with this recipe because I don't really like fancy colorful veggies. It's also a good basic recipe and leaves lots of room for adding your own things. Doesn't take very long either so give it a try."

By the time I gave up and added more starch, the ingredients were all overcooked. If I use this recipe again, I'll definitely decrease the amount of beef broth that I use or increase the amount of starch from the start."

I used green pepper, yellow pepper, onion, mushrooms sliced, diagonal sliced carrots and celery. I left out the sugar since I don't like sweet sauces. I doubled the amount of ginger and garlic, (well, maybe I tripled it). I added a dash of dry sherry since I am allergic to oysters....and it turned out fantastic. Next time want to try broccoli instead of peppers. Maybe add bamboo shoots and water chestnuts too. Thank you for this recipe."

We didn't have any ginger and didn't use oyster sauce....we did use carrots, green onions (instead of regular onions), green beans, and green peppers for veggies. I made beef broth from the beef sachets and I did make too much (I had doubled the recipe but I don't think this needed doubled) but we served it on rice and the extra juice tasted excellent so I think I'd leave it doubled. We'll be eating this one frequently- all the kids loved it too! Excellent flavor and super easy!"

I'm glad I doubled the recipe. Will make again!"
