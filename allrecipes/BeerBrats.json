These suckers should be so juicy that they snap when you hit it and the fat drips down you chin. Don’t mess with boiling them, it just over cooks them. I would suggest just putting them straight onto the grill. Try on a lower heat first then sear them off on high heat. Yes it’s a pain because sometimes they don’t cool all the way but trust me it’s worth it to have to cut one open to check."

Dark beers are great for flavoring the brat, but will usually NOT make an edible au jus. Bun not required It’s completely devoured here, so I always have to double the recipe."

Even my daughter ate the sauerkraut! This is definitely a recipe I’ll use again!"

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe as is except that I had to use what I had on hand. First I used Swiss cheese stuffed German sausages. Also, I did not use the pepper flakes as spicy hot upsets our stomachs horribly. With that said, I prepared them per the instructions. I cooked the onions until pretty soft and glossy and most of the liquid was gone. I served the sausages on pretzel buns that I spread with a bit of grain mustard from France I happen to find at the kitchen store. It was delicious! Next time I get beef brats or any good German style pork or beef sausage I will make it this way again. Really, it is an easy recipe that is downright good. Also, make sure you get a really good beer. I used a Belgian wheat beer I found at the grocery store and it came out excellent. The recipe is open to experimentation with either the type of sausage or the type of beer. Will make this again definitely to go out of the beaten path of bbq sausages of any kind. BTW, don't get deterred if you don't have a BBQ, use your broiler for the final browning"

"reviewBody": "I've made this dish a few times and the alterations I've settled on are #1 flip the order, grill first until you get the preferred level of grill marks, then simmer in the mixture for like a half hour or longer to absorb the flavor. And #2 my family aren't big beer drinkers so we decided to swap it with Angry Orchard Hard Cider and the apple flavor works with the brat perfectly. If you want beer flavor pick a strong dark, but I prefer the apple myself."

"reviewBody": "As a transplanted Yooper...who's been making Brats like this for most of my life...I'll also put in a plug for Johnsonville...they are the best! Spent lots of time in Germany in the service, and never encountered a Brautwurst there that came close. As for the recipe, I like the touch of adding the garlic powder and crushed red pepper flakes. It added just the right amount of kick and flavor to make it interesting, but not too much mind you. We wouldn't want anyone to mistake our Brats for Italian Sausage would we. I'll be changing my football season traditions and incorporating this recipe into my routine. As for boiling out the flavor...as the guy said earlier, you don't boil them...just give them a nice warm bath in the beer, butter and onions (and now garlic powder, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper). In fact, I usually take mine out of the freezer and let them defrost in this wonderful bath. You want it hot, but not boiling."

"reviewBody": "Delicious! This is recipe is wonderful. The only modification I made was to use half of the red peppers because I wasn't sure if it would be too spicy with the full amount. It was perfect. I cut the onions in circular slices and then drained and sauteed them in butter while the brats were grilling to serve as a topping. We served the brats with sauerkraut, relish, the grilled onions, horseradish mustard, and pickled pepperoncinis slices. Mmmm! Will definitely make again. Easy to make for a summer dinner party, and tasty/impressive enough that it doesn't seem like a lazy meal (even though they are)."

"reviewBody": "Followed the recipe as instructed. No edits. In reviewing many of the other reviews, I noticed a distinct difference between the par-boil and grill only sides of the camp. I have to say that par-boiling them helped cook the brats through without overdoing it. I would probably over cook them if grilling only. The seasonings add a nice touch to the flavor. I served it with corn on the cob as another reviewer indicated and a salad and it was a very good meal. I found the “beer mixture” leftover not suitable as a side or topping, but have saved it for a cheese soup, which I think will be fantastic. Props to the recipe owner - this is sure a good recipe! Thanks."

Slight modification using 2 packages (total of 14 brats)...\n- used 6 bottles of Yuengling Black &amp; Tan beer (adds great flavor) and 1 cup water\n- poked slight holes in each brat before boiling (flavor of beer seeps inside brats)\n- after finished boiling, throw on grill on low heat to brown the brats\n- after removing from grill, put right back into the pot of beer...that way, the skin on brats don't start shriveling and drying up...keeps the brats nice and juicy!\nFamily and friends love these...always request to keep making them!!"

It's my go to for parties.\nOnly thing i do different is i slow cook the brats on indirect heat while the beer and onions cook. \nI cook out half of the beer/liquid or untill it becomes a bit thicker.\nThen i toss in the brats for another 15-20 mins or until most of the beer/liquid is gone and becomes more of a \"sauce\" \nThis dish wont last longer than 5 minutes at a bbq. \nI've been using this for 2 years.

This is also easier for serving over periods of time to a crowd. \n\nOn Wisconsin!"
