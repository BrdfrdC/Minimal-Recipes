I added fresh lime juice to add more lime flavor \nand replaced the water with sugar free Smirnoff Ice Zero sugar and I used Michelob light. So refreshing and enjoyable on a hot day!"

I really, really love a good one, and bad ones just tick me off. So when I read this recipe, with BEER in it, I expected to hate it. But a friend told me the really excellent Mexican place near her house puts beer in their margarita, so I had to try it. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 9oz tequila instead of 12. I ended up adding an extra splash, though, so probably closer to 10 oz. HOLY COW!!! 1000x better than expected! I immediately texted the recipe to everyone I know! This is my new fave. None of the heartburney effect of a normal Rita, and it tastes better than anything I have ever made at home. Hubby and I went through 2 pitchers (since the kids are at Grandpa's)!! Good times were had by all!"

The beer smoothed out the taste of the raw tequila we bought in Mexico, and the girls and guys loved it - still do! Just adjust the amount of water to your individual tastes. One can of water is a good starting point!"

I really wanted to try this recipe but only had the frozen orange juice concentrate on hand so I took a chance and made a half batch, squeezing in a bit of fresh lime juice. It might be a tad sweet because of the orange, but I will try it with the limeade next time. Thoroughly enjoying this one!"

"reviewBody": "Very simple take on beer margaritas (also termed coronitas) by using simple limeade as the flavor source. It is VERY strong with tequila. However, the amount of beer was actually very little (25%), whereas many of these recipes use more. I recommend adding replacing 6oz of the water with 6oz of more Corona. If you like it weaker, cut the tequila down to 9oz instead of 12oz. Will make again!"

Good-quality tequila is really essential since there are so few ingredients. We later had just a mix of beer and the limeade and found that it was much more well-balanced with the water and tequila added in. \n\nDefinitely a simple but delicious drink to sip on during the summer months."

Very fruity, and not beer-y at all!"
