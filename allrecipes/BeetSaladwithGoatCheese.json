My family thought the dressing was too heavy on the vinegar, so I changed the recipe to 1 cup orange juice concentrate and kept the oil &amp; vinegar quantities as shown. I also followed another reviewer’s suggestion and roasted the beets. I brought this salad to a celebration, and knowing everything heavy would fall to the bottom of the bowl, I deconstructed it and put the lettuce in a big bowl and arranged everything else, plus additional fruit, on a platter for guests to add to their individual salad."

It tasted like a creamsicle with a hint of vinegar.\n\nBoiling the beets for 30 minutes means you have to peel them manually with a peeler, since the skin doesn't come off easily. Notice the recipe doesn't mention how to get the skin off at all."

Using frozen orange juice concentrate adds a bright, sweet, yummy citrus edge &amp; makes my mouth water just thinking about it! Topping the salad off with toasted maple syrup walnuts is ridiculously good and adds a brilliant sweet crunch to the tangy mix. This is my new GO-TO beet salad!!! DELIGHTFUL!"

I prefer roasting the beets (400ºF for ~45 minutes depending on the size of the beets) I like the tip of leaving a bit of the green stalks on when roasting so you have something to hold onto. I might try pickling the beets next time to get a different 'zing'. Thanks for the recipe."

I added a very tiny clove of crushed garlic to the dressing. I put a bit of the dressing on the beets to marinate for an hour or 2. Then I lightly dressed the greens (rocket/lettuce mix), put the beets on, then the walnuts, then the crumbled feta (goat cheese makes me ill). It was very pretty and tasty as well."

Using a paper towel, rub the skins off the beets. (This can be done ahead if time) I like to reheat the beets a bit and serve warm in the salad as it melts the goat cheese."

"reviewBody": "This salad always goes over well at parties and potlucks. I repeatedly get asked to bring it again. For the dressing I prefer a 1:1:1 Ratio of oj concentrate/ balsamic vinegar/ oil. I always add plain cooked quinoa, it really adds to the salad. If I have time I also marinate the beets in balsamic vinegar. \nArugula is amazing with quinoa in salads, I usually use half arugula and half mixed greens. \nI use the Candied Pecans recipe by Alix on AR for the nuts, it is the most addictive incredible recipe for candied nuts and goes well with this salad. I found the walnuts/maple syrup in this recipe too moist/ soft and missing the crunch I love in candied nuts.\nWhen putting it together, just before serving, do it in this order for the best visual presentation:\nToss greens in dressing, put in bowl\nTop with quinoa, then beets then feta then candied nuts. The white/ red contrast is beautiful, at least until it get mixed up and the whole salad becomes pink!"
