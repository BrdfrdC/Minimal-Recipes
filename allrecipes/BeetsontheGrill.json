Flipped the foil-wrapped beets a few times to ensure even cooking. I loved them, daughter liked, husband hated, baby somewhere in b/t, but I think alot of it is just vegetable preference; beets are just beet-y, no matter how you prepare them, but I found this way to be fun, easy, and efficient enough, since I was already running the grill."

I actually had some fancy-schmancy blood-orange infused olive oil a friend had given me, so I sliced the beets in thin circles (and I also sliced a yam to go with it). I placed the beets in a Ziplock and drizzled some of that oil into it, and shook some coarse into it too -- shook it up, and then placed in a foil pouch for the grill. I did the same to the yam, but kept it separate, assuming it would need less time on the grill. The yam was done in 20, the beets in 30. Once off the grill, we combined them together on everyone's plate. To-die for!!"
