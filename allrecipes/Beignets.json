These are nothing like cafe du monde, the consistency is completely different. The dough is bland, and I even added a good amount of vanilla. These don’t hollow out like cafe du monde beignets, they flake up like you’re frying biscuits. If you’re looking for something comparable to what you get in the French Quarter, skip this recipe."

Try to make the beignets within 24 hrs of mixing ingredients and letting it sit in fridge 2. Test the oil with a very small piece of dough. It should puff up nicely. If not wait for the oil to get hotter. 3. Make sure the dough is rolled out very thin. If you don’t know how to eyeball 1/8 thin, think of a pop tart thickness 4. Add 2 teaspoons of vanilla to the mixture 5. Add cinnamon to the powdered sugar to top off 6. Enjoy!"

The main problem I had was the batter didn't seem very consistent, with Lumps of flour in it; this ended up being fixed when rolling the dough out. One thing I'd do differently is let the dough rise out of the fridge because for the first time round in the fridge, the dough did not rise at all, leaving the beignets a bit flat. I'd also sift the flour. Tastes really good though."

The remaining dough sat untouched in the fridge for at least 4 days. I used the rest of the dough using as little extra flour as possible to roll out for cinnamon rolls. I read in a cinnamon roll recipe to add about half of a cup of heavy cream over the cinnamon rolls before baking. They were so good!!!! I made a simple powdered sugar icing for the top. Baked at 400 for maybe 14 minutes. I did add vanilla and extra sugar to the original dough ."

Here’s what I learned-1- ADD VANILLA!!!2- Dough was really sticky so I added an extra cup of flour. It helped but I ultimately add more flour again anyways as I roll it out using a floured surface. Don’t be afraid to add more flour. 3-You can make day of. I made the dough and let sit on counter while oil heated up. 4- I fried in my Instant Pot. Let oil heat up on high sauté mode. I used a thermometer but it didn’t get up to 360. So I used the water test instead. (flick a drop of water in the oil and if it pops, the oil is ready)5- shake in a paper lunch bag with powdered sugar. 6- it makes A LOT of dough. I plan to make cinnamon rolls as other reviewers mentioned. They also said it’s good on the Fridge for a week so I plan to take my time."

"reviewBody": "As far as ingredients I followed this recipe to a tee (somewhat, LOL!). I even bought a thermometer to assure the correct hot water temperature for the yeast and oil for frying. \nModifications: I felt a little weird about adding the sugar, milk and egg mixture directly into the yeast so I first mixed those ingredients and set aside. Then I followed the directions to prepare the yeast. That's it! from that point I continued with the directions as instructed. Oh, before I forget, I also added 2-3 tsp of vanilla and allowed yeast to rise in the refrigerator for 24 hours (patience is key;-). Having recently visited New Orleans I had the privilege to visit both Cafe Du Monde and Morning Call (which was my favorite), I have to say, these homemade beignets were as crispy, light and airy as any that I've had over the years in New Orleans. The family loved them! They also freeze very well. Cut them up prior to freezing, flour wax paper and layer. Take them out of the freezer an hour before frying and you're good to go. From reading the varied reviews I think patience, adding vanilla or the flavoring of your choice can make the difference. The ultimate complement came from my mother in-law when after having my beignets she ordered beignets at a local establishment which served a New Orleans menu, she told me mine were much better!"

(You can store the dough in the fridge for a couple of days if you don't want to make all of them at once. It only gets better.) We added some vanilla sugar we had in the house (made with real vanilla beans) to the confectioner's sugar dusting, and it just gave the beignets an ever so sophisticated fragrance and taste."

I did add some vanilla extract to my batter. Delicious!!! I've made these so many times now and they NEVER fail to deliver. You can use powdered sugar, brown sugar or vanilla sugar to coat them. Hubby loves them with brown sugar. Delish!"

"reviewBody": "My mom, an avid baker, was always whipping up a variety of yeast-based breads while I was growing up. There is almost nothing more heartwarming than the smell! Naturally, I wanted to replicate that delicious yumminess as an adult, but I always failed to make an airy and delicious bread. I've always blamed it on the fact that I don't have a mixer or bread machine to do all the work for me, so I have do the mixing and kneading by hand. This recipe is the first recipe that allowed for that and turned out beautifully. I will say that I deviated slightly from the recipe (although I don't imagine by much--I just didn't measure it) as I put in the whole packet of yeast. I let the dough refrigerate for 24 hours before punching it down and letting it rise for another hour in the fridge before frying up those puppies--perfection! As many other reviewers noted, this recipe makes A TON of dough, so I too tried a few different ideas mentioned by previous reviewers. For baking the other tasty bites, I pulled a piece of the dough and let it sit on the floured counter, covered, for about 10 min before working it into whatever new iteration is would be fore the day. On day 3 I made cinnamon rolls with oven at 375 for 20 min (or about when I started to smell the amazing aroma wafting from my kitchen). Then day 4 were the meat pies--this time setting the oven at 350 and baked for about 20. NOTES: For everything I baked, I did make sure to roll the dough quite thinly because it rises and fluffs"

This recipe made a TON, so I plan on keeping half of the dough in the fridge hopefully until next weekend. \n\nI did make some substitutions...instant yeast (which is all I had)- 1.5t. I did not have evaporated milk so I used the substitution of 3/4c whole milk and 1/4c half and half. I subbed butter for shortening, added a splash of vanilla, and a little bit more flour than called for-maybe 2-4T more, just to make the dough more workable. \n\nSince this was my first time to make them, the sizes of mine were very irregular but they turned out great! I did coat with powdered sugar in a paper bag, which made for much less mess. These were great!"

For uniformity I would suggest using a cookie or any mold cutter. Even in the fridge it will still proof, leave it for at least 4 hours. I used lard instead of shortening as its healthier. Will use this recipe for all events and will try making chelsea or cinnamon rolls with this dough as suggested by some reviewers.\nThank you for this recipe which is a definite keeper and its goes well with coffee or tea."

My coworkers loved it and my former roommate, who's from Ivory Coast, loved it too.\n\nThey didn't taste bland when I made them, but that's probably because I accidentally added the powder sugar to the dough mix in addition to the regular sugar. After the beignets cooled off I drizzled them in honey and added sliced strawberries to the side."

Great breakfast rolls.\nI've also made a cinnamon raisin brown sugar loaf of of bread. I rolled out the 14x9 rectangle (1/4 to 1/2 inch thick)put butter on it and spread the topping. I roll up this up and place it seam side down in buttered bread pans...wow!!\nUpdate: I made another batch of dough this afternoon and rolled it out, cut them into beignet shape. I got out a paper plate and some parchment paper. I made a few layers of diamonds with parchment paper between each layer. I put a plate on top (upside down )secured them with a couple of rubber bands for freezing. Now I can cook up as few as I want each morning and they'll last about a month.\n\nPaul"

The pastry is light, slightly crunchy and a wonderful texture, but I did think a little vanilla as others suggested would have given it the flavor I was looking for. Overall a great recipe. In my opinion it just needed a slight bit more sweetness other than the powdered sugar. Also, it makes a ton of dough. I am going to try making the cinnamon rolls tomorrow as another reviewer suggested, or maybe some funnel cakes for later tonight?"
