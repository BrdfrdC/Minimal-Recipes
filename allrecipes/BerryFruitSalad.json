"reviewBody": "This is almost one of those 'non-recipe recipes' that everybody should have in their kitchen arsenal--where simple, straightforward ingredients come together to make a fantastic dish. I love the simplicity of this; and that it really is all about the berries. You can adjust the sugar amount depending on how sweet your berries are, and you can also use any berries you may have on hand. If you let the berries sit in the fridge for 30 minutes before serving, they'll be even better--as it allows them to release their juices a bit. You can also eat this with anything: serve with yogurt or whipped cream; add to your morning oatmeal; dollop some on a slice of pound cake; or just sit there and try to not eat the whole bowl in one sitting (like me). Thank you so much for sharing your recipe--this is wonderful!"

I love the mint flavor with the berries but my husband prefers his unadulterated. It's easy enough to fix both ways."

"reviewBody": "Wonderful, fresh berries are in all the markets this time of year, so of course, I had to buy them all! I found this recipe as a way to use them all in one recipe. I didn’t use the sugar in this, but instead I lightly dressed the berries with some leftover dressing I’d made for my Orzo and Wild Rice Salad. I also added some fresh pineapple that I had and liked the color contrast it provided. I served this on some bright, beautiful baby lettuce from Hubs’ garden. So, if you’ve got berries, this is a good and simple way to use them!"

You really can't screw it up no matter what you do and if I had a nickel for everytime I made this I'd be rich beyond my wildest dreams! It's great all by itself, mixed with yogurt, added to cereal, or on top of your favorite pound cake!"
