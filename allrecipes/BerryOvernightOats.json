When I bring it to work and put it in the fridge, my co workers are always admiring how pretty and delicious it it looks and a few have jumped on the band wagon. I substituted frozen organic berries for the fresh fruit and just 1/4 cup coconut milk instead of the 1/2 milk it calls for in the recipe."

I put the oats in one of my soup cups with a handle and eat on my 45 minute commute to work. \nIf you're going to microwave it, add a splash (maybe 2 tbsp worth) of milk after refrigerating overnight and before putting it in the microwave or else you will dry out the oats.\nI also add 1 Tbsp of the powder PB fit for flavor."
