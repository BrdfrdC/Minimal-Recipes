"reviewBody": "Tried this after seeing the recipe in the Aug/Sep 2019 AllRecipes magazine with the \"hidden gem\" tag. The recipe printed there was slightly different and I've typed it below:\n\n1.5 cups sweet red wine, Zinfandel, or red blend\n1.5 - 2 cups ice cubes\n1 orange, juiced (about 1/3 cup)\n1/3 cup frozen blueberries\n1/3 cup frozen raspberries\n1/3 cup frozen strawberries\n1/4 cup orange liqueur\n2 Tbsp sugar, or more to taste\nFresh berries (optional)\n\nFollowed the magazine recipe exactly using Rosatello Rose wine. Used a bit more ice until the right slushy consistency. This was so light and refreshing and looked so pretty. Definitely will make this again and I see this being a summertime tradition. This is one of those recipes that can be easily adapted to what you have on hand."

"reviewBody": "Simply put, this was DELICIOUS! Cool, refreshing, dare I say, somewhat healthy? I made this in advance, stirring about every 12 hours. I put the container in the fridge, about an hour prior to serving, and I think I should have put it on the counter. When I ran it through the blender, it had the consistency of a smoothie, and we had to have spoons, lol! It needed a bit more thaw time than I gave it. I used a cup of sugar in a quadrupled recipe, and I moistened the glasses with an orange slice and rimmed the glasses with sparkling sugar. Very festive, and everyone enjoyed this cool concoction on a very hot summer evening. Thanks for the recipe!"

Putting it in the freezer made it very slushy, which was perfect. I will make this again. Such a refreshing recipe"

Maybe one day I'll actually make a recipe as specified, but in the meantime, this one was a good guideline to a pleasant drink."
