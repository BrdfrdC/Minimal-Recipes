I let them sit in the colander for 45 minutes, dried them in paper towel, and baked as directed except I used parchment paper instead of foil. I used too much olive oil, but that was my fault not the recipe! They baked at 425 for 20 minutes, I had to turn up the oven to 450 to finish them in another 20 minutes. It was worth the effort on a weekend, but doubt I would do it on a weeknight!"

"reviewBody": "Made these last night. Would strongly suggest to either mix the potatoes with olive oil in a bowl vs a bag and take out with tongs before putting on baking sheet. Way too much oil and the potatoes had no “crispness” to them as a result. I would have had to keep them on broil for quite some time to get near that.result - but that would also mean opening up the oven every few minutes to make sure they don’t get torched. Bottom line, ditch the bag and pouring entire contents on baking sheet unless you like soggy fries."

Instead of 6 potatoes, I used 2 Russets (800 grams). I left the spice amounts the same, but reduced the amount of oil (20 grams). The fries were perfectly salty, garlic-y, and peppery from 1 teaspoon of each. My partner and I alternated between dipping in Ketchup and Ranch, and could not decide which was more delicious. This is a keeper of a recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I was skeptical to try this because I was concerned the potatoes would turn out sweet-tasting from the sugar sprinkles. But a good rub down of the potatoes to remove it and to dry the wedges proved to be successful. No sweet aftertaste!\n\nThe texture of the potatoes were great. A perfect combo of a bit crispy on the outside and soft and cooked-through on the inside. The seasoning was also great. Next time, I will use a little ground rosemary, I think. This one's a keeper!"

I leave open the possibility of modifying my rating to five stars if when I prepare it again, the extra garlic powder elevates it."
