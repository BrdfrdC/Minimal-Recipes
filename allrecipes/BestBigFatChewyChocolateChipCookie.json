I find the batter is easier to work with if refrigerated for an hour, but the cold batter will add 60 - 90 seconds of bake time. I use a slightly rounded ice cream scoop to measure out and get 23 - 24 cookies, 8 to a pan."

I did make some additions as follows: I added 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla beans, along with the vanilla extract; I added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, which adds even extra chewiness to the cookie; I refrigerated the dough for over four hours before baking (can be refrigerated even 24 hours before baking); I used a 1 tablespoon cookie scoop. The cookies were huge; chock-full of chocolate chips; crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. Simply the best."

It adds a caramely richness that elevates them even further."

I'd like to know what changed, because I loved how they came out before. Now when I'm done mixing in the dry ingredients, it doesn't have the thick consistency of cookie dough. I've had to chill the dough before baking. (Image is of cookies baked in 2020, the cookies now are coming out a lot flatter)."

It turned out wonderful despite the fact that I only used one jumbo egg rather than one egg and one yolk. Because of the extent to which and the speed with which the batter melted, I was pretty worried after the oven had been on for a few minutes, but in the end, everything turned out perfectly great. Due to the fact that they spread so much during baking, it is highly recommended to scoop them using a 1/4 cup and to only put six on each baking sheet."

Due to the large size of the cookies, it takes little time to put them on a cookie sheet and set the timer! The recipe uses readily available ingredients, takes a few minutes to put together, and the result is AMAZING - a big, soft, delicious cookie from beginning to end! I like substituting milk chocolate chips in this recipe, but like them with either kind of chocolate."

To make I subbed gluten free all purpose flour for regular with no issues other than baking a couple extra minutes. I did chill the dough in the fridge between batches. The resulting cookie was a perfect chocolate chip cookie that my family enjoyed and is definitely something i'd make again if I needed cookies and was short on time."

He'd help me make these again if I'd cook them. Once they were cooked, over half were gone the first night (and only 3 of us ate more than 1!) I used the exact measurements listed and managed to make 28 cookies. I thought I measured correctly but maybe it was slightly off. It did not affect them at all, it gave us more to eat! They have a delicious, crunchy other texture and are very creamy inside with all the chocolate. Excellent recipe!"

I loved the fact that you get to use melted butter instead of room temperature butter, sometimes you don‚Äôt get the time to plan for baking specially if you are trying to keep your children entertained. I followed the recipe to the tick, left the cookies in the oven for 19 minutes and they came out beautifully, chunky and chewy. I got 12 cookies out in total. We enjoyed them with a nice, cold glass of milk. This recipe is a keeper by all means and my daughter who is going to college next year asked me for the recipe so she can make them while she‚Äôs away."

I made the dough 1 day and baked them the next. I left the dough out to soften for 30 minutes. I used a melon baller to scoop the dough out and they came out all the same size. I baked them for 16 minutes and left them on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before removing them. They cooked up nice and plump and didn‚Äôt spread out, just a perfectly round cookie. I quadrupled the recipe and put balls of the cookie dough in the freezer for future use. I gave a gallon size of cookie dough balls plus a gallon of baked cookies to my best friend. I put my baked cookies in a freezer bag and they were still soft after a week. This recipe beats the original Toll House recipe hands down!!!"
