The one time I \"baked in a preheated oven for 1 hour\" (step 4), everything burnt to a crisp, so I only do 20 minutes. I also use 2 Tbsp chutney, 1 Tbsp curry, and 2 eggs. When pouring on the milk, I make sure it measures 1 1/2 cups. With these tweaks, I find it's a very tasty dish that I appreciate."

I also doubled the curry powder and the chutney, but that's obviously just taste preference. My chutney wasn't a spicy one, just a regular Mrs Balls chutney and the curry powder I used was a Cape Malay curry powder, which I think really made it taste authentic. So if you can find that in the shop or find a recipe for a spice blend online I think it would definitely add to it"

There was no custard top as when I poured the milk/egg mixture on top it all sunk in around the chunks of browned meat. The baking time was too long as everything was over done. I am going to make it more like a meatloaf with raw burger mixed with the spices and after that has firmed up, making the custard on the top and reduce the baking time."

Baking times were reduced to 25 mins for the first step and 20 mins with the topping. Delicious. I thank the previous reviewers who said the recipe dish size was too large and cooking time too long. Even with my modification it was quite shallow, but the moisture was perfect."

"reviewBody": "After trying Bobotie for the first time during a recent trip to Cape Town, SA, I just had to try making it once I got back home. This is a very good recipe, but I did incorporate some of the recommendations of other reviewers. I couldn't find apricot chutney, so I used 1 tbsp + 1 tsp of apricot jam, and it worked fine. The recipe doesn't say to drain the excess fat after cooking the beef, but I did. When you put the beef mixture into the casserole dish, pack it down, so that most of the the egg mixture will remain on the top of the Bobotie. After you've squeezed the milk out of the 2 slices of bread, break them up into small pieces, so they get evenly distributed throughout the mixture. I used a 2-qt casserole dish instead of a 3-qt, and I also used 2 eggs instead of just one. Also, I reduced the initial baking time from 1 hour to 30 minutes, and after adding the egg mixture to the top, I let it bake for a full 30 minutes to ensure that the egg was completely cooked and had even started to brown a little. I served this with 3 side dishes of sliced banana, a raisin sauce (also from this site, made earlier in the day and allowed to chill), and a simple tomato/cucumber/onion/chives/lime juice salsa, the same way it was served to me in SA. I also made an African Yellow Rice (also from this site), as a fourth side dish. Topped all this off with a chilled bottle of white SA wine, and got the thumbs-up from my wife and daughter."

I almost always substitute ground turkey for ground beef, and in this case I used a whole two pounds of the turkey. The only other difference was that I reduced the cooking time. I just baked mine right in a cast-iron skillet for about 45 minutes before adding the egg and then cooking it for another 25 minutes. This turned out just right, and if I had cooked it much longer, it probably would have burned. This really is an excellent recipe! I am happy that I stumbled upon it and we will definitely be having this again!!"

"reviewBody": "The only change I made to this recipe was to subsitute an extra 1 tsp of chutney to replace the teaspoon of apricot jam since I didn't have any. The flavor was very good but it was too dry and almost burnt from baking for so long. When I make it again I'll use a 2 quart casserole instead of a 3 quart. I'll also shorten the baking time from 1 hour to 1/2 an hour before adding the egg mixture and then continue to bake for only 15-20 minutes after adding the egg mixture. I'd also add another egg to the milk to make it thicker. This really does have great flavor and I definitely recommend it with the above changes.\n***Update: I made this recipe again with the changes I suggested. We all loved it! The bobotie was moist and delicious. I've passed the recipe along to family who also love it. I'd give it the recipe five stars with the changes."

"reviewBody": "Oh my goodness. I would NEVER have thought of putting an egg custard on top of this dish. I have also never eaten minced beef quite as sweet as this. I didn't have any chutney or jam, but used peach jelly as a substitute for both, and it turned out awesome. I surprised my wife with this recipe, as she works longer hours than me. She loved it, as did the kids. I served it with roast potatoes and minted peas, and now have my extended family hooked on it too. I am now going to try other South African recipes because this one was a real surprise."
