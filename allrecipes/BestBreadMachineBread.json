I do not like the cube shape my bread machine bakes, so I mix the dough in the bread machine, but finish in bread pan in the oven 350¬∞ for ~30 minutes. I have let it rise in the bread machine and let it rise in a low temp oven. Results are about the same."

The loaf turned out awful. Tried loaf #2 following another recipe I found online. Again it was awful. Couldn't decide if it was the machine and so I made a 3rd loaf using this recipe. It came out perfect! It came out actually as I was hoping. So happy it turned out that the bread machine worked just like it was supposed to. I have made several more loafs and they have also been perfect. With the cost of bread these days it has made sense to make my own. Thanks for such a fantastic recipe!!"

The first time I made it, I used the regular Bake setting on my machine, which includes 30 minutes of rest time before kneading. Although the inside of the loaf was light &amp; fluffy, the crust was super thick. After reading through the comments &amp; learning about the difference between dry active yeast &amp; instant/bread machine yeast, the second time I used the Rapid Bake setting on my machine, which doesn't have a rest time before kneading, &amp; the loaf was wonderful! A perfect crust that was golden but not crunchy, &amp; a light, fluffy middle. This toasts up so much better than store bought bread, I'll probably be baking two loaves a week. Next time I'm going to add onion powder &amp; caramelized onions to the mix like another reviewer suggested. Oh my."

"reviewBody": "The recipe seems like a good starting point, but I've found that I needed to reduce the amount of yeast to 1-1/2 ts to make it work. If I go with the amount stated the loaf rises and then falls. It might be due to my method of flour measurement. Previously I was using a 1 cup measure and just scooping the flour out of the bag, but that made the loaf way too dense. Now I put 3 cups of flour into a bowl aerate it with a fork and spoon it into the measuring cup. Not sure if that's the right way but it seems to work reasonably well."

I replaced the oil with olive oil, used slightly more salt as others advised, and used active dry yeast, but other than that this recipe needed nothing. I cooked it on 1lb setting on my machine with light crust and it turned out perfect first try! It is a somewhat plain tasting bread but it's white bread so no complaints."

"reviewBody": "After 7 other recipes, THIS is the best. For white bread, I added the 1/2 t. salt recommended in the comments, taste was excellent. Next, I followed Crystal S. recipe for wheat and it was the best I have ever made. The texture, rise, crust and taste was better than store-bought. The wheat recipe makes a 2 lb loaf so I am going to divide it into two 1 lb loaves next time. I like to cook my bread in the oven. After the bread machine dough setting completes (mine takes 90 minutes), gently remove dough from the pan to lightly floured area. Let it rest for 5 minutes. Gently shape into loaf and place in greased pan, turning once to grease the top and with the seam side down. Then \"proof\" it or let it rise the second time in an oven (heated to 200 but then turned off). Place the bread pan on top of a wet dish towel in middle rack with room to rise to double (mine took 25 minutes). The low heat and humidity are perfect. Remove pan and dish towel. Heat oven to 400 with an empty roasting pan on the bottom rack. When Temp is ready, turn it down to 350 and pour 1 cup room temperature water into the pan. Place you bread pan on center rack above roaster. These are all methods learned from my great grandmother. If you are going to make much bread, invest in a cloth bread sheet which you flour and keep in the fridge. You will never go back to the counter or slippery plastic sheets. Also but a good metal bread pan. Mine has a cutting board for the lid but keeps bread perfectly with no wrappers or muss."

"reviewBody": "I like this recipe because it follows the principles of traditional breadmaking: proof the yeast and then add the other ingredients. Other bread machine recipes said to add the yeast last. I ended up with loaves as dense as a brick. My first two batches rose VERY close to the top of my bread machine so I've had to back off on the yeast just a smidge. I went from 1 1/2 t to 1 1/4 t. I used a high quality olive oil for my oil, fresh bread machine yeast, and King Arthurs bread flour. This recipe works consistently in my 1990s Oster bread machine. It produces a tall loaf with a crisp/flaky crust. The center is fluffy and cake like. No holes. I find it nice for toast or big sandwiches."

I tried making just dough and then baking in the oven and also letting it go the full cycle in the machine, but the bread was coming out really tough and under-baked.

I could not tell it had ever been used. It has a view window in the top which is nice. This recipe worked marvelously first time out. I used it because there is no Krusteze bread machine flour available anywhere in our area anymore. Thank you pandemic. I bought bread flour which is also in short supply. The only change I made was to chip up some cold butter (salted) and drop it into the mix. These days of shortages, I think my bread machine will more than pay for itself."

I had no problems with the dough over proofing so if you generally don't have that issue I would leave salt at 1 teaspoon, I ate the bread with salted butter so I don't want it too salty. Tried the recipe twice with success, definitely try with less sugar if you usually eat European style bread"
