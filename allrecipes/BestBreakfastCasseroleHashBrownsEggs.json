I made the egg mixture then mixed the sausage and cheese into it, then put the whole mixture over the hash browns and lightly pressed it down. I increased temperature to 400 degrees. I don't care for layers of cheese, so mixing it all together made it perfect. It was a nice change from the bread cube-egg casserole I usually make."

I added the extra eggs since it looked like the liquid level should be a little higher, but could also depend on how deep your pan is. I used a 9 x 13 pan. I covered it and baked it as instructed I also added some shredded cheese on top at the end and it came out wonderfully. I recommend this recipe and I will definitely make it again as my family loved It."

I flattened it down and baked at 400¬∞ for about 15-20 min. Cooled it for a few minutes and then proceeded with mixing 8 eggs, 3/4 cup milk, the called for spices, and an eyeballed amount of real maple syrup. Next time I'd also add about 1 tsp dry mustard powder and maybe a few drops of hot sauce. I was short on cheese, so next time I'll load it up, likely for more than the recipe states. Served for dinner with a drizzle of real maple syrup, this was total comfort food on a snowy evening. Can't wait for the breakfast leftovers!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe is great as written and very versatile! My favorite way to make it is with cubed frozen hash browns. Fry an onion first, remove half from the pan, add in potatoes and cook a bit with the onion. I add the same spices to the potatoes (and then again to the eggs as instructed). Fry the sausage or bacon (either are good) and add the remaining onion to that mixture as the instructions state. I think adding extra spices to the potatoes and frying a bit in the pan before placing into your dish makes a big difference on flavor. I've even put the pan of potatoes in the oven for ten minutes while cooking the sausage or bacon. FYI... I use about two cups of shredded cheese (prefer my measurements other than cups ;), and layered as stated! Great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Overall, this recipe is super easy to make and tastes good but a little bland for me. But, my kids liked it a lot. The bland part comes from the hash browns. But in combination with the salty sausage it works. I liked mine with salsa! I also did not thaw the hash browns. I shook the bag of frozen hash browns to make sure all the frozen chunks were separated. I placed them in a 9x13 pan then cooked the sausage and got everything else ready. By that time the hash browns were pretty much thawed."
