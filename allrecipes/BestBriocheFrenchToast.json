Don’t skip the toasting or drying out of the bread, I think that’s the key to a nice crunch on the outside."

I did check around and found another recipe calling for ¼ cup milk (not 1.5 cups milk) for 4 not 6 slices, 3 (not 4) eggs (which is basically the same) and twice the vanilla for 1/3 fewer slices of bread. And no nutmeg. But I think the issue was way too much milk. I loved the idea of baking but either I didn’t cook long enough on the stovetop first or it was just too wet a mixture due to the milk."

Soaked each piece and set on electric skillet set to 325 for 4 minutes each side. Transferred to pan and cooked 9 minutes. Puffed up beautifully. Taste is very “eggy”. I put it back in the oven for 4 more minutes thinking it was underdone. Still tastes “eggy”. It possibly could have soaked in the mixture too long or something but it was not (in my humble opinion) outstanding. Thank you for posting the recipe though."

This was the perfect amount of custard for 6 - 1\" slices of Brioche. I sliced the bread &amp; left it out overnight &amp; also made the custard the night before &amp; put it in the fridge so the flavors could meld together - the flavor was outstanding!\nWhat a wonderful recipe! We almost always choose pancakes or Belgium waffles for our once a month indulgent breakfast, but saw this recipe &amp; decided to give it a try. My husband, who is not a French Toast guy thought this was \"wonderful &amp; spectacular\"! \nThe browned butter was such a great layer of flavor which perfectly complimented the sweetness of the syrup. We will be making this in 2 weeks for visiting family. As to the bread puffing up, some did, some did not - who cares! All was absolutely delicious!"

"reviewBody": "Using brioche bread is key! I use the base of this recipe, and I alter the ingredients some. I use 3 eggs and 1 cup of milk while still using 1 teaspoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I can make 12 pieces of French with that combination, with little mixture to waste. I also add cinnamon. After each piece of brioche bread has been dipped on each side, I add more cinnamon and nutmeg to the mixture. Otherwise, the flavors are gone before you finished dipping all of the bread. I don’t do the warm butter at the end. I tell each person to put butter on their own toast and melt it in the microwave if desired. This makes it easier to save leftovers. My family loves when I make French Toast. It’s always a big hit!"

I was leary about there being no cinnamon, but omg this French toast was comforting, with a hint of sweet... just what I was hoping for. I only used a half tbsp butter in my nonstick pan and there was a little leftover so I could have a drizzle of brown butter. Perfect treat while on my diet. Weirdly, my brain was tasting bacon even though I made none. Must’ve been like tastebud memory or something. This French toast would be off the chain served with bacon for sure!!!"

"reviewBody": "Not sure what happened. Used brioche bread sliced about 3/4” thick. Followed the recipe and cooked in pan 2 mins one side and 3 the other. Baked for nine minutes. Still raw inside. Baked another eight minutes and still raw inside to the point “eggs” were squishing out as I pressed it with my fork. The flavor was decent even though I missed the cinnamon. Maybe my bread was too thick but I didn’t have time to bake for an hour to get it cooked when everyone was expecting to eat in 20 minutes. Very disappointing and a waste of good brioche. Breakfast was a banana this morning."

"reviewBody": "Absolutely the best French toast recipe ever!!! Easy and delicious. I also used a dash of cinnamon in my egg mixture, it adds more flavor. Also, don’t skip the browned butter, it literally makes this recipe! (Watch your butter so it doesn’t burn, when the whey on the bottom of the pan is golden brown, take it off the burner and immediately pour it into a bowl, doing this stops the cooking. Mixed with the syrup, it’s out of this world!!!"

"reviewBody": "Have to add to the rave reviews. I made this this morning in my family told me to throw away all my other recipes for French toast. The brioche that I had was very moist so I put it on a cookie sheet and dried it in the oven for about five minutes on each side 170°. I probably could’ve done this a little longer. We did six slices of Brioche and had about half of the mixture left over so next time will cut that in half. I also did not have nut Meg on hand as we were traveling so I use cinnamon instead. My French toast also did not perfect but it didn’t make a difference to us. The brown better with the syrup combination was over-the-top. Thank you so much for posting a wonderful recipe that my family will enjoy for years to come."
