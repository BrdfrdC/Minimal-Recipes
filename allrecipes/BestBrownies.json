Fingers crossed that I cooked it long enough. Seems done with pulling away from the sides AND the fact that I put a cake thermometer in it. The frosting was too chunky and balled up... So, I added one more TBSP of butter (melted this time) and 1 TBSP of milk. Turned out still thick so I added maybe another 1/2 TBSP of milk and it turned out perfectly thin enough to spread! Score! Frosting is fabulous now!"

I also used to put a dollop of nutella in the batter as well, just to be a lil wild. I don't bother making the frosting because it never seemed necessary. Also not a fan of frosting in general. Be sure to add powdered sugar to the top of these bad boys once they're out - they're superb!"

Tip: when making the frosting, pop the butter in the microwave for 15 seconds, so it's borderline melting, but not quite. That way, the frosting will actually blend together and will be easier to spread."

They are PERFECT either with or without the frosting, so I normally don‚Äôt bother with it. The only modification I use for the recipe is I brown the butter before making the batter. It takes the flavor to a whole new level! Thank you Angie for this recipe which has become a beloved family favorite!"

We used to triple the recipe but use less cocoa powder, and never frosted them. If you want a chewier brownie then cook the batter in a larger pan. Another thing we used to do is add a handful of oats to make the brownie chewier."
