One thing I do want to say is that, while recipes should be able to be rated based on their ability to stand alone, their adaptability to other ingredients and cooking methods makes a recipe all the more attractive to me. If you don't want to take suggestions to heart, fine. I don't think people who write in with ideas mean to say that you HAVE to do things their way. I appreciate those suggestions, but some are pretty 'out there' and I just by-pass those. Rather than get angry about them, I like the fact that people are expressing ways to modify the recipes."

"reviewBody": "The most important for the great bruschetta taste is the freshness of the ingredients. Tomatoes have to be tasty, Use the ones from own garden, farmer's market or during the winter months Campari tomatoes (can get them at Costco or Sam's club and some grocery stores). Basil is better fresh, finely chopped; garlic minced, better than crushed. Mix together, add GOOD tasting EVOO. I let it stand for up to 1-2 in room temperature. Tomatoes loose taste when refrigerated. It will get little soupy. My friends fight over the left over juice! \nBefore serving add salt to taste. No need for parmesan, or balsamic. \nSlice baguette in ? inch slices, brush with the same good EVOO and broil until nicely golden, turn and broil the other side. Place on the platter and spoon tomato mix on the warm toasts. Enjoy!"

Fresh herb is preferred. I use chopped cilantro because I have it in the fridge. Fresh parsley or basil will do as well. My friend also adds fresh chive in hers. As for olive oil, I drizzle enough just for the consistency. I also spread coconut oil on toasted bread before assembling the buschetta. 3 servings down to my belly in 10 minutes. Yum!"

"reviewBody": "Changed things up. I used fresh basil, cherry tomatoes, crushed a few cloves of garlic, added quite a bit of chili powder for the kIck, and added a splash of balsamic vinegar. Kept to the rest of the recipe. Made this three times in three days, and learnt a few things. First off its best marinated overnight. Also, removing all the pulp and slicing the tomatoes into small pieces made for a really pretty presentation. Tried a few variations, cold bread with cold bruschetta, bread toasted in the oven with the bruschetta on it, and bread toasted on a pan with a generous heaping of melted butter in the pan and adding the bruschetta straight from the fridge. The third one was the absolute best, as voted by the people helpfully test tasting the various batches. This is wonderful for parties where you can sneak out for a few minutes and emerge with a nicely decorated plate that is demolished within seconds. Thanks for sharing!"

I felt that cooking it mixed and marrinated all of the flavors without waiting the full 8 hours. I made sure not to cook it to long so that the tomatoes were still in some type of chunky consistency."

It sat for maybe 10 minutes before we ate it on French bread sliced and buttered and toasted in a toaster oven. Love putting the parmesan cheese right in the other ingredients."

I did add 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar like the other reviews suggested, and I used fresh basil instead of dry and more of it. Also, I threw in some fresh green onion since I had some in my fridge already. I would definitely add some sort of onion to it.. I only let it chull for 2 hours but it tastes perfect to me. I put the mixture on some toasted French bread slices... So good!"

I added a yellow onion, 3 cloves of minced fresh garlic, a squirt of bold Italian dressing and some red pepper flakes. I didn't feel like going to the store for french bread, so I just quartered and toasted some regular white bread. This was gone in minutes and everybody was raving about how good it was! Will definitely be making it many times again in the future."
