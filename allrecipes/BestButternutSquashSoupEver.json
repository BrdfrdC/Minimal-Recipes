It was very bland and not orange in color like most butternut squash soups I've had. I will search other butternut squash soup recipes. I think adding purr-aid carrots would help with the orange color, maybe some heavy cream and a cinnamon stick or two."

My first attempt was a little less spectacular than I'd hoped, but I used a squash called Honeynut, similar to Butternut, that turned out to have a very mild flavor, not as squash-like as I enjoy. I also used chicken broth instead of stock. I'll make it again with the correct ingredients."

When I do serve this I will serve it with some pumpkin seeds on top and a squirt bottle of Sour Cream I also use the Crema and that‚Äôs a little bit easier on the palette then I think the regular Sour Cream has. I almost forgot to add is I grate Allspice with the Crema, Pumpkin Seeds it add flavor. Well enjoy and happy fall.üçÅüçÅ"

Roasting method only got me halfway there. I also had to use dried thyme (no fresh available)- which? A couple pieces of thyme here or there were inedible but overall? We were blown away by the great flavor! This was my first butternut squash soup attempt ever and darn pleased with the results! Thank you for posting an awesome recipe I will make again and for sure every fall (and some winters!!)!!"

I like mine spicy and use chili powder, curry or Cajun spice. Others I've liked are cardamom or winter/breakfast spices like nutmeg or cinnamon. The base soup can be used to wow guests with plating color for that special dish."

We don't watch our salt so went for reg. chicken broth as opposed to low sodium. Skipped the pepper and coconut milk because my family are not fans. This made it much lower calorie too (not a bad thing). Added 1/2 an apple, a pinch of cinnamon. It was perfect - just enough sweetness due to the apple I'm sure. Would def. make again. Thanks!!"

Topped with French's crispy onions and crispy bacon!"

She said it tasted like a cream soup but I assured her it wasn‚Äôt. She really enjoyed the taste. Will make again."

I read the reviews and took the advice of several reviewers - I used a whole squash (although on the small side), roasted the squash w/a little butter in a 400 degree oven for 5 minutes before adding to the saut√©ed onion, garlic &amp; thyme, used a little less than 4 cups chicken stock, added a little cream after pureeing the soup, and it was so delicious! Only complaint, this one recipe didn't make enough for leftovers! It only served up 4 small bowls, so next time I would double or triple it1"

I used a local variety of squash (I'm from the Philippines) which is a bit sweeter so I balanced it out with a bit more chicken stock and extra salt. I used homemade chicken stock. I didn't have allspice so I used dashes of cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg. It's creamy enough w/o any cream. An indulgent soup w/o the guilt :)"

I appreciate that it didn't have heavy cream in it. Next time I will try roasting the squash to see if it could actually be better."
