I used a plug in fryer and checked the oil temp. 3 min for a 1/4 inch piece of dough was plenty. Not sure what the people who had problems did, but my guess is they had old oil, old baking powder, gluten free flour, and no thermometer. Maybe they are just the kind of people who claim \" I did exactly what the directions said\" when in fact they have no idea how to follow directions beyond \" click here\" Oh, I used more nutmeg because I like nutmeg."

"reviewBody": "There are both good and bad aspects to this recipe. There are complaints of the dough being sticky. This is appropriate because the dough must be kneaded, which requires a floured surface. The process of kneading on the floured surface will give you the desired texture. I imagine adding too much flour would create a thick inedible mess or a biscuit The donuts expanded to 3-4 times the rolled thickness. Use this as your guide for how thick you roll them out. They fried beautifully and the texture was great. I deep fried so that may have helped. As for the bad. That donut itself was quite bland. I would experiment the next time, but this was the first time making them so I followed the directions. I tossed some in cinnamon and sugar and others in powdered sugar. My family loved them....so I'd make them again and maybe add more cinnamon and nutmeg..or vanilla"

We just used a really deep pot for the oil along with chopsticks for flipping the doughnuts and a smaller metal strainer to get them out and it worked great. Took a few tries to get the temp and doughnut thickness right and then we were in business. Outstanding. My husband and I can't stop eating them, which isn't great since we're still sheltering-in-place and can't go to the gym haha! Added some frosting and sprinkles for fun and enjoyed."

Half turned out amazing and half disintegrated. I’m guessing my oil temp changed. But all and all a success! My kids loved them and it made it feel like donut Sunday at church. The chocolate topped and granulated sugar and cinnamon dipped worked great. I think the powdered sugar needed to dry out more."

I made them for several friends, family and neighbors and everyone loved them. I fried them in canola oil in a cast iron dutch oven. I let it heat up for 15 minutes at medium heat and perfect frying every batch. I don’t own a thermometer so I had trouble with the oil getting too hot in the past with other pans but this was great! Great recipe for better-than-bakery donuts!"

I should have known when the first step in the recipe states to heat the oil, that it would go much faster than my normal 60-90 minute wait time..This is the best recipe for ingredients,time and taste. and speaking of taste..I was a bit skeptical of how they would taste, but I had nothing to worry about, these are great! Thank you Jennifer for sharing this great recipe! I made doughnuts, donut holes and benets and they barely were cooled enough to eat when the last one was going, going, GONE! :)"

I don’t have a deep fryer so I did them one at a time in a small pot to conserve oil and did my best to regulate temperature. Would add a little less sugar next time as I prefer them very “plain.” Made my family very happy this morning!"

I realized after I started making it I didn’t have Nutmeg and so I added another Teaspoon of Cinnamon. Because it was my first time I decided made all the doughnuts dark in color to be sure they cooked all the way. My brothers cut the Doughnut shape from Mason Jar Lids and the Doughnut holes we made from Baby-food container."

I have made these several times and my only problem is getting the oil temperature just right. I use a cast iron skillet and check the temp.of my oil before each batch I'm frying. If making more than one recipe I have found I need to change my oil after one recipe as it is too dirty. I probably should invest in a deep fryer to solve my problem. Eventually I will get this down to an art. LOL, Thank you for sharing this recipe ."

We used to get plain donuts from this local market years ago and it's been long gone and we still think of the donuts... these are as close as I'm going to get according to husband. Did add a little more cinnamon and nutmeg, and also about .5-1 t. vanilla. I might add more sugar to the mix, as I like them plain, and I did have to dust a tad powdered sugar on them so will try with more sugar in the mix next time. Thanks for this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I've made raised donuts for years but never cake donuts. However, that will change because these were delicious and easy. Plus they don't require raising. I made them for an annual neighborhood donut party where there were hundreds of raised donuts, and mine were the only cake donuts. The cake donuts were a bit hit! I like that they have some spice and some sweetness; I also like the cake texture.\n\nA few notes. As others suggested, I increased the cinnamon and nutmeg, and I also added some vanilla. And I rolled them out a bit thicker than just 1/4 inch. Other than that, I followed the recipe as is and had no problems. I will say that I was surprised to not get more donuts from the recipe. I made a double batch and ended up with only about 3 dozen donuts plus holes. Next time I will know what the yield is.\n\nWe served a variety of glazes with all of the donuts--vanilla, orange, chocolate, maple, and mixed berry. All worked well with these donuts."

The dough came out slightly sticky, but floured the parchment paper and just pressed out the dough. Using doughnut cutter, I got fifteen doughnut and 15 doughnut holes. Made icing using 2 tablespoon of melted butter, 1 cup powdered sugar, and milk as needed. I added 1/2 tsp. of citrus flavoring. Dipped the fried doughnuts and got the glaze needed to put them over the top! Awesome!! Family loved them! By the way, they were not heavy or dense. They are just right on."

Other than needing to substitute half&amp;half for the milk, I had all I needed to make these (well, no deep fryer, either, but a large, deep skillet and lots of oil...). I am still letting most of them cool down, but what I've tasted so far is so good! I was like a little kid when they plumped up, I was so proud that I actually made them right! I'm glad they aren't too sweet, not too anything, just right for cake donuts."

They were predictably not so pretty, with a heavy crust that absorbed a lot of oil. Still yummy, though! Since that method saved me the trouble and mess of rolling them out and adding floor, I was very happy with the change. It was fairly easy and quick, for a weekday breakfast treat! \n\nI heated the oil on medium, with a thermometer in at all times to keep an eye on it. I would set each batch (4-5 \"holes\" at a time in my medium-sized pot) on paper towels briefly to drain, then tossed half the \"holes\" with cinnamon sugar in a brown paper bag, and sifted powdered sugar over the other half. Everyone enjoyed them! Thanks for the recipe. :-)"
