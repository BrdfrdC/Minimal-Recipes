I used canned chicken chunks and I suppose if I baked or roasted a chicken, leftovers should make this recipe even better. This recipe is a keeper!!"

With this or anytime I am cooking chicken of any description, pieces, breast, thigh, whole the lot I always stick my meat thermometer in and the SECOND it reaches 165oC (def. no more than 170oC) I stop cooking and remove from pan to rest. Even breasts are juicy when you do this - (ie providing you beat them to any even thickness first). You can't go wrong when you use a meat thermometer."

I didn't coat them in flour, but made patties and baked them at 375 degrees for about 30 minutes, or until chicken is done and starts to brown. Was really good without all of the oil and flour."

The smoke from the roasted chicken and splash of lawrys seasoning in the flour make this a new favorite at our house! Even my very picky 3&amp;7 yr olds eat it all up! We serve it with a dollop of sour cream, potatoes and corn."

"reviewBody": "As is just ok, but if you use flour &amp; panko to coat helps. Also, next time we'll add some spices or herbs cause it needs it bad. The taste was ok otherwise so just needs a boost. The worst part &amp; I do mean WORSE is it smells when frying. It reminded me of warming up our old cats wet food to get the chill off. Needed to burn candles &amp; spray the place after eating. With all that said, we do plan on making again though. Oops, forgot we used ground turkey so maybe that is why there was a smell. We didn't have any ground chicken &amp; were in the middle of a blizzard so used the turkey."

And I used olive oil maynnaise. Word to the wise, you will make a mess; make sure to have paper towels on standby and plenty of hand soap. But it is so worth it. I ate mine by themselves and dipped in BBQ sauce."

"reviewBody": "This is a good recipe but had to tweak a bit so that I used half of the chicken and substituted the other half with minced potatoes. I ran out of mayo so I used heavy cream instead. To make the mixture more stable and not fall apart when placed on the pan, I reduced the flour by half and substituted the other half with cornstarch; these were combined straight into the mixture instead of rolling the mixture on them. I had to set the mixture aside for 5-10 minutes in the fridge to allow the ingredients to bind together, and just before frying I added around 1/2 cup Panko breadcrumbs to add a bit more crunch to it. Turned out great."

Also throw in some dry dill, plus salt and pepper. NEXT I BREAD THESE HAND FORMED CAKES /CROQUETTES in some flour before I fry them up. everyone loves them. can't always find ground chicken in g. store"

My husband says it doesn’t need it, though. \nI found the raw mix very moist and hard to form into patties. I got the hang of it but it needed more flour to toss it in...v-e-r-y gently! The onion needs to be chopped quite finely too, or it makes them a bit crumbly. \nDefinitely a keeper."
