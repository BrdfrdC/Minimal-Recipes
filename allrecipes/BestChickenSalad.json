I used shredded chicken that I had in the freezer after buying lots of chicken breast on sale and cooking/prepping it for future use. Not sure why doing that just occurred to me, but it was really easy to do and it’s healthy, as well as a huge time savings! The toasted almonds really make this recipe. I haven’t added the lemon juice yet, maybe tomorrow depending on how it tastes then. It is really good with just Mayo, celery, black pepper, onion and garlic powder, as well as tarragon as suggested by some other reviews. I didn’t measure-did it by taste &amp; desired texture. Highly recommend!"

Very yummy and easy to make- I only made “one serving” and it was easily enough for 3-4 people to eat. Serve in multigrain pits pockets and with fresh fruit on the side for a balanced, healthy meal!"

I omit the almonds because hubby just doesn’t like them. Omitting them greatly reduces the time it takes to make this dish. I also add some chopped green grapes. Every single bit of it gets eaten in my house every single time! Thanks for sharing!"

Since discovering this recipe I keep a bag of slivered almonds in the cupboard. And I'll add red onion or any onion I have on hand and some seasoning of my own taste. Living alone I buy a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket have it for dinner and make chicken salad with the leftovers. Excellent recipe thank you very much."

I also don't like mayo much so I cut that to 1/4c and used cream cheese and sour cream for the other 1/4c, it still came out dry so I added more mayo and sour cream probably equaling another 1/4 cup. I also used rotisserie chicken which may have been why it needed more mayo.,and toasted pecans instead of almonds because that was what I had on hand. Served it to some unexpected (but not uninvited) guests, when you say \"stop by any time\" you better be ready, I sliced up hot dog buns and made sliders out of them and it was a huge hit."
