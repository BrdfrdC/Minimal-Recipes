Whatever makes a chocolate chip cookie delicious is MISSING from this recipe. I don't know if there is too much brown sugar, or too much flour, or not enough of something else. I just know the cookies are bland and super sugary all at the same time. I am soooo disappointed at having wasted my time and my ingredients on this recipe. I have never ever bitten into a chocolate chip cookie and felt so.... nothing. SKIP it!!!!!!"

I didn't have a hand mixer/stand mixer before so I used a whisk and a wooden spoon and the cookies turned out fine (might've gained some arm strength from it) Some tips I have are if you don't want the cookies too sweet change the sugar ratio to 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. If you want crunchy/hard cookies shape it smaller (1/2 teaspoon of dough) and for chewy/soft cookies shape the cookies bigger (1/2 tablespoon or 1 teaspoon of dough) Lastly, the measurements don't have to be exact for all the ingredients I like to use a little less flour in this recipe (2 1/2 cups) and you could add more chocochips if you want :)"

I keep reading reviews, “It’s too dry” or “the recipe calls for too much flour”. I can assure you that the portions of ingredients are correct. The ones complaining either weren’t sifting their flour, and or packing when measuring. Maybe mixing when they should have been stirring. Or simply over-baked. My recommendation is to read the instructions carefully, measure correctly, and don’t make balls. Make them cookies a little smaller than how you want them to actually be. Last but not least, when baking treats ALWAYS, and I mean ALWAYS bake for 1 minute less than the least recommended time. You’ll thank me later."

I thought it was wrong but didn’t decide what to do until I tried to stir in 2 cups of flour and realized there was no way my arm was strong enough to stir another cup into the mixture. I stopped at two cups and they came out great BUT next time I will adjust ratio of Brown sugar to the white. The brown sugar adds so much more flavor! I hope no one puts in the 3 cups as it will be a complete waste of ingredients. I did notice other people agreed with my opinion. Good luck!"

If you use quality ingredients (Guittard chocolate and Kerrygold butter for example, along with real vanilla) and don't over bake, they'll be 5 star! I've made this recipe over a hundred times. It's great as written, even better with dark brown sugar instead of light and 1/2 tsp cream of tartar mixed with the flour to give them a crackle appearance (give pan one \"bang\" when you pull from oven it they'll crackle even more). I found with experience that there was no need to dissolve the baking soda in water. Bake them on parchment so they don't brown more than desired on the bottom. Voila, the best cc cookie!"

Then added a bit more vanilla extract to make up for the water not added. But other than that… OMG! Its a family affair when its time to make these cookies. Great quality time baking with my kiddos, and eating them too! Enjoy yall."

I can't find my favorites anymore!) ... anyway, the first batch didn't look done after ten minutes, so I left them in a minute or so longer. That was a mistake. First tray was good right out of the oven, but too crunchy and dry afterwards. Leave these in the oven no longer than the time stated! Bottom line, these were just OK. They're a little too dry for me and I'll go back and try to find the recipe that wowed me last week."

A few observations I have made over time. 1. Do NOT overcook these, this is easy to do. I little bit of LIGHT brown on the edges 11 min in my oven then they come out immediately. If they are overcooked they are hard and not good. 2. These make a crispy/gooey cookie like brownies. Edges are a bit crispy, middle is slightly gooey. I love this, you may not. 3. Room temp butter and eggs are a must. 4. I make large cookies, but I flatten out the dough a bit before I cook them. If you're looking for a puffy/chewy cookie recipe, this is not for you."

"reviewBody": "This is an absolutely Amazing recipe. My family all brag about how amazing my chocolate chip cookies are. The only thing is I’ve had to change the recipe up a little bit. I started using about 2 1/2 cups of flour instead of 3 I just noticed it made them a lot less dry.I also like to chill the dough in the freezer for about 10 minutes. I think this helps the dough be a lot less sticky and easier to put on the pan. I also don’t resolve the baking soda in 2 tbs of hot water. I just put in the baking soda and put in the water. In my opinion it doesn’t make a difference. These cookies are really good with just a few minor tweaks."
