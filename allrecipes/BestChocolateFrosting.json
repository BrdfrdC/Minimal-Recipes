I creamed it then added half the sugar and A tbsp of milk at A time. Then after all was combined added cocoa and vanilla untill supper fluffy. My kitchen was A little on the warm side so I refrigerated the frosting while waiting for cupcakes to cool. I encourage the woman who suggested adding the extra butter to make A recipe of her own giving credit to the author of this recipe. üéÇüòÅ Thankyou to all the awesome ppl who submit suggestions and allrecipes for helping to create awesome memories I made this and A cupcake recipe with my son !

"reviewBody": "Worst frosting ever. I've been baking since I was a little girl. I normally make frosting on my own, without a recipe, but for some reason I decided to follow a recipe this time. What a mostake that was. This came up with 4.7 stars which is a really good rating, I'm just not sure how this recipe got that good of a rating. First of all, the taste was too much like icing instead of frosting, the texture was incredibly runny so i couldnt pipe at all. Maybe if it was made with softened butter instead of melted butter the texture would've come out good. I guess this frosting works today because I also somehow managed to find the worst chocolate cupcake recipe ever. What a day to decide to try something new.... thoroughly disappointed."

Our family has dairy issues so we sub the butter with Miyoko's vegan butter and the milk with oat milk and it's still perfect. I do however add the milk slowly and to preference rather than putting in a set amount. Using the miyoko's butter can alter consistency so I find it's better to do it this way with the milk. Thank you for this recipe!"

At the last minute when we went to put in the vanilla, my 9 year old daughter said \"what about almond?\" We did 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract. WOW! I could literally eat the whole cake. I will NEVER BUY CANNED FROSTING AGAIN AND WILL FOREVER MAKE THIS INSTEAD! I do want to point out to add a little less milk. My frosting was a little thin so we had to refrigerate it for 30 minutes before frosting."

"reviewBody": "Perfect as is! Sweet and chocolaty and much better than anything you‚Äôd buy in a can. Some trouble shooting advice for others. If your icing turned out lumpy your butter was probably too cold. The recipe calls for melted butter yet many bakers use softened butter. I however like softening it in the microwave until soft and just the tiniest bit melty. Faster than letting it come to room temperature and still rich and creamy and perfect for spreading on cakes. No lumps either. When measuring by volume the actual amount of things like powdered sugar can vary a lot. It can be compacted our lightly packed or anywhere in between. So when adding milk do so VERY slowly. Just the tiniest bit too much milk will take you from perfection to soup. Once it‚Äôs no longer powdery I add milk just a few drops at a time. If it gets too loose just add more powdered sugar. To make black frosting I used this recipe and used an 1/8 cup (Two tablespoons) of wincrest black cocoa (this brand is jet black and perfect) and poured that 1/8 cup into a third cup and filled the rest up with regular cocoa powder and the other 1/3 cup I used regular cocoa powder. So the 2/3 cup cocoa called for in the recipe just roughly a third of that amount black cocoa. Then add a good bit of black paste food coloring and let sit over night. Don‚Äôt skip the wait as it takes the color from slate grey to actual black. Leave the frosting on the counter or in the fridge but let it come to room temp and stir well before using."

When I tell you it was fantastic, I don't even have words. Best chocolate frosting EVER. We had some from a restaurant the other day, and there was NO LOVE in that cake. Tonight, there was most definitely, love in mine."

Changes I made: Used softened butter instead of melted, used almond extract instead of vanilla, and added about 2 tbs extra of milk. I also used a stand mixer. It frosted the top of a 9x13 cake and would have been enough for the sides if I wanted. It was not fluffy enough for piping, but not runny enough to pour, either. Loved it!"

Mixed it together while my cake was in the oven, and put it in the refrigerator while the cake cooled. Very sweet and chocolatey. Confused by other comments about it being grainy or runny--not true for me. My only reason for 4 starts and not 5 is my personal preference for less sweetness, but it was a good combo with David's Yellow Cake batter recipe."
