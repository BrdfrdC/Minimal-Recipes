The only thing I had to make seperatly was the roux. I poured that in the blender, seasoned and removed 2 mins later. It was delicious. If I were to change one thing it would be that I had the Ninja set to Smooth Soup setting and it completely purreed the soup like the recipe intended. However, I would have preferred to use the Hearty Soup setting so that there would have been small chunks of broccoli left in the soup. Next time, that is the route that I will go."

And I served it with lemon wedges to add before eating! What i would change next time is I would try to blend it to a smoother texture, would add a little more milk mixture to make it creamier, and finally serve it with some croutons as well."

Fresh-ground pepper really adds to the already delicious flavors. I poach chicken breasts in it, in a covered casserole dish, and serve over wild rice, but itâ€™s great on its own."

Also, delicious! \nI love the addition of celery this recipe calls for.\nThe only switches I made, for a keto friendly soup: 1/2 t. xantham gum mixed with 1 T butter added to the melted butter, and heavy cream (1 cup) for the roux. A little extra broth to thin to the perfect consistency.\nI thought about grating some fresh nutmeg into the simmering soup, however it is simply scrumptious just as written- pureed until velvety smooth and savored in small mouth and soul pleasing sips."

Unfortunately that means we are left with those woody, stringy stumps and stems. \n\nI followed the recipe, but used chopped up stems instead, cooking them in the chicken broth for 30 minutes instead and the puree in small batches. \n\nAlso, take the extra step of cooking the flour to a roux before adding the broth or puree, you won't regret it."

I also added a lot of garlic powder. It is delicious and is my favorite creamed soup. I notice that many cream of broccoli soup recipes call for much less broccoli which I assume makes it very bland. I love the rich broccoli flavor and the thick texture of this soup. \nAlso I use an immersion blender because a regular blender makes a terrible mess, plus it's easier to blend in the pot."
