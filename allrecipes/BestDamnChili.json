"reviewBody": "I made this recipe for Super Bowl Sunday at the In-Laws place. Everyone enjoyed it, including me. I must confess that in my rush to get all the ingredients, I forgot to buy any of the chiles. Whoops. So, I added more of the chipotle pepper sauce to try to give it the kick that the chilis would have made. It was very mild, but then my wife and her sister loved it that way. Next time I will include the chilis but all in all, it was a hit for our Super Bowl Sunday chili hot dogs. Thanks for such a great recipe! Also, a bit of advice. Get all the ingredients out and ready with the proper measuring devices and things will move along more smoothly. I was rushed and it took me about 2 hours to get it into the crockpot and start simmering while I ran out and played golf in the morning. By 2pm in the afternoon (7 hours later) it was tasting great, just not quite spicy enough without the chilis. I will definitely make it again."

Based on reviews, I used 1/2 the amount of tomato paste and could only find a Poblano pepper (not an Anaheim) after trying 2 different stores, so that was my only substitution. If you want to make a great \"sloppy joe,\" this recipe with a bit less liquid would be tremendous. However, if you are seeking a chili recipe, this is not the one to try."

My husband doesn't particularly like chili, but he gladly eats this when I make it."

I like my chili soupy and beany; beans were OK, no need of evaporating or thickening liquid. Used half of the beer and completed the 12 Oz with beef broth, and did not used beef bouillon. Followed the sugestion on a review of less tomato paste: used 6 Oz only of basil, garlic, oregano tomato paste. It is medium hot for my taste, only used one large poblano and one large Anaheim peppers. Also followed review suggesting extra bell pepper and onion. Oh yes, with this chili recipe, I will be on the next 'best chili competition' at work!!"

"reviewBody": "Amazing recipe! This is great chili. I did make some adjustments though. I used two (1 large, one medium) red conical sweet peppers, one Anaheim pepper, one Poblano pepper, and one green Jalapeño pepper. I did not precisely measure all the spices so there is probably a little more of each in mine than what the recipe called for but not much. I added Cayenne pepper to taste. Instead of two and a half pounds of meat, I used three pounds. I wanted it a little more heartier. Lastly, and my big change which I think made this chili out of this world, I used one pound of Lamb, one pound of Venison, and one pound of Elk. All of which taste so much better than beef and are healthier. Also, I did not make the sour cream mixture. We just used plain old sour cream and shredded sharp cheddar cheese. I added those after I took the picture. My best friend and my girlfriend both commented how much they enjoyed this chili. My best friend also said that it is the best chili that he’s ever had."

That creama is something new I’m going to try. Sounds goooood. A pot of rice, Fritos, small elbow noodles, chopped purple onion, and a big pan of cornbread on the side so everyone has their choice for add ins. Making some for us and the neighbors for Halloween. It’s getting to be a big pot of chili time of year."

I would suggest cutting the salt a bit for anyone who is sensitive to salt. I'm not sure if there is such a thing as low-sodium beef boullion, but that might be the solution. I did a mix of finely chopped beef (I had some left over in the freezer) and ground turkey as I didn't have enough of either on hand. I was worried about this mix, but it ended up being delicious. I don't usually take time to rate a recipe, but this one is going to be my go to chili recipe from here on out."

"reviewBody": "Really enjoyed this one !!! Loved chili as a kid, growing up -- This brought me back home , AND THEN some! The flavor was incredible! I did not use the chipotle pepper sauce because I am not sure what that is, and I also used just a tad less tomato paste, as I thought the recipe called for a bit much. I added a third can of beans ( I did TWO Kidney, and ONE pinto) as I like a more bean-y chili. Other than that, I followed it to the T, and all my guests were raving about it! It was the perfect consistency as well! Throw a bunch of shredded cheese on top, with a side of cornbread, and enjoy! It was worth all the headache trying to find all the ingredients! hahaha."

"reviewBody": "I love this recipe! I do make a few alterations that make it even better. I add about half a pound of diced “Conecuh Sausage” which is the best sausage you can find. It adds a wonderful smoky flavor and great juicy texture. Sorry to all y’all northerners. But if you have a Publix near you, that’s where you can find it. It’s an Alabama made sausage, I sincerely recommend it. I agree, 12 oz of tomato paste is too much. I add maybe 4 oz, If you need to thicken your chili up, I suggest making a slurry of 2 tbs cornstarch + 2 TBS of Worcestershire. I also like to use darker beer. This really enhances flavor. I like to use the beef “Better than Bullion” brand instead of cubes. The quality is much better. I also like to mix ancho chili powder, chipotle chili powder with regular chili powder. This creates a nice depth of flavor. And the last touch: USE MEXICAN CREMA SOUR CREAM. It’s authentic and so much better than your your average “Daisy” brand"

The chipotle and Anaheim peppers really set it off to another flavor - the brown sugar and cooked chipotle sauce add a sweetness to it. The heat is perfect for me. Not a lingering heat! I did use a ground brisket and pork sausage mix and it came out good. But if you are looking for that Texas red chili this is not it. But if you are looking for a savory chili you gotta try this for something different."

I added a scant tablespoon of coco powder and it really kicked it off. Gave it a bit of a mole flavor. I think a bit of instant espresso would suit this recipe well too though I didn't try it. I will fit it in somewhere next time. Probably before I add the beer with the bullion. Brilliant recipe on its own though. I've recommended this to friends and family. Thanks!"

I have been making this chili for about three years in a row now and it has never let me down. Let me give you guys some advice though: \n1) Don’t add the can of tomato paste. Like at all. Just skip it entirely. The sauce in the cans of tomatoes is more than enough. \n2) Use 2.5lbs of tri tip instead of ground beef. \n3) Use a 16oz can of Sierra Nevada Tropical Torpedo IPA as your beer. If that’s not available, use Sierra Nevada’s Pale Ale.\n4) Add way more than 4 cloves of garlic. I use like ten, lol\n5) Instead of 2 cans of kidney beans, use one can of kidney beans (DRAINED!) and one can of S&amp;V Pinto Chili Beans (UNDRAINED! That delicious liquid is precious!)\n6) Add one teaspoon of molasses at the end as your last step.\n... I promise you’ll thank me later"

Three of us tried it, but the leftovers did not get eaten. These people eat anything, too."

"reviewBody": "Oh, dear, I had high hopes, but this was such a disappointment! I should have read more reviews before making. I agree with another reviewer who said 5-star reviews are misleading when the reviewer has made adjustments. I started with the recipe, and all I could taste was tomato paste and salt (and I left out the 1 tsp salt! 1/4 c. Of Worcestershire sauce is a LOT). I added celery, green pepper, corn, more beans, barley, trying to dilute the tomato paste flavor. Added a lot more sugar to try to balance the acid. Then it was just acidic and sweet. Then went to baking soda, which helped some. Cooked some potatoes with it to try to cut down the salty taste. Ended up employing more experimental means - canned pumpkin, molasses, cocoa powder... in an attempt to salvage it. The end result was a VERY late night and a year’s worth of chili that is just barely edible."

"reviewBody": "So I am going to start that I followed the exact recipe and cooking directions with a few exceptions, but those exceptions are very minor and they were done to make my version keto friendly. I am giving this recipe five stars because the taste, spices, etc. are SPOT on and make this chili amazing!! I could not modify the recipe to my needs without following this almost to a T.\nThe only major difference is I did not add the beans (bad for my keto diet) and I listened to other reviews and only added two tablespoons of a 4 oz. can of tomato paste. \nI used a combination of ground/shaved/cubed beef because I could not add beans and I wanted some texture. \nIt doesn’t say if the white wine should be dry or sweet so I used some cheap moscato. I made sure to use smoked paprika- there is a difference so pay attention. ;) And was worried because I am not used to a chili smelling smokey. Oh, my heavens! It was soooo good. This is a keeper."

"reviewBody": "I made this chili last night and it was delicious!! I've made many different chili recipes over the years, but this one is a keeper! I will continue to make it! I did make some modifications as to my own preferences such as used shredded chicken instead of beef and chicken broth rather than beef bouillon, and added a pinch of cinnamon and added some dollops of Cilantro creme sauce over the top as another user suggested as well as a little apple cider vinegar, but I adhered to the rest of the recipe and it was excellent. A lot of depth and a good amount of spice that blended in well together with the tomato base. So yummy - will proudly be serving this at family events to come paired with cornbread muffins!"
