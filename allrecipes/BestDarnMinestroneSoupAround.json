They were very hard. No one likes that."

This is what I did: Frozen peas and corn, fresh carrots and beans, didn't have any spinach, only 2 Tbs. butter to cook onion in, diced tomatoes v/s whole, 3tsp garlic, 3tsp parsley, the whole can of garbanzo, and only 1 cup heavy cream (4cups seems like WAY to much). All other ingredient quantities the same and I did puree half the veggies. Very happy with the flavor, maybe I'd add more S&amp;P. I cooked the noodles separate based on another review but in the end combined it and have yet to eat the leftovers to see if it is too mushy."

A cup could be added to make it creamier but it's not necessary. I also added a half teaspoon of oregano. You may have to add sea salt depending on the type of broth used. I've made it with chicken stock, and I've made a veggie stock version. I used the diced canned tomatoes as I like smaller tomato chunks, and I have used the seasoned ones. I served mine with homemade garlic Parmesan croutons."

I omit the butter and throw the onions in with the veggies. I use frozen veggies and half the amount of fat free !/2 &amp;1/2. Pureeing the veggies is the key to this soup. No need to cook it so long - I do the whole thing in 30 min. Keeps well and always disappears within 3 days. A sure crowd pleaser."

I added 3 cloves of garlic to the sauteed onions and added white northern beans instead of garbonzos. Also used frozen mixed veggies instead of canned. Used only 2 cups of cream - that seemed to be plenty. This recipe does make a LOT; however, I froze half and will get two meals from the batch. Blending the veggies is key. Very, very delicious!!"

(Although I have to puree the entire thing to hide the beans..and omit chickpeas) Just a tip for people.... If you puree the whole thing...boil the noodles separately and throw them in at the end. I use ditalini ( small) pasta, and I use whole milk instead of cream. Ive tried half and half too, but once you puree it you don't lose the creaminess factor. I leave it in my bug soup pot and use my immersion blender , I used to use the blender.. no more. Whole milk works wonderfully. Thanks Ron. I miss being in the D."

(with this soup you dont have to be exact with measurements) -I split the kidney beans... white and red. -I used fresh tomatoes... not canned (4 of them) -I used fresh garlic instead of powder. (same measurements) -I used Fresh Basil and Parsley not dried. (same measurements) -And instead of Fatty Heavy Cream I just added more Chicken broth. I was even better the next day!"

For the mixed vegetables I used a frozen 14oz bag mix that had: brocoli, lima beans, carrots, and squash and half a 16oz bag of a frozen pea/carrot mix, and a full package of frozen chop spinach. I halfved the recipe and used 3T of Smart Balance spread instead of butter and used whole milk because that's what I had. Even with these mods there was no lack of flavor! Yum! Yum! Oh, and I was short on time so only simmered for about 30-45 mins for the first step and 30 mins for the last step and it was still fantastic."

"reviewBody": "Very Good! I changed a couple of things though. I cut the recipe in half and I used frozen mixed vegetables since I don't like the flavor of canned. I also used a orzo type pasta because macaroni swells up too much and I used half n half also. If you want meat in it you can slow cook some stew meat before making the soup then it turns out real tender or add precooked Italian sausage. I've also made the soup vegetarian with vegetable broth and it was still real good. Thanks for the recipe!"

I used fresh grilled veggies instead of canned, and added some cayenne to give it some punch. Half-and-half instead of cream seemed to work pretty well, too. Basically, if you're into cutting calories, it's easy to do that with this recipe and still yield VERY nice results!"

I ruined the whole batch of soup because I added the pasta in then cooked like the directions say. the problem was the left over soup... I ended up throwing it out due to the mushy past. Next time I would just add the pasta per serving."

I wanted to make a minestrone soup really bad, but even with the slight changes i made, MY WHOLE FAMILY LOVES THIS SOUP!!! First, I cut the recipe to 6 servings (still makes a lot). I did not have spinach or canned mixed veges, so i used frozen mixed veges and no spinach. I also did not have garbanzo beans so used 2 cans of kidney beans instead. Lastly, I used diced tomatoes instead of whole ones. I think even if i had not made those changes, it STILL WOULD BE AWESOME! YUMM! MAKE THIS! Oh, I wanted to add that this is the recipe that made me join this site even though I've been visiting it for a couple years now!!"

FROZEN mixed veggies (\"for soup\") were perfect, and I used two 32 oz. boxes of chicken broth. Later, for kicks I added imitation lobster to the leftovers, and that was good too! Great recipe for a group, like our family, or guests."

"reviewBody": "I LOVED this soup!! I only had beef stock on hand and used that instead, and halved the recipe, and it still filled up my large dutch oven pot!! I tried this before adding the cream,(half and half), and it was very tasty without it, as well! The flavours are NOT oustanding until the next day. Hubby said the first day it tasted like just cream, but the second day, WOW!! Added fresh basil at the end for a lovely flavor, and also a titch of sugar(oops). I just prefer my tomato base recipes to have a touch of sweetness. I also think when you use that much cream in this soup, the tomato paste needs to be bumped up a bit, as I found myself adding about 1/4 cup. So in light of my few minor changes, I can only give this 4 stars, as I tweaked a bit for my own personal preference. I HATE it when people change the whole thing and then still only give a 2 or 3 star rating, or tweak it so it is nowhere NEAR the original and then give it 5!!! As this recipe stands, it is truly a 4 star!! Thank you for a lovely soup!!"

We used to go to the one in Detroit, but that one burned down (or something arsen related) many years ago.\n\nI have to agree that your soup is very very similar to Lelli's. I did not make it with the elbow pasta and so I only put in 1 cup of heavy cream!!! I do have to admit that I threw out the first batch I made because the Fat Free Half &amp; Half I tried to substitute for the heavy cream was just horrible!!! The second batch I made with the heavy cream was perfect!!! Thanks for giving me a new recipe I will make over and over again! Hubby loved it too, he said he was looking forward all morning to coming home for lunch and eating more of this delicious soup!"

"reviewBody": "This is a fabulous, fabulous recipe!!! Ron's not kidding when he says to use a big pot and that it will feed an army--you need a BIG stockpot. It says 12 servings--but my ladle holds about a cup, and my bowls hold two ladles-ful. I think we can get about 18 bowls out of this recipe, estimating. I make it for dinner, then we have lunches out of it for several days, plus dinner the second night, and we have a family of 5 (and four of us are male). One important adjustment I made--I use half and half instead of the cream. It's perfect like that, IMHO--I've made it twice and have never used the cream. Even with the decreased fat, it's very rich and can cause some digestive issues, if you know what I mean, so I know I could never use the cream in it (plus, you'll save about $2 with the price difference between a quart of cream and a quart of half and half!). I also don't use 8 tablespoons of butter to saute the onions--3 is sufficient and takes a big bite out of the calorie and fat content. You won't miss it.\nThank you, Ron!!!!"
