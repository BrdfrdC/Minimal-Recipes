I read peoples comments and added more ginger and more garlic and more onion powder, still bland, added more, still bland, so i added soy sauce, eh..still not that great but I had to keep moving. I rolled them and fried them and they were just ok. They definately needed dipping sauce and all I had was soy sauce so I dipped them in that and it was better. The next day I bought some sweet and sour sauce and tried again and it was better, but only because they were sauce ladden. The veges inside dont have enough time to cook because the egg roll wrapper cooked in a few minutes. So there was a crunch factor to the inside which I like anyways. I often cook for the neighbors and they liked it ( but are they really going to tell me my cooking sucks? no) my standards are higher than theirs. Im not a negative hater of this persons recipe, it is something I may make again but with a lot more tweaks based off this original. No wonder egg rolls cost $$$ at a restaurant because they are so time consuming to make aswell! I am a white girl so I will leave the asian cuisine up to the asians who have their own little secrets that make them yummy."

"reviewBody": "To call these the best is certainly ambitious. We both felt they were completely lacking in flavor and after going over the recipe again and reading comments, I understand why. Garlic and ginger, that's it. Bland. Tasteless. Maybe add some white pepper, soy sauce, spring onion greens, and fresh ginger next time? Also, the conundrum of this: How am I supposed to fit one pound of ground meat, two cups of shredded cabbage, and 2 oz. of carrots into EIGHT wrappers using only 1/4 to 1/3 cup mixture each? Am I reading that wrong? We needed the entire pack and over-stuffed quite a few. \n\nThe reviews for this recipe are deceiving, many of the 5 star reviews are based off of reviewers adding additional spices or sauces to their egg rolls, that doesn't reflect on the true recipe. This recipe is a good base."

They just lack flavor, and taste nothing like what I am used to at a restaurant, which, with any home recipe I accept that they won't be quite the same. I can't quite put my finger on it, but definitely needs more seasoning, maybe some sesame oil or something similar. Though I think I would look to try other egg roll recipes that perhaps have a little more to them than this one, as it is simply, too simple."

The first time I made these I showed them to my husband, who said, \"Nice - these are frozen, right?\" \"No hubs, I made them.\" He assumed I was pulling his leg because said they look just like the ones we used to buy. Only these taste so much better! The only drawback is now I don't have an excuse to order out for Chinese food anymore. Thanks for sharing the recipe."

The mixture otherwise is bland. Two tips: 1. make sure the mixture is dry otherwise your egg roll will get soggy and 2. Make sure your oil stays at 375 for temp or the roll will absorb too much of the oil. Totally a hit and will do again."

The coleslaw mix reduced in volume the minute the warm cooked sausage was combined. Doubled the spices and added chopped cilantro and green onions. Very good and easy, peasy. Made far more than the 8 rolls predicted in the recipe -- about 16-18 rolls. My family was eating them as fast as they were fried! Decadent too but sometimes we all just need that ! Need to find an easy dipping sauce now; the one I threw together was good but needed improvement. Thanks for sharing!"

The flavor was not hitting right for me and the egg rolls felt empty on the inside because the cabbage shrunk so much. I will do what another reviewer suggested and cook the cabbage first next time. I will also be looking into a different arrangement of spices or just working out a better one myself. I am rating this three stars because I did watch the video multiple times for help with rolling."

I’d say 1/3 head finely chopped cabbage, 1 shredded carrot, 4oz finely sliced tofu, 1 minced green onion, 1tsp grated ginger, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp sesame oil, 1 tsp sesame seeds (mixed into the veg), and I think I also put some minced jalapeno and turnip in there. Make sure you seal the egg rolls with cornstarch/water. For much, much lower fat content, pan fry in batches in 1tbsp oil on 4 sides til brown. I also made a dipping sauce: 1tbsp each gochujang, honey, ketchup, and 1tsp soy sauce (which is actually a nice general purpose sweet/spicy sauce!). DEFINITELY making this again."

I cooked it with brushed peanut oil in the oven for 20 minutes at 425 and the crunch was not that great. I think corn oil would be better. I forgot to turn them 1/2 way through. But the flavor was good. The boys gave me a 6 rating. I then wrapped up the rest of the mixture with spring roll wrappers and also added scrambled egg inside of it. It was more flavorful but the wrappers were too thin and broke. It might work if I double wrapped it with spring rolls. Corn oil did crunch it up better. Update 9/19 You need an awesome dipping sauce for this. Mix together 6TBS Light soy sauce, 3 TBS rice vinegar, 1 tsp chili garlic sauce or even sriracha sauce, 1-2 tsp fresh grated ginger root, 2 TBS brown sugar or white, 1-2 garlic cloves chopped, 1 TBS sesame oil. and a few green onions chopped if you have them.

My kitchen smells deliciously of onions, garlic and ginger! The garlic is from a fresh garlic bulb; the ginger (again) is from Lighthouse Herbs (reconstituted) ginger. This ginger saves a lot of time in prep and works equally well. Again using (as suggested by previous readers) a coleslaw mix to which I added more shredded carrots. Used a pizza cutter to shred the coleslaw and carrots finer. Worked great. When mincing the garlic I put Pam Cooking Spray on the blade of the chopping knife. What a great idea! (Don't remember where I read this) Keeps the garlic from sticking. This time I will be using a small electric fryer. The first batch of egg rolls I fried in a regular sauce pan and what a mess! Will see how the fryer works."

I do love egg rolls with bbq Chinese pork, but used minced chicken this time. I marinated it in pineapple juice, teriyaki sauce , with fresh minced garlic and fresh minced ginger for a couple of hours before cooking it. I also lightly stir fried the veges till softened (cabbage, carrots, bean sprouts, green onion, minced mushrooms &amp; bamboo shoots) before putting it all together for the egg roll. Water works just fine to seal your egg rolls, no flour paste needed. These were a real hit with the family. They freeze well too (reheat 400 for 10-12 minutes) I used Chinese hot mustard and Sweet Chili sauces (from this site) for dipping. Yum!"
