It created a huge loaf that was prize worthy, moist, dense and tender. I put in Craisens (dry cranberries) and 2 teaspoons of caraway seeds, which added enough flavor without overtaking the delicate flavor of the bread. My family raved about the bread, saying; \"It was the best soda bread they have ever had!\""

It turned out okay, but I wasn't impressed with the taste at all. I did a plain loaf, without any raisins or currants. Thought about adding dates &amp; walnuts, but didn't. The loaf looked nice. I baked it in a 9\" round cake pan. Unfotunately, because of it being more like a batter, I wasn't able to \"bless it\", so maybe the angels didn't like that. Oh, well. At least my Colcannon came out halfway decent. Cancer sucks. It makes it so hard to get some things done. My elderly mother liked the bread. So, that was nice."

Did not have a 9 inch cake pan, so used 10 inch--must cook for an hour at the recipe temp to be certain bread is fully cooked in the middle (which it was not, despite knife coming out clean after 45 minues). This bread could also be good with summer grillling as a side. Also found some diced cinnamon-sugar apples to try next time in place of raisins."

I also decided to use 1/2 cake flour and 1/2 AP. Remember to use 2 T extra cake flour per cup for substitution. I agreed that it would overflow a 9 inch cake pan when I saw the batter so I used 2 pans. 8 inch pans would be ideal but I didn’t have. Put parchment round in the bottom and it came out with ease. I know that’s a lot of changes but thank you for getting me started in the right direction. Reminds me of a loaf sold at a bakery nearby that closed a few years ago. The line would be out the door."

It is a sticky dough and that's fine just pile it into a well greased pan. Baked up well in a 9\" cake pan for 55 minutes. Excellent flavor just like Irish soda bread from a bakery. Reheat wedges in the oven for extra crispness then slather on the butter. Yum!"

I believe portion in the recipe is problematic. I divided the paste into two batches for baking since others said it didn't cook through otherwise. Took 30 min and it was done. Got something resembled sweet muffin instead of soda bread. Very disappointing. If I make it again, I would look for a recipe with less eggs, less butter, fewer raisins, definitely less sugar."

I couldn't imagine fitting this into a 9in cake pan to begin with anyway."

The only change was for the double recipe - I used one box of Zante Currants and coated them with a little of the flour mixture before doing anything else. This soda bread is great for dessert, breakfast, or snacking. However, if you want to eat a soda bread with your corned beef and cabbage - try a more savory recipe with caraway seeds in it. Thanks for this fantastic recipe!"

Changed to the dough hook, then added the flour mixture and raisins alternatively a little at a time. Mixed on low until nicely combined. Baked it in a 9X4 loaf pan for 45mins and it was still gooey in the centre,baked for 15 mins. longer. Turned out nice. I give it a 4.5! Not perfect but almost."

My only warning - I used a 9 inch cake pan as noted in the recipe - definitely not big enough, luckily I put the pan on a cookie sheet, or this would have been all over the oven. Will make again, next time in a bigger pan, maybe a tube/bundt pan would probably be perfect. Thanks for the recipe."

Second time, used a deeper pan, but bread ended up very dry because of its density and time necessary to bake through. Took two different breads to work. The other recipe went very quickly while this one still has some sitting in break room."

I, too, added a little vanilla and an extra 1/2 cup sugar as the other reviews suggested. I ground cinnamon and sugar (comes combined in a grinder at Trader Joe's) on top and baked in 2-9\" round pans. Seriously, the best soda bread I've ever had. Not at all like the kind I remember growing up (DRY.) This was moist with just the right amount of sweet."

After you make it, try it lightly toasted smeared with some Irish butter... it's amazing."

"reviewBody": "I just got this recipe today and decided to try it immediately. It was a breeze to mix up, didn't even need a mixer. I followed the recipe and directions exactly, except I didn't have a 9-inch round cake pan. Instead I used a round casserole dish the same size. The finished product is beautiful, rounded and golden brown. Once it cooled, I sliced it and it slices beautifully too. However the texture is not like any soda bread I've ever had before. It's more like a muffin or quick bread. It's a little bit sweet too. I think it would be marvelous with peanut butter on it and I will definitely make it again. I just won't plan to serve sandwiches on it. It would be lovely toasted with butter &amp; jam with hot tea also!"

I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the top so it smelled as good as it looked."

"reviewBody": "this bread hit some what the middle of the road for us. While I thought it was 3, my son gave it a 3. My oldest gave it a 4, while my middle daughter and my hubby gave it a 5. I'd never made this kind of bread. The recipe was very easy. It wasn't sweet, but was like a light biscuit bread. The raisins made it sweet. Can't say it was the best bread but can't say it was the worst either. But what I can say is that it was okay, but this batch needs to be divided into 2. The reason I say that is because It's so dense, that the bottom center never got completely baked even after it was in the oven an hour and 15 minutes. While it looked pretty, it was to thick. 2 smaller round loaves would have been better for the baking process. But I think in my own preference. To improve this better for my taste. Add just a hint of cinnamon to it. But it's an okay bread."
