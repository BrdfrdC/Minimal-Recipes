The onions and carrots were still crunchy after cooking for 75 minutes (the meatloaf reached 165 degrees) and the onions were overpowering, taste-wise. On the plus side, it is a very moist meatloaf, and using soaked bread instead of bread crumbs gave it a nice texture, even with gluten-free bread."

"reviewBody": "This meatloaf has been in my recipe files for many years. I had forgotten about it for some time but when I noticed ground beef at a good price today I thought of it right away. Instead of baking in a loaf pan, I divided the mixture in two and formed free form oval shaped meatloaves on a foil lined sheet pan. I put a lengthwise dent in the middle of each one to hold any extra topping that I didn't spread on other parts of the surface. Turned out great. I like this method as it provides a lot of surface area for the topping and for browning. Great with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables."

"reviewBody": "I make this meatloaf (but a keto version) quite a bit and my trained chef husband really likes it. I double the recipe and will use 1.3 lbs of beef and 1 lb of ground pork. Instead of bread, I use pork rind crumbs to make it more keto friendly, My husband really hates chunks of onions, so I sub with shallot salt and onion powder. The topping is probably the main reason he loves the meatloaf. I used no sugar added ketchup and swerve brown sugar. The meatloaf is moist and full of flavor and has a nice sweet glaze on top. I double the glaze recipe so that he can add more to his slice after cooking."

I chopped a handful of baby Portobello mushrooms and added to the mix and forgot the dry mustard. I just mixed it all together and baked 1 1/2 hours. Best meatloaf ever!"

However, I wanted to also stay true to some of my own version so I used 1 cup of Panko bread crumbs in place of bread slices, placed slices of mozzarella cheese, in lieu of cheddar on flattened meat mixture and sealed cheese by forming into a loaf. I always lay 1/2 slices of uncooked bacon across the top. This is my new and favorite meatloaf."

Itâ€™s a pretty good recipe once itâ€™s personalized to your liking :)"
