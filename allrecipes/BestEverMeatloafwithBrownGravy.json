I also added a boat load of garlic, which my family loves. I noted the issue with the meat loaf breaking apart. So, I scaled back the bread crumbs to 1/2 cup and added an egg. This was perfection. I mixed 1/4 pound of bacon bits into the mixture, as well as 3 fresh crushed garlic cloves. The dish was money and big hit with my improv of this basic recipe."

You could use ketchup and no one would know the difference,\n I made the gravy which also was ok but again nothing special just by looking at the ingredients you can see it is only thickened beef broth with a little onion and some mushrooms. The recipe is easy to make and it turned out ok I don't think it would be my favorite that is for sure, it needs spices or something, I actually am surprised that so many people raved about it. I would call it plain ole meatloaf!"

I often use a pkg of McCormickÂ® Brown Gravy for something like this, split the cup of liquid between beef stock and red wine, added a bit of dried tarragon, salt and pepper. OK, OK, I know I changed it a bit, but this actually turned out quite well, and the recipe is strong enough to stand on its own. I see no need to ever buy the McCormickÂ® gravy again, as this was so easy to make, inexpensive, and turned out pretty well."

This is how you prevent clumping. I used extra onion in the gravy, and I also added minced garlic and chopped onion to the meatloaf. The garlic didnâ€™t cook through in the baking process, but Iâ€™m a fan of flavorful, crunchy garlic pieces."

"reviewBody": "I read a review on here that said the meat loaf was plain, so based on that I added some dried parsley and onion &amp; garlic powder. I also had a 2lb package of lean beef, so I just used that. I thought it would go quicker if I cooked patties on my stove. They tasted amazing and the family kept trying to grab them! But, it was a little time consuming, so I think I might try the oven method as directed. I did think that the gravy was quite salty though. So, I added the same seasonings and adjusted the water, but still wasn't to my liking. So, next time I think I will make my own gravy."

If more than 2-3 people &amp; you want leftovers you may want to increase recipe size."

After it cooked it just didn't bind together. I have never had that happen with a meat loaf. The gravy was incredibly bland. I use very good organic stock and often have this problem with recipes because they are not full of sodium. I added both salt and pepper to the gravy. The gravy was easy to make. I would make the gravy again for sure, but I think I'll stick to my old meat loaf recipe. Thanks for sharing."
