The base batter ‚Äî well, I didn‚Äôt realize it was *just* a base. Like Primer before you paint. These muffins are Primer White, and trying to add nuts or berries is like flinging paint at the wall, hoping it will magically give you full coverage. It will not. So - maybe add some additional spices, or different flour‚Ä¶. But then? You‚Äôre probably looking for a different recipe, it turns out. I‚Äôm gonna follow ‚Äúivandiepart‚Äôs‚Äù review and try the best of the best blueberry muffins next I guess."

Yes, I know it says 'or until golden' but the suggested time is way off, since I did a second batch at 15 minutes that turned out great. I do have an oven thermometer by the way so that should not have been the issue. Addressing the variability more clearly by saying 15-25 minutes would have been much more helpful - would have helped alert me before I seriously toasted the bottoms of my first panful."

"reviewBody": "Pretty good recipe, you do need to put your own spin on it. A quick tip is so make sure all your ingredients are room temperature before adding them together, it starts activating the baking powder and you end up with a much better finished muffin. Also after you divy out the batter in the pan let them sit for 10-15 mins. This also helps them poof better during baking and the result is a fluffy tender muffin."

I've tried them with chocolate chips and blueberries, both of them worked out great. \n\nBut they do lose some fluffiness and become crumbly if you leave them out for too long. Best to eat them right away. \n\nAlso, after 45 minutes, take the muffins out immediately. Not doing so can make them turn dark brown. They still taste good but they don't look good anymore."

Since she eats incredibly healthy I substituted no sugar added applesauce for the oil and used Enjoy Life chocolate chips. So good! I think the applesauce makes it a little more dense but they‚Äôre DELICIOUS. I love that there are so many ways to be creative with this recipe and will absolutely continue to use it for the base in future muffins!"
