"reviewBody": "This piecrust is excellent however what is not mentioned in the main recipe is that your butter or shortening must be chilled and you must use ice water. Cutting in the butter or shortening to pea size and then adding the ice water slowly makes this recipe excellent. You may need to chill the dough before rolling out but all in all this has been a winner. I truly believe that the negative comments are from making this without chilled ingredients. I have used this recipe many times and it has always been excellent with the rave reviews from those consuming it."

It was the taste that Makes me give this recipe 1 star. In a word - greeeaasy. WOW! After a couple of bites of this pie my lips feel as though I put on several layers of lip balm. I hate to do this after all the work, but this pie along with the recipe is going in the dumper."

"reviewBody": "Awesome recipe!!\n\nLoved it the first time 4 years ago. After that, tried to change the fats and see what would happen....1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter seems to me the best for our tastes. Otherwise, everything is spot on - keep making it over and over. A pie crust should be loaded with fat, that's what gives you the buttery lovely flaky quality. Another key - don't over mix or over process! Just to incorporate. The heat from your the friction of hands/rollers as you work to roll out your crust will keep mixing - it should be a 'shaggy dough' or a rough dough having incorporated at least 3/4 of the flour, that you turn out onto a surface to work with. The additional flour will work in as you gently work roll/ shape the crust. Don't overwork your dough/crust! Just work until you can shape it, roll it and move on with the glorious pie making of all types!"

"reviewBody": "Made this pie crust for the first time. Followed the instructions exactly and made a Rustic Peach Pie. The pie filling was great, but the crust wasn’t. I used grated frozen butter, added it to the flour and salt, then mixed it with enough ice water to make a ball, flattened it and then wrapped in plastic and put back into the fridge. We had to cut the crust with a knife to eat it. It was very chewy. When I took the pie out of the oven, it looked as if it was sitting in a pool of grease! Probably too much butter in the crust. Won’t try this recipe again. Maybe I should go back to the Crisco pie crust recipe that’s on the box, but I’ve read some interesting things about Crisco and maybe I won’t go back to it. I’ve never tried Tenderflake though! ????"

All the negative reviews I read were correct regarding (greasy texture, difficult to work with, too sticky, doesn't roll out). I chilled it, that didn't help, I put it between plastic wrap while rolling and then didn't help. I even pieced some of it together and baked it to see how it would taste. I'll have to admit after all this, it tasted flaky but it was impossible to work and roll so it looked decent. Trust me--get another recipe and save yourself some frustration. I will not use it again or recommend it. I used the ingredients as listed."

"reviewBody": "This crust was very good! I followed the recipe exactly as directed, but I chilled the water and shortening for about an hour before I made my dough. I doubled the recipe, and it made about 1.5 times what I needed. I rolled my crust out a bit too thick at about 1/8\" (I made a cherry pie), so next time I think a much thinner crust would be much tastier for a fruit pie. My crust turned out flaky, just the right amount of moist, and was quite simple to make. I also followed the tip of another reviewer and rolled my dough out between two pieces of plastic wrap, which worked wonderfully."

I hit up All Recipes to see what I could find and I decided to try this recipe. This recipe is *so easy* to make and it came out perfectly. I chilled the dough for only 45 min or so, 10 min in the freezer. This is my go-to recipe for pie crust from now on! Thanks!!"

"reviewBody": "4 stars only because if you are new to pie crust making you must read the reviews for the tips that make this pie crust successful. You MUST refrigerate or freeze the shortening, the pastry cutter, and add ice cubes to the water and strain to the correct amount. If you do those things this is a 5 star recipe. I wanted a bit of a buttery flavor so I substituted 1/2 C cold butter for 1/2 the shortening. I am a baker but I specialize in cakes. This was my first attempt at pie crust and it came out great. I used it for apple dumplings. It was easy to work with, held together beautifully was tender and flaky. Follow the the tips and you too will be a pie or dumpling maker..thanks for the recipe and thank you to all reviewers who covered the tips..Will be using again!!"

I followed the other reviews that said use 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup shortening. Super flaky and buttery crust. It was absolutely wonderful. If you are a beginner I would highly suggest chilling it as suggested as it made the dough super easy work. For anyone who is wondering, this recipe will make enough dough. For a top and bottom crust. I was curious about that as no one else had said it yet. I will definitely be using this as make pie crust on all my pies in the future. Cheers!"

"reviewBody": "I have always had trouble with homemade pie crusts, but have never found a frozen crust that matched the flaky crust of my grandmothers pies. No matter what I do, its always either too dry or too sticky. This recipe was easy and a typical shortening-based crust. Overall, simple to make, but also simple to make wrong. I used another reviewers suggestion and rolled out the dough between two pieces of saran wrap, which helped rolling it out even though it was really sticky. On the second try I found it worked even better by sprinkling the saran wrap with flour on both sides first. The taste was good and the crust was very flaky. So even though I still find it a pain, it was everything a flaky crust should be."

It has a lot of shortening in it so the refrigeration is important. If you don't know how to make a pie crust try watching one of the videos on here, it's important to know the tricks such as adding water 1 tablespoon at a time until you hit the right consistency and know what the right consistency is. This is an excellent almost foolproof recipe for great pie crust."
