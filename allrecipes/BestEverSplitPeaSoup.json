So I left it in the crock pot all night (on off) &amp; when I looked at it, everything was normal. Not sure what happened. The soup was the best I've had!!"

I think it would be too bland without the added spices, but that is just preference. \n\nFirst, I used gee instead of the oil to cook onions, etc. \nI added several spoons (not measured exactly) of rosemary and ginger (probably 1 tablespoon). I also used a spiced salt blend. \nIn addition, we were out of celery so I did about a 1/2 cup extra of carrot, about 1/2 cup of dried celery &amp; some celery seed. \nI liked it so much that I sent out pictures and now have family members asking which recipe I used and what I added so they can give it a go. We will definitely make this again."

I also make it in the pressure cooker, high pressure for 10 minutes, rather than simmering in a traditional pot. Quick and delicious!! I think the large quantity of veggies gives it great depth of flavor. A keeper recipe."

Then I drained the water out before making the soup. I made it for the Jewish holidays and wanted to put meat in it. I browned a few short ribs in olive oil before sautéing the vegetables.

My mom used to add cut up pieces of polska kielbasa which she pan fried first. Omit any extra salt if you do this. I also like to add 1/2 tsp of oregano and 1 tsp pepper. Try it this way and you will be coming back for seconds. :)"

I did not puree as I thought it was thick enough.\nThere was a bit of broth and I liked that the carrots and celery were still mostly intact. Worried I wouldn't like it without ham bone/ham chunks. Needless energy waste. It was very tasty and I will make it again! Thanks for sharing this recipe!"

Probably should have let it cool a bit first. For salt free seasoning I used equal parts (about 1/3 tsp) tumeric, paprika, sugar, garlic powder and some dried onion. Only complaint is the color is orangish and not green when blended. Tasted great!"

Immersion blender worked like a charm to obtain a smooth and silky texture. My house smells AMAZING!!! Thank you for an awesome, basic split pea recipe that can be played with, or not!!!"

I made two small adjustments to the recipe to suit my taste by adding one small ham steak cubed and a generous pinch of hot pepper flakes. I may have used more liquid than called for as well. I put in two large tetra boxes of chicken stock and then filled the slow cooker to about 3/4 full with water. It turned out just right. Because I added the ham cubes, I did not blend the soup but I used a potato masher to smooth it out a bit. I will definately make this again."

Recipe can be easily modified for individual taste preferences, including adding ham if so inclined. Followed directions other than simmer time reduced to about 1-3/4 hrs. If you like a chunky split pea soup, reserve some carrots, celery, and possibly split peas instead of running everything through a blender or food processor. Give this a try!!"

I used 1 cup of lentils for the green split peas, so my soup was 50% yellow split peas and 50% lentils. I also added Country Ham cubes. For my seasoning I used Ms. Dash Table Blend. The Soup turned out Great!\n\nNote: Since the split pea breaks down when cooking I do not recommend pureeing the soup but that is just a preference."

Along with all the vegetables I added 2 cups of diced potatoes, also replaced chicken broth with vegetable broth. Also, I did not have a seasoning blend, so added 1Tbsp of curry powder, 1 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp ground thyme, 1tsp parsley flakes and 2Tbsp soy sauce. After simmering for 2-1/2 hrs as suggested, the flavors were perfectly melded and I blended 1/2 the soup and left the remainder chunky. Absolutely yummy! Thanks for the recipe!"

I would suggest adding only 1/2 teaspoon of salt or none until you finish cooking since it is already salty if you're using store-bought canned broth. Season to taste in your own bowl or when you're ready to serve. For color, I used only green peas and added a dash of cayenne, which also adds a nice kick. My family has split pea soup (erwtensoep in dutch) around christmas, it's a family tradition, and i love how easy this recipe is!"
