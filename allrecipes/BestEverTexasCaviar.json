Of course I didnâ€™t have some of the ingredients (subbed fresh cut up garlic for garlic powder and mixed it in with the veggies and subbed red wine vinegar for the rice vinegar and I couldnâ€™t find white corn up here in Canada so used peaches and cream corn) and topped it off by being too lazy to cook then cool the dressing - I just mixed it together and then poured over the vegetable mixture and stirred it all . I loved it and my sister said it was better than a similar dip recipe that we got in Arizona. It was so good that she took some home (it makes a whole bunch - I changed bowls while making it) and she planned on eating it as a salad! I definitely like how it tastes light and has no tomatoes in it. Might become my new way of eating veggies ðŸ˜Š"

I would add lemon juice to brighten the flavors, and use less sugar. It needed salt, and I think a can of drained rotel would be great.\n\nThis recipe is a good base to start from though. Just taste as you go. Season to taste and make it your own version."

I reduced the vinegar by 1/4 cup, added 1/2 fresh lime juiced and 1/4 tsp each cayenne pepper and cumin (so I gave it a 4 instead of 5 but only for not liking too much vinegar and wanting more spice). I took it to work (I work with nurses, md's, lab techs, pharmacists) and the bowl was licked clean! Everyone wanted the recipe! Its a keeper cowboy!"

I add an extra jalapeÃ±o, a bit of cumin, cayenne (if it's not spicy enough) and more garlic. I try to make it the day before because it needs some time for time for the flavors to meld together."

I prefer spicy, salty, lime flavor myself. I didn't use canned beans (used dried and precooked myself), used fresh corn, roasted my own green chili's on the grill, added fresh diced avocado, white onions, fresh garlic and cilantro. I used a drizzle of olive oil, lots of fresh lime juice and some juice from a can of jalapenos I had on hand. I completely skipped the sweet bell peppers, sweet red onion, sweet vinegar, and sugar. Made my way, it was fantastic! Served it over barley I had precooked and then sauteed with garlic, CA chili and cumin. It made the best taco's ever! Thanks for the recipe. As a relatively new vegetarian I've been struggling to find things I can make with flavors I love that don't include meat. This recipe sparked my creativity and although I didn't care for it as written, it was a starting point for something I will make again and again. Thanks!"
