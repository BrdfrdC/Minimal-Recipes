The other is pickled jalapeno, but I don't think the dill would go very well so I swap it for cilantro. I also add a scant pinch of cumin and give it a south-of-the-border slant."

If you want a little more crunch, some diced celery is good to add in also. I didn't add in the crab meat, since I just wanted tuna salad only. So I used an extra can of tuna to replace the crab. I also added in a dash of onion and garlic powder, and some parsley. Great flavor and the best tuna salad! Thanks for the recipe!"

It was good, but I didn't find it any better than my usual tuna salad (tuna, hard boiled eggs, sweet relish, and mayo). I did enjoy the dill/pickle, and my husband enjoyed the lemon. Neither of us could tell there was crab. It's definitely worth trying, but I wouldn't say it is the best thing ever."

Crab is rather expensive and I feel like I got cheated. Needs something - maybe more sour cream and less mayo or more spices. I did double the recipe and at first I didn't add the sweet pickle relish. After I tasted it, I decided it needed something and added the sweet relish. Helped some but not enough to call it the best!! Won't try it again."

It's not too dry, not too runny. A great combination of ingredients. So simple too! I did only use 1/2 cup of onions and I completely eliminated the pickle relishes, I don't care much for them. I did finely chop just about 5 bread and butter pickle slices just to get the color. This was AWESOME, I used to love turkey salad but am now vegetarian so this is great! It's good on toasted bread, crackers, or would be good with lettuce, tomato, and a little mozz. cheese and toasted in the oven on a sub roll."

A lot of times, I'll make a double batch because it tastes so much better the next day. It's so yummy that I think I'll make it now and have it for lunch."

The first time we made it, the only thing I did different was not add sweet relish (bc I hate it), but added more dill in it's place. The second time I made it (which was the next day bc it was so good we ate it all in 1 day) I did not add tuna. Instead, I added 16 oz of the imitation crab and 2 small packages of salad shrimp. I omitted the sweet relish again and doubled the dill relish. I also added a dash of Celery salt. I have looked high &amp; low for a good seafood salad recipe and this was perfect as tuna or seafood!

I couldn't taste the crab (I have always thought when using crab, keep the ingredients simple so that you taste the sweetness of the crab meat). Also, two types of pickle relish plus the addition of dill weed is overkill. Sorry, didn't really like this one. ):"

I've always added hard-boiled eggs to my tuna salads for sandwiches...if I were serving it in a lettuce cup, I'd leave them out &amp; use apples or something instead. I used organic, low fat sour cream, green onions &amp; dijon mustard. I also used chopped sweet/hot pickle slices for the sweet relish. Added celery seed, granulated garlic (would normally use fresh but I just got one of those nifty grinders ;o) ) as well as a squeeze of lemon. Before I became health conscious, I always ate my tuna salad on white bread. I threw caution into the winds for one night &amp; had it on white, for old time's sake. I missed the wheat! LOL We enjoyed it Kristy ...thanks!"

I have always put sweet relish, mayo, and hard boiled egg in my own tuna salad, but this one is so creamy-spreadable and so palate pleasing, I plan on passing the recipe on to friends. Ordinarily, a \"mere\" tuna salad would not merit that attention, but this version is a classic and a keeper."

It was excellent. I scarfed it down immediately."

I bought some fresh crab meat, but found some shells in it (in the refrigerator section). I have bought jumbo lump crab meat before and it was awesome - you just have to get it from your seafood department before it sells out for the day, but it is totally worth it! I made the mistake of only putting in 6 oz of tuna by mistake so the salad was kind of on the sweet side from the sweet relish and the crab, so I will be sure to put it all in next time. I was hesitant to put the relish in, but it was nice, and wasn't overpowering or distinguishable enough that my pickle-hating boyfriend couldn't eat it. I am contemplating putting in some drained cottage cheese in, for creaminess and extra protein."
