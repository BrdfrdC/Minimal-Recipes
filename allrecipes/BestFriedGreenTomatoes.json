"reviewBody": "I used a mandoline slicer and cut the tomatoes 6-7mm (~0.25\") thick. I didn't discard the non-stem end but I used a super sharp knife to shave the peel from a circle at the end to provide a ring of peel like the other slices have. I used what apparently were green \"beefsteak\" tomatoes because they were a good 4\" in diameter and two tomatoes were enough to take up all of the cornmeal/breadcrumb mix. This was the first time I've succeeded in making fried green tomatoes as in my previous attempts the breading fell off. These were perfect and took me back to those Cajun restaurants I've been to years ago that served them. Although I didn't make any, these would have paired perfectly with a spicy remoulade sauce."

That being said, I used \"on hand ingredients\" ...wheat flower, jiffy brand corn muffin mix with Cajun seasoning, and like one of your other reviewers garlic powder. I cooked it outside on my neighbors porta-stove, and HFS... it smelled like the fair! Mind you it's December, I tried this because I took out a plant from the yard, and the wife even loved them!!! Jalapeño cheddar grits used to be my \"go to\" ... not so sure about that now!!! THANKS!!!"

I’m not a super fryer, but following those steps to coat the sliced tomatoes produced crisp, tangy, juicy fried green tomatoes that are absolutely addictive. I’ll be making these again."

My daughter &amp; I would eat them as we cooked them. So I decided to try this recipe &amp; I love the crunch of the panko crumbs. I started them in the skillet until browning started then finished them in the airfryer. They where perfectly crunchy outside and chewy inside. Also used almond milk because I do not buy cows milk. I like salt &amp; a sprinkle for a sweet &amp; salty crunchy vibe. Great recipe though."

I am a food snob and am quick to judge but these are outstanding. I did however use buttermilk instead of milk so that might have made a difference. My personal opinion, use the buttermilk. You won’t regret it. Dip them in some bbq’sauce mixed with honey mustard and you’ll be in hog heaven."

I also added garlic powder and onion powder to my powder mixture and I used a mix of peppercorns (red, white, greven and black ) for a fuller flavor. \n\nI did have the same problem I always seem to have whenever I havTorry anything on the stove top, all the batter seemed to fall off and go into the oil and then the oil burned essentially before the tomatoes were done cooking."

I like a kick to things, so I added some Tony’s to the bread crumbs. \nNext time I will try baking as one reviewer did. I wanted to be as true as I could be to the original recipe the first go round. Next time I will use one egg and half the milk. Thank you for the recipe."

Just generously cover the bottom of your pan. Per other reviewers, I also added a couple TB butter. I also reduced the flour to 1/2 cup, and added some garlic powder and Laawrys. I fried for approx 2 min per side. They fried up and browned perfectly. Great recipe."

"reviewBody": "I made these following many of previous reviewers recommendations (thank you!!). I soaked the tomato slices in 16 ozs. of buttermilk for 5-10 minutes (in a ziplock bag-so easy) as I wanted to bake them (400*F 40 mins, flip half way through) for a healthier version. I used half the amount of flour. I poured some of the buttermilk out of the ziplock bag into a small bowl, so after I floured the tomato slices I dipped them in buttermilk again before adding on the Panko/corn meal mix. I would definitely add some spices to the flour mix next time (garlic powder, onion powder, a little chili powder or maybe even adobo). We had some leftover BBQ dipping sauce and tried that but it overpowered the tomato flavor, so I would definitely cut back any dipping ingredient (BBQ sauce, Hot mustard, hot pepper relish) with sour cream to tone down its flavor a bit so it doesn’t overpower the tomato slices. First times having these and they were a hit!"

I made this recipe exactly as directed except I used soy flour in place of wheat flour (my husband is diabetic so that cuts the carbs a bit) and I didn’t deep fry, but only sautéed in olive oil and a little butter. The result was better than my former fried green tomatoes— the batter coated nicely and there was a nice crunchy texture from the corn meal!! This is how I will make this dish from now on!!"
