Plus, I could pick little doo-dads out of the garden to mix in with it, like chives, parsley or sweet basil, cherry tomatoes, and spinach leaves. I tried several samples to see which way tasted best. The bed of spinach leaves, quinoa mixed with chives and cheese, and an egg over easy on the top was my favorite. No toast needed."

I am trying to get more colorful vegetables in my diet so I also added shredded carrots, diced cucumbers (peel on) and a variety of colors of sweet peppers. Because I am adding so much I 1/2 again the wet ingredients - vinegar, oil and lemon juice, as well as extra garlic. This is a very healthy salad loaded with protein. I plan to make this regularly and can't wait to have my friends try it at our next potluck!"

I happened to have minced white onion on hand, so I used that instead of the red onion. The salad has a delicate Mediterranean allure. I will definitely be making this one again!"

"reviewBody": "We really, really enjoyed this recipe. I do the quinoa the night before so that it is completely cool before adding in the feta. The first time the feta sort of melted and I just like the feta in more chunks....personal preference. I also did the tomatoes with olive oil and garlic, to get them to really absorb the flavour and then add it. Great recipe for a really yummy alternative to a lettuce based Greek salad, making it bit more filling."

"reviewBody": "This has become one of my go to easy dinner recipes. It doesn't take long to make and is really packed with flavor. The fresh parsley is really important for the flavor, so make sure you have that! I also usually eliminate the olives because my boyfriend doesn't like them, and it might be better without them even though I am a huge olive fan! I think the olives end up adding too much salt to the dish so I'm happy without them."

"reviewBody": "This is absolutely scrumptious. I did make some modifications and some additions. I doubled the veggies, feta and dressing amounts but kept the quinoa to 2 cups. It was a perfect amount as I am taking it to a potluck. I added fresh dill and oregano as I have an over abundance of those and was short on the parsley. I also completely replaced the vinegar with fresh squeezed lemon juice...I juiced three small lemons and added the zest of one. I rarely write reviews, but thought this one was definitely worth it! So good!!! (One last thing, even if your quinoa is prewashed, it's still good to rinse it thoroughly. I used red quinoa.)"

"reviewBody": "I made this using the suggestion of other reviews, and cutting the amount of quinoa in half, it turned out to be spot on! I was a little concerned at leaving all the rest of the ingredients the same, but it worked great! The only other adjustment I made was to toast the quinoa in a dry pan for about 10 minutes before cooking it. This step really brings out the nutty flavor and, IMHO, enhances the whole dish! I also make my own Greek salad dressing, and, in the future, will try adding it in place of the dressing called for, pretty much the same flavor profile anyway. This was a wonderful salad, both my husband and I loved it, will definitely be making this again!"

I loosely followed the measurements, added cucumber and several different coloured peppers. I'll definitely make this all summer long."

I did end up however adding more of the dressing and quite a bit more veggies and some artichoke hearts and cucumber as well... I'm not sure but my quinoa to veggie/dressing ratio seemed way off. There was just soo much quinoa! Never a bad thing i suppose. Anyhoo this recipe was great and i will definitely be making it again. Thanks!!"
