"reviewBody": "I made some changes to this, based on what other reviewers said. I used fresh green beans, microwaved for 5-7 minutes until still crisp, and left to the side while I prepped the mixture. I used mushroom soup, cheddar cheese, and french fried onions. I also added 2-3 tablespoons of sour cream, real bacon pieces, salt, pepper, garlic/onion powders and little cayenne pepper for a slight kick. After mixture was to my liking, I folded in the green beans and baked in oven for 30-35 minutes. About 5 minutes before done, I added a layer of french fried onion on top (used all cheddar in the mixture) and heated until topping was warm. Absolutely delicious!"

Baked it for 35 mins, then topped with the remaining fried onions and baked an additional 5 mins. It was wonderful!\n\nI'll be using this recipe again for sure. Thanks!"

I then put all the fried onions on top and bake another 5-12. I skip the microwaving, and mix all the cheese in together and it's so good! Pretty salty but we like it that way."

Fresh green beans cooked first, then I mix/heat the soup and cheese with perhaps a little milk or water, not much to make it creamy. Mix the green beans with soup/cheese mixture and put in casserole dish. Topping same as recipe."

"reviewBody": "I liked this much more than the traditional Green Bean Casserole. The cheese is a good addition. I didn't bother with the microwave. It's not at all necessary. Just mixed it all up with 2/3 of the french fried onions. Bake for 30 mins at 350 and then top with remaining french fried onions and bake about 5 more mins to brown. \n\nI happened to have a LARGE (6+ lb can of green beans) that I got on a special. It's probably a perfect amount for a large Thanksgiving crowd. I drained the liquid, added 2 cans of regular cream of mushroom and 1 can of roasted garlic cream of mushroom, 2 t. salt and 1 t. pepper and 3 cups of cheddar cheese. Mixed 1- 6oz can of french fried onions into the mix and then transferred to a large casserole dish. Topped with a second can of french fried onions the last 5 mins. This would be great to make in two casserole containers and freeze one for later. I fed 10 people with it and had enough left to freeze for another meal later. I'm glad I found something everyone really liked as I have about 4 more of those LARGE cans of green beans!"
