As other reviewers remarked, perhaps garlic and cilantro would help. I ended up using it as a layer in a 7 layer dip instead of solo, and there it certainly contributed to the flavors."

Omit the olive oil, add one minced garlic clove, chopped tomatoes, cilantro (sometimes I substitute the last three items with part of a can of Rotel Mexican style lime and cilantro diced tomatoes), finely chopped onion and for a little zip add a pinch of your choice of hot ground pepper (cayenne, chili powder or chipotle chili pepper). The flavors blend together nicely."

It definitely benefits from sitting for an hour. I tasted it right after I made it and the salt and olive oil were really pronounced. It all blends and mellows after the hour wait. Because this guacamole doesn't have any strong flavors like cumin or cilantro, it's really good as a sandwich spread in place of mayo."

Everyone in my family liked it and the entire bowl was gone within the hour... will definitely have to double the recipe next time! :) I also added a dash of cayenne pepper to give it a little kick."

Leave Out the olive oil, the avacado itself has enough oil in it. Mix everything together and squeeze the lime over it and mix well. Add salt to taste and get ready to make a fool of yourself! This version is GOOD!"

Garlic, cilantro, finely chopped jalapenos and diced tomatoes are wonderful add-ins to any guac recipe. Also, I prefer limes to lemons. If you don't like cilantro or jalapenos, this would be a good recipe."

There is a chemical in cilantro that causes it to taste exactly like soap to some people, so to me it would be exactly like shaving in a bar of Ivory."

"reviewBody": "First of all, I like guacamole a little chunky, it looks far more attractive and the avocado is taster when it's not pureed, as the photo shows.. It needed fresh garlic, zero olive oil, chopped pickled (or fresh) jalapenos to taste, fresh ground pepper, a teaspoon of salt, red onion chopped and a quarter cup of coarsely chopped fresh cilantro and LIME juice, not lemon, also lotsa people add a chopped tomato, which is lovely but you can't save the guac in the fridge for long with tomato in it......I guess if you've never had good guacamole, you'd think that recipe was ...meh...but seriously....Another tip to keep the guacamole for turning color (if you have any left over) is to pack it into a glass container with a tight fitting lid but before putting the lid on it, place a piece of saran wrap directly on top of of the guacamole and press it into it lightly so no air will come in contact with it. Then put the lid on.\nOle'"

I'm am 99% positive that this same recipe used to include minced garlic, garlic powder, and onion powder. Recently I noticed that the recipe is different and I've been trying to remember the ratios of everything but I can never get it quite right. I'd love for it to be switched back because that recipe was much better than the one currently here."

Add two cloves crushed garlic, the same amount of tomato as onion plus fresh cilantro leaves. Keep the seed in the container with any leftover guac and it will slow down the process of it turning brown."

I even added in some chopped up habanero pepper to make it more like choka. But I think I will stick to eating my avocados plain cause all I felt I tasted were lemon and onions and none of that wonderful sweet avocado taste :(."

I garnished with tomatoes and onions and ate it with baked tortilla chips. I realized after I started eating it that I forgot the olive oil! I had never heard of putting olive oil in it anyway. I thought it was a tad lemony, but maybe it will stay a bright green color this time in the fridge. I did use probably a little less lemon, than what was suggested, and I also chopped the onion quite small. The main thing that surprised me about the recipe was the 16 servings, I was lucky to get 3 small servings. I will make this again, when I don't have all the ingredients of my typical guacamole, leaving out the olive oil as I did this time."
