First off the rosemary is too noticeable and adds a perfume I don't care for in a burger. I'd suggest leaving that out, and suspect if I did so the oregano would be nezt to remove, then basil, then cutting the garlic in half. and skipping the onion soup. The star of a burger at some point has to be the MEAT."

I did make two small changes. After adding the fresh garlic I decided to leave out the garlic powder. I also used only half the package of onion soup mix as we are watching our salt intake. We will be making these again very soon. We also plan on having them the next time our kids visit."

Only made one mod since to allow for a guest who was not a crazy garlic person like my wife and I. Just trimmed the powder and minced garlic back and found it was a hit for them as well. I think it's always in the chefs hands to tweak as required"

I noticed that some said it was too salty so I decided to forgo the onion soup mix altogether, plus it didn't hurt that I actually didn't have any! Lol.. instead of using onion I tried using a finely chopped shallot and two teaspoons of onion powder. I also decided that the rosemary didn't have any business being in my burger sooo... none of that either. I added just a little bit of salt and some pepper . Also, decided to put the burgers on brioche buns and boy were they good! I thought they were super easy and delicious."

The flavors blend better!"

First, you control the salt...so if you dumped a bunch of salt in after adding all the ingredients, then this must be your first time cooking. AND if you think this tastes like meatloaf, you don't know how to make a meatloaf. Anyway, it is flavorful and grills up nicely (I don't think it would pan fry as well)."
