"reviewBody": "Back in the 60's in the heyday of the Space Age, I lived in Cocoa Beach, FL. There was a restaurant whose signature dish was Caesar's salad. They made a unique dressing that many tried to copy, and the best copy was published in the local paper. I use that recipe to this day, and it's very similar to your recipe, except for the addition on curry powder and eggs. I make it up in the processer or blender and keep it in a glass jar in the fridge for several weeks. I recommend you try adding about half a teaspoon of curry powder, it adds an interesting flavor and an egg or two. It thins it out and makes it richer tasting."

By using light mayo and water, with all of the other ingredients, it's definitely lower calorie than those with oil and eggs!"

I added the paste a little at a time, until I knew I had enough for my particular liking. Other than the paste, I followed the recipe exactly. I made my own croutons for the very first time. I used a fresh baguette loaf, diced the bread into 1\" cubes, brushed the cubes with olive oil and sprinkled them with fresh grated Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper, and then baked them. I used fresh romaine lettuce. My family loved the salad!"

I bake the croutons instead, on 350 for twelve or so minutes with olive oil and maybe some salt and/or poultry seasoning, because I haven't figured out yet how to fry them without ending up with chewy croutons. The dressing recipe on its own is over the top fabulous and I wouldn't change a thing there. My girl isn't super excited about anchovies but has never complained about this recipe, while I might add a fish or two on the side for my plate."

Baked the croutons 5 minutes, drizzled with oil, pressed garlic, salt, and pepper mixture. Baked another 5 minutes. BEST CAESAR SALAD EVER! In fact, best salad of any kind ever. In contention for best food ever. Making it yourself lets you experience the real caesar salad! Oh, and 2 tablespoons of fresh squeezed lemon juice."

It sounds really nasty, but honestly, it wasn't fishy AT ALL. I looked online and 1/2 tsp is equal to 2 fish, so I used a teaspoon. Everyone who loves Ceasar salad loves this recipe and the croutons were excellent as well! Will definitely be making this more often!"

When I followed the directions to a T it ended up tasting a little too much like mayo so I added some more Dijon mustard and minced garlic and it tasted like fresh authentic Caesar dressing!!! I didn’t make my own croutons because my favorite brand is Rothbury Farms—they make the best store-bought croutons. Thank you for such a simple but effective recipe :) Great to have this one under my belt."

I always make my Caesar dressing the \"real\" way: coddled egg, slowly whisked olive oil, etc. Since you're basically making homemade mayo with the other standard ingredients (garlic, parm, Dijon, Worcestershire, anchovy, lemon juice), this seemed an easy way to skip a step. Sorry, didn't like it all. Tasted like Hellman's mayo with add-ins. Was vaguely reminiscent of Caesar, but that was it. Will stick to my old way."
