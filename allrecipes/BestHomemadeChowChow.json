"reviewBody": "Due to a really short growing season this year, I was left with a ton of green tomatoes. A friend mentioned they could be used in Chow Chow. So after finding this recipe I thought I would try it out. I like that this recipe has a whole lot less sugar than many of the other recipes I saw online for Chow Chow. I made this exactly as written except I added 4 tsp of turmeric. And as another reviewer mentioned, I figured that the spices would just go through the cloth since they are ground. So I just added them to the vinegar with the sugar and the horseradish. I boiled it till the sugar was dissolved then added the tomato mixture. It cooked for about 1 1/2 hrs before the tomatoes were tender. This made about 30- 250 ml jars. This is the first time I have made or eaten Chow Chow, and it has been a good experience. Both my husband and I think it is delicious! I can't wait to start trying it as a relish, in omelettes, or maybe even in a grilled cheese sandwich. Thanks for helping me make use of my green tomatoes, and for the great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Thanks for this recipe. I had an abundance of green tomatoes at the end of this season, and since I don't like to waste, I came looking for something to do with them. I was pleasantly surprised. My family loves this recipe. \r\n\r\nMy only question is, why is it suggested that the spices and sugar be put in a cheesecloth. It just melts away into the boiling tomatoes, and leaves a messy cloth to clean up.\r\nMy guess is that the cheesecloth catches the chunks of clove etc. Am I right?"
