It was fine as is, but I played around later with half, and added 2 smoked papika olives and a little of that liquid, and then about a Tbs of sun-dried tomatoes and blended again. Outstanding! Over the top. This is a great base recipe!"

Best part is none of the additives and hidden ingredients that you get with the store bought brands."

Really, why do people pay so much for a small container of this stuff in the grocery stores, when you can make three times that amount, for less, and it tastes so much better? We really enjoyed this. I do have to say, that the garlic flavor does enhance as it sits. I used 2 pretty small cloves of garlic, and after sitting for a few hours, you can really taste the garlic - so keep that in mind when you are deciding on how much to add. You can always add more, but once it's in there, you can't take it away!"

"reviewBody": "Regarding the differing opinions from reviewers about the amount of garlic to use, I would like to point out (from experience) that assessing how much seasoning to add (whether to this recipe, or to recipes generally) should always take into account how much of that food will likely be eaten by any single person. If this hummus is to be served as an appetizer or party dip, especially as just one among several options (and it's most likely that people will have just a few bites of it), then it can be highly seasoned. But if it's to be eaten in larger amounts, or even as a meal, then the garlic (or, for that matter, other strong seasonings in other recipes) should probably be toned down. By the way, with this recipe, you might begin by mincing the garlic and letting it pre-soak in a dish with the lemon juice for a bit before proceeding with the recipe. The acid in the lemon juice should help tame some of the raw garlic's emphatic assertiveness."

I highly recommend doing this. Next time I won't bother with the water and just use the bean liquid. Also, I erred on the side of caution and only used 1 large clove of garlic and that was plenty. I had trouble getting this to blend, so I ended up using about double the liquid than called for. This also needed salt to enhance the flavor. A great base recipe and 5 stars with a few tweaks."

"reviewBody": "Good basic recipe I think water takes away from the flavor so the second time I made it I used the juice from the garbanzo beans. That helps with the flavor issue. I also added a touch of salt and used two cloves of garlic instead of 3 as the flavor intensifies as the hummus sits, and I love garlic."

I wouldn't change a thing, although I made a triple recipe and made two alternatives with part of it: one with steamed yellow squash with cinnamon and cloves and one with chopped basil added. I baked up some pita chips and have been having the best lunches, sampling my 3 dishes alternatively."

"reviewBody": "Whoa! Garlic overload! Obviously garlic cloves vary greatly in size and mine must have been particularly large. I used just one good-sized clove and now as I write this it's all I'm tasting. Thank goodness I made this well in advance of serving so that I had the opportunity to adjust - by making another full recipe omitting the garlic altogether and adding it to the original batch. (Now we're going to have \"hummus overload!\") Perhaps it might be better to just start out with \"a teensy bit of garlic\" instead of the rather vague \"3 cloves garlic.\" Other than that this is a good, basic hummus, tho' for my taste it could use a touch of salt."

"reviewBody": "This is a very good base hummus recipe. It has a good texture and some flavor. Because I like lots of flavor, I would probably add additional garlic and maybe some cayenne, but that is just personal preference. You can't go wrong with this recipe and then you can tweak it with additional seasoning from there."
