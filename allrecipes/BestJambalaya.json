"reviewBody": "I have always enjoyed jambalaya but have never made it until today. This recipe gave me a great base. I added a bit to it and it turned out great. We used hot sausage from Costco because that was what was available. I doubled the garlic, crushed red pepper , and hot sauce (our hot sauce is flavourful but medium heat. I used a yellow pepper and red onion. After cooking the sausage I deglazed with red wine and then cooked the chicken. I used a 28 oz can of crushed heirloom tomatoes. The rice started sticking to the bottom of the Dutch oven so I added the remaining amount of a 975 ml container of vegetable broth. I also added about 2 cups of shrimp. I omitted the file powder because it wasn’t available in my area. I think okra would be a great addition and plan to add that next time."

(That i seasoned and quick fried separately) Used about 2/3 of a 28 oz can crushed tomatoes. I like it a little spicy so upped the hot sauce. In reading the posts about uncooked rice i made sure to cover the pot with foil and lid to help seal. Just opened once halfway through to stir. (Used jasmine rice) Came out perfect."

I used olive oil. I know that sounds like a lot of modification, but the recipe did really help me along with the rest. And, it turned out DELICIOUS!! I took it to the restaurant where I work and where we were serving Jambalya for Fat Tuesday - knowing I would not be able to eat the restaurant's version. Three employess (including a kitchen manager) tried my dish, and all liked it more than the one we were serving; all three saying mine had much more and better flavor! I really loved it, have plenty of leftovers, and will definately be saving this recipe and using it again!"

The recipe doesn't state to either leave it uncooked or prepare it beforehand. I followed the others advice and cooked my rice separately. Didn't have chicken broth so I used chicken bouillon and didn't have filé powder, so I substituted it with cornstarch (both are thickening agents). Added 2lbs of cooked shrimp as well as increased the crushed tomatoes to 28oz instead. I also increased the spice amount (I eyeballed it, shouldn't take too much more). It was absolutely delicious!"

My only changes were 1) I used olive oil, 2) I used 12 oz of sausage and added about a half pound of chicken thighs in addition to the 1lb of chicken breast 3) I used cornstarch instead of file powder and 4) used diced tomatoes because I didn't have any crushed. With the tomatoes I simply crushed them by hand in a bowl before adding. The dish came out excellent. I didn't have any issues like others did with the rice being tough or having to add more broth. There was a nice heat, not overly hot. This was a great tasting and easy to make recipe that I will certainly be doing again. Thanks for taking the time to post it."

I wanted shrimp too so that went into the pot when adding the andouille and chicken back in. To account for the shrimp - the spices, veggies, rice, crushed tomato and broth were increased proportionally. This went really well with a pan of cornbread! A little kick, but not too much."

"reviewBody": "Hello ladies and gents, I'm from Gonzales, Louisiana, the Jambalaya Capital of the World. I may be able to help a little with this recipe. First, use any oil you like. Peanut oil is rather expensive. We don't use tomatoes. That's New Orleans style. It's your choice. We don't use Worcestershire sauce nor file. File is for thickening gumbo. We brown our meat pretty well to get the flavor and color of the rice to a medium brown. Your jambalaya should not be watery. It should be just like cooking a pot of rice. If too soupy, keep cooking longer. Instead of using two products to spice it up, your sausage should have enough season with a helping of cajun spice which can be found in any store. You can use chicken stock if you want, but you don't need it. You can use water instead, but the stock kicks it up a notch. I've been cooking jambalaya since I was 17 and I'm 67 now and no one has ever complained. I hope I helped a little."

I dehydrated mine in my air fryer-130 degrees for literally 10 minutes."

The beauty with this is it is a bit flexible so you can substitute as you go. I don’t have file powder and I even googled a sub for that, but it wasn’t necessary. My rice cooked well and I used a cast iron pot with a lid. The family loved it. Definitely saving this to my saved recipes for use again!"

Fourth, I omitted the file powder. My grocery store didn’t carry it and to be honest I’ve never heard of it. Third I let it cook 35 minutes and last I added shrimp. Adding the extra broth made a big difference. At 35 minutes the rice was 95% done, I think it could have used another 5-10. I don’t know if it matters but I live in a high elevation (Utah) so maybe that’s why it takes longer to cook the rice? Anyway, it turned out great! My family loved it!"

The rice should not be cooked like that, there’s way to much liquid, there’s no need for the tomatoes, and gumbo filé does not belong in jambalaya. Also peanut oil was the worst choice of oil you could’ve used. you need a neutral oil like canola. i can tell whoever made this recipe isn’t from here. if i could give this zero stars, i would"

Cook for 25 minutes. Do NOT touch that cover. The steam will help cook the rice.\n\nOh, also, at step 2, I add okra (frozen diced) to the sautee when cooking the trio.\n\nSource: some random guy from New Orleans posting on some random forum I found at 1 am wondering why my rice was crunchy."

"reviewBody": "My picky family LOVES this recipe! I have made it 3 times, and I think I finally perfected it for us. Here's the adjustments I made:\n1. I leave out the hot sauce and file powder. It's got plenty of heat for us with just the seasoning and Red Pepper flakes.\n2. I use beef Kielbasa instead of anduille, since we already have it and the anduille is a bit hard to find.\n3. I use Zatarain's Creole Seasoning instead of Cajun seasoning. Gives it a great smokey flavor with a bit less heat.\n4. MOST IMPORTANT! After using 1 1/4 cups of normal, long grain american rice the first two times and being dissapointed that the rice was still crunchy, I switched to using 1 1/2 cups of Jasmine rice (uses less water and cooks faster). It was PERFECTLY DONE and delicious!!"
