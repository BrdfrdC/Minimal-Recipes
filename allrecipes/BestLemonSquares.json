They are perfect, easy to make , not to sweet, and out of this world delicious . Thank-you for a great recipe. I love you for it.\nI added some lime scented whipped cream on top for the perfect sin."

Next time I will still double the filling, grease the pan really, really well and reduce the oven temp to 325 degrees sooner. Probably half the baking time at each temp, guessing 30 minutes each."

The second thing I did was increased the temp to 350 for the first 15 minutes then turned down to 325. I baked for 30 minutes. The reason is the first batch was a gloppy mess. It just wasn't anywhere near done and my oven runs a little hot ."
