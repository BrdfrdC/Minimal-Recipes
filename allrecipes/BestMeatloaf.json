I know she did say that internal temp should be 160 though and that was before it went in for the last 10 mins. After cooking completely, it was still way too soft and fell apart. Not a bad recipe, I’ll keep it for the flavor and just tweak it a tad. I definitely won’t put the same amount of sauce/milk in the meat next time."

I I have made this meatloaf 3 times since you posted on allrecipes dot com and can offer a few suggestions- 1. try using beef labeled as just ground beef instead of ground sirloin or ground chuck. Me thinks that somehow the meat loaf tasted even better when I used plain lean ground beef! I will contact Alton Brown for an explanation about this! LOL!; 2. try adding 1 cup of pre-cooked and diced Spam to the recipe! Yes, that Spam! And hold the salt, you will not need it! LOL!; 3. add the zest of 1 large orange and 1/2 cup of your favorite BBQ Sauce to the recipe for the glaze! Now please report back about how you like my suggestions (or not!). Happy cooking!"

"reviewBody": "Before starting, I noticed that the video at right does not follow the baking instructions. The glaze is put on when the temperature is increased for the final minutes. It doesn't show anything about the middle phase. That being said, I followed the video and put the glaze on for the final 15 minutes @ 400°. I am also trying to eat more vegetable-forward, so I prepared this with 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground meat substitute. It worked great, wasn't greasy and had a meaty texture. Could have used a bit more salt b/c of the substitute, but I prefer to let people salt their own food anyway. Otherwise, because we like it spicy I added horseradish to both the loaf and the glaze. I didn't have the whole quantity of sour cream called for. Didn't seem to matter — no issues with dryness, and I didn't add the milk. Overall very tasty and not time-consuming."

So, this was a little fatty but the flavor was incredible. I used 3/4 cup of Progresso Garlic &amp; Herb bread crumbs instead of bread and crackers. I'm not a huge fan of tomato sauce, so my glaze was about 3 parts ketchup to 1 part tomato sauce. Everything else was just as written in the recipe."

I followed it almost exactly, but because I changed the scale (for serving size) I had to adjust a little. The only thing I added was extra sauteed onion, extra Ritz crackers and ground sage. My husband couldn't get enough of this meatloaf. He actually asked me to replace my old recipe with this one! Also, I didn't use the topping in this recipe, I used my traditional Ketchup, brown sugar and worcestershire sauce. *sidenote: I never use all ground beef in meatloaf, I use half extra lean ground beef and half ground pork! I think it gives any meatloaf a better flavor!"

Followed recipe with these changes to ensure my family would love this &amp; due to the fact that with at least 20 cans of various tomato products in the pantry...1... lonely.... 7 oz. can of tomato sauce :-( . Subbed 1/2 can crushed tomatoes in the meat mix, reserving the canned sauce for the topping. Added about 1 T. cholula to the glaze as we like a bit of kick. Free formed the loaf, layered fat-trimmed bacon (to reduce fat a wee bit) over the top then surrounded it with fresh carrots, cut into 2-3\" pieces. Glazed the carrots as well with the yummy. Checked internal temp with instant read thermometer 5 minutes prior to time recommendation-a perfect 160 degrees."

Maybe it was because I was drinking some wine. Lol. It was really good. My husband loved it too. I served it with roasted potatoes, carrots and fennel. Yum"

"reviewBody": "This meatloaf is so fluffy and good. I think lightly whisking the egg and adding the sour cream or youghurt is the key ! I used youghurt instead of sour cream, added more spice, (italian seasoning, mustard, tapatio hot sauce, and turmeric), and skipped the ketchup and crackers. I made mine with less lean burger so got a nice caramelized layer at the bottom. Thank You for this great recipe!!!"

I've found it! \n\nI even screwed it up a little bit and had to use onion power and garlice powder instead of fresh (didn't have the fresh) but followed the recipe with adjustments for these ingredients. \n\nI also read the recipe wrong and put in the full amount of tomato sauce into the meatloaf itself. And, I baked it for an hour on 350 instead of 350 down to 400 degrees. \n\nIT STILL turned out wonderful. Thank you for sharing this gourmet miracle!!!!"

I add bread soaked in milk and breadcrumbs Italian, onions , peppers, garlic minced, onion powder, pepper , egg, parseley, worstershire sauce. The onion I grate. Then pour the tomato sauce and barbecue over to before putting in oven. I love my meatloaf tender and well seasoned. So to each his own. They’re all good."

Pretty good...nice and moist, albeit a little fragile.\nMy mom told me put a little water and olive oil in the casserole pan because I guess that’s always the way she made it. But, she is the type who insists on really blazing the meat and cooks usually to the point of dryness. I followed this recipe as written. My tip is: I think you can skip the water and oil. Unless you lambast your meat too. \nThe end result, again, not bad, but I had quite the pool in the bottom of my casserole. I drained off as much as I could after I transferred it onto a serving platter. I even made beef gravy to go with this, but that probably wasn’t necessary."

I am surrounded by hills so it often acts like a convection oven but I have never had to adjust recipes. I used evaporated milk and it gave a depth of flavor and texture, and did not dry it out. I also added a little more catsup and a couple of dashes of red wine vinegar for the sauce to top the loaf during the final 10 minutes of cooking. I also added an additional eight minutes under the broiler to get a slight char to the sauce. Bonus: Roommate says it is the best meatloaf he has ever had!"

"reviewBody": "Having always before made turkey loaf, making a classic meatloaf was something of an adventure for me. I thought of this at the last minute (of course) and picked this recipe because of the personal note to its title \"….I've ever made.\" Well, not only was it my first, but it was definitely my best ever, and I'll use this as a base recipe from now on.\n\nI made so many changes the author may not wish to claim my version at all, but it came out so well!\n\nFirst, I used ground sirloin (it's hard to go wrong with sirloin). Second, I had no \"store-bought\" white bread, so tore up a couple hamburger buns (I NEVER have hamburger buns in the house, but there they were). Third, I had no—and still have no—idea what crackers were called for, but just took 6 or 8 Ritz and crushed them into the mix. Fourth, canned tomato sauce sounded too bland, so I used a can of fire-roasted crushed tomatoes with garlic. (Since when can one have too much garlic?) Lastly, I didn't have any Worcestershire, so used some A1 I found after rummaging around in the fridge. Whew! Perhaps we should call this \"My Bomb-proof Meatloaf,\" for despite all of my fudging it came out wonderfully moist and tasty. (I followed the cooking directions exactly.)\n\nIn fact, it was so good that I had another large slice around 10:00 pm as a snack! Many thanks for posting this fine guide to Meatloaf! I'm now empowered enough to experiment further and develop a repertoire. But I should imagine I'll always come back to this fine recipe."

Then let it set aside. Then I placed 1/4 Cup of FINELY chopped onion in pan &amp; cooked with butter. As they were almost finished I added (2TBSP) of garlic PASTE(since that’s the equivalent of two cloves) . As they finished up I estimated a little pepper &amp; salt. Crumbled the toast &amp; egg and mixed into meat. Then added the onion and garlic mix and crackers with 1/2 a can of the tomato sauce. At this point I could tell this recipe didn’t need anymore moisture. So I then placed in pan and cooked according to the directions. For the sauce I added the same amount of ketchup but I added about 2 tbsp of brown sugar and then poured most on top until meat was covered. Finished cooking and it was an ABSOLUTE hit for my crowd"

At first, I thought the meat mixture was going to be too moist, but I kept mixing/kneading it, and the bread soaked up the excess. I have a special meat loaf pan (2 pc) that drains the excess fat. It was definitely a hit, and I will make it again."

So..I omitted the milk, and swapped the bread n crackers for italian breadcrumbs. I added the crumbs as needed until the meat was not too wet. I took another readers advice placing bread underneath, perfect idea. I had no loaf pan since we dont usually do meatloaf, yet it held shape perfectly. The sauce I added brown sugar to, yum. Will double to have more for spooning Timing and temps also perfect. Will make for years to come!! Served it with Sallys Spinach n Cheese Mashed Potatoes recipe on this site!"
