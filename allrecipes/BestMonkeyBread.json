Then I cut across the loaves making 1 inch cuts. I then cut each of those \"slices\" into 6 pieces making about 3/4\" pieces of dough. I rolled those pieces in the cinnamon/sugar and put them in the bundt pan with walnut pieces and raisins and allowed them to sit for 30 minutes to rise just a bit more. From there I followed the remainder of the directions as stated. It was done a bit before the full time but was amazing! Didn't last long at all!"

This allowed me to use various ingredients that some of the kids like (raisin and cranberries) and the nuts (pecan and walnuts) that my hubby and I love. I used one can of Walmart biscuits since it was an experiment. Everyone loved them! I cut the parchment paper in a t shape to allow the biscuits to rise and puff up as not to have any spillage in the bottom of the muffin cup. I spooned the brown sugar &amp; mixture on each muffin. The aroma was delightful and filled the house! I'm making more in the morning."

"reviewBody": "I had one can of limited edition Pumpkin Spice Grands and I didnât want to triple it, I had a 5 cup tall bundt. (This adjusted smaller recipe can be used with cinnamon rolls too) I cut the rolls up into smaller pieces -6 per roll- and I added extra spice to the white sugar shake (cinnamon with dashes of cardomon and mace). In a small bowl I mixed up broken pecans, jumbo raisins, and chocolate covered caramel morsels -about 1 cup total. I used just enough dough pieces to make a layer, sprinkled some of nut mix, another layer of dough then nut mix, leaving 2 full rolls of cut sugared dough pieces to make the last layer since it had to cover more surface. Sprinkled the last of the nut mix on top. I only used 1/4 stick butter and 1/3 brown sugar to pour over this smaller pan. I baked it at 325 convection, or 350 reg, for 18 min. I recommend when you flip it out - to put your rack over a plate to catch drips. I decided to wait until the top gooey layer had been pulled off and eaten to use the icing that came with the rolls."

I remember the brown sugar/butter mixture being added to the bottom of the bunt pan, THEN the sugared biscuit being added on top of that so when you turn it out the \"caramel\" runs down. With this, when I turned it out, what is now the top was dry- no sticky, gooey yummy. The butter brown sugar sauce did not melt down through the biscuits during baking. Maybe I cooked it a sec too long- who knows? I think Ill stick to adding the butter brown sugar to the bottom 1st. Kinda like an upside down cake."

It works much better if you melt the butter in the microwave and then add the brown sugar, mix, then pour over the dough. I also used 1 stick and a half and there still wasn't enough to cover the whole bread. Other than that this recipe was delicious and easy to make."

Then I add the premixed dry ingredients to the bowl, and toss it by hand, to make sure all the biscuits are separated. I use a 9 x 13 pan, which takes around 20 minutes to bake. When ready to serve, I cover the pan with tin foil, place a cutting board over the top of the pan, hold on tight and quickly invert."

We did not have a problem with it sticking in the pan but we generously sprayed it. We waited 10 minutes for it to cool and it popped out just fine. One note: I suggest you put the cake pan on a sheet pan in the oven because ours bubbled over and started to burn on the bottom of the oven. We used 12oz refrigerated pillsbury buttermilk biscuits."
