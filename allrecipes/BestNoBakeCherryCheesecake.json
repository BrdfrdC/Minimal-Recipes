I make it in a spring form pan and it calls for a larger amount of the ingredients. Be sure to put cheesecake in the frig while still in the spring form pan. It comes out of it much easier when very cold."

I had to improvise as we are camping and no confectioners sugar and then I decided I wanted to do cheesecake 3 ways (3 recipes) and had to work with three 8 x 12 foil pans with plastic lids. I added 1 tbsp of corn starch for each cup of sugar in the cream cheese mixture and used 3 1/2 cups of cream for the triple recipe. I added the extra 1/2 cup of cream for a little more volume as my pans were bigger than suggested. We had graham bottom with cheery pie filling topping, graham bottom with homemade raspberry sauce and finally a chocolate wafer crust with chocolate syrup drizzled on top. They were a big hit with our guests."

Topped with blueberry pie filling and add fresh blueberries from the fruit section small container, sometimes will use cherry pie filling have also used the sweet pie filling add fresh strawberries any one is a treat anytime of the year.

My husband is diabetic so I substitute Stevia for the white sugar and reduce the amount of icing sugar by about 1/3 of a cup. My family loves it with raspberry pie fill for a topping but I have also made it with fresh strawberries and it was awesome!"

The original recipe tasted just dreadful.\n\nI really wanted to blame the weird after taste on the heavy cream and the fact that I don't often have cream, or maybe it was off? But I only opened the carton for this recipe, and I triple checked the best-before date - I had over a month left to use the cream.\n\nI actually threw out the cheesecake - quite a feat for me. I don't want to risk doing that again so I'll just play it safe and stick with the condensed milk version of this recipe."

I love vanilla so I added 1/2 tsp to the graham crust and 3 tsp to the cream cheese/whipped cream mixture (doubled recipe). Otherwise everything was as is in recipe. The cream cheese/whip cream mixture had a distinct lemon taste without adding lemon juice...due to the extra tsp of vanilla?This recipe tastes better and lighter than the one I used to make with Cool Whip."

It's a winning recipe. People who aren't crazy about dry baked cheesecakes love this. I now make it several times a year for friends' Birthdays because it has become a favourite in my friend group. It's fantastic with any topping and any crust. Actually, one of my favourites was this layered with lemon curd inside a shortbread crust. Delicious."

I had a little more than 8ozs of cream cheese left of a 3# block, so I added a little more powdered sugar. In addition to the vanilla extract, I added a little lemon extract to brighten it up. I didn't have heavy cream, but I had whipped topping. In it went. I have ripe peaches, so I'm going to grill them, slice them and top with them and a dollop of Cool Whip. This is the PERFECT fast go-to refrigerator cheese pie. Get creative!"

It does help if you refrigerate this for a short period between adding layers. (ie) refrigerate briefly after making the crust then again after adding cream cheese mixture but before putting cherries on top. then finally adding cherries and refrigerating till it's done. It gives it a nicer, cleaner appearance."

"reviewBody": "The first time I made this was about 2 weeks ago, a total runny mess! I didn't have heavy cream, so i looked up a substitute (butter&amp;milk) for heavy cream and used it in place- what they failed to say was that for the substitute use for \"cooking and baking\" purposes only, not for \"no bake\" foods. Found that out on another site! As I said it turned into a runny mess that sat in our fridge for nearly a week!!! So today I made sure I had the heavy cream and I also kneaded the cream cheese and let sit out at room temp, before mixing (about 20-30 min). I added in 2tsp of lemon juice to aid in holding shape and 1 1/2 cream cheese, instead of the one. It held perfect form when putting into pre-made shell I will never make that mistake again! As for the taste - D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!! Creamy and nicely formed to cut into.- very happy with this recipe, Thank you!"
