That may have been my fault - I left my bread out on the counter to dry for the day, so it may have been too dry for the volume of custard. I also added a handful of rather elderly raisins to the bottom and between the layers, so they may have soaked up some of the moisture as well. It was tasty enough. Next time, I might use mixed spice or cake spice (or just add some nutmeg and ginger to the cinnamon)."

You don’t put all the flavor on the bottom then cover it up. You need to mix everything together or the sugar will just sit on the bottom...... The butter works fine on the bottom to keep it from sticking but the sugar and cinnamon needs to be mixed with the egg and milk mixture.... I had to get stupid with things to fix it after I’d already added the sugar to the butter on the bottom. Now I have to add more to the recipe when I wake up in the AM because the top is all dry. I had to work from the bottom up to make it mix."

After I put the brown sugar and butter I also put down a layer of chopped pecans and a layer of sliced bananas, I used about 4 large ones sliced thick. It was AMAZING."

Keep an eye on it while in the oven.\n\nIf using a thicker sliced bread (i.e. brioche) be prepared for a longer baking time (45 minutes to an hour).\n\nAs recommended by another reviewer, I added very thinly sliced apples. Turned out beautifully! Syrup was unnecessary."

It was otherwise challenging to cover all of the bread with the egg mixture."

I made morning of, and let it sit for about 3 hours. AMAZING AND LOVED BY ALL OF US :) Will definitely be made many times over as a family treat! Thanks for the recipe :)"

"reviewBody": "Made two batches for having my family over for breakfast, one batch with the brown sugar and one without for a more savory french toast. Both turned out well and were a big hit! I added an extra 2 eggs and 1/4c milk to each recipe because with the 6 eggs and 1/2c some of the bread was still a bit dry, but 8 eggs and 3/4c for each batch was perfect! I think the size and density of your bread probably makes a difference, I used bigger and denser bread (Nature's Own Perfectly Crafted Thick Sliced White Bread is what I used) than a lot of sandwich bread. \n\nThe one without brown sugar was a tiny bit heavy on butter, it was still good and was still eaten and enjoyed, the butter flavor was just a bit strong. Next time I make it without brown sugar I'll probably do 3/4 a stick of butter instead of a whole stick."

So I decided to give it another shot at making baked french toast, after not being so successful in the past. I have a recipe for brioche bread baked french toast that I know my son enjoys, but I knew that the recipe was too decadent for plain old potato bread. Well, I must say I was pleasantly surprised! This recipe is a keeper for sure. I did not make any changes. The only thing I did not do was let it sit overnight as suggested. This came out perfect!"

We made a double batch and used 1/2 c butter, and 3/4 c brown sugar, added an extra 1/2 c milk plus 1/2 T vanilla and used 18 slices of Sara Lee artesano bread. we used 1 - 9\"x13\" and 1 - 9\"x9\" baking dish. We added 1/2 of the cinnamon to the butter and brown sugar and the other 1/2 to the batter. 2 layers of 5 slices of bread each were used in the larger pan, 4 pieces (3 whole and 1 slice cut in half) in the smaller pan. We prepped in the evening, refrigerated about 9 hours, then baked. French toast was flipped onto serving trays and cut into 8 servings for each of the larger pans. Served alongside sausages and fruit. No one added syrup."

I poured that mixture into a 9X13 pan. In another bowl I mixed 4 eggs, 1 cup of whole milk, 1 tsp. Vanilla. I layered the bread on top of mixture, poured half of the egg mixture, I then made another layer adding the other half of egg mixture. Covered and placed in fridge overnight. In the morning I placed it covered in the oven 350° for 30 mins, removed the cover and baked for an additional 20 mins untill the top was light brown. Cool and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Theres no need for syrup as the butter/brown sugar is sweet enough. Just love!"

"reviewBody": "No complaints about the flavors, though next time I would change the technique. Instead of adding butter then brown sugar, I think I will mix the two ahead of time so the sugar is more evenly distributed in the pan. Then I will likely dip the bread in the sugar on both sides, again to even things out. I opted to do the prep just 30 minutes before popping it in the oven but I’m sure the overnight method helps everything soak into the bread nicely. This made for a good brunch item!"

Refrigerated overnight with it clingwrapped, then baked it in the morning for about half an hour. The smell of cinnamon baked bread was lovely but the result was a tad dry, perhaps placing it overnight in the fridge dried it out much? I don't know, taste was alright, the healthier version than pan-fried french toast! The top was crispy so that was the plus. :)"

I added toasted chopped walnuts to the bottom layer and used an extra egg and a little 1/2 &amp; 1/2 because my bread was really dried out when I went to assemble it. I baked it at a little higher temperature (375 degrees) since I wanted it to be nice and brown on the bottom. I served it with apple pie filling that I thinned down with a little water and lemon juice. It was FABULOUS and not overly sweet. Friend took recipe home and leftovers for her husband."

These are the modifications we made:\n1) Used 9 slices of Dave's Killer Bread - Organic 21 whole grains &amp; seeds\n2) Didn't melt the butter, just used soft butter\n3) Put cream cheese chunks between the bread layers\n4) Used cream instead of milk\n5) Covered with foil for 30 minutes of baking, then uncovered and baked an additional 15 minutes or so, until well browned.

I made extra butter and after pouring the recipe amount in the pan, I added another 3/4 cup of brown sugar to the butter and used a brush to brush the top of the bread slices.\n3. I refrigerated as instructed. After baking I added 2 bananas to the butter and brown sugar and cooked on stove top.

"reviewBody": "I thought it was very good with the adaptations I made to recipe. I sprayed the pan with nonstick spray first to make sure cleanup was easy (which it was). The bread I had on hand was homemade sourdough, which worked well for the texture of this recipe. I mixed the butter, sugar, and cinnamon together, and added 2 tsp of pure vanilla extract, and divided them between the bottom and the between the bread layers. I increased the milk to 3/4 cup. I added a topping of cinnamon and sugar lightly sprinkled across the top. I did not wait overnight; I just let it rest for 10 minutes before baking. I baked it at 375 for 40 minutes. After baking, I inverted it onto the serving platter. The only change I'd make to my method would be to put all of the butter/sugar/cinnamon on the bottom instead of dividing it, so it would be even more of a syrupy crust. I had initially thought people would take one slice off at a time, but they stuck together well, so we all just cut our own slices, instead of trying to make it fit individual slices of bread. Will definitely make it again."

I left everything else the same. It was delicious. I removed the bread from the 13 X 9, flipped it over (butter/sugar or brown side up) onto a serving plate. The pieces that were not in the butter/sugar mixture needed a little extra maple syrup per some peoples request. Served with some maple sausage links I cooked in the oven at the same time I cooked the french toast. Also served with some cut up peaches and strawberries on the side."

I used thinly sliced challah bread (pre-sliced from supermarket bakery) in a 9x 13 pan. I also added the extra egg, added a splash half and half and a splash of vanilla creamer to the egg mixture with the 1/2 cup of milk. I figured a little extra liquid would be ok with the extra egg. I then put fresh blueberries in between the 2 layers of bread. I did let it sit overnight and next am sprinkled a pinch of Brown sugar and cinnamon on top prior to baking. I would say it took about 35 min to bake but it was perfect, not soggy at all. I cut the bread slices in half, and flipped the half slices over into a platter (brown sugar side up) drizzled a bit of warm syrup and some more fresh blueberries. It served a group of 10 ladies with some other brunch items. Received many compliments especially from a friend who makes these types of dishes all the time."

I just added it until it looked good enough to me, which was more than the recipe called for. Doing so added a really good cinnamon flavor. The bottom was crunchy, almost like it was caramelized, but the rest of it was soft and the combo was perfect. I added about a tabIespoon of vanilla into the egg mixture as well. I also cut the French toast into French toast sticks. It was a huge hit at our Easter party. The entire pan was devoured in 30 minutes."
