"reviewBody": "Very good recipe and easy to make. I added diced chipotes, diced jalapenos and some green chilis to spice it up a bit. This was done after the beans were cooked, this way you can suit it to your taste. Also to round out the taste and texture a bit of olive oil at the end - gives it some fat."
