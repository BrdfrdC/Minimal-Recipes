"reviewBody": "Terrific recipe &amp; method! Our 2lb Eye roast had a very thin layer of fat on top. It was dried it with a paper towel, sat on the counter for about 10 minutes and then was placed in a roasting pan with a rack. A very small amount of olive oil was used to lightly coat the roast. Seasonings patted all over the roast: salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, thyme and herbs de provence. Roasted at 375 for 1 hour and 20 min until meat thermometer read 140. Thank you for the comments about checking the meat temperature! We have an old oven so it took longer than expected. The meat temp is the key, don't rely on the timing. Covered and rested for about 15-20 min then sliced thin. Delicious, and very tender. The drippings were minimal so if gravy is wanted it does need doctoring up a bit for flavor. The meat itself was delicious! Thanks for sharing!"

I followed the instructions and cooked my two pound roast 20 minutes, per pound, 40 minutes total, as per instructed, and my roast was completely cold in the middle! Not even close to being cooked. It took another 40 minutes to reach the 135° at 375°. Otherwise, it was reasonably tasty. Next time I will probably cook at a lower temperature for a longer period of time though. I find it makes for a much more tender of a roast."

The flavor was really good. Typically I just use salt and pepper. The garlic was a really nice addition. I plan to make all my future roasts like this. I do recommend adding a bit of water though. If you buy roasts low in fat you will need additional liquid. Also it gives you more liquid to use for gravy. YUM"

The issue we have had is that we started our first one with the 20 mins/ pound timing and it came out mostly raw which 4/5 of us did not like. So we made. A second time with 22 mins/ pound and it still came out very rare. The third time we did 25 mins/ pound and it was rare at the ends about an inch in then raw middle. We can’t seem to get the timing down right so it’s rare in the middle vs. raw. Tasty but if people don’t like very bloody meat, you need to cook it significantly longer."

I was fortunate enough to have herb de Provence so I mixed a 1/4 cup of softened butter with 1 teaspoon of herb de Provence, and on teaspoon of black pepper. Lathered the meat with it and applied a generous amount of kosher salt. I was using a convection oven set to roast so cut the temperature down to 350 degrees. The timing was pretty accurate. but I use it only as a guide. The internal temperature rose to a little more than I like. I usually roast to 120 degrees, but went to 126. I let it rest for 15 minutes tented, and when cut was a beautiful pink. I had a very lean eye of round, but there were enough drippings to make a wonderful au jous. I added some red wine to the sauce. I don't use flour in my au jous for I feel that is gravy. not au jous. Reduced it, and the dinner was just spectacular."

"reviewBody": "2.13.19 Well, the reviews are all over the place, so I decided to totally follow the recipe. My roast weighed 2.75 pounds, I cooked at 375ºF for 50 minutes at which time my thermometer was reading 140º, so I removed it from the oven, and let it sit covered with foil for 15 minutes before slicing. Although the meat was perfectly cooked, it was tough as shoe leather. And I’m not faulting the recipe for this because I’m finding more and more often, it’s the meat itself, not necessarily the cooking method. We still enjoyed it even though we did a lot more chewing. To finish off the leftovers, I made roast beef hash one evening, and some open-faced roast beef sandwiches another. After the thinly-sliced beef simmered in the hot gravy for a while, it did soften a bit. I’m almost to the point where I’m about ready to give up roasting beef, because one time it’s tender and the next time with the same recipe, it’s tough. This inconsistency drives me nuts because it’s always “hit or miss.”"

It was delicious even though I forgot to add the salt just before convection baking for 3 hours. Next time, I will remember that to see what the difference is. I found this recipe while searching for a \"Perfection Roast\" recipe where you cook for 5 minutes(?) per pound on 500 then keep the oven doors shut for 2 hours. I couldn't find that specific one, so I tried this and am extremely pleased. Not being stressed at all about it was a bonus!"

Before cooking I layered the top of the roast with onions and center cut bacon. The bacon grease basted the roast while cooking so it wouldn't dry and the excess grease kept the potatoes nice and moist. I also put a half a cup of water in the bottom of the pan before i started. I cooked to 145 in the oven and let it finish on the counter at 150 before slicing. Rave reviews from all the guests at my dinner party! Let the roast sit to room temperature on the counter before you start for nice even cooking."

I have a 'keep warm' setting that I may try or simply turn the oven down to the lowest temp it has. Thanks for the great idea, now I'll work to make it fit my oven."

"reviewBody": "Made this twice now. Taste was good for an easy quick meal. I removed roast from the oven when internal temp reached 135 F and let it rest. Result was a good medium rare, with external slices being more along the lines of medium-well doneness. 2nd time making eye of round I changed the recipe a bit to try making italian beef, added herbs and more seasoning, let roast rest as I did before. Then, wrapped roast in foil and placed in fridge for 24 hours. Result was easy for slicing, but next time I'll remove from oven at 120 F to reach rare doneness after the rest time. If you use this meat to make Chicago Italian Beefs with your own au jus, ya gotta do a rare temp since the slices of meat will be placed in the jus and finish cooking. Anything above rare cook time would result in over cooked beefs--no one likes rubbery italian beefs--that's my opinion anyway. 5 stars for good, basic recipe as written with proper cooking time. Loved being able to follow cook temp in this recipe for da beefs! If only I could master the jus for the beefs, but that's a whole other recipe!"
