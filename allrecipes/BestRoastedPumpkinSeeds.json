These are always better after they have cooled awhile and become crispy - put them in a tupperware container to store."

I just shook the salt over top since the recipe didn't call for a specific amount. These smelled great while baking but were so-so in taste. They were very chewy and not crispy as others I have tasted. I was afraid that I would hurt the crown on my tooth. Thanks anyway."
