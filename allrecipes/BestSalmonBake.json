"reviewBody": "Very easy to make! I made this for dinner last night and my husband and son loved it. My son went back for seconds which he never does with salmon. And we eat a LOT of salmon since we live in a salmon fishing village in Alaska. I followed some of the other reviews and squeezed fresh lemon over the top just before putting in the oven (the picture shows lemon, but the recipe doesn't call for it??). I also sprinkled garlic salt. My husband even re-named it, \"Salmon Fresco\"! He even said the dish looked like something served in a nice restaurant. The tomatoes and green onion don't add flavor to the salmon (like a marinade would because it seeps into the fillet) but taste great on their own, enhancing each bite with fresh-tasting flavor. Delicious!"
