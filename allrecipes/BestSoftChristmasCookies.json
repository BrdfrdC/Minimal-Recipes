These cookies hold up well - mine were left out overnight for icing to dry, and then frozen and thawed twice, and shipped across the country! After more than two weeks, they are still delicious! I used the Sugar Cookie Icing from this site, and they've just been the best cookies I've made to date!"

I didn't even bother with the margarine, and used butter. I wish I had read more of the comments before making it. That's what I get for not listening to my gut when I saw how much flour it asked for! The dough even after chilling was like dust dry, I couldn't even roll it into balls without them falling apart! Let alone roll it out to cut shapes in. Dang shame."

"reviewBody": "I tried this recipe to see if it was better than the one I had been using. Sadly it is not. I followed the recipe. The dough was a bit crumbly but once it warmed up a bit it rolled just fine. They cut out ok. Not great because of the crumbly dough but ok. I baked the first batch at 400¬∞ for 8 minutes. Over done. Cut it down to 6 minutes. The thinner cookies were still too brown. Thicker ones were just right. Thin cookies were hard. Thicker cookies were softer but not truly soft. Ok so that brings me to taste. These are almost tasteless. So bland, not even a butter taste! Overall I am not impressed with this recipe."

Made sure they were not too thin although I made a couple too thick and they are enormous. Used 1 tsp of lemon extract in addition to the vanilla and brushed them with a lemon glaze (butter, lemon juice, powdered sugar) and then decorated them. Beautiful and tasty!!"

Fist batch we over cooked a bit, not burned but not soft...at 8min at 400F so then we reduced time to 6min each time cured that. FYI We are in Colorado with a Bosch oven. I think 8 was too long for the fist batch but might have been perfect for the rest of the batches since the oven lost heat each time it was opened....the taste is perfect. Now we‚Äôre excited for the decorating!"

Also I cooked it at 375 for about 8 mins and they turned out well. It‚Äôs true, you need to make sure not to roll them too thin or bake them too long. What I really loved about these cookies is that they are NOT overly sweet so they pair really well with an sugary icing when you decorate them."

(It depends on how big your eggs are and how much ‚Äúliquid‚Äù they add.) I did roll it into logs and then chilled it, and used it as ‚Äúslice &amp; bake‚Äù cookies and let the kids put decorations on them before baking. Even though the dough got a bit warm by the time the kids were done they didn‚Äôt spread too much at all. They are not TOO sweet, and are firm when baked but turn into a chewy goodness in your mouth!

I knew right away this recipe (using 3 cups flour) was going to be different when I finished mixing all ingredients. Instead of being dry and heavy, the dough was soft with a touch of stickiness. Just be sure to move it along when cutting them out and placing on sheet or else they lose their shape which happened to mine due to family distractions while I was trying to finish. But they still look ok and taste great! Thanks to the author for this keeper recipe."

Also these will be prefect to roll into sugar and/nuts and do thumbprint cookies with."
