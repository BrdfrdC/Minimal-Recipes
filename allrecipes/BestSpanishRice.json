I used 1/2 large onion chopped, 1/2 c finely chopped red pepper and our usual Basmati rice on hand. For the broth I used \"Better than Bouillon\" chicken broth; and rather than the picante sauce, I used 1 c of our salsa on hand which happened to be medium Tostitos salsa, that I pureed. It all came together so nicely. I garnished it with fresh cilantro and served with extra optional cilantro. Yum! My son and 2 daughters enjoyed it and hubs mentioned at least 3 times, just how good it was!"

I also like adding some frozen corn a few minutes before the end of cooking just to add another flavor element. But just as it is, this recipe is a hit and not to be missed."

"reviewBody": "This is really tasty and so very simple. I do have a couple of notes, though. First, pay attention to the amount of liquid you're using. I tend to use chunky salsa instead of picante sauce - it's just what I usually have on hand. But if you do that, you'll need to up the total amount of liquid used. Generally, you want a 2-1 water-to-rice ratio, and chunky salsa is not 100% water, so I use about 1.5 cups of chunky salsa and 2.5 cups of chicken broth. I've also added some crumbled bacon (or jarred bacon bits) while it cooks and sprinkle on some shredded cheese once it's done, just to dress it all up a bit. Maybe top with some sliced green onion as well?"

Because I am at 9,600 feet elevation, I have to use ALOT more liquid when making rice. I also added 1 tsp of taco seasoning. I took this rice to a pot luck and had maybe ¼ cup left over. It was a hit. Definitely a keeper!"

"reviewBody": "I made my own Spanish rice as an experiment years ago and this is almost exactly what I did! I didn't add the extra onions, but I did heat up a little butter and olive oil to toss the rice with before adding to the chicken broth/salsa water. It turned out absolutely perfect as this one is. The extra onion does give it a little more flavor. As someone else stated the liquid ratio may be light depending on (my guess) your salsa choice. I have to use an extra 1/4 to 1/3 cup broth and watch the last 5-10 minutes that it doesn't use it up before it's done."

I’ve made this several times with different salsa and a few times have been disappointed. Since salsa is your only ingredient with any flavor it plays a HUGE part in the outcome."

I’ve made it a few times and I now bulk it up to make a main dish out of it.\nI sauté meat with the onion, often a mix of chicken and shrimps, or chicken and sausage, anything you have. It’s also great with leftover rotisserie chicken or pork loin. I add more veggies like peppers, mushroom, spinach, etc. It’s really easy to add ingredient and very forgiving."

I have never had a problem with the rice being hard but I usually use the rice to liquid ratio on the bag, depending on what type of rice I have on hand. Long grain seems to work best. I also cook the rice till it's translucent. I have other recipes that use this method and I like the added flavor it adds. And I have started adding the cumin! What an easy and good recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Don’t let the simple ingredients fool you. I have tried about five different other recipes for Spanish rice. This one was spot on the closest to what I find in Mexican restaurants. I have made it three times. The first time it was great. The second time I didn’t have any bottled salsa so I used a fresh salsa.. The fresh salsa did not have enough tomato (sauce) backbone. So definitely use the traditional bottled salsa. The third time I added some cumin and although it did taste great it did not taste like restaurant style rice. Only suggestions I would have is since chicken broth usually comes in less than a 2 cup can, I used one can and upped the salsa to almost 2 cups. If you want it spicy or use hot salsa, a little less medium salsa, and my family actually prefers mild. For the traditional taste of Mexican restaurants I recommend using mild. One other note, make sure the rice is lightly browned before adding wet ingredients. Otherwise your rice will become sticky."
