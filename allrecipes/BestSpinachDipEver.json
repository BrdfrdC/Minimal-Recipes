I ended up using almost 2 10oz bags (approx 18 oz) of frozen chopped spinach and 8 oz of water chestnuts (after adding all the extra spinach, I decided to use the rest of the can for balance). This resulted in rave reviews all night and folks actually cursing me for making dip so delicious they couldn't stop eating it. 4 stars as written, 5 stars after my alterations."

I also tried using frozen chopped kale instead of spinach and couldn't even tell the difference in flavor at all so I'll continue using kale. I added it in frozen and it worked great, I didn't notice any difference in the consistency of the dip at all either, which was surprising to me."

Also, instead of using just mayonnaise try using Miracle Whip! As in 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup Miracle Whip. Such a better flavour! I have never once thawed the spinach either. Chop it up still frozen and just mix it all in. Beyond perfect every time and is not the least bit watery! Actually, I thawed it out one time just to see what it was like, and it was 10x better frozen!"

I really liked using the leek soup mix as opposed to the vegetable or onion soup mix. This was fantastic as a veggie dip! The end result was like a thin dressing- I probably should have squeezed more liquid out of the spinach- so I blended in some cream cheese and that helped thicken it up some more. Really liked this - will make it again!"

When it comes to sour cream and mayo keep the same and add some Greek plain yogurt to the mix and if you can find it.. dried spinach. And of course let it set will not be watered down. The yogurt gives more health and a zip to it. Your welcome."

The second time I made these changes for Easter and my family devoured the entire thing in about an hour! - Use the entire bag of spinach. - Did not add water chestnuts. - Add 1 small tub of herb and garlic cream cheese (another reviewer's suggestion). -Add 1 cup of shredded parmesan. Did not put in sourdough bread. I am keeping this recipe forever. It actually made it to my physical recipe box!"

This was really easy to make and I followed the recipe exactly. I don't eat it so I don't know how it tasted, but like I said earlier, we filled the bread bowl a total of three times throughout the party."

Also, squeeze all the water out of the spinach so it will not be so soupie. Adding a little extra spinach may help as well. \nThis recipe is almost exact to knorr recipe, except it‚Äôs veggie mix instead of leek mix and knorr suggest green opinions. The taste is very similar, some prefer one over the other. However, you can not go wrong with either soup mix. \nI pretty much followed the recipe as written. \nI did add the green onion and pimentos. \nI also used an entire box of spinach. \nnext time I will use a red bell pepper, a little garlic, more water chestnuts, and a box and a half of spinach for a little more texture. This was my first time making spinach dip and it was a hit. I served it with pita and tortilla chips.."

I chop the chestnuts and throw it all together. There's never enough sour dough bread so I get 2 sour dough bagels and cut them down the middle into quarters. Then I cut each long piece with scissors. Much faster and every piece has some crust on it. Sour dough bread is the only bread to use. Just like the mayo, never salad dressing."
