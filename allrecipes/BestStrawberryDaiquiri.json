If you measure out the frozen strawberries as indicated (about 6 strawberries weighed), you need the ice because it’s not enough on it’s own. One could certainly double or triple the strawberry amount to reduce the sugar and ice amount, but I tried this recipe exactly as written and it’s wonderfully spot on. Tastes just like it would at a restaurant. I will be making these again. Thx for the great recipe!"

This recipe is very versatile and all combinations I have made have been raved about by my party guests!"

Next time I make this, I am going to increase the amount of strawberries to at least 5 ounces and I'm going to make a simple syrup with the lime juice, lemon juice and sugar to make sure the sugar is completely dissolved. I blended it for quite a while last time and I still had sugar at the bottom of my glass. I also left out the lemon-lime soda - it didn't seem right to add it - unless you are leaving out the rum, then I would add it in. As far as taste, this was just as good as, if not better than any daiquiri I've ever ordered out... so good!"

Anyhow, we made virgin daiquiris using a total of 1 cup of lemon lime soda, 1/3 cup of standard granulated sugar, 1/4 c of lime juice, 8 ounces of frozen strawberries and 4 1/2 cups of ice/ Great change of pace to accompany dinner."

And it doesn't matter whether I use fresh-squeezed lemons/limes or use the pre-squeezed juice in bottles or whether I use fresh or frozen strawberries. The only thing that really makes a difference is using powdered sugar rather than regular, since the regular doesn't dissolve or distribute evenly. I'm also liberal with what 4 oz. of strawberries means to me. I've tried this with raspberries, too, and am looking forward to trying it with mangos. Mmmmm! Thanks for the great recipe!"

I used fresh strawberries, fresh lemon/lime juice and orange-flavored sparkling water ('cause I didn't have any lemon-lime soda) and a tiny bit of peppermint oil. Garnished with a spring of mint and a lime slice.\n\nOMG and don't drink it too fast...I got two or three brain freezes before I slowed down! LOL"

I don't know if all of the ingredients are necessary, like both the lime and lemon juices. I've only ever made it with Captain Morgan, not Malibu. And I add significantly more rum than called for."

I used frozen whole strawberries, I did make a simple syrup and used 1/2 c of that, sweet and sour mix (I had it so I used it), and but the blender on slushie. Everyone loved them and if too sweet, added a squeeze of lime into the individuals glass to suit their taste :-) Make some non-alcoholic ones tonight for our Sunday movie night! Thanks for this recipe!!"

I also mistakenly bought frozen limeade concentrate instead of soda. When I made the limeade up, it worked fine. My friend who is not much of a drinker requested additional rum. We almost doubled the amount of rum (bottoms up!), and the drink still masked the flavor very well. I would HIGHLY recommend, but I would also highly recommend buying FRESH strawberries for this drink."

I also cracked my blender and half the ingredients came out and I re-did it. And my blender really sucks and is old. But despite all that, my frosty concoction turned out pretty good! It could use more strawberry taste, but if I didn't put in so much ice... :)"
