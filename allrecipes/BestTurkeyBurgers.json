I had no problem with grilling them - they were terrific and the recipe goes into the \"summertime\" dinner rotation."

After reading through the reviews of this recipe I followed some of the suggested modifications. 2 tablespoons of soy sauce rather than salt and 1 teaspoon of worcesterchire sauce. I also used 2 cloves of garlic rather than 1 (because I love garlic). Everything else was exactly according to the recipe. I served these on slightly toasted cracked wheat buns with white cheddar cheese, grilled onions, tomato slices, lettuce, and the usual condiments. So delicious!!!"

WELL...wonder of wonders, my husband said \"These are really REALLY good and I think I prefer these to the regular hamburger patties you make!\" I am dumbfounded! I loved the recipe for me and made extra patties for the freezer, but when Steve said that I KNEW this recipe is a keeper. I highly recommend it for flavor, ease of preparation and the fact that \"picky\" people will love it too. Thanks so much for sharing this!"

Onion was two slices med onion and garlic 1/2 large clove, both finely minced. Finely snipped parsley until it looked like about right, like 1 Tbsp. 1 Tbsp plain breadcrumbs, 1 egg white beaten until frothy then about half roughly 2 Tbsp. 1/4 tsp salt and freshly ground black pepper until it looked right. IT TURNED OUT GREAT! Topped with a provalone slice while hot then between bun with mustard, raw onion rings and lettuce. YUM"

Served with bacon, cheese, avocado, and Sir Kensington‚Äôs Garlic Everything sauce. Delicious!"

The second time, I used fresh parsley, but less than the recipe called for. I didn't want to overwhelm the burgers. *And one cool feature I have always loved about Allrecipes. com, you can tweak it by using the \"adjustment\" feature. My family only needs 4 burgers, so I put four in the adjustment, and it calculates how much of each ingredient I'll need. - Z. Mitchell, North Carolina."

Precooked meat will aggressively absorb any moisture from the eggs. You will need to flash cook the precooked meat at a higher temperature with more oil in the pan to prevent scorching. Just play it by ear and you will get an idea how much oil and how hot to push it."

It was a quick recipe and I thought the taste of them were pretty good. They taste a lot better and have more flavor than the turkey burgers you get from the freezer section of the grocery store, so I plan to make these again. I'll be tweaking the recipe a little more."

"reviewBody": "Very nice recipe. I only made this for two, so the portions of things were adjusted wildly. I used a whole egg (I will try to use less next time) and a bit more bread crumbs than suggested (1/2 italian seasoned bread crumbs, 1/2 panko), 2 garlic cloves, grated shallot instead of onion, 1/2 tsp. umami mushroom spice and 1/2 tsp. 21 seasoning blend (both Trader Joes), a glugg of soy sauce and worcestershire sauce, 3/4 tsp. seasoning salt instead of regular salt, probably double parsely. I cooked on med-high for 5-6 min, per side. The burgers were very good, but could have taken even more seasoning,"

I was worried that the mixture was too gummy as it was difficult to mold into burger patties, but I formed each patty on its own piece of parchment paper which made it easy just to flip the paper over to put them on the grill. They turned out perfectly - moist and held their shape. I did add a bit of Worcestershire sauce to mine, too."

"reviewBody": "First I made this recipe exactly as written. I found it lacking in flavor for my taste but a great foundation recipe. Here's how I adjusted it to add a lot more flavor. I used sauteed caramelized onion in the mixture instead of raw onion. I also added a tbs of caramelized garlic paste which I make myself. (recipe for the garlic paste below) I used Johnnies Seasoning instead of salt and pepper. I used 2 whole eggs instead of egg whites. The mixture was quite loose so I did not cook them on a grill as it would have made a mess on the grates. I sprayed just a wee bit of avocado oil on the burgers and cooked them in my basket style air fryer on 375 F for about 7 mins. After the patties cook for a few minutes they firm up quickly so they are easy to turn. These cook very quickly so don't over cook them. \nI made a dressing to go on toasted buns using mayo and marinated sun dried tomatoes mixed together about an hour before serving so the sun dried tomatoes hydrated. I also put sweet banana peppers on the burgers."

I had one pound of turkey so I used the Allrecipes' adjustment. And, you can grill. Of course, the grill needs to be very hot and the burgers should be brushed with oil (I used olive oil). \n\nI had to use celery tops (chopped finely) because I didn't have parsley. But all other ingredients were used and I didn't add or replace anything else. \n\nThank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!!!!\n\nOh ...forgot to say I used 93% lean/7% fat ground turkey."
