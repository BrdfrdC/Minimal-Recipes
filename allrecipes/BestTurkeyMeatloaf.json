Lol. Actually lazy version is just as good if not better. No crackers. Use stuffing mix (not cubed). It adds herbs ie flavor. Ground Turkey or chicken is bland. I used plain almond milk. No one knows. Please don‚Äôt add salt. Plenty in stuffing mix. No brown sugar? Who keeps brown sugar if not a baker? You don‚Äôt need it. But if you want the sweetness then make your own. It‚Äôs 2-3 tablespoons of molasses to one cup white sugar. Who has molasses? Much preferable for pancakes than store bought syrup. Unless maple. Maple syrup is so good. But I digress. That should do it. Good luck!"

My nephew who normally doesn't like meatloaf couldn't stop raving about it he loved it! It has become a favorite meal and if there are any leftovers which is rare, it makes for awesome meatloaf sandwiches the next day if it makes it that long usually I wake the next morning to an empty dish. Thank you for the recipe."

I used two full 20 ounce packages of ground turkey. Instead of crushed crackers I used about a cup of Italian bread crumbs, threw in some extra garlic and came up with a good sized meatloaf that tasted great. I think it‚Äôs delicious and you can add or subtract ingredients to suit your taste."

I'm no stranger to Worcestershire and Ketchup but it takes almost a 1:1 ratio to give it the effect taste. I use it for steak sauce at home a lot. this was overly sweet, not a lot else going on. Sorry, I like savory maincourses. We will make due with left overs I think I can salvage something else out of it but this was disappointing."

Cut out the salt altogether and used panko instead of the cracker and only the egg white, almond milk and adjusted where needed for 2 lbs of the turkey. Instead of the original toping (again to avoid the salt) I used a Carolina BBQ sauce. It came out very moist and not much in the way of extra juices in the pan when cooking."

I made it mostly as the recipe stated however I didn't have all the exact ingredients. I did add minced veggies to this to try and pull a fast one on my kids and it worked! Bonus: I minced onions, 2 slices of bacon, handfull of mushrooms, fresh spinach, fresh kale and cooked those down in a sauce pan with a little EVOO. I then combined everything together like the recipe calls for. I omitted all the sugar and added the worcestershire to the meat mix instead and topped with ketchup only the last 30 min. This recipe came out amazing and my super picky kids asked for seconds!!!"
