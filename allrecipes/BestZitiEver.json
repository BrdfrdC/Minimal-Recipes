Last time I used copious amounts of mozzarella in my lasagna, it dried up somewhat. So I left the mozzarella for the top of this ziti. Came out well. I added an egg and some heavy cream to the ricotta to keep it creamy, not “cakey.” Added grated parm and spices salt/pep to the ricotta and did the layering with sauce and sausage. Everyone loved it. The 9x13 pan is perfect size. This recipe is a good one!"

My only changes are using fresh basil in the marinara instead of dry, and I use italian blend cheeses instead of just mozzarella to give it that extra flavor. I assemble it the night before, cover it and put it in the fridge. When I'm ready to bake it I throw it in at 350 for an hour. I love how crisy the top cheese gets when leaving it in longer. My family loves this ziti and the next day leftovers taste even better. Try this if you love simple and flavorful recipes that are easy to make."

I used 1 jar of tomato and basil and 1 jar of olive oil and garlic - Bertolli. Also, if you like the hot sausage you may want to try that. I prefer the mild so the taste was perfect! I have made it three times now and always get rave reviews!"

Used Fusili (curly shaped pasta) just one jar of marinara (unheated). Omitted the Italian seasoning. Had some prepared frozen meatballs and put 9 meatballs (18 total) on top of each 8x8 baking dish and pushed them under the cheese (it was an after-thought but worked great). Easy to put together and my husband LOVES it (told me to make it again). :)"

The thing I would change next time is make sure to use a large yellow onion instead of the enormous one I used making the dish too oniony. \n\nMaybe it should be measured by cups of instead of a single onion. I also don't think I used the proper amount of sauce as I read the instructions to mean a total of 24oz. Still am not sure which is correct. \n\nI'd also add a little more Italian sausage next time. Really good considering all the mistakes I made along the way."

"reviewBody": "Recipe is \"okay\" the way it is written but a few sight adjustments will make this simple dish really good. First, cook pasta only about 5 minutes and let the sauce (yes you will need more than what is called for here) soak into and finish cooking the pasta in the oven. Use 4-5 cups of a good sauce. Use 15oz Ricotta and add 2 Tablespoons of Olive Oil (go ahead and put the basil here instead of the sauce)and add about 1/3 cup parmesan to the mixture, forget the Italian seasoning expecially if you are using a good seasoned sauce. Increase mozzarella to taste but be sure to sprinkle the top with about 1/4 cup parmesan too. For those that complained about using several pots, simply use the pasta pot to cook the sausage after you have dumped the pasta out, then put the sausage aside and heat your sauce in that same pot. Still find it a bit bland? Add about 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes to the sausage while browning. And yes, a pound of pasta, pound of sausage, over 3 cups of cheeses, plus several cups of sauce layered into a 9X13 pan is definitely going to make more than 4 serving...LOL...just read the recipes and do the math."

Definitely a keeper, will be adding this to my favorites. I found a recipe here Best Marinara Yet, now I always make my sauce by this recipe(plus add 1 can tomato paste). I always read the reviews which make this site unique and the best. So I took the advice and used Turkey Italian Sausage instead, sauteed 1 diced onion, 2 cloves chopped garlic, and 1/2 a red pepper with the sausage. I also added a light coat of shredded parmesan cheese. Served with a garden salad and Garlic Bread. Could not be more pleased. Thank you very much!"

You can but the real italian resturants don't and is worth the extra effort to make your own!\n \nThis was fantastic. I made my own gravy (sauce) from scratch with olive oil,garlic, fresh basil,ground black pepper, little fresh oregano, fresh basil from the garden, 1/4 cup red wine (chianti) crushed tomatoes. locatelli cheese and tomatoe paste (I don't like jar sauce)then I followed all the instructions except I used half pound of semolina ziti and a half pound of whole wheat penne cooked ala dente (9 minutes). I also used 1 full pound of ricotta, plus sharp provolene, grated romano, locotelli and 1lb mozzarella and cooked 1 hour at 350. My sausauge was real italian with fennel. and on the top more 4 cheese and a lot of fresh basil fron the garden. Turned out fantastic! We always serve this with a mixture of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, oregano, fresh garlic &amp; garlic powder. a little hot pepper, salt , fresh ground pepper and fresh tomatoes cut in quaters and fresh italian bread for dipping in the oil mixture. Served with red wine we like Chianti."

The only thing I did differently was to \"doctor up\" the jarred marinara sauce by sauteing fresh minced garlic, finely chopped onion, green pepper &amp; mushrooms in the saucepan before adding the sauce &amp; basil. I also threw in about 2 T. of grated Parmesan cheese. I let the sauce simmer about 20 minutes while I prepared the rest of the ingredients, then assembled &amp; baked as directed."
