Used hickory bbq sauce with the ketchup, used Dijon mustard, a little cinnamon and I sautéed the onions in the grease with the bacon after I cooked it and mixed it all in with the bake beans. I also added buttered white rice. Turned out really delicious. Next time I’m mixing it with some ground beef and adding green peppers. Thanks. Really good!!!"

The beans were a hit even with the carnivores! Nothing leftover. Will definitely make agin."

I've made similar recipes and enjoyed them, but this is the first I've seen using pancake syrup - and I liked it. Next time I make this I'd be curious to swap it out for real maple syrup. I prepared this a little differently and was very happy with the results - I diced the bacon and sauteed it, then added the onions and cooked them until tender - didn't want to risk ending up with raw onion."
