I made a single serving size as opposed to the 4 servings, and made my husband one of the boxed spanish rice with real rice. I let him try both and he liked the cauliflower one better. I followed the directions exactly, even the full amount of water and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Tasted fresh and wonderful."

"reviewBody": "This rice is good it's the second time I made it. The first time I made it as stated and it was fine but a little bland. This time I used canned tomatoes with the green chiles and subbed water for the chicken broth (didn't actually have broth). I also added a green bell peppers with the onion to sautée. I added some salt pepper and a little chili powder and cumin to the liquid. Once it boiled I added the rice and let it simmer on low for maybe a min then added some cilantro and took it off the heat. It's instant rice so it doesn't need to be simmered. Turned out better this time but still a little bland for my taste. My boyfriend doesn't like a lot of heat so this adjustments were just right for him. I'd def add japalenos and more spice if you want more heat."

"reviewBody": "Thank you mjhutch for this recipe. I tried other rice recipes on this site, but since I'm a cooking know-nothing, I screwed 2 of them up. This one, though was by far the easiest. Following the super-easy instructions my rice came out perfect! (I used the instant white rice like the recipe asked for. I also added the cilantro at the very end, like someone else suggested.)\n\nNext time I made this I altered the recipe as follows: added 1 small can of diced jalapenos and some fresh cut corn kernels, to the rice- tomatoes-broth mix. Then about 1/2 way through the simmering I added 1 cut zucchini. (I added the zucchini late to keep their color and crunchy texture.) This tasted so good and made it so hearty, almost a meal in itself.\n\nBeing Mexican (that's why I added the japalenos), I know Spanish Rice, and this is among the best I've had! Now everyone is asking me about the recipe and even my mom can't believe I made a spanish rice better than hers! Rename it \"Best Spanish Rice!\""

As others recommended I used diced tomatoes w/ green chiles, I added a spoonful of tomato paste to boost the tomato flavor, vegetable broth (to make it vegetarian), a dash of cumin and a little chili powder. It was more flavorful this way and I would probably make this again for a quick throw together side dish. Made it as an accompaniment to the Delicious Black Bean Burrito recipe from this site, which I highly recommend."
