One reviewer made a remark about using \"chemical-laden cream of chicken soup\", which sent me on a mission to find out just what chemicals Campbell's cream of chicken soup is \"laden\" with: CHICKEN BROTH (WATER, CHICKEN STOCK), MODIFIED CORN STARCH, CHICKEN FAT, SEASONED CHICKEN, VEGETABLE OIL (CORN, CANOLA AND OR SOYBEAN), WHEAT FLOUR, SALT, CREAM, YEAST EXTRACT, MODIFIED MILK INGREDIENTS, SOY PROTEIN CONCENTRATE, ONION POWDER, VINEGAR, BETA CAROTENE, FLAVOUR (CONTAINS CELERY). Beta carotene is a naturally-occuring pigment found in yellow &amp; orange fruits and vegetables. It is an antioxidant, which your body turns to vitamin A, in the quantities it needs. Next I'll try oven-cooking this in my cast iron skillet, as another reviewer suggests."

"reviewBody": "The best way to add flavor to chicken is to begin seasoning it several hours before you cook it. Just ask Paula Deen. You don't have to make a wet brine, just sprinkle salt and seasoning on the chicken and give it a rub. In an hour, the chicken will drop juice, and when you come back a couple of hours later, the juice will be gone, having been sucked back into the chicken, along with the flavors of the seasonings you used. For those who like spicy chicken, I suggest using a dry spice (cayenne, ground chipotle, hot paprika, Szeshuan, whatever you like or have on hand). That way you're not diluting the dunk with another liquid. I also prefer bread flour to AP flour, as the extra protein packs a bit more crunch. To make those craggy, crunchy bits on your chicken, pour some of the dunk mixture into your flour and work it well with your fingers. You will notice that the flour will form lumps (flat craggy bits), that will stick to the chicken and give you a craggier, less smooth fried chicken. Craggy = Crunchy."

I did buy a special oil thermometer to make sure I had the oil at the right temp and I think that was helpful. My one critique is that it was almost kind of bland. I am making it again this weekend and will use more seasoning. I will probably also be using up my cream of chicken with herbs, so maybe that will add a new flavor."

The only change I made was that I used gluten free flour because 3 of the 6 of us in my family cannot eat wheat/gluten. Only thing I may change is to add more salt and seasonings next time. Will definitely make this again- it was so moist inside and golden on the outside and only took 7 minutes to fry. The family loved it. Thank you for a great recipe!"

Like many I added a lot more spices to my mix, we like a spicy fried chicken with lots of flavor, and I partially boiled my chicken in heavily salted water (your chicken gets done all the way and the meat gets seasoned as well!). Other than that made it exactly as directed! It was super crunchy and absolutely picture perfect."

"reviewBody": "Wow! This chicken was better than the best. Crispy outside and still nice and juicy inside. Awesome! \n I used 20 chicken tenders. One can of the Cream of Chicken Soup worked well. I do not add salt to anything. I did have one change. I used Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb along with all the other spices. This made 3 batches of yummy goodness. The last batch I sprinkled a dusting of cayenne pepper over prior to frying. Every batch was delicious. The photo I added really shows the crispiness. I will experiment with different soups and maybe even Ranch dressing next time."

My husband doesn't care for garlic, but didn't notice the garlic in this."

I end up using cream of mushroom soup most of the time and it tastes just as good as if you used cream of chicken. I use chicken strip tenders in place of breasts to cut down on cutting,cooking time and mess. I also use peanut oil and it gives it more taste than using vegetable oil. I also don't use a plastic bag for the coating. Instead I use a baking dish and roll it and spoon it over it. It keeps your flour mixture from getting too chunky and moist. Very good recipe, we enjoy it at least twice a month!!"

The only change I made was using cream of mushroom soup since that was what I had on hand. The level of seasoning was perfect for our tastes. Definitely must let the coated chicken sit until the coating gets doughy before you fry it up, as the author suggests. Will absolutely make this again and again!"

"reviewBody": "this recipe was JUST OK! THe crust was super thick and for me...maybe because i can already make great/seasoned fried chicken. The cream of chicken soup did nothing but made everything so much messier. THe key to good chicken is...buttermilk, a generous amount of garlic POWDER, onion POWDER, paprika, Season salt, salt and pepper, all purpose flour. Taste a little of your flour (just a tiny bit on your finger) and season to your preference. Honestly, to get the perfect seasoned chicken, you have to practice making your special floured batter...(do measurements and write it down)...and one day...you will have the perfect batter recipe for you."

After reading the reviews, I marinated the chicken in the soup mix for about 3hrs and I added every spice I could think of and the measurement of each spice was 1/2 tbs. I put salt,pepper,cajun,cayenne,italion,oregano,and garlic seasoning. I probably put a few others that I can't think of. I recommend adding as many spices and possible and a lot of each.

"reviewBody": "I brought this to a picnic the other day and all my friends loved it. I did read many of the reviews prior to making this so I did put extra seasoning in the coating (1/2 or 1 tsp of the following: Lawry's seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, Tony's creole seasoning, garlic and herb blend; plus 40 grinds of black pepper). I pretty much put seasonings in until the coating was fragrant enough for my taste. I also marinated the chicken overnight in the cream of chicken with garlic cloves, cayenne pepper, black pepper, the seasoned salt and onion powder added to it (I probably used 1/2 teaspoon of each of the dry spices). Once coated with the dry coating, I placed the chickens on my cookie rack with paper towels underneath for 45 minutes, turned them over and let sit for another 45 minutes before frying. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and deep fried them in peanut oil for 8 minutes. Results were perfect! Chicken was juicy and flavorful and the coating had a great crunch on it."

"reviewBody": "Yes, I read the reviews before making this, and YES, I knew that most people found this chicken to be bland. Well, I obviously STILL didn't use enough spices because this chicken was incredibly boring. It's true, the chicken came out moist and the skin was nice and crispy. But we literally had to shake salt on it before EVERY bite. It concerns me that fried chicken requires SO MUCH salt in order to be palatable. I guess I will stick with broiled chicken. I should note that I used chicken that did not have any salt added before packaging. Maybe the people that \"love\" this recipe are using the kind that has had salt added?"

"reviewBody": "The coating that stayed on the chicken had excellent texture, though as other reviewers have noted, it was a bit on the bland side. Tossing the soup-coated chicken in a bag with the flour worked remarkably poorly - much more soup stayed in the bag than stayed on the chicken. The next time I try this recipe, I'll just mix all of the coating ingredients together and use this as a batter-fried recipe. If that doesn't work well, simply dredging the soup-coated chicken in a bowl of the flour/cornstarch mixture should work better than the bag-toss technique."

I deep fried the chicken until golden brown and then put it in the oven for a few minutes just to finish it off. I paired it with ranch dressing as a dip.
