I personally felt like the fried egg didn't mesh well with the other flavors but that is a personal preference. I added some salt to season the beef but felt it would have been nice to add a unique seasoning to give it more flavor. I loved the way it looked. Very visually appealing. I just need to make some modifications to make it perfect."

The only reason it is receiving a 4 star instead of a 5 is that I heavily salt and peppered the steak with some chili pepper flakes before cooking it and the steak was still bland compared to the rest of the dish. I think maybe putting some sesame oil or soy sauce on them or marinating before would fix the problem, which I will do next time I make this recipe because it was absolutely delicious"

"reviewBody": "This was a great recipe, though I made some changes. I found a Korean marinade and marinated the beef, which we also grilled instead of cooking in a pan. I had to use Thai chili paste instead of the Korean hot pepper paste, but I'm hoping to find some online for next time. I'm not sure how much that'll change the taste but it worked well at any rate. I added small cut broccoli florets because I currently have a ton of broccoli. I cooked the spinach in some sesame oil in a pan rather than boiling it and I loved the taste so much that I skipped adding the soy sauce. I made a Korean \"bbq\" sauce to drizzle on top of everything which added some sweetness to it. I'm not sure if that was really needed, but I really enjoyed the addition. It made for complex flavors that were delicious. My husband really enjoyed it. Great meal!"

About 3 rounds of wringing out the paper towel and repeating. This allows the spinach to absorb the soy sauce. They become the perfect soy pop. I didn’t need to add any extra gochujang because there was plenty on the matchstick veggies. It’s worth all the chopping!"

My meat was a bit bland so I plan on using a bulgogi sauce when cooking the meat, or maybe just marinating it overnight.\n\nThe cucumber carrot mixture was the best part of the whole dish; I could just make that and munch on it and be satisfied with such a tasty snack!"

"reviewBody": "When made correctly this dish is delicious. If you are considering adding it to your dinner rotation, then I highly recommend taking a trip to your local Asian supermarket. There you will find ingredients and tools to make this perfect every time. At the Asian supermarket you should buy your gochujang, stone bowls, sticky rice, chili oil, and their thicker soy sauce made for soups.\n\nEverything is made up ahead of time. I use: bean sprouts, shredded carrot that I mix with the thicker soy sauce, chicken tossed in the same sauce, steamed and pressed spinach tossed in chili oil, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, and an egg, but you can add different veggies if you prefer. I put my stone bowls in a warm oven while I cook my sticky rice in my rice cooker. The sticky rice gets really crunchy in the stone bowl and is well worth the effort. Once it's done, I take the bowls out and place on a hot burner (be careful of heat because the bowl can crack). I add the sticky rice to the bottom with chili oil and cook for five minutes. Continue to stir so it doesn't burn and occasionally flick water into the bowl to get that crunch. When that is finished, I add the other ingredients around the bowl like a sliced pie would appear. Lastly I cook the egg for the top, add salt and pepper to it and place it on top. Undercook the egg as it will continue to cook in the very hot bowl. I cut my gochujang with sesame oil to thin it out a bit. This is a family favorite and healthy too."

The veggies are easy to add or substitute to your taste or what you have on hand. I like to add mushrooms and have substituted kale for the spinach when I was out and it worked well. My whole family loves it, even my 7 year old who asked for seconds tonight and ate it all up."
