"reviewBody": "AWESOME! Absolutely delicious! I did need an extra Tbs. of butter for dipping. After laying out the first layer, I realized there was no way I was going to get 3 layers, so I just made 2 which meant, since all my ingredients were measured out for 3, each of the 2 layers ended up with extra toppings because I wasn't about to wrap and put anything back in the fridge. Mine took 40 minutes to bake and it came out tasty and beautiful. The only thing I did differently was to chop up my jalapeno slices a bit to provide better distribution. Wished I'd had a beer to drink with it because this stuff was hot...but soooo good."

What's not to love.... except the uncooked doughy bits in the middle when you make monkey bread without using a bundt pan. I did find if you cut the biscuits into 8 pieces instead of 4 that does help and I baked the first layer of biscuits for about 10 minutes before adding the cheese and remaining layers."

Easy variations are to add pepper jack cheese, sausage, bacon or ham for breakfast. Turn it in to a pizza bread by adding smoke mozzarella, pepperoni or salami. Or a veggie bread by adding a variety of vegetables. This bread is so versatile and forgiving you can add anything and it turns out well! Thanks for the memories bfr610!"

I drained them really well (between paper towel) and they were great in this recipe. It was doughy (in a good way), cheesy, spicy and oh soooo delicious. I won't hesitate to make this again and make it for company. I look forward to trying another one of your recipes, bfr610!"
