"reviewBody": "I followed this recipe almost exactly as written &amp; they were fabulous! I used a Gluten-Free flour blend with maybe 1/4 tsp. of xantham gum added to make it more like regular all-purpose flour with the appropriate \"chew\" for a molasses cookie. I made a couple of different molasses or gingerbread cookies for a taste test for the family, and these were the winners by far. The flavor is excellent, and the texture was perfectly chewy. We preferred them not flattened since they seemed to get better crinkles on top when they hadn't been squashed down. I used a cookie scoop &amp; just dropped the dough ball into a small bowl of sugar &amp; swirled the bowl around the coat the dough. I baked these for exactly 8 minutes. The recipe itself is excellent, and I don't think you'll be disappointed at all if you try it. My only beef--and it's small--is with the video that was made by someone other than the original baker. It shows someone scooping the flour with a measuring cup &amp; then tapping it down on the side of the bowl, rather than spooning flour into the cup &amp; leveling it off. Also, most of the measurements were rounded spoons of things. While it may make for an \"aesthetic\" look in the video, it can result in cookies that are drier &amp; denser than they ought to be. (&amp; this is especially true in Gluten-Free baking). Skip the video &amp; you'll be just fine."

I’ve written it down and shared it at cookie swaps and with family members, we can’t have a Christmas without them.

I do find that they need to bake a little longer then 8-10 minutes, I bake them for 12-14, but my oven could also be old."

I made a few slight changes: used 2 cups all-purpose flour and 1/4 cup bread flour, as I ran out of all-purpose. Used real, salted butter. Tried the oj-in-place-of-water trick mentioned by another reviewer. And finally, I refrigerated overnight. I also baked two batches differently: one normally at 10 minutes and one using my oven's convection setting at 10 minutes, 325 degrees. Both were great, but I preferred the convection setting, as they resulted in a gooey-on-the-inside, slightly-crispy-on-the-outside cookie."

I also did 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar (demerara) instead. This actually made them taste a bit more like molasses than just honey and lot sweeter. They appear to be a bit on the light blonde side so will try this recipe again with real molasses! Definitely worth trying this recipe and was super easy to make!"

I decided to try this recipe on Christmas Eve, and the only complaint with these cookies was that I only made one batch. Not only were these the best cookies I've ever had fresh out of the oven, they were just as soft the next day. After we finished the entire batch, it was unanimously decided that we should make them again... right away... only a double batch. The only thing I changed was to take a reviewer's advice and use orange juice instead of the water, since I had it on hand - and I also increased the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon for no reason other than I love cinnamon. Thanks for a great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Made these ginger cookies for family and friends this holiday season and they were a huge hit. I read through a good amount of the comments before baking and found they were very helpful in producing a successful and tasty cookie ! \n\nSome of the revisions I followed were: using orange juice instead of water, swapping margarine for butter, using 3/4C of brown sugar instead of white (white sugar was only for rolling at the end), and chilling the dough for at least 30mins. \n\nIn addition, I used a small cookie scoop to form the dough balls and the bottom of a glass to flatten them slightly. They cooked in 7mins flat and when they cooled, dipped them in a lemon icing. Strongly recommend this recipe !"

So for my second batch, I used 1 tablespoon of ginger instead of the 2 tsps., I substituted the 1 cup of white sugar for light brown sugar, and I added 1/2 tsp of cardamom. I also flattened them down before baking. They were fantastic!"

We added a teaspoon of orange zest to the dough and rolled them in sugar sprinkles instead of normal sugar and they tasted like Christmas!\n\nWe've made these twice. The second time, we chilled the dough for 30 minutes before making the dough balls and that made the dough less sticky and spread less in the oven, which was easier, but they still taste really good if you don't chill the dough!"

"reviewBody": "I read quite a few of the reviews before baking and I did use a couple of the suggestions. I replaced the water with freshly squeezed orange juice. I personally didn’t find it gingery enough so I will increase it next time. I did roll the dough balls in sugar but as others have stated, it adds unnecessary sweetness that takes away from the finer taste. Chilling the dough is necessary - 30 minutes is plenty. This also makes it easier to roll, especially if you skip the sugar coating. The recipe says bake for 8-10 minutes and I find that’s not enough. 12 minutes is good. It darkens the cookie more and you get a nice crispy edge. The centres are still soft. Will make again with those adjustments."

I tend to use about 3/4 of a cup of sugar rather than a cup and find they are the perfect sweetness. Using a cookie scoop helps keep them all uniform size, and I always have a pair of medical exam gloves on hand (pardon the pun lol) to use when forming. They tend to stick way less to the gloves than they do to skin."

I did so last year, giving out gingerbread boys to friends, and they loved the texture and flavor just as much as I did. The only change I made was accidental on my part. The recipe calls for baking soda, and I mistakenly used baking powder. You know what? It didn't seem to make a difference-- in that there was nothing wrong with the finished product. You've got to give this recipe a try!"
