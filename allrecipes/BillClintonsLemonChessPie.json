Let it cool when you remove it from the oven then cover with aluminum foil and refrigerate over night prior to cutting. This allows the custard to thicken."

Anyway, here is what's different the total liquid is correct, but the distribution is not his &amp; is also not improved. Use 1/2 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice and 3/4 cup milk. I reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cup (a bit sweet with 2 whole cups). To those saying it's runny, you didn't cook it long enough. If it's still giggly, it's not done, stick a knife in it -- when it comes out clean, it's done &amp; not before! Every oven is a little different. Also make sure you don't forget the flour and cornmeal - it makes a difference. I put fresh blueberries in the last one &amp; it was phenominal!"

"reviewBody": "Have never made a home made lemon chess pie until tonight. Followed the recipe pretty closely because of the reviews.\nReduced the sugar by 1/3 c. but think 1/2 c. reduction would bring out the lemon flavor more. Also, had a deep dish pie crust that I did not thaw and it cooked perfectly including the edges. There is to much liquid so next time I'll reduce the quantity of milk by half (I used fat free half and half because it's what I had.) Also, even though the photo shows a more custard type layer at the top I didn't expect that and was looking for a more smooth consistency throughout. Going to refrigerate and let it firm up some. This needs to bake the day before you need it. The flavor was nice lemony but very sweet."

"reviewBody": "Really enjoyed this, with a few adaptations. Definitely sweet enough with 1-1/2 cups sugar instead of 2. I doubled the amount of lemon juice and added an extra tablespoon of zest. Also added a few splashes of vanilla extract. Next time we might substitute cream for the milk.\nOne recipe was plenty to fill a deep dish pie shell, although it did take longer to heat. 40 minutes was not enough (we used a toaster/convection oven). I kept an eye on it and ended up cooking about 55 minutes. Top was nicely browned but not burnt. Filling was still soupy but pie set nicely after resting on the counter for a while. We tried the first piece while still slightly warm. Delicious &amp; perfectly tart. Pie did weep a bit, but not a problem (and I bet it won't do again once refrigerated).\nI hope it's not apocryphal that this is one of Bill Clinton's favorites. We made it to console ourselves after the debacle of the 2016 election."

I did use a 9\" deep-dish shell though since most reviewers seemed to think there was too much batter for a regular 9\" crust. For those who think it's too sweet, it's a chess pie...it's SUPPOSED to be sweet. After all, the main ingredients in a chess pie are lots of sugar and lots of eggs. For those reviewers who had problems with the recipe, all I can say is \"learn how to follow directions\"."

I baked this nearly twice as long and it never set in the middle. The top did get a deep golden brown, which I thought was good from the pictures. However, the top spongy part was too thick in the end. The custard was ok, but grainy from the corn meal. It was edible only because of the strong lemon flavor. I don't think I like this kind of pie in general, but the lemon saved this one. Yet another Southern thing I don't get!"

I had 4 lemons which was more than enough lemon juice but yielded only about 1.5T of zest and I added a tiny drop of vanilla. Mine took a little longer to bake at 50 min but was picture perfect coming out of the oven. I made this yesterday and am eager to make it again even though I've got half the pie left in the fridge."

A pie recipe (originating in the South) its a wonderful custardy ,lemony pie that has the right balance of sweet &amp; tart! When I make this pie,this is always the recipe I use! 2 Enthusiastic Thumbs Up! TRY IT ~ YOU'LL LIKE IT!!"

The center was not set when it came out of the oven. It sat on the counter cooling for a few hours and then the center was nice and firm. You cannot cut this pie when it comes straight from the oven. It is the perfect dessert after a rich, heavy meal."

I used my French White Quiche dish (10inch X 3inch) and it is PERFECT fit for the entire recipe. I love anything lemon. I loved my grandmother's Chess Pie. A total winner~! I serve it with 'real' whipped cream and sliced strawberries and a spring of mint. A crowd pleaser~! Thanks~! I do have to increase the baking time by about 10 to 12 minutes. No problem in setting-up and it comes out the same color as the picture used in this recipe."

"reviewBody": "Yep, made it several times and used buttermilk in lieu of the milk or 1/2 buttermilk and 1/2 half'n'half. Pretty creamy stuff. Used 1/2 teaspoon intense natural lemon extract with the zest. All these little changes are fine. Only commnent otherwise is the oven setting may be too high and the time too short. I moved it back to 300F and let it cook 20 min longer and it really set up. At 350F and 40minutes it didn't set up in the center. Also when you lower an oven setting and increase the cook time, more H2O evaporates and that contributes to the custard to set easily. But not an issue really."

Plus, there wasn't enough lemon flavor as others have said. Thanks for the recipe; it wasn't bad, but I think I will look for another lemon chess pie to better suit my personal preferences."

I used only one cup sugar (by accident but it tasted great!)&amp; 1/2 cup of lemon (because we like it tart),real butter,&amp; fat free milk. Great easy recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I took these to work and got a lot of compliments. Chess pie is not common here in Missouri, but had quite a few co-workers enjoy them.\n\nIt may have been the crusts I used, but the longer-than-normal baking times did something magical to the crusts, they tasted more like shortbread. Yum!"

"reviewBody": "I've made this twice in the past week. My husband and I both prefer it to lemon meringue pie. I've made pies professionally for quite a few years. This recipe makes a 10 inch pie. There is too much filling for a 9 inch pie. I used 1/2 heavy cream the first time and it was almost too rich and interfered with the tart/sweet lemon flavor. The second time I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 half and half. That is the combination we prefer. I only had 2 lemons, which made about 2 tablespoons of zest and it was plenty. You need to use butter, no substitutes. This pie is meant to be rich and sweet, combined with the unique texture from the cornmeal. Wonderful. Will be my go to lemon pie from now on. I did have to increase the baking time for a bit, but just kept an eye on it. This pie benefits from sitting for a few hours and we like it best cold."

"reviewBody": "I made this pie today and it was absolutely wonderful. My husband and I agree that it's a \"keeper\". Based on others' comments, I was concerned with having filling left over so I used a store-bought piecrust (Pillsbury) (found in the dairy case in the long skinny box) and rolled it out bigger so that it would fit in my 10\" pyrex pie plate. It ended up being perfect as I had just the right amount of filling. I also used half and half instead of the milk and the next time I will cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups. I cooked it for 50 minutes which I think was perfect for the 10\" pie and it set up very nicely in the fridge - it cut beautifully!!"

I also cut the sugar back 1/2 a cup, as 2 cups of sugar in a pie is too much for me. I only used the zest of 1.5 lemons instead of 3 tb. and that was plenty of lemon flavor. Just giving this 4 stars because of the flavor."

Somehow the whole was much less than the sum of the parts - real butter, eggs, milk, real lemon juice, sugar and homemade piecrust should have been wonderful, and they just weren't. To me the only point of dessert is to taste great, and this pie just didn't make the cut.\n\nAs other reviewers noted, there was not enough lemon flavor from 1/4 c. lemon juice, the recipe makes a lot of filling (completely filling a homemade 9\" piecrust with tall crimped edges), and it takes about twice the recommended time to cook."
