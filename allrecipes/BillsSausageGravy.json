"reviewBody": "Found this recipe a few years ago, and it still is my go to. Making it now. Anyone who says it's bland, just add more salt. It literally says salt and pepper to taste. If that's not enough, then make it your own with whatever other herbs. I actually use exactly a half teaspoon of salt and the same amount of pepper. It adds just enough flavor to balance the saltiness of the biscuts. (I use store bought so they have their own flavor. Too much in the gravy will make the finished product far too salty). If you make your own biscuts, then maybe use a bit more. Just my 2 cents."

But using either Bob Evans Naturally or Jimmy Dean Original sausage, it has that tasty breakfast sausage spice that I love. When the sausage is about halfway fried, I get the oven preheated. Once preheated, I put the biscuits in and keep working on the gravy. Biscuits and gravy finish at the same time then it’s time to chow down! Just made it about a half hour ago for supper using sausage we had made by a local butcher from a hog we bought from a friend. Mmmm!!"

We use cayenne pepper to taste, instead of black. Always double this recipe - it freezes well! Outstanding!"

I follow recipe with rest of ingredients except I use 2% milk which is what I always have on hand, I did use fat free milk once and it worked good too. I use the 3T of unsalted butter as I am scraping the bottom of my cast iron pan to get the almost burnt sausage pieces loose. It gives it a nice color too. I also added some ground coriander and enough S&amp;P to taste. I did have to add little more milk as it was a little too thick. Next time will def try the maple and even sage sausage."

"reviewBody": "I saw the many, many 5-star reviews and found them hard to believe. After I made the recipe I am even more doubtful...I cannot believe over 200 people voted this less than 5 stars. ABSOLUTELY awesome. A home run for sure. As a life-long (well-most of is anyway) New Englander this was my first try at sausage gravy down in Florida. My Florida-born wife said it's the best sausage gravy she's every had. Simple recipe and tastes great. Watch the video. I made this as a \"test\" appetizer (in case I screwed it up) for my wife but she LOVED it so much we threw some turkey bacon in the microwave and cooked up some eggs and ate the rest of it for dinner (my cooking loaded Instant Pot dinner will be refrigerated for tomorrow night).\nVery easy--very good.\nPS (and I hate these caveats) I used the one-pound Jimmy Dean sausage and it was great. We used 6 biscuits and that's what this recipe covered. My wife (who cooks everything with lo/non-fat says this recipe is only good to cover 4 full-sized biscuits since you want to have plenty of extra just to sop up and eat with a spoon)"
