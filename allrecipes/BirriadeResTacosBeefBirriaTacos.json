"reviewBody": "I've never had Birria before and wanted to try something new. The meat was so tender and flavorful! I did not have chile de arbol and used a combo of guajillo and ancho (...3 ancho and 9 guajillos I think) as that's what I had on hand. I wish the recipe specified the seasoning amounts to be used. In the future I would use 1/8 teaspoon for everything and use maybe 1/4 teaspoon of Mexican Oregano. However, I think it would be best to just add a light dash of each and taste as you blend the ingredients to see what it needs more of. Thank you for the recipe!"

Absolutley delicious, I made this for my daughters family and they all loved it. Decided to eat it with white rice, because we're having Lengua tacos this week. I'll be making this again with beef. Reminded me of my childhood."

It would be more helpful to state more specific spice amounts instead of just a \"pinch\", but it came out delicious nonetheless. My roast was only 2 pounds, so I removed it from the oven after about 2h15m. The meat was falling apart tender and very flavorful. I made the sauce the day before to save time. This one is a definite keeper!"

The only things I did different was used minced garlic from a jar, boiled my tomatoes with my chilies, did not strain (I like thick salsa), and cooked the meat in a crock pot for 8 hours on low. I shredded the meat after and poured juice over it. Now it is ready to be put into tacos with cilantro and onions. Fixed side of beans and steamed zucchini and squash to go with it. So good! Definitely the new family favorite. I was worried about it being too spicy, but it is perfect."

I used canned tomatoes (fire roasted) to save time and they worked just as well. Thanks! Great recipe!"
