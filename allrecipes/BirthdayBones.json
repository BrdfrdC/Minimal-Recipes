"reviewBody": "I made a half batch just to try the recipe. I never make dough so I was a bit concerned this would not be for me. However, this was very easy dough to make and roll out. 1/4\" is perfect for baking this recipe. I did not have a cute cookie cutter so I I just cut the dough into strips and then into pieces. I placed them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Another reviewer suggested flipping the bones half way through so they are crisp on both sides. (Not soft on one and crisp on the other)This was a good idea. I flipped at 10 minutes and then baked another 7-8 minutes. \nRecipe turned out great! My dog did like these!\n\n I would think any flour would work fine. I will look into other flours that are better for dogs and try them in this recipe. Today I used Bob's Red Mill whole grain white all purpose flour.\n\nI am hoping to replace Milkbone dog treats with these as every box I have purchased in the last 6 months has had moths, larva, and/or webbing in the box! I really want to know my dog is not eating that or worse. \n\nThanks for the recipe!"

All I put in them were 1c all purpose flour, 1c oats, 2 Large over ripe bananas ( thawed from the freezer) and 1c of peanut butter ( mixed what was left of the natural, crunchy and smooth). I rolled them into palm sized balls. The first batch I pressed a fork in for the design but the next 2 dozen I just pressed in my palms. Baked about 12-14 min and they were done. My testers were eager to try them and they LOVED them. I made enough to give little Christmas bags to neighbor's and friend's dog and will include a list of the ingredients so they know what is in them. A great little gift to go along with the human Christmas cookies I'm giving each family. Thank you Tami for such a simple recipe! Next batch, I am adding shredded carrots in there as well."

I purchased a 1 1/2\" X 1 1/2\" cookie cutter, added 1/4 cup honey but reduced the peanut butter to 3/4 cup. The natural peanut butter had enough oil, so I didn't grease the cookie sheets. I also reduced the temperature to 350 and cooked them for 13 minutes. No longer. The last two times I baked these, they came out perfectly! One recipe makes about 150 cookies when using the smaller cookie cutter. I pet sit and give them out to all my \"friends\" and they all love them!"

I warmed some peanut butter with water and brushed the biscuits to see if that would tempt him. No way! I dont know if he is so used to store bought snacks with a strong odor or what. I tried one and it was a bit bland for an adult taste but was certainly not horrible and you def got the flavor of peanut butter. I will repost if he changes his mind but as of now does anyone want about 50 biscuits? LOL"

I did as one reviewer suggested and baked them for less than 20 minutes. I baked them for 17 minutes and they turned out perfect. Puppies could smell them baking and eagerly awaited the new batch of them. This is a great recipe, easy to make and makes you feel good that you are giving your dogs a healthy treat.

You can just put a light coat of flour on the surface that you are working on, coat your hands, then press out the dough, and cut out your shapes. Very easy and quick to make. I cut these out in heart shapes, then baked for 12 minutes, flipped them over and baked another 6 minutes so both sides are browned and the cookies are crisp. Thanks for a great, easy dog treat recipe!"

I also used 3/4 creamy and 1/4 crunchy peanut butter. This does make a LOT though! I will freeze half of them and keep 1/2 out for treats. I used an olive oil lid(about 1\" in diameter) to cut them, and they didn't spread out, just poofed up a little bit. 3 or 4 minutes in I flipped them, gave them another 3 or 4 minutes and done."

"reviewBody": "I just pulled these out of the oven, and OH MY GOD!!\n\nThese were SO easy to make. The only challenge was to mix together the PB and milk. But the dough wasn't sticky AT ALL. I didn't even need to transfer to a floured surface.\n\nI had to cut it down to '14' servings, though, because I was low on flour, and all the measurements still turned out perfect.\n\nThese baked up in about 17 minutes in my old-as-time oven. They look pretty crunchy, but they're really quite crumbly and soft. This is perfect for small dogs, like my Shih tzu, who can't just gobble down a whole bone.\n\nThese are by far the easiest dog bones I've ever made. (I used to have a small business selling dog bones.) The dough is easy to shape (I made fun shapes after using cookies cutters, like mini-gyoza, fortune cookies, and even a big hamburger) and to roll.\n\nThey also cool off really quickly, and that's awesome because, if you're a shih tzu owner, you know how impatient they can be! :) My little pup was literally scratching at my legs as I took them out of the oven. She gobbled three right down in a row.\n\nLong review short- THESE ARE PERFECT."

In the end, I literally had hundreds of little dog biscuits, which were a smashing hit for our last house party and fun party favors for our canine guests! Its nice that they are edible for people too, if a little tasteless, for those guests who don't read the sign that says \"Dog Treats\"... I should note however, that small dog biscuits need MUCH less cooking time! I think I baked mine for only 10-12 minutes."

When I opened the pantry where I had put the bag of treats, both dogs instantly sat, staring at me, waiting for more! The dough was easy to work with. I cut the dough into 1-inch rounds and baked in three batches. When the last batch was done, I put all the baked treats onto the cookie sheet, turned off the oven, and put the treats back into the oven until the oven had completely cooled. Dried out the treats a little bit and made them crunchy. I vacuum-sealed a few small bags of the treats to give to doggie friends for Christmas. Next time I'll just cut the dough into small squares to make them faster. I will be making these again, thank you!"

I tried them and they were very bland and floury, oh but my two dogs; Buster &amp; Milo thought they were the best thing ever made. They went crazy while I was making them and I couldnt believe that they wanted these more than the soft bacon/jerky treats I had. \r\n\r\n2) I made the 2nd batch using apple sauce instead of the milk as reviewers suggested. My dogs had no preference in the finished product and they were much more prone to burn. I ruined a few of the cookie sheets trying to work out flipping them and things I did not have to do with the first batch. I noticed also that reviewers who mentioned them burning also changed the recipe. Perhaps the sugar in the applesauce made them burn? Anyhow I recomend the original recipe. \r\n\r\n3)I also tried another dog biscuit recipe from this site that seemed to have easy and normal ingredients but the dough was much harder to work with. \r\n\r\nTHIS RECIPE IS THE BEST!!!!!!!"
