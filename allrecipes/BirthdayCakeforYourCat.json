Other than that, he loved it!"

I had to mix it all up after baking and pick up a finger of the fish cake and bring it up to my cats face in order to eat the cake. He doesnt seem to like shrimp either. I guess it just depends on the Cat. But a can of tuna would be easier"

I personally think they needed more cheese but again, he didn't seem to mind. Made as written they are on the dense side so you'll have to cut it up for them. No biggie but I thought I'd mention it. Santos says thanks for the recipe!"
