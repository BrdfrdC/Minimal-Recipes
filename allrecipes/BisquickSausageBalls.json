Also I add about 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce. Gives them that little extra umph! ðŸ˜‹As far as the sausage brand, I prefer the homemade hot sausage from Bigs Meats and More, in McBee SC. Jimmy Deans is good too. Good quality sausage is a must. Delicious."

I have tried other recipes, and this one is the best, IMO. We keep them handy almost all winter for a quick grap at any time. They heat up nicely in the microwave in seconds."

Done with this site. Thanks for nothing."

I made them mostly for munchies for me &amp; my husband and he took some to work and shared with co-workers. Reviews from them were thumbs up. They really liked them. And so did I. I'm not waiting to make them for holidays only. I will be making these year-round."

"reviewBody": "This was my first time ever making sausage balls and they turned out delicious! Iâ€™m not known for being very adept in the kitchen so Iâ€™m writing this review to hopefully encourage others of the same level. I read through every single review first and came up with a plan based on othersâ€™ suggestions:\n1. Let the sausage and cheese get to room temp first.\n2. I wore latex gloves. \n3. Mixed the sausage and only 4 cups Bisquick together, incorporating just 1 cup mix at a time by folding and then kneading. I could easily see, using that method, how 6 cups would definitely work but I personally wanted a less doughy end result.\n4. Once the sausage and Bisquick were fully mixed I added the cheese in 3 parts to make sure it all mixed in well.\n6. Added seasoning of my choice and mixed one last time.\n7. Made 3 test balls of varying thickness and tightness and baked them. Despite one review I read, the more compact balls baked up best with the looser one turning into more of a peanut shape. Golf ball size and smaller size each turned out identical. \n8. Using parchment paper, I baked the amount I needed on the top rack of oven for 25 min at 300Â°, but I may go to 27 min next time. Bottoms were brown but not over done.\n9. Froze the rest by putting them on a baking sheet first in the freezer and then bagging them. \n\nI do not have a mixer and I do not have a rack to allow for grease to drip. So I made do without those things, but I thought they were great suggestions."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was an epic fail as written. The balls fell apart and didn't cook at 300 degrees. So here is what I did... 4 cups Bisquick, 1.5 lbs cheese, 2 lbs sausage and the addition of 2 eggs and 3/4 c. water. I also increased the baking temperature to 400 degrees for 30 minutes. They formed into balls and cooked throughout with a nice brown texture. After that, I would give it four stars!"

(I do use neeseâ€™s since we are in NC and itâ€™s local) I also add milk gradually while mixing, otherwise, they are dry. Probably about 1/4 cup total but just eye ball it. You want it tacky enough to stick together but not runny in any way."

Personally, I think that 3 cups Bisquick is a bit much and makes them too dry and they crumble too easily. Also, note that made smaller size balls (not golf ball size) which may have helped as well."

The end result was absolutely inedible. WAY TOO MUCH BISQUICK in this. How ever much you make, cut the Bisquick amount in this recipe by HALF. I made the half recipe and used 3 cups per the instructions (and half the other ingredients as well). They might as well have been golf balls. Plus they were nearly impossible to \"roll\" into balls. Had to throw away 1/3 of the mixture as it was unusable. Will try again with a better recipe."

Jimmy Dean hot sausage, 2 to 2 1/4 cups Bisquick, 1 lb shredded sharp cheddar. (I find the finely shredded cheese blends in more easily, allowing the balls to hold their shape). Let the sausage come to room temperature. I also roll the balls smaller than a golf ball about 1\". This will yield about 4 dozen."

For those who say that it is too dry, you really have to work the BisquickÂ®? in one cup at a time with the cheese and donâ€™t roll the balls too big. I roll them and freeze them on cookie sheets before putting them in ZiplockÂ®? bags for the freezer, taking out what we need, cooking at 400 for ~14 minutes."

After mixing and kneading until my hands hurt, there was still baking mix and cheese at the bottom of the bowl that would not incorporate into the sausage. I shoved all I could into the sausage. It made very dry balls with little flavor, but edible. I took some to my mother in laws, not knowing that she was making sausage balls, too. When I walked in and saw hers ready to go into the oven, I asked her why mine looked so different. I told her the recipe and she was shocked to see how much baking mix I put in. Hers called for 3 cups of baking mix, and made perfect little balls. This is WAY too much baking mix. Oh well, now I know!"

I make double batches bc my family loves these (even bought a huge bowl just to make them in). My favorite mixture is 1lb of sage mixed with 1lb of hot sausage. Also, mix sausage and bisquick first then add cheese can help with the crumbles. These are always a huge hit!"
