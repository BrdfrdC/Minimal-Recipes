The addition of lime zest gives it a nice boost of flavor.\nI added a red bell pepper for extra flavor and substituted canola oil for avocado oil, because I don't have any.\nI omit the cilantro for the picky eaters--I'm sure it would balance well with the lime though.\nI juiced the lime used for the zest--it doesn't make sense to use the packaged lime juice when you have the better fresh option.\nI make this salad all the time, and even the carnivores in my family love it.\nThanks!"

This is one of those dishes that gets better after it has had time to cool down together a bit, so if you can make it ahead and keep in the fridge, it's especially good."
