Not to be “that guy” but hummus is garbanzo, so technically this is not a hummus recipe, it’s a black bean dip. I did not care for the flavor of the olives so left those out after using them the first time. I doubled the cumin and cayenne and added a tablespoon of chili crisp to spice it up. I like my version so will stick with it."

The second time, I made it without the cumin and garlic (as it adds a bit too strong of a spice), and it was good as well. It's better if you let it sit overnight, and good with carrot and cucumber sticks. Definitely add more lemon juice if you want more a taste to it."

I actually prefer it to the traditional hummus I had been making. I creamed the lemon juice and tahini first and then added in everything except the beans. Lastly added in the beans and this made it extra creamy. A little olive oil at the end. My toddler ate a whole bowl of it! Only thing I left out was the cayenne. Will definitely make again!"

"reviewBody": "In my hurry to make this recipe I missed the part about using olives and paprika to garnish it. I didn't have any Greek olives so I used black olives right in the mix with the hummus. At this point I would suggest salting to taste because black olives are quite salty. I also used half lime and half lemon juice as some other reviewers had suggested. My kids won't normally eat hummus but they gobbled this down and I made a double batch. It was absolutely delicious. Keep in mind the season to taste bit because we used a little bit of extra cumin and paprika as well. This is definitely a keeper. It keeps the saturated fats down below what I'm allowed in my diet and has many other really good nutrients. It was so yummy too."

Because some people don't like a lot of spice, I cut the cayenne pepper to 1/8th teaspoon. After tasting I also upped the lemon juice a little...maybe another tablespoon and drizzled a little olive oil in. Turned out great. Will serve with pita chips and some cut up veggies."

I agree that doubling the amount of spices makes for a more flavorful dish. I love it with Trader Joe's Bite Size Everything Crackers. I'll surely be making this numerous times!"

I didn't have Tahini, so I just used ground up toasted sesame seeds and robust OVOO and I added some extra garlic. I garnished it with chopped olives and chopped fresh chives. So good!"

Since I didn't use canned beans I think it could use a little more salt. Otherwise this recipe rocks. I like spicy food so I will add more spice to taste. What a great way to get your fiber."
