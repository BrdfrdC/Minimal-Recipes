"reviewBody": "The flavor of the beans is excellent and the recipe is simple. Perfect! Another recipe I've been wanting to make also calls for refried black beans but I have never seen them at the store so I made my own using an Instant Pot refried bean recipe on this site. The smooth texture of the refried beans mixed with whole beans created an excellent creamy texture. Black beans are typically my least favorite bean but this recipe changed that."
