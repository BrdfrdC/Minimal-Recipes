I added more salsa and sprinkled in some taco seasoning to taste. I also baked a couple of chicken breasts, coated in taco seasoning and then diced them up and added them to the filling (but it would have been just as great without the chicken). After those additions, this is now a 5-star recipe with my family."

If interested, I doubled the onion, red pepper flakes, and salsa. Also added 1 teaspoon cumin and 2 teaspoons cilantro flakes."

In order for this to hold together on a tortilla or two, one will need more cheese. I did these in the oven = best option. Spices needed: cumin, cayenne/or 'zip' of your choice. I didn't find it too sweet and at least for us, the red pepper flake taste was too diluted. Worth another go-round, though."

Too much for one person. \nFound this on the internet @ https://www.unlockfood.ca/en/Articles/Budget/All-About-Beans.aspx\nDried beans that have been cooked can be kept covered in the fridge for 5-7 days or frozen for up to 6 months. Label with a date and store beans in an airtight container made for freezing food or wrapped tightly in heavy foil."

"reviewBody": "Very easy &amp; quite quick to put together when you prepare the filling ahead. My reason for the missing star is the addition of brown sugar in the recipe - waay too much \"sweet\" for our palette in combination with the corn, so I was glad I went with my instinct &amp; left it out. Our adult son doesn't like sour cream or guacamole, so we had extra salsa with a good squeeze of lime juice &amp; a grind of habanero pink salt - the tang perked everything up! We are vegetarians too, so I love to see plant based recipes coming in from so many creative chefs. Thank you!"

I honestly hate quesadillas, I think they aren't filling, I've eaten so many plain cheese ones in my life that just the thought of eating them turns me off, but these have changed my mind. I love the sweet savory flavor of them, the flavors work so incredibly well together. Even my husband who hated anything black bean after I made him eat a bunch of black bean burgers, loved these quesadillas. The beans made them especially filling."

I started out with a pound of ground chicken, added chopped onion and banana peppers. Then added refried black beans w/green chilies &amp; jalapenos, and a can of well-rinsed creamed corn. I used some taco seasoning, left out the brown sugar, and added cumin. I fixed these in the oven at 450 for about 5 minutes till turning golden. We love them. Will make again. Just throw things together that you like--it just might work."

Then, cheese followed by bean/corn mixture. Then more cheese. Oiled the top-side of tortillas as final layer. Baked in the oven for 15 minutes. I think the brown sugar was key in balancing the salsa, as mentioned in the video."

"reviewBody": "This was a fantastic quesadilla recipe! Thank you! A few tips I might add are as follows: 1. Smaller tortillas, such as fajita size, are much easier to work with, as they can be flipped with minimal fuss or fallout. The smaller size tortillas also allow for more individual servings; they are perfect for younger kids; easy to hold and eat, either cut into triangles or left whole, and there is not a lot of waste. I used soft taco sized tortillas initially, and they were fine, but for the subsequent quesadillas, the smaller ones worked better. 2. If you grate your own cheese, it seems to melt better than the pre-shredded cheese. I also found that scattering a bit more cheese on top of the filling will glue the top and bottom tortillas together. I didn’t change anything else, and this recipe was terrific! I used organic canned black beans; they are a bit smaller than non-organic, and canned corn with no salt added. I also used organic jarred salsa, and I think those ingredients made a difference in taste. Just very clean and fresh tasting. Doing without the casein in pre-grated packaged cheese also made a difference, I believe. I am going to try this sometime with diced green chile, white beans, Colby cheese and chopped tomatoes. Thank you again!"

Skip all the cooking, just drain and rinse beans and corn, put some on a big tortilla, add some brushetta or pico-de-gallo (even better if you like it spicy), chopped jalapeno (fresh or pickled), cilantro, green onions and cheese. Fold it in half and toast on a pan or in the oven, flip to toast on both sides until slightly crispy. Serve with sour cream and salsa."
