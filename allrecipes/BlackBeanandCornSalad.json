"reviewBody": "I did read the reviews, I agreed with most the changes, and of course, it boils down to personal preference. I've made enough salads to know, a 1/2 cup is way too much oil, a quarter to third cup is fine. Also, someone mentioned, (and you can look it up), adding the avocado pit has nothing to do with keeping the avocado from turning brown. It's the Citric acid alone in the lime juice that keeps the avocado from turning brown. Look it up. For the tomato, I went ahead and just added it. The only difference, I did not include the center watery portion, with the seeds and all. That is what makes it more watery. I used Roma tomato's and patted them lightly with a paper towel. I'll be making this again. I made it ahead of time, the flavors relax and blend together, IMO."

The second time I made it I used fresh not frozen corn cut right off the cobb. Roma tomatoes and allot more garlic as suggested. Both were really good either way. I think letting this sit in the fridge over night is the secret to this recipe. So good the next day. YUMMMY"

I prepare the dressing ahead but add right b4 serving. I serve the avocado separately as it browns so easily and in my opinion detracts from the otherwise bright colors. Delicious. Leftovers carry well through the next 2days and can be used as is or to top many things. I do strain off the increased liquid b4 using the leftover."

"reviewBody": "Whatever you do, do not - I repeat - DO NOT use a juicer to juice your limes! My limes were SO firm there was no way I could choke a tablespoon out of them by hand, let alone a third of a cup. So, I cut off the skins &amp; juiced 3 limes to get 1/3 cup of juice &amp; the acidity was so overbearing! I added more olive oil (I got the healthy expensive stuff) to try to compensate, to no avail. No one in the world hates to throw out food more than I do, but I ended up throwing out the whole dish...grrr! I'm giving it 5 stars because this is a word of caution, not a rating of the recipe! Next time, I'll either make sure my limes are softer, or I might consider that disrespectable plastic lime instead. Again, grrr!"
