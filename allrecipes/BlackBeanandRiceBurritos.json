Also, I didn't have tomato sauce so I used an undrained can of tomatoes and it worked just fine! (I use brown rice always....)\nAfter I rolled them up, I put them in a baking dish, sprayed them with cooking spray, sprinkled lightly with cheese and baked for a bit. You don't have to do that,, of course, my hubby liked it better that way. Good recipe! Thanks!"

It's VERY SPICY HOT (at least to my palate), so if that's you, start with half the spices as others have noted and add more if needed. I especially halved the cloves after making it a few times as they were a bit overpowering, and I use fresh tomatoes. I usually just have it with steamed rice in a bowl, but it also goes very well in a burrito. I'd have it hot or cold - the burritos would make a great packed lunch."

All the kids scarfed down the food and loved it. I thought they were okay. a little weird but still good and I would probably make them again however my husband hated them. he didn't like them at all. He kept asking what spices I used and when I told him he said that for him it was the cloves and nutmeg that \"ruined\" the dish."

I did a few things differently though. 1) I only used 1/2 cup of rice because I didn't want to overwhelm the burrito with rice, 2) I used a regular onion because I didn't have a sweet yellow onion 3) I skipped out on the cayenne powder and nutmeg because I didn't have any, 4) I added about 1-2 tsp of taco seasoning and 1-2 of taco sauce just to give it a bit of a Mexican kick, 5) of course added some salt, and 6) I mixed the rice into the bean sauce and then spooned it onto the tortillas. So yummy and so satisfying! I loved it! :D"

I ended up having to doctor it up with salt and jarred salsa at the end. I'm not one of those people who puts a load of salt on everything, and I'm surprised I didn't see this in other's reviews. I actually thought I did something wrong so I kept looking back at the recipe, but the only thing I changed was using chipotle chili powder and brown rice. Even after the doctoring it's still just OK. I won't make it again."

I think halving the seasoning would probably make this recipe a 4 star for me. Someone who likes really strong flavors will probably adore the recipe as written. I mixed the rice and beans because the beans were a little runny and the texture was perfect when mixed."

My intent was to \"use\" open containers of black beans, tomato sauce and rice. Certainly can adjust the heat to your liking - would encourage to keep the nutmeg and clove.

I just did some good shakes of the cloves and nutmeg, which actually to my surprise were a nice addition. I thought the chili powder and cayenne could be reduced even more, but my son loved them as they were, my husband agreed with me. I mixed the rice and beans together at the end to thicken the bean mixture up, which was a bit soupy by itself. We topped with all the taco fixens. Pretty easy meal and we did enjoy the burritos."
