For all the people who are whining and complaining that it didn't have enough flavor, it's the type of recipe that you can be built upon. The recipe as written, is good and simple, if you want more flavor, you can add a ton of different things to this recipe, but as written, it's very good. I topped mine with some cheese and sour cream. I'll definitely be making it again."

I added a bit of fennel and star anise and peas just to mix it up. Will definitely cook again. Singaporean Indian dinner guest loved it."

And more garlic and salt and pepper (not cayenne) and oil are really needed to make it work. I like the suggestions others made about things they added but didn’t want this to be a tomato and chili powder kind of dish. Very disappointed."

But the main recipe and the top comment's additions made for a fabulous meal. My fella said it was \"spiced perfectly\" and dove right in. I really liked it too. The rice ended up a little less fluffy than I'd have liked, but that's my own fault for having the additional liquid in there from the can of tomatoes. Will be sure to account for the extra liquid the next time around. Still though, soooo good! Think I've found a new staple."

When finished, you can garnish with tortilla strips (colored ones) or tortilla chips crumbled on top. We had chicken on the side, but we could add it to the dish as well. I sprinkled a little chlli powder on top of my portion. Nice and filling, nutritious, and good."

Put 1/8 tsp cayenne &amp; the cumin in with the rice while it cooked. Very grateful to find this recipe, since I had limited supplies and didn't want to go to the store!"

"reviewBody": "I made the recipe as written with the exception of not adding the full amount of beans. I was combining the rice and beans and after adding one can of beans which was about 1 and 3/4 cups, I felt like that was the perfect amount of beans to rice ratio for my liking.\n Next time I will rinse the beans in water and then drain, instead of just draining the liquid from the can. When I did combine the rice and beans and stirred them together, the rice took on a dirty or gray color vs. staying white. If I would have rinsed the beans first in water, I think it would have looked prettier or more appealing."

"reviewBody": "The recipe is a good one and the proportions are good but I think that the order of operations is why some people find it so bland. This is how I think the instructions should read:\n\n1. In the stock pot, heat the oil. Set a timer for 4 minutes and dump the onions in.\n2. At three minutes left, add the spices. This activates the spices.\n3. At two minutes left, add the rice. I'm not at all sure that toasting rice before adding water does anything important but it seems to be the fad these days.\n4. At one minute left, add the garlic. This way the garlic doesn't get murdered by cooking over direct heat for so long.\n5. When the timer goes off, turn the heat down to low and add the broth. If the broth is still warm from the kettle, then it should boil instantly. Just slam that lid down to hold the steam in. Otherwise, bring up to a boil and then turn down to low and put the lid on.\n\nDo the above and it should be pretty flavourful."

Lots of protein so this one is great as an entre alone or as a slightly sophisticated side.\n\nI've used it as a burrito stuffing with some country sausage and scramble egg. Wrap it in a steamed flour tortilla. Pop it up a bit by turning some spinach into the egg and sausage mixture just before you fold in the beans &amp; rice. Adding a little chopped cilantro (if you have it) is a great add. By now the volume has nearly double so steam a few extra tortilla shells."
