I also had 1/3 cup special dark hersheys cocoa makes it rich my husband is a chocolate lover. Batter should be on thicker side. And filling needs to be just right i let cream cheese set out for 2 hrs before mixing. Mix cream cheese, egg and sugar until smooth then i just fold about a half a bag of mini chips in. Also filling should be thick not runny."

"reviewBody": "It‚Äôs been YEARS since I had a black bottom cupcake and I had a craving and was surprised to discover the internet doesn‚Äôt have too many recipes for them. Decided to give this recipe a shot. Made my first batch as written and giving them three stars. Second batch I used coffee instead of water, added espresso powder, a whole tablespoon of vanilla, used dark cocoa, doubled the salt in both the batter and filling (salt adds flavor to baked goods, not saltiness, it DOES matter and you CAN taste a difference, contrary to other reviews), and nearly doubled the chocolate chips. Baked in mini muffin tins for 12 minutes. Spray the cupcake liners if you want to make sure these won‚Äôt stick. 1/3 full was not enough for mini cupcakes. Fill halfway with batter and add a heaping teaspoon of filling. Next time I‚Äôd add a little dollop of raspberry jam before adding cream cheese filling to make them more like the ones from my childhood. I think these are much better cold from the refrigerator the day after they are baked."

We had only been dating for about three weeks at that time. I don't remember how many I made but they filled a gallon size zip-loc bag full. I gave them to my honey in the morning and they were gone by bed time. These did the trick!! I'm making them today and giving them to my honey in celebration of our 11th anniversary. I have made them several times, like when I want something, made a mistake, or just want to see him smile. They work every time. I have never changed a thing in this recipe. Make as directed and you will see."

This recipe uses the original ratios for the filling but halves the ratios for the cake batter so you end up with twice as much filling as you need. The cream cheese filling runs all over the top instead of setting up in the middle. They were not right at all. Do yourself a favor and use the Hershey's website recipe from the '70's when they were called \"Filled Rich Chocolate Cupcakes\". Hope this helps!"

"reviewBody": "A delicious and pretty addition to a cookie tray but baker beware! Some experimenting is necessary when baking. Overfilling the baking cup even the slightest bit will cause the dark cake batter to bake too high--out of the liner. I used mini cupcake liners and put 1/2 Tablespoon of dark batter with 1 teaspoon of cream cheese batter. Baked 15 minutes. \nI would advise only filling the liner 1/3 full no matter the size. I might try using brownie batter next time, which doesn't rise so high."

I made these 2 days ahead of our cook out and I think the extra time made them taste even better. They are also particularly tasty if kept in the fridge and eaten cold. Will be adding this to my recipe box."

"reviewBody": "I've made this recipe many times and the raves I get continue for days. I've also made just the cake base, without the cream cheese filling. When I make the cake portion, I lightly dust it with confectioners sugar and serve it with a generous scoop of premium vanilla ice cream. The richness of the chocolate cake and the creaminess of the vanilla ice cream result in so many requests for the recipe that I have to explain how I came up with it. Because this cake is so moist, I've never frosted it (it diminishes the cake and the whole effect is lost!). Give it a try!\n\nPS: I place the cake batter in an 8\" x 8\" x 2\" pan. I've also doubled the recipe and made a 9\" x 13\" x 2\" pan."

I got 16 cupcakes out of the recipe, baked for only 18 minutes. The extra cream cheese mix went into a ramekin and baked. I saved some mini chocolate chips and pushed them into the center of each cupcake after they came out of the oven, which melted and was so VERY yummy."

"reviewBody": "I have made this recipe many times. It's easy to follow and turns out every time. I substitute 2/3 of the oil called for with apple sauce, which makes them more moist and light. Agree with another reviewer that the cream cheese has to be soft. I leave it sitting on top of my stove while pre-heating for several minutes and that does the trick. If you prefer a less-sweet taste, you can get away with less sugar in the filling and batter and they are still delicious."

"reviewBody": "My husband requested cupcakes and I had all of the ingredients for this recipe so I gave it a whirl. He loved them, so I'll be making them again. I substituted 1/2 of the water for a blend of milk and coffee in the batter. Coffee always compliments chocolate flavor. I was forced to used regular sized chocolate chips, didn't have the mini ones, but they turned out great. In fact, I liked the larger burst of chocolate in the filling. Reduced the recipe serving size to \"18\" and got a perfect 12 cupcakes...I like to fill my muffin pans enough to get a healthy sized cupcake."

Here's a great tip; I used a large cookie scoop to transfer the batter to the cupcake liners and it came out to exactly 24, evenly filled cupcakes. Then I used a small cookie scoop to top the batter with the cream cheese mixture right in the center. They came out perfectly and the cream cheese mixture sunk into the batter as intended. Happy baking!"

I'm not understanding the \"blah\" reviews about the cake, mine was moist, chocolatey and very tasty. I will try the coffee substitute next time as I normally do this but I was pretty surprised how good this recipe is as written. I baked mine for 25 minutes. I will make these again!"
