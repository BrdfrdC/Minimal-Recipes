"reviewBody": "Black Forest has been one of my favourites since I was young. This recipe, the first that came up on my search was far from a real Black Forest cake. Cake was not as fudgey and moist as I would have expected. Sour cherries are just not available in Canada and since one is essentially making pie filling anyway and the canned version is already tart it works perfectly add a touch of lemon juice and vanilla to get the tin flavour out. I have never in my life seen or heard of using the crumbs to coat the sides of the cake but I guess is a chinsy version of using grated chocolate‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.I will stick with grated chocolate myself. Overall a good basic recipe for a beginner baker or for the kid bakers or at the very least a basic how too. Make your own deep chocolate cake for the base cake. Secondly the whipped cream recipe used here will likely fall within a day without some sort of stabilizer like skim milk powder or cream of tarter to allow it to hold for a couple days. In the end maybe just use an entirely different recipe or make your own adjustments as most here seem to be doing."

Instead of crumbling a whole layer of cake for the outside, i just shaved off the sides so it could still be four layers. also, for the whipped icing i recommend adding merengue powder so the icing can stiffen and not become liquid overnight and to avoid the cake collapsing. I put about 3 teaspoons and it worked like a charmüëç"

And it is very impressive to make/look at. Crazy - I forgot the vanilla in the cake portion, but it still turned out fine. I‚Äôm sure it would‚Äôve been better tho! I took 1 star off just because for my taste, I think I would‚Äôve liked it to be a tad sweeter. (I don‚Äôt think the vanilla would‚Äôve affected that.) Or maybe it would‚Äôve, in which case I‚Äôd give it 5 stars. But other people liked it bc it wasn‚Äôt too sweet. It was relatively easy to make, impressive, and quite delicious."

Brushed layers with substitute of vanilla vodka and used leftover cherry goop from filling as no Kirsch available. Chilled in between whipped cream and chocolate application. Came out great!! Will decorate with cherries on top of piped whipped cream on top but cake top wouldn‚Äôt fit so left until presentation. It‚Äôs my 64th birthday cake reminiscent of my time in Bavaria in USAF , used my birthday present, a stand mixer, not too sweet very moist!"

My granddaughter wanted a chocolate cake and decided to challenge ourselves in baking this beautiful cake. It was really a joint effort and had so much fun in making come together. \n\nThe only change we made was the two cans of tart cherries it called for; we added one can tart and the other sweet making them two different shades of red and two different sizes of cherries. You can see the two colors together made a great combination on top.\n\nTip, before adding the cherry filling between the layers or on top, make sure it has been cooled off enough or they will be runny. I placed the cherry filling in freezer as I placed the icing on the cake. Gave them more consistency."

I agree with others that I found it difficult to find the canned cherries so I just used cherry pie filling. \n\n I also made mine 4 layers instead of 3 but I crumbled the cut off from when I levelled the cakes and added that to the bottom of the cake. I then also made a chocolate ganache and made it a drip cake."

But for the cake recipe the ratio of wet to dry seemed off and it was so I added a cup more of milk. That worked, otherwise the cake was average not the best but not the worst either. I was also surprised to see no Kirsch, weird for a Black forest cake to not have (but again I'm cheap so meh). If you're going to make this cake be prepared to make alterations."

I added more cocoa powder, less sugar (and half brown/half white at that), butter instead of oil, and buttermilk in place of regular milk in the cake!.Turned out nice and dark chocolatey! Yum! And for the cherries, I simply used some of my frozen tart cherries, put them in a pot to heat up, and followed along with the recipe for adding corn starch and sugar to them from there. Those worked great too! This is a great recipe, thanks for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "This was a great cake. I liked that it did not include alcohol; I don't care for Kirschwasser. The chocolate cake is a great stand alone recipe. It was easy - love a good one bowl cake. The crumb was tender, cake moist without falling apart, and the flavor was sublime. The cherry filling was so easy and not a cloying sweet like canned pie filling. I did reduce the amount of sugar by 1/4 - 1/3 cup to keep some of the tart of the cherries. That tart really did provide some balance to this cake. The quantity of heavy whipping cream called for was way too much. I think 2 cups, prior to whipping, would have been ample. Otherwise, the powder sugar was a great addition. It was not too sweet and was the crowning touch to this cake. It was truly a great cake - the ladies I shared it with were full of compliments - appearance, taste, texture! I will definitely be making this again. Thank you Linda Greer for this tasty contribution!"

I also filled another reviewers tip to stabilize the whipped cream with gelatin to make the whipped cream hold up. I choose to use all four layers in the cake and used grated chocolate on the sides of the cake, instead of crumbled cake.

They were much easier to pit once they were cooked. Then I added the cornstarch and sugar. I put much less sugar than was called for in all of the recipe since I don't like it too sweet. I found the batter was not enough to put into 2 pans. The batter was very good tasting and had the right amount of chocolate. I would make it again. If you want a very high cake, you may want to double the batter. I would make it again. It was delicious!"

So this was a great recipe for a kid-friendly cake. I made the cherry mixture and cake the day before and assembled it the day-of. I was worried it would be too wet if I did it the day before. Turns out, it might have been better to make it the day before to incorporate the moisture from the cherries into the cake. The cake recipe was wonderful - it had a fudge consistency. I also used shaved chocolate instead of the crumbled cake. It added texture. It was a big hit! I'll be using this recipe again!"
