Can't wait to try in a fried rice dish. We had this as a side dish for Swai fish from this site. It did need to cook longer but that is not a big thing if you know that ahead, but since this was our 1st time our dinner come out all together for the meal."

A Merlot balances well with this meal as the encrusting was Rosemary, Basil and Dijon Mustard. With the savory rice a full bodied wine is needed."

I doubled this recipe and used coconut oil instead of butter with roughly-chopped 1/2 cup of whole almonds. Put paper towels on the counter, in the area that the ventilation \"spits\" the steam, if you're using a rice cooker."
