I cut out the pineapple and the apple, but otherwise followed the recipe as amended (that is, 1.5 l not 750 ml of vino) and used a cheap but decent cab (Frontera out of Argentina; 1.5 liter for under 10 bucks up here). Tends towards the strong side but gives a good buzz. Had it with a paella we made and some Tapas and all was well."
