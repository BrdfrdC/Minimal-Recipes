Also, I used non-dairy substitutes for the butter and milk that were an easy swap. I wish there were an easy way to remove the seeds, that would make it so much better. Served it with vanilla non-dairy ice cream to balance the sweetness. It would have gotten more stars if it weren’t so sweet. Nobody needs that much sugar."

Cake batter is way too thick to pour over the berry soup I was left with and the whole thing turned into a hideous cake island mess and it was a disaster to try to salvage it. Will not ever be using this recipe again."

I also cheated and added a bit of extra blackberries, butter and brown sugar (because I LOVE topping!), but once it came out, it turns out I didn't need it. Next time I make it, I will just use the regular portions. The other piece of advice is to make sure it bakes long enough. You'll want it fully cooked. I ended up baking mine for about 45 minutes, which meant the edges were golden brown, slightly crispy and great. Served it warm with vanilla ice cream and LOVED the final result."

Thank God I thought ahead and placed the pan on a parchment lined baking sheet or I’d be scrubbing up the wasted ingredients. I am so disappointed...what waste of ingredients. I was so excited to try this. The only thing I can think of of that the 3/4 cup white sugar into the berry mixture just makes it runny before you even add the batter causing it to overflow."

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe pretty much as is except that I used 3/4 cup of sugar for the batter and used 1/3 c of milk instead. I agree with the reviewers who say that this recipe could definitely benefit from less sugar in the batter. Honestly, the sugar used for the blackberry topping is just enough to make up for the sugar you can cut from the batter. With that said, I could have used 1/2 cup of sugar and still the cake would taste sweet enough. My blackberries were on the bland side so the sugar the recipe called for the topping made up for the blandness of the fruit: thus, balancing the recipe throughout. Here are my suggestions to balance the sugar of the recipe: Consider the sweetness of your blackberries and the amount of WHITE sugar on the batter. If you use sweet blackberries, you can cut off some of the WHITE sugar to 3/4c. Then, use about 1/2 cup of sugar for the batter. If your berries are bland or bitter, make the topping as is and cut the sugar of the batter to 1/2cup. My other suggestion regardless of the sugar content is to make a bit of whipped cream icing (Chantilly Cream) for decoration. It will be a nice decorative touch on the side and will neutralize any excess of sweetness. Overall, this recipe with a little tweaking of the sugar content, is just very nice. The cake is very dense and accompanies the topping very well. Be patient when pouring the batter. Pour it in little mounds and level it carefully. If you have a spring foam pan, it will be the perfect to"

Made the berry compote in the baking pan as suggested. The batter was a little thick but I spread it out over the berries with my finger and it was perfect!"

I will say, though, it was a little too sweet for me. Next time, I'll cut the amount of sugar by 1/4-1/2 cup."

"reviewBody": "I had some super sour blackberries in the fridge and decided to try this recipe out. Initially it was for home, but had a last minute dinner to go to so decided to take it along. Safe to say it was a success!!\n\nAs the other comments said, the cake mixture was quite thick, and I was worried that there wasn't enough of the mixture. But it turned out fine. The cake was a little dry, so I might add a bit more milk next time. It was also a bit sweet, so might use a tad less sugar for the cake next time. \n\nDefinitely would make this again!! Really quick and easy for something so lovely!"

"reviewBody": "Very sweet, and cake like cobbler topping. I used fresh picked blackberries, but found the seeds really gritty, so I suppose you could use blueberries. Anyway, I made the batter, which seemed too thick for cake, and poured it over the cooked berries. It was really thick and not easily spread within the 9 inch pan. Don't worry though, because the batter eventually covered the pan top and cooked to a cobbler consistency. I will use a 1/4 cup less brown and white sugar, otherwise everything else was fine!"

"reviewBody": "Everyone loved this cake. The blackberries were freshly picked from our Thornless Blackberry vines. I lined the bottom of a deep 9\" fluted pan with parchment paper and poured the blackberry topping on top of the parchment paper. Because this is a rather thick cake batter, I scooped the batter onto the topping, gently spread with a spatula and baked for 40 minutes. I allowed the cake to cool and turned the cake plate upside down over the cake pan and then flipped it, removed the pan and slowly peeled the parchment paper. This cake sliced and served so well. A couple of our guests wanted vanilla ice cream with their serving, however, I preferred the cake just as it was. Thank you, PamelaP for sharing your delicious recipe. I will be making this again and again."
