I was worried it would be soggy but the recommended 2 tablespoons of starch fixed that perfectly..i used a store crust so I cant comment on the but I do agree that 1 full cup of sugar is necessary..i thought that was suggested due to the blackberries so I didnt add more because i had just the blueberries but even still it couldve used the extra 1/4 cup. It still was yummy with ice cream but alone it isnt very sweet"

So rich, thick and lots of deep flavour. Instead of cooking the fruit in the pie and worrying about it being to thin, I thaw the berries in a sauce pan, add the sugar, salt, cinnamon, lemon juice and butter. Then when it gets hot I add the flour and cornstarch and mix until it is thick. Then I add it to the uncooked pie shell and put the uncooked pastry on top on and bake till browned."

"reviewBody": "I tried this recipe using my own pie crust recipe. I used 3 1/2 c. blackberries and 2 c. blueberries and added about 1 1/4 c. sugar, as the blackberries needed more than the blueberries do. I also added about 1 tbsp. of quick cooking tapioca. The filling was not too runny or too thick; just about right. Instead of baking it for the entire time in the oven, I baked it at about 80% power in the microwave for 10 min. first, while the oven was heating, then finished it for 10-12 min. at 425 degrees in the oven. This prevents the crust from browning too much. The microwave baking time equals about the same as 30 min. in the oven for 10 min. in the microwave. I've done this with other fruit pies in the past, and it saves heating up the kitchen too much also."

Here's how I did this recipe: Added berries to pan on medium heat with sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, ginger, and cardamom (depth of flavor) and added 2 tsp. water to 2 tsp. cornstarch or flour. This step thickens the berries and prevents too much juice. I waited for the berry mix to cool then and added it to the pie crust to bake. It made the perfect pie! Will make again."

"reviewBody": "We used the Crisco crust recipe, which is almost identical to this one. I used fresh berries, and followed the recipe almost exactly. We wanted raspberries in our pie, so I did 3/4 cup blackberries, 3/4 cup raspberries (with the listed amount of blueberries). I also added a little more sugar and skipped the lemon. We also sprinkled some maple sugar I happened to have on hand on top of the crust after we pulled it out of the oven which really added a lot to the final product. Okay, so maybe we didn't follow the recipe all that exactly. :-) But I didn't see the recommendation to add cornstarch until afterward, and I'm actually kind of glad I didn't. We served it still warm, but it had jelled nicely and tasted absolutely delicious. It was a little gooey but I thought the texture of the filling was perfect. I wouldn't have wanted it more firm. The whole family (except the one member who doesn't like berry pie) gobbled it up."

To sum up the discussion on using frozen berries: If you are using frozen berries, either don't drain so much juice and add the flour or cornstarch, or drain ALL the juice and DON'T add the flour or cornstarch. I drained all the juice and added the thickeners and it was way too thick. However, the sweet/ tart flavors of this pie was just right and adding the ground cinnamon as well as nutmeg wouldn't hurt (I used a combination of ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon, leftover from making carrot cake) and it turned out alright :)"

Not to mention after 45 minutes of baking the crust came out slightly uncooked and the blackberries had liquified. My first slice was a few hours after it had cooked and it still tasted good (Would've actually rated this a 3 had I not been too lazy to post here until morning ) even though it was really runny but after letting it sit overnight the bottom crust became unbelievably mushy and I started to taste the cornstarch."

I opted not to make the crust for the pie and instead used a frozen roll-out pie crust. Because I only had one, I found the Crumb Topping for Pies recipe by Jakesdelights and added that to the top. I cooked for 35 minutes and the topping got a little too dark. Next time, I'll probably check it after 30 minutes. Because the crumb topping has brown sugar in it, I might also reduce the amount of sugar in the filling as it was very sweet."

I made an egg wash of: egg white, a small amount of yolk and a small amount of cold water - beat it until slightly frothy then brush on top of the pie. I also sprinkled some sugar over top of the wash. When the pie was in 20 minutes, the edges were already golden brown so I covered them with foil. There was some filling seepage but the pie was still so pretty that I had to take a picture and upload. \nI will definitely be using this recipe again."

I am not sure how to reduce this as I used frozen berries, thawed them and drained them before I put them in the pie. My crusts didn't even stay together long enough to put it in the oven. The juice took over and separated them before I could finish my decorative crust.\n\nNOTE! I also added 3 TBS of corn starch. I've never had to use a turkey baster to reduce the amount of juice in a pie - this was a first for that! \n\nI'm thinking that the frozen berries were at fault here. Had I used fresh, this may not have happened."
