I have made it multiple times and different ways - grill, cast iron to a baking sheet, and it's always great, but it came out the absolute best when I bought thin sliced chicken breasts and kept them in the cast iron skillet on the stove top. Took about 5 mins on each side, with a very hot skillet on med heat. I also used cooking spray, instead of oil, to cut down on smoke as the top comment on this recipe advises. My spouse has an undying hatred of cumin, do not ask me why, so I substitute garlic powder. Perfection!"

The instructions say after it's blackened to put it in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. It was still RAW inside. I ended up baking it for 15-20 min, checking for the internal temperature. This was disappointing, because the rest of my dinner had to keep reheating to wait for the chicken.\n\nIt did taste great though."

I served it with a garlicky brown rice and a side salad. Definitely going to make a big batch of it to have on hand! 10/10"

This recipe does not call for oil, which I feel is a problem. I will try to make again but maybe use the grill instead to get the chicken crispy."

Easy to make. Thanks for sharing."

Also, instead of using two larger chicken breasts, I used 4 smaller sized ones. Seared in the pan for about 3-4 mins each side, then baked in the oven for about 10-12 minutes. The chicken came out super juicy and flavorful. Perfect to slice and put on top of my Gorgonzola cream sauce gnocchi."

The only thing I altered is I used oregano instead of thyme because that's all I had on the spice thing. As far as the 1 review of a \"dangerous fire\", for one you typically don't cover cast iron, and for two you had it too hot. Mine turned out perfect but the cooking time always doesn't work out quite right. I cook way longer that the times stated. Overall really enjoyed it! My only question, after its seared in a cast iron pan, why not just put the hot pan in the pre-heated over? Again, I'm far from a chef but just wondering if it would turn out the same....."

I followed the advice of another reviewer and just cooked these on a really hot skillet. They came out great. Very moist and a little spicy since I double the seasoning. You really need to serve these over something more bland like rice or Alfredo fettuccine noodles since the chicken is so flavorful. If you don't like it too spicy, just leave the recipe as is and I'm sure you'll enjoy it."

I followed the directions exactly as Karena had laid out (including brushing the chicken breasts with vegetable oil before sprinkling the seasoning on them), and it turned out PERFECTLY !!! I did throw in a teaspoon of garlic powder just for add'l flavoring. I doubled the recipe (based on previous reviews) and it was PERFECT for two large chicken breasts !!! Also, I seared the chicken breasts in a fry pan for approx 2 1/2 minutes per side before putting them on a tray in the oven for 20 minutes. (And allowed them to cool for approx 5 minutes after pulling them out of the oven.) Thanks Karena !! I will make this dish a \"regular\" in our home, and highly recommend to others !!! : )"
