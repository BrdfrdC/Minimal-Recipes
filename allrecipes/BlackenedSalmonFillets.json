Heated up a well-seasoned cast iron skillet on medium high and used olive oil instead of butter. Turned burner down to medium low and cooked salmon for 4 minutes on one side. Flipped, covered and turned heat (gas burner) to low for 3 minutes. Perfect!"

Anyhow butter burns so just heat cast iron skillet and add a tablespoon of EVOO to the pan and cook at medium for 3 minutes skin side down, turn over and cook 4-5 more minutes. Who wants their salmon to taste like burnt butter? You can always drizzle it with melted butter when it’s done cooking. Oh and def add garlic powder and less cayenne. Following these changes will give the perfect blackened salmon."

I always use an iron cast skillet placed on an outdoor grill even in winter. It allows for a very hot skillet with tons of smoky flavor. Otherwise, watch out for smoke alarms going off indoors. Use the highest heat possible for pure blackened salmon. For extra thick salmon steaks just throw in the oven at 350 for a few minutes after the skillet."

Conclusion-smoking hot skillet is not a requirement! Thanks for the recipe...I literally have this blackening in my spice cabinet to have made up/on hand!"

This recipe is a keeper. Next time we will cook outside on the Blackstone griddle and keep the spice fumes out of the kitchen."

I only used about 1/3 of the cayenne, personal preference. I also added a bit powder chipolte . Next time I will use some smoked paprika. I also had 6 fillets, a couple of them were trout, which my family said was also excellent. I did not increase any of the ingredients and there was enough to cover all the fish."

Salmon was out of the question Pan seared,baked ,or steamed it would sit on his plate untouch. So when prepared this recipe he was very dubious on trying it.\nBAM !!! what a success he actually had 2 pieces of the salmon.\nThis recipe is full of flavor and the blacken salmon heightens the taste. regretfully I did not take pictures . In the future I will . This recipe will be the go to recipe when I cook Salmon. \nThank you so much."

"reviewBody": "My husband went to the supermarket looking for something special to eat. He found some great looking fillets of salmon which had the skin on, so that is what we used. I followed the recipe for the most part, did not have white pepper, so used only black and instead of butter used olive oil to brush the fillets before putting the spices on it. I also added a bit of chili powder and garlic powder to the spices. Sorry Allrecipes but I cannot cook anything without garlic and onions . I did use a bit of butter mixed with olive oil when cooking the fish. I cooked the fish on an iron skillet and according to the cooking instructions. Our fish came out incredibly delicious and even though I am not a big fan of salmon, I liked this recipe very much ...double thumps up. Oh, when serving, I sprinkle a bit of fresh cilantro and the green part of scallions on top of the fish! Yummy"
