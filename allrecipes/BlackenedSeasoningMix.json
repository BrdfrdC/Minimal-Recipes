"reviewBody": "I was googling for a good blackened seasoning recipe for me and my girlfriend and imagine my delight to find this recipe front-and-center at my favorite recipe website! I can't say how much we love this seasoning, right out of the gate. First, we didn't have any problem with the amount of oregano as others have had, but adjust as necessary. Next, we like things very spicy, so we bumped up the cayenne to 1 TBSP. Finally, we added a dash of curry as well. One of the great things about this is that it's saltless. My girlfriend likes much less salt than I do, and sometimes I would like to minimize salt intake for varying reasons. This recipe allows us to control the saltiness at will. It's amazing how much we could use without overpowering. We've already tried this on ground turkey, sautéed in avocado oil and butter to put on a sandwich or in tacos; it's also phenomenal on tilapia as some have mentioned. We’ve already decided to keep some of this in a bowl next to the stove for regular use. It’s magical! I can’t wait to try some as a rub on some meat for the smoker. We will be making A LOT of this in the future. Thanks so much."

I covered my meat (first time was salmon, second chicken thighs) entirely, making sure each surface was covered with a thick layer of seasoning. Then, I fried each in a pan with butter. I made sure to touch the meat as little as possible, letting each side cook for 6-8 minutes. FOOLPROOF! I would recommend to anyone. This is seriously becoming a new staple recipe for me. Thanks so much!"

I added additional garlic powder and finally some Lawry's Seasoning Salt. I only added a pinch of oregano because I don't like it. Perhaps fresher herbs would have helped."

"reviewBody": "This recipe it really helped me! I, too usually cook salt free but in this case salt was good. I modified it as follows: First of all, I don't actually \"blacken\". Burning food is toxic and carcinogenic. Don't do it! Use \"Trader Joe's South African Smoke\" for the basil (that will give you that smokiness), \"Slap Yo Mama\" **HOT** Cajun seasoning (make sure you use the hot version!) for the salt, black pepper, red pepper, and onion powder, add extra dried onions, and add enough water and olive oil to make a rub, and use a fresh clove of garlic not dried garlic powder. Use other ingredients in the recipe (oregano, thyme, paprika). You should have a nice, thick paste for a rub, but not so thick that you can't spread it well. And then rub it on some fresh tilapia– And cook just enough don't blacken– Use a little extra water in the pan so nothing dries out. Don't use full flame, and use a cover while cooking. When it's done there shouldn't be much water left but it shouldn't be at all dry or brown much less burnt. And that's going to be spicy and tasting good! O btw the way I didn't measure anything-I just kept adding the stuff until it looked and smelled right and I rubbed up that fish with the good flava' before cooking it."

If you do the same amount of pepper but half blackvand half white, than double the salt so it's a 2-1 ratio(2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon white pepper) you have a very flavorful true to style blackening seasoning. Very good on pork, steaks, chicken and mild fish like grouper, trout and tilapia."

We also agree that THIS seasoning mix is even better. Always mindful of Hubs' sensitive innards I reduced the cayenne by half, leaving all else the same. We used it to blacken grouper in a cast iron pan on our outdoor grill - just out of this world. All the seasonings blend cooperatively with each other to create a whole new taste - in other words, no one spice stands out. And for us, cutting the cayenne by half was just right. Great recipe."
