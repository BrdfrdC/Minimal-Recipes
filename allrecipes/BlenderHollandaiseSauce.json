You can not add butter all at once, or fail to blend while adding the butter or it will cook and curdle the egg yolk. I omit the mustard and I like sprinkling a bit of paprika on top."

I use an immersion blender in a tall narrow container, and the only trick is to ensure that the butter is quite hot and you are blending the entire time you are slowly drizzling the butter in. If the butter isn't fairly hot, the egg will not thicken at all. Easy recipe to customize to your family's taste. Today I served it on homemade crab cakes."

This recipe couldn't be easier to prepare and is delicious. Heck,it even allows for tweaking to your taste w/o making it difficult. It's up to you to notch it up or down. If afterwards you don't think it was it could have been, that on you then. Just saying."

"reviewBody": "My first job ever was working breakfast at Tippin’s. Their restaurants have long been out of business, but I have craved their Eggs Benedict after all these years. I always order Eggs Benedict go out to breakfast or when we travel, etc and rarely have had any as good as the version they served. They used Wolferman’s THICK English muffins (amazing and worth every calorie) and this recipe tastes exactly like the hollandaise Tippin’s used. SO good and perfect for a special occasion. For my trial run, I had no real butter on hand so I used yogurt butter and avocado butter and it still turned out amazingly good. So you could make this hollandaise a “little” healthier and be confident it will turn out to be delicious. As another reviewer mentioned, my butter also wasn’t quite hot enough after 1 minute in the microwave. Luckily, I was using a hand mixer and bowl, so I just set my bowl in the pan of hot water I was planning to make my poached eggs in. I continued mixing as the bowl heated up and it set perfectly. Next time I’ll just heat my butter longer, but this method saved the sauce ;). If you love a lot of hollandaise and are planning to serve 4-5+ people, I would absolutely double or triple this recipe. My craving for Tippin’s Eggs Benedict has been satisfied!"

This recipe made it super easy using my food processor and the consistency turned out marvelous - so creamy &amp; no cooked egg pieces! I omitted the dijon mustard since I don't like it/carry it in my house and added an extra egg yolk and an extra Tbsp. of lemon juice per another reviewer's suggestion. The lemon juice was overpowering in my opinion, so I tamed it back with about a teaspoon of Splenda since I'm doing the low-carb thing. I will keep the extra yolk but not add the extra juice next time. This is definitely a keeper and the best/easiest way to make a deliciously decadent hollandaise!"

"reviewBody": "This was good, and definitely easy, but a tad bit lemony for our taste. Next time I may try 2 tsp instead of one tablespoon of lemon juice. I had the yolks and other ingredients blended and ready, and melted the butter on the stove, as I try to avoid microwaving as much as possible. At the last minute, I cranked up the heat to get the butter bubbly, and was able to easily time this to be ready the moment the asparagus was. For those who had theirs end up runny, I imagine it had to do with the temperature of the butter. Ours was the perfect consistency and texture. Will definitely make again with a tad less lemon."

"reviewBody": "Making Hollandaise sauce, because I rarely make it, has always been an intimidating experience to me. I was in a rush this morning, making eggs Benedict. I tried this recipe in order to get brunch on the table quickly. I used a Braun hand-blender. Given the simplicity, speed, and taste, this recipe is a no-brainer. The speed that it all comes together is so quick, I would hold off adding the melted butter in preparing the sauce until your dish is fully plated. The taste of it is so good, I will use this as my default recipe even when I’m not rushed."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is a very good substitute in a pinch! I usually make the McCormick brand hollandaise sauce because I like the taste and it's easy to do. This was equally as easy and when I had my butter already melted on the stove ready for my packet, I realized I misplaced the packet. So I quickly searched for a quick and easy recipe to compensate. I already had the perfect amount of butter. All I added were the egg yokes, dijon, and the lemon to the blender and then poured in my already hot butter! We didnt have any hot sauce, but I liked the way this turned out. \n\nI think it almost tastes like McDonalds breakfast sauce, which I'm sad that they discontinued. So now I have a great recipe to use in a pinch or when I crave that same taste!\n\nWhen I make this next time I will add just a little less dijon as it's quite powerful!"

"reviewBody": "I made it and it tasted great but I saw no point in the blender, it was extra work and cleaning. Just make it right in the pan on the stove to start with.\n\nI'd give this 1-star for the blender part, I'd give it 5-stars for ease and taste.\n\nI've made this several times now without the blender. I make this for my family of four on weekend mornings. I use 4 egg yolks and just add a bit more of the other ingredients and we have just enough sauce for (4) english muffins, 2 half covered english muffins for Eggs Benedict for each of us. If you like more sauce and are making more than 4 muffins (8 halves) you may need to make a double batch.\n\nIt is all a matter of taste, make it how you like it, tweak it until you own it. For us, the mustard and hot sauce make this sauce prefect.\n\nI use a large 4 cup Pyrex container right over a burner on the stove adding a little heat as needed. This saves me the extra mess with the blender. If timing is an issue just add a bit of water to reconstitute the sauce and mix and warm as you go. They are egg yolks after all, they will harden a bit if you let them sit after warming the sauce. a little water seems to have had no effect on the taste, I may try milk next time if needed...."
