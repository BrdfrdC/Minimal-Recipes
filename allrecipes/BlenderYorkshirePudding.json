I'm seriously impressed at how perfectly they came out. \n\nThe only thing the recipe doesn't mention is what the consistency of the batter should be so if you're a newbie like me and you're concerned you're doing it wrong; it should be like 'single cream' according to what I found online. \n\nThese are certainly going to become a regular addition to our Sunday roast!"

By the time you get to the last cup the reaction has changed. Nonetheless it's still a recipe that works and doubles well. There are never enough of these to go around, that much is always guaranteed. And they are great the next day, stuffed with leftovers"

However, I would use a muffin tin that had larger spaces (deeper) in order to get a higher \"puff\" on the pudding. \nThis is very similar to a Swedish recipe that I make in a large frying pan - great breakfast with syrup.\nI found these are wonderful with a bit of wild honey."

"reviewBody": "Fantastic, what a no fail recipe! I have struggled making Yorkshire (or hockey pucks as my Dad would call my previous attempts) and now it's a Sunday staple. Right after I put the Prime Rib in the oven, I whip this up in the blender and refrigerate. When the Prune Rib comes out, I put a muffin pan for 12 with 1/4 tsp of the drippings (try using lard or even bacon drippings if you didn't collect any from the roast - real fat makes a huge difference in flavor). Heat the muffin pan as you raise the temp. in the oven, then take the batter straight from the fridge and pour into the hot fat. Huge puffy Yorkshires come out 20 minutes later."
