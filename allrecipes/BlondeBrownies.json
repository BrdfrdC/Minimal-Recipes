This is for a friend with a wheat allergy. My hubby, who is diabetic, was moaning that he wants some too, and so I will change it again by using half the sugar, and adding in ground flax and wheat germ, and possibly ground quinoa so that he can eat a little and not die on me. They smell wonderful, look great and tomorrow when my friend eats his, I think he will agree they are amazing."

I'd never used these substitutions and probably didn't need both, but it worked out deliciously -- especially if you love the taste of peanut butter! I also reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 c and it was plenty. The second time I made them (in the same week!), I made a 13x9\" pan and increased all ingredients by 2-1/2 to make them a little thicker. I also decided just to mix the chocolate chips into the dough and it worked perfectly. Might reduce the amount of chips to 1/2 c next time. I'm thinking this is a good dough to switch up with other additives depending on what sounds good that day!"

It takes good (very sweet, so if you do not like sweet things probably go with different recipe). I think it is important to make sure it isnt cooked too little. Underbaked will be too squishy, and I think slightly overdone would be better than undercooked."

I've been on a brown butter kick lately and this works really well with browned butter...adds a toffee kinda taste. Delicious. I used 2 c. of brown sugar in a tripled recipe and it was perfectly sweet. Also measure your salt very scantly...not quite a full measuring spoon. Ultimately it's a very good recipe, just needed a little tweaking for our family's personal tastes. I suggest making it as written and then tweaking it for yourself...never hurts to have a second batch!"

"reviewBody": "Great recipe! Once the batter is all mixed, I added a little milk because we like ours a little gooey/not as thick. I also added white chocolate chips. I’ve mixed them in the batter once and I’ve also put them on top and when they would start to melt, I would swirl them and make a marble effect. I baked mine for 25 mins or so on 350 and then 10 mins or so on 325 so that the edges and bottom didn’t get too crispy before the middle was done. This helped to keep the texture how we like it...gooey brownies are the best! (Make sure to spray down the pan too... I used a 8x8 glass pan and it was perfect!) Everyone’s ovens and pans are different so a little trial and error to find out what works for you is all it takes. My 5 year old loved helping me with these too. This is now by far my favorite brownie recipe ever and I can’t wait to share with friends and family!"

Next time, I'll back it down to 2/3 cup. Still very, very sweet. EASY recipe to make, though. With slight adjustments due to sweetness level, I'll make this over and over. Thanks for the easy method! **Added 1/3 cup of oatmeal and that tempered the sweetness level a bit. Still too sweet - will keep trying since it's so easy to make."

The only change I made was less than the suggested amount of chocolate chips, and I used mini morsels instead of the traditional size. I doubled the recipe, and used 9x9 pans instead of 8x8. These were gobbled up quick at a party we hosted for my brokerage. Will definitely be making these again!"

"reviewBody": "I totally judge my baked goods by how the batter is. This batter was meh. And I kept checking to see if I had all of the ingredients because it seemed too sugary. Gritty... Lacking in something. I put it on the oven, read the reviews, found someone else thought the same thing. So I pulled them out and started mixing in flour (yep, in the baking dish) until the consistency and pre cooked taste was more to my liking. In the end, we have a winner. I prob doubled the flour. And I also used dairy free butter so my allergy baby could enjoy. Flavor is on point. Thanks for the super easy recipe."

Next time I make them I definitely won’t bake longer than 25min and will update the rating if they turn out less dry."

"reviewBody": "These are awesome. I've made many times using a different combination of baking chips and nuts, sometimes leaving out the nuts all together. I don't even use a mixer with these bars, just mix it all by hand in one bowl. I combine the dry ingredients first, then add the brown sugar, melted butter combined with vanilla, and beaten egg, then I mix with wooden spoon. Using a mixer will beat more air into batter, making for a more cakey brownie, and these are meant to be chewey and \"fudgy,\" not cake-like. Do not overbake these brownies. They will continue to bake after you take them out of the oven. I bake for 23 minutes in my over and take them out just as the top turns goldern brown. I've made these with almonds and white chocolate chips, semi-sweet chips and toffee bits, and milk chocolate chips and pecans. These are just so easy, and everyone likes them."

I doubled the recipe, but wish I would not have doubled the salt as it was a bit too much. Otherwise the flavor is good, not too sweet. It does bake up nicely and rises, but the edges were too crisp for my liking and the batter was hard to work with. I’m not sure if I’ll make again, maybe just as a large cookie cake or something instead of blonde brownies. My husband really liked them and so did the kiddo, but it was just a meh for me."
