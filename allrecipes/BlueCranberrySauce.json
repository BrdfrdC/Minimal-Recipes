I didn't want any skins so I strained the mashed cranberries and put the remaining skins and flesh in my food processor before putting back in the bowl with the juice. I added equal parts of blueberries and raspberries. I also used orange juice for the water as per other reviewers. Everyone LOVED the flavor and put it on the rolls, ice cream, pancakes, etc. Thanksgiving and the following four days. I will make this again but try to get it a little thicker."

For those who think of the canned stuff when you hear of cranberry sauce, this will make you realize fresh cranberry sauce is so much more superior that you’ll never go back. The recipe is easy and relatively quick to make. You could have your children make it while you’re preparing the rest of the Thanksgiving meal."

This year I'm going to mix in some actual orange to the sauce with the fresh blueberries after it cools. \nI love this recipe because there is so much you can do with it!"

I upped the sugar to 3/4 c, but I now agree with other reviewers that it needs a full cup. (Some people must really like things tart.) I cut the cinnamon in half and just put a pinch of nutmeg and allspice-- thought it was spiced just right this way. I also think the use of OJ instead of water would have helped the flavor. A lot of reviewers did this and thus rated the recipe higher. Overall the recipe is OK, but I guess many of the tweaks make it 5 stars."

I would make it again but probably cut the sugar in half because the fresh blueberries do such a good job of makeing it sweet enough. Also love the fact that it contains 2 anti-oxidant power houses (the blueberries and cranberries)!"

"reviewBody": "Made this for Christmas and it went over pretty well. I had to add extra sugar -- pretty much double -- to get it sweet enough that it didn't make you pucker when you ate it. Or, to get it on par with the canned stuff. The only thing I didn't like about making this (which has nothing to do with the recipe itself) is that the skins came off many of the cranberries and often we'd get a mouth full of skins which wasn't terribly pleasant. Could be that I overcooked them. Anyway -- it's a nice change for cranberry sauce but I'll keep trying new recipes -- this isn't the be all and end all."

Emeril's recipe, to be specific. It turns out that his recipe was utter garbage, and tasted like the bottom of a litterbox. This recipe, on the other hand, was amazing... I did a small amount of customization, substituting orange juice for the water, reducing the amount of cinnamon, and adding a slightly larger amount of nutmeg and blueberries. It turned out great, and I want to thank the author for the recipe! Nice work!"

"reviewBody": "HELPFUL TIPS WHILE MAKING THIS: I definitely had to take the advice of another reviewer and add 1C of sugar. All the other cranberry sauce recipes on here call for 1C as well, so it's not as alarming as one may think. Otherwise, it is WAY too tart. Know that when they say the cranberries will POP ...they literally mean pop, so it may be best to not wear white or stand so close to the pot ;) Otherwise, this was delicious and a nice twist to the normal cranberry sauce. I've got to admit that my husband thought there was too much cinnamon, but he is one of those people who are sensitive to seasonings (loves them but hates when one overwhelms a recipe). Personally, I thought it was perfect!!!"

Thanks a lot for a different take on an old favorite. :o)"

"reviewBody": "UPDATE: THIS MADE A LOT, SO I TOOK SOME TO MY MOM &amp; DAD (MOM LOVES MY TRAD. CRANBERRY SAUCE &amp; ASKS ME TO MAKE IT EVERY TDAY). SURPRISINGLY, THEY DID NOT CARE FOR THIS. BOTH FELT IT WAS TOO SPICY (???). OK, here's the deal. I've recently had a hankering for cran relish (guess I didn't get enough of it during the holidays lol). I purchased quite a few 12 oz. bags of fresh cranberries while they were on sale back in Nov. as I was planning to make a LOT of cranberry dishes. Sadly, I never got around to making any of them.... I froze what I had, so that it would be easy to take out what I needed when I needed to (I forgot to thaw for this recipe, so I ran my bag under lukewarm H2O for 5 min. or so). I am hoping to make a slow cooked turkey next wk. I want to serve it w/ all the fixins' - cran sauce, stuffing, dinner rolls, etc. I figure, if I don't get around to making this in the next coming wk., I'll just freeze this until I need it. I must admit I was not sure I was going to like this at all, initially. I am not a fan of cooked blueberries (although I enjoy them fresh), but was so intrigued, I had to give this a try. I am soooo glad I did! The spices are AWESOME (they make the dish)!!! The blueberries are a surprisingly nice add. And if you sub. OJ for the H2O called for (I always do this), this is extra super yummy!!!! I still prefer Holiday Cranberry Sauce (MARJK), but this is a close 2nd! Thanks for sharing, Connie! :-)"

I use 1 cup of sugar (instead of 1/2), freshly grated nutmeg, and fresh squeezed orange juice instead of water. I've tried adding raspberries, and it's great that way. This year I added the arils of one pomegranate instead (with the pint of blueberries), and it's my favorite so far. I do use frozen berries, since they're out of season, and frozen berries are juicier this time of year. Highly recommended recipe! Leftovers: add a spoonful or two to cold sparkling water for a delicious drink. The kids LOVE this!"
