I did somehow made these changes: 1. 1 cup AP flour + 1 cup oat flour instead of 2 cups of AP flour. 2. 1/2 cup of brown sugar + 1/4 cup of white sugar instead of 1 full cup of white sugar (still it came out very sweet so I suggested to reduce it even more. 3. Added 1 spoon of whole fat milk 4. Buttered 2 regular aluminum baking foil pans and dusted brown sugar + cinnamon powder at the bottom and at the top of the bread (highly recommended!) 5. Coated the blueberries with flour so that it won't sink 6. Added chopped walnuts for some crunch and 1 medium banana slices for topping decoration 7. It definitely took over 45 minutes to bake it, I guess every oven is different."

Also added about 4 or 5 more tablespoons of sifted! flour to compensate for extra blueberries. On the top I cup up 1/2 inch thick slices of a regular banana spaced out across batter just barely sprinkled with cinnamon sugar looked great when it came out of the oven ...baked about 45min at 350 or until toothpick comes out clean came out awesome ...."

The instructions say to use 3 small pans. I'm not sure what \"size\" that may be but the batter was too much for my mini pans so I had to use a regular loaf pan. Mine baked for 55 min. in my convection oven which was probably 5 min. too long. Will definitely make again and cover the top about half way through since the top came out a little crunchy. Hubby definitely liked this bread."

I am doing it again for 45 minutes. My bananas had been in the freezer so when they thawed I mashed them and added them. I found when I cut the bread the next day the slices tended to crumble. You need to cut thicker slices than normal quick breads. I really didn't taste the banana."

"reviewBody": "My go-to starter recipe. And I mean that in a good way. This time I changed up the recipe only a bit. I creamed butter and sugar (half cane and half brown sugar) then added vanilla, big dash nutmeg and cinnamon, 4 bananas (I’ve used more in past), added dry ingredients last and as called for, I folded in the fruits, using 1 1/2 cup giant blueberries coated with flour and 1 cup walnuts. I buttered pans and used cane sugar instead of flour to coat over top of butter. Learned that from Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry in their British Baking show. While hot, loosen sides and remove to cool on rack. Comes out much easier than letting bread cool in pan and gives a nice outer crunch. Clean up is easier too. ;) Baked 15 minutes longer, reduced heat to 335 midway, and covered with foil once a bit browned (it continues to brown. Anyway, came out delicious!! Thanks for the recipe."

"reviewBody": "The recipe has a good flavor, but I think it is more suited to muffins, than a loaf pan. First of all, the submitter did not specify SIZE of the \"small\" pans. I have 2 different sizes of bread pans, so since I did not have 3 small ones, I prepared 2 large ones. I messed up a pan unnecessarily, because all of the dough filled one pan, a 9 1/4\" x 5 1/4\", only halfway. I realized, too late, that the \"small\" referred to by the submitter must be 5 3/4\" x 3 1/4\". Of course, the single loaf needed more baking time than was specified. Secondly, the loaf had a cake-like texture, instead of the coarse texture of a quick bread This recipe would be much better suited to muffins, and please look to Sarah Jo's review for them."

So far they look great. As far as I’m concerned this is my go-to recipe. I love it because I don’t need to keep baking powder around (which I don’t use), the recipe is simple, the bread is moist and delish!! Sorry, I didn’t use blueberries. But I did cut up some fresh pecans my hub was an angel to shell for me. Seriously awesome!! I will review again when I hear from my diabetic friends."

"reviewBody": "So I altered the recipe a bit. First off, I used stevia instead of sugar (a little less than a cup). I also used about 2 and a half bananas because I wanted the flavor to really come through. Then, I followed Sarah Jo's suggestion and used a muffin tin at 350 for 22ish minutes. My muffins were small but tasty. Next time, I'll try substituting half of the flour with oats and maybe some of the butter with coconut oil. My goal is to make an almost completely healthy muffin that's also tasty."

They turned green because of the frozen blueberries, but they taste good. It made 18 small muffins (cupcake size, not mini) and I baked them for 22 minutes. Otherwise I followed the recipe. I will make these again. Basic muffins, nothing fancy. Not too sweet, perfect for breakfast Had all the ingredients on hand. Im always looking for ways to use bananas that are over ripe!"

Good thing I checked for doneness - my small loaf pans only needed 23-24 minutes to be baked thoroughly. We liked the flavor but found the bread to be on the dry side . . if I make it again I think I'll increase the amount of butter or add a dollop of sour cream for extra moisture."
