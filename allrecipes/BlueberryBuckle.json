This time around it took an hour in a preheated oven in a glass 8x8 dish with fresh blueberries. However, it’s now my go-to for family gatherings at the holidays and is loved by everyone, including the notoriously difficult in-laws, so no complaints here! Balanced, delicious and (warning: here comes that word that some people have been rallying against in recent years) MOIST. Just nom. I’m making it again right now. Nom nom."

I will keep adjusting this recipe to make it work better because I love the flavor."

Afterwards, I realized it needed vanilla extract and some lemon zest to elevate the flavors and create some depth. Next time, I would try 1 tsp of pure vanilla extract and 1 tsp lemon zest and see if that’s enough or will it need additional tweaking. With these adjustments I’m sure it would raise my rating to 5 stars!"

"reviewBody": "For those who get fussed about 5 stars with edits to the recipe, the recipe as is works nicely so no worries! I have some tips that I like to do for those who want it \n1. As others have said do not reduce flour. Watch how you measure it. If you scoop with the measuring cup you are probably using too much flour as it compresses. Use a spoon to fill the cup and then level it. The recipe says to pour the batter which may be misleading. This is supposed to be a thick batter that needs to be spread into the dish. It has the consistency of peanut butter. This is why it is a buckle. It also won't rise as much as a cake. It is dense and moist.\n\n2. A trick to make a nice crunchy topping for any recipe,\n. Make the topping first. When blended into the pea sized crumbles, press it up against the sides of a glass or metal bowl and put in fridge. When rest of cake is ready , use a fork to break topping away from bowl sides and re crumble. Handle as little as possible to keep it cool. Sprinkle on cake as directed. I personally prefer 50-50 brown and white sugar.\n\n3. Cream your shortening and sugar first and very well. The batter should be light and fluffy and the sugar a bit broken down (eg can't see crystals of it). It will take a few minutes high speed, scraping the bowl down 2 or 3 times. Then beat in egg. I use 50-50 butter and shortening as I prefer how it blends and like the butter taste. I also add 1 tsp good vanilla and beat it in after the egg.\n\n4. Takes 40 min cooking time"

Don't be afraid if the batter is very thick and you have to press it into the pan. Also, the amount of topping is necessary as it adds just the right amount of sweetness! We ate it for dessert, as coffee cake and snuck pieces because we could. Highly recommended!!"

Because of this, I put in 1/2 batter, blueberries which I then pressed into batter, remaining drops of batter, and then crumb topping. It's a relatively light bread/cake, well balanced with berries but not exciting given the cost of blueberries."

I had to add a couple splashes more milk to get it to a better consistency. Everything else was the same. It did take much longer to bake than listed, not sure if that was because I had more milk in there, but mine took about 10-15 more minutes to cook through. Very tasty. It does just taste like a blueberry muffin to me, with a streusel topping."
