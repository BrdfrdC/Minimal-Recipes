"reviewBody": "Made according to recipe using 1/2 Cup chia seeds. Tastes ok, did not set up. Disappointing. Pudding is a thick and creamy desert that you eat with a spoon, this is more like a thinner milkshake that you drink. Won’t make again, don’t want to play around with how much chia seeds are necessary to thicken it up."

"reviewBody": "For my wife's pudding, I followed the recipe as given using Erythritol for the sweetener to keep it low carb . She loved it, especially the creamy consistency and coconut-cinnamon topping. I used maple syrup to sweeten the pudding, and instead of blending all the ingredients together, I added the chia seeds last and just gave the blender a quick tap to stir in the chia seeds rather than grinding them up. My batch took all night in the fridge to set up and the pudding had more of a tapioca pudding type of consistency. And I topped it off with toasted pecan pieces."
