The taste is decent but this was a flat disaster."

Make sure if you use splenda, cut the amount of each kind of sugar in half. \nI thought 2 sticks of butter in the cake was a bit much, so I used 1/2 cup canola oil in the cake batter, but didn't adjust the amount of flour. I put flour on the blueberries, and folded them into the cake batter. \nI used an 8x11 glass pan, sprayed with Pam cake flour. I put 1/2 of the batter in, then sprinkled 1/2 of the topping, then layered the rest. 38 minutes at 350 degrees."

But if you just keep checking with a tooth pick every 5 minutes after the called for time you won’t have an issue. The cake was so moist and flavorful, I almost didn’t want to share it. With the blueberries it evened out the sweet. The topping was flavorful and not too sweet. Be sure when making the crumble to work with cold butter so it doesn’t melt into a blob. That has happened before. The crust then gets really hard. This will definitely be my go to coffee cake recipe."

The streusel did make a LOT, so I put the extra in the freezer since I'll probably make this again. I also, as a personal preference, tossed the blueberries with some of the flour mixture and mixed them into the batter instead of just the middle layer."

"reviewBody": "I followed this recipe without any modifications. The coffee cake is dense, as I would expect for a coffee cake, but it is moist and flavorful. I think adding more milk as others did will result in a lighter cake texture. I guess it's an individual preference.\nI gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 because I felt that there was too much streusel for the size of the cake and not enough blueberries. I'll adjust next time. \nAlso next time, I think I'd use something other than a Bundt pan because I didn't like the streusel on the bottom of the cake when it's unmolded. Or maybe add the streusel in the middle with the blueberries. \nOverall this is a nice recipe for coffee cake."

I let the batter sit in the fridge for an hour to help get rid of the horrible gritty taste from using gluten free flours. *a great tip when baking GF. Adjusted cook time until done. Very good!"
