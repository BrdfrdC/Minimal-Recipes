It simply came out of the oven (yes, after 40 min. at 375) with the blueberries tasting as though they were simply uncooked blueberries and with no juice whatsoever. And to top it off the oats in the topping just gave an unpleasant and annoying texture when chewing."

It also didn't set up well; we ate it when it was cool but it fell apart as it was served. After a night in the fridge the remainder was a little better set but not as I expected it should be. I've been mixing the remainder with plain greek yogurt for breakfast and that combo has been delicious. If I make this recipe again I'll reduce the sugar and add cornstarch like other reviewers."

"reviewBody": "Here's the recipe for the delicious Berry pie I made yesterday for my sister's Christmas party. Step 1: (Easy Peasy way) Basically I got a frozen already made crust I got from Trader Joe's. Step 2: I then mixed in a bowl 2 cups frozen blueberries, 1 1/2 cups cranberries, 1 1/2 cups froezen rasberries (basically 5 cups berries your choice) mixed in with 1/2 cup blue agave (I try to avoid sugar), 1/3 cup pastry wheat flour with 2 teaspoons lemon zest (I actually used extract which made it very tart) and 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice. I also added 1 tablespoon corn starch (or you can use arrowroot) to thicken it (this will be needed as extra water will be created when the berries melt as one reviewer pointed out). Put this filling in the pie crust. Step 3: Follow the rest of the instructions in this recipie to add the crumb topping - I only used 1/2 cup brown sugar and used 3 tablespoons apple sauce and 3 tablespoons cannola oil. It tastes great either hot or cold. I tried it hot topped with whipped cream (see picture) which was really good - Enjoy!"

"reviewBody": "Easy recipe especially if you used frozen pie shell. I always use frozen blueberries as I pick them in my yard at the lake and always have them to use. I never thaw them for pie or muffins. This recipe has plenty of thickener (flour). If you want more add a TBSP more to the berries before they go into the pie shell. Baked 1 hour. I would maybe use 4 1/2 berries next time so that there was more room for the crumble topping to lay flat on the pie. Mine had a swell in the middle so I had to be careful adding the topping as it rolled down. I put my hand along the edge as I was adding topping to prevent that. Fabulous. We ate it warm with vanilla ice cream. Rave reviews from my family. It’s gone..Yum."

Kudos to the submitter for not adding more sugar to the berries. Many add too much &amp; the berry flavor is lost. The topping was good, but - &amp; I mean this not to be a negative - kind of like a dry oatmeal cookie. It softened overnight, of course. Surprisingly with the right amount of sugar with the berries, the topping didn't sweeten it too much, but it didn't. Huh. :D Good, but I prefer regular ole pie crust.

It didn’t set up as it should have and I could still taste the flour."

Made it as recipe reads, except added 2 tbs. cornstarch, and blind-baked the crust for about 10 minutes, covering the edges with tin foil (I used frozen deep dish pie crust). Refrigerated the pie after it cooled a bit. After a few hous of chilling it still bled a bit, but nothing terrible, it was still juicy. Excellent with our homemade peach ice cream. Crumble on top was nice and crispy, good texture . Definitely will make this again."

I also added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to the filling dry ingredients before adding the blueberries. Next time I will try 1 1/2 tablespoons because it was still slightly running. \n\nOur store was out of fresh blueberries so we used frozen. I forgot to thaw them overnight so I put them in a colander and lowered it into cold water for 5 minutes to thaw. Then I let them drain and patted them with a few paper towels. \n\nLove this recipe.

I have not had a problem with it being \"overly wet\". With the suggestion of another reviewer from Grandma Ople's Apple pie, I now always use a pizza stone- not sure if that helps or not.
