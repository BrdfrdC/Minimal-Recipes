"reviewBody": "I’ve made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe but added pecans instead of walnuts since I prefer them. I found the flavor a bit bland, and it was very crumbly. The second time I made this, I added a 5.3 oz container of Greek yogurt (Light &amp; Fit toasted coconut and vanilla flavor) to help with the crumbliness. This may have helped a bit with the flavor as well, but to further enhance it I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, roasted the pecans before adding them, and added extra blueberries. By doing these things, I found both the texture and flavor greatly improved. I cooked this in a 10 inch casserole glass dish. I cut it into 16 squares and froze the squares in a freezer bag. In the mornings, I microwave a square for 45 seconds. I am basing my 4-star review on the original recipe, but with the changes I made I would rate it 5 stars."

The bars are a bit on the crumbly side. I think a better binder would help. The texture may improve with freezing. Although these are a good gluten and dairy free option, I would like to see them bake up a little less crumbly."

I rehydrated a cup of these in whiskey in the refrigerator for 3 days, drained them and used them. I did not have Walnuts and dont like them anyway, but I have black walnuts so I used them. The batter was stiff so I added a drizzle of the spent whiskey to the mix. baked at 350 F 35 minutes, cooled and cut. The crumble factor was not too bad but I will use some regular flour with almond flour next time, and use cream in place of the almond milk. This recipe will work with just about anything."

"reviewBody": "I used low-fat buttermilk, ,instead of almond milk. I also used 1/2 cup of pastry flour- 1/2 cup of oat flour instead of all oat flour. Buttermilk gives me the gut bacteria and a little creamer texture. As stated by another user, the 50-50 pastry-oat flour reduces the tendency for the bars to crumble. I didn't have an 8\" square pan, so I used a 9 \" spring form pan. Approximately the same area, but easier removal."

These bars tasted delicious! In fact, my husband polished them off earlier today! I took off one star because the bars really didn’t stay in “bars”. They turned very crumbly and could not be picked up, which is probably why my 19 month old daughter wouldn’t eat them. If anyone has any suggestion to help make these a little neater to eat, I’m all ears!"

I have a mini loaf pan and baked these in there, so we only got 9 bars. It worked out perfectly and we will definitely be making these again!"

Any ingredients I changed were substituted because that's what I had on hand. I don't have a square pan so I spooned the batter by 1/4 C full into muffin tin and cooked for 10 min. They came out perfectly, but more like a muffin than a bar. Nice and moist and should freeze well. Oh and it was easy! Next time I want to add finely diced apple in place of blueberries."

UPDATE: The next day, these were so crumbly, that I found the best way to eat it was to put a square in a bowl, add some milk (I used almond milk) and microwave it until warm, and eat it like a warm bowl of oatmeal. I also found these to be very filling, and it kept me satisfied until lunch time or later."
