Also my blueberries were stored in sugar so they will add some sweetness to it."

The rest of breakfast was ready, so I put half of the batter in the fridge. I had to add 5-8 minutes to cooking time. It tastes good. Next time I will add cinnamon to the batter and keep the temp at 375 for the allotted time."

Replaced milk and vanilla extract with those.\nUsed a tiny teaspoon of butter on the bottom of 8, 6oz Pyrex ramekins and sprayed with cooking spray on the sides. I did not add any sugar topping, it is sweet enough without it.\nAfter the 20 minutes at 350, I turned the oven off without removing the popovers. Waited an additional 5 mins, opened oven for 5 mins and yes they sunk, but not as much as pulling them out into cooler air immediately. I have made these three times to experiment from original recipe to the above. They are fabulous not matter how you bake them."

"reviewBody": "Delicious, great alternative for pancakes...and quicker! The recipe definitely makes 12 if using a regular muffin tray, not 6. I used frozen blueberries (thawed) and drizzled syrup when they were done. As they “pop over” in the pan, the butter does drip over the sides, so I used a tray to catch underneath. Don’t be afraid to really whip your batter, this is very similar to a Dutch Baby/German pancake...if the flour isn’t really whipped in, they won’t rise as high and will be heavier."

These are good, they are easy, and they don't require a lot of prep or baking time. I used cherry jam in a few of them instead of blueberries, just because I love cherry jam. The jam sank to the bottom and isn't as pretty as the blueberries, but they are equally edible. All in all, I think this recipe is a keeper."

"reviewBody": "My son is lactose intolerant so I used coconut oil instead of butter and almond/coconut milk instead of whole milk. The changes I believe gave it a wonderful flavor! They did fall as soon as they came out of the oven and they stuck to my pan more then I thought they would making them not very pretty to serve. Wonderful flavor will try to repeat and modify to get better results."

"reviewBody": "After reading previous tips, this recipe actually serves 12 so I divided the butter into fourth's (cause I just couldn't make myself put in that much butter) and put one in each cup and only filled each tin 1/2 way. I did not think it was too eggy. Thought it was very similar to a mini version of German Oven Pancake. I opted not to do the cinnamon sugar topping but will try next time. I also, by accident, baked it at 375 the whole time which I think helped it not be as runny as others had mentioned. Turned out beautifully and tasted yummy! I'm keeping it in my recipe file. :)"

Had not thawed my blueberries so I may next time but these were still very good popovers. Mine did not collapse and I followed recipe exactly even to the fresh lemon juice and powdered sugar. Served warm with Irish Tea and they were excellent."

"reviewBody": "I liked these, but will probably play with it or choose another recipe next time. I only added 1T sugar to the batter &amp; that was enough. 'Didn't do the cinnamon &amp; sugar, &amp; confec after - just the confec sugar, about 1T. The recipe seemed off temperature-wise, according to experience &amp; other recipes for popovers. I really like popovers. These didn't look like a hot air balloon, but they did \"pop,\" but immediately deflated. I'm blaming the blueberries. No biggie. Anyone who hadn't had popovers before wouldn't know &amp; they're still good. This made twelve regular size muffin-tin size. Huh? :D I divided the 3T butter among the 12 &amp; they weren't totally stick-free, but close. :)"

"reviewBody": "I have to agree with the other reviewer on this recipe. It was very easy, which made a nice Mother's Day breakfast, but they were pretty eggy. I understand that with three eggs they're going to be eggy, but I just felt like they could use a little more sweetness in them. I used some melted butter and the remaining cinnamon+sugar mixture and poured that over the top of them once I plated them, and that did make them pretty sweet. \n\nFor next time, I thought about using two eggs and then putting some vanilla flavored coffee creamer and a few spices incorporated into the batter, like nutmeg and cinnamon sugar, and instead of using white sugar, maybe brown sugar. I'm not sure. I'm not saying this is a bad recipe at all, because it's not, I just would prefer a little less egg texture and a little more sweetness. With some tinkering around, I think this could be wonderful."

"reviewBody": "I've never had a popover with fruit in it before, and these were a bit heavier in texture than I expected. They fell almost immediately after taking out of the oven, and maybe that's what they're supposed to do, just don't know. They rose VERY high in the oven, and I almost wondered if this should have been 8 popovers instead of 6. The muffin cups were filled right up to the top of the pan. They are not the prettiest popovers I've ever had, they're definitely eggy, but they are tasty and very easy to make."
