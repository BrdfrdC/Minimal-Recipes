It is always delicious, always appreciated, and you need very little planning as most of the ingredients one has around the house. I sprinkle my extra sugar on the top, rather than as directed on the bottom,after filling the Bundt pan. The first time I ever made it I incorrectly did that and it give us a real chewy meringue type finish to the bottom which we enjoy. Highly recommend this."

Next time I made it in the medium size loaf pans and that was great just as gifts. This is a thick batter and I went from using a hand mixer to a stand mixer and it went a lot faster. One thing I added was in the loaf pans I sprinkled turbinado sugar on top...adds a nice crunch!"

Baked for 76 minutes. After 10 cooling, the cake released perfectly onto the serving plate. Hereâ€™s what made the biggest impact for success: I put a small layer of plain batter in the bottom of the Bundt pan before adding the blueberries to the remaining batter. No burnt blueberries and an even distribution of berries. Iâ€™ll make this one again for sure!"

The second round last night I used spray nonstick, and no sugar for the bundt pan, came right out no problem, I also added lemon extract with the vanilla. I then made an orange zest glaze using the juice and zest of one clementine (I didnâ€™t have a lemon on hand) powdered sugar and milk. It lasted one night! This basic recipe is awesome as is, but the variety of things you can do to change it up are endless!"

The batter was very thick, but I think that helped hold the blueberries in place so they didn't sink to the bottom. The cake was moist, not dry at all. I will definitely use this recipe again."

Baked for 80 minutes and then another 10. Cake was still very moist to the point of being a tad dense but I think it's my oven, not the recipe. I would make again definitely and would add extra vanilla. The kids all loved it."
