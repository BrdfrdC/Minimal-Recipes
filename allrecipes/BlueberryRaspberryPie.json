I don’t remember exactly if I made it word for word the first time but the second time I used store bought pie crusts and followed the recipe for filling and cook time. I’d recommend if you’re using store bought to use 2 teaspoons of water and a table spoon of sugar on top. I did the 1 tablespoon of water and sugar and my dough had a hard time cooking and getting crunchy. Will definitely make this pie again though! It’s delicious!"

The only reason I’ve made this is my daughter has been shopping for us during the pandemic and buying us fresh raspberries which my husband and I don’t really like! And I had frozen and fresh blueberries to use up. So there you go, always say thank you for the food shopping and extra surprises. Something like making lemonade out of lemons?"

"reviewBody": "This is a wonderful pie recipe! I love fruit pies, but hate pie that's pasty and or too sweet. This recipe brings out the natural flavor sand sweetness of the fruit, and was neither too runny nor too thick and pasty. I will admit though, that I used commercial pie crusts and didn't do the sugar wash on bottom crust, it didn't seem necessary. I also used equal parts raspberries and blueberries to make a heaping 4 cups of fruit, and a scant 3/4 cups of sugar. I'm confidant though this would be just as good if I'd followed the recipe exactly. I'll definitely make this again."
