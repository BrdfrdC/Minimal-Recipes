The only differences in the recipe is I use either 2 boxes of grape jello or 1 box of grape and 1 box of black cherry jello which is grandma’s variation and 2 tsps of vanilla and two 2/3 cups of sugar because I like it a little sweeter. The pictures shows pecans but it’s not listed in the ingredients. Topping with pecans should not be excluded. I’ve been making it my grandma”s way since 2018."

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe exactly as written for a Christmas party and it was a HUGE hit. It's really good and very easy to make. Since I did't get to have very much of it at the party I decided to make a smaller batch for my husband and I at home but didn't have the exact ingredients. Here's how I made the second one and it was excellent. I used 1 lg box of raspberry jello with 2 cups of boiling water. I added 1 can of well drained crushed pineapple. I didn't have any pie filling but did have blueberries I froze this past summer so used 2 cups of frozen berries instead. Made the topping the same with cream cheese, sour cream, and sugar. It was sooo good with the real blueberries instead of pie filling. Either way is great but if you're looking for a little less sweet and more of a real fruity salad try fresh or frozen blueberries. For parties I think I'll use the original recipe (because so many people love really sweet) and for hubby and I at home I'll make it with a generous amount of frozen blueberries instead of the pie filling because it's healthier and tastes so fresh."

"reviewBody": "My mom used to make a jello salad like this one that my husband tolerates so I was on the hunt for a better recipe. I followed this recipe to the letter and it was waaaaay to sweet for me (all I could taste was sweetness!) and too much topping for my husband. I decided to combine my mom's salad and this salad and I came up with, to me and my family, the perfect recipe. Here's what I did:\r\n\r\nMake the raspberry jello as the package instructs using the hot and cold water. Add the crushed pineapple and about 2 cups thawed frozen blueberries. (Note: the pineapple needs to be REALLY drained otherwise your jello won't set. I mash mine through a metal strainer with a spoon.) Put the jello/fruit in the fridge until set. I didn't change the topping ingredients except to cut the volume in half. Spread the topping over the set jello and chill until served.\r\n\r\nWe could taste the fruits in this version without being overpowered by sweetness. Hope this helps someone!"

I put the crusts into the fridge and the jello into a pitcher and then poured the liquid into the cream cheese covered crust so I wouldn't have to carry it from kitchen counter to fridge. Worked great; no spills. More than enough for 2 pies (kinda hard to call this deliciousness a \"salad\"). I did these for a family picnic this weekend and there were NO leftovers. Salad? Dessert? Yep, I could start and end with both!! Lovely dish. Thank you!!"

Most people think blueberries and pineapple are a strange combo until they taste them together!"

"reviewBody": "HELPFUL TIPS TO MAKE 5*: This is how I made this into a prize winning dessert on our military base! You can easily make 2 pies w/graham cracker crusts w/this recipe. The times I make two pies, I put the unused jello in a individual sized teddybear pan, so my toddlers can have a snack later w/o the fattening cream cheese mixture. They love it!! Anyway, I filled w/enough cream cheese topping to cover the bottom &amp; sides of the pre-made crust. ...waited about 5-10 min. for the jello to cool from boiling (necessary), and then placed it on top until it reached the rim of the crust. Be sure you're still able to carry it to the fridge w/o the blueberry mixture spilling over ...making the crust look not as presentable (speaking from experience). lol The next morning, the texture was so nice, and there was a beautiful layer of cream cheese on the bottom. Plenty of extra that I put in a Tupperware for those piggy's in my family to add more on top if they wanted. I am always thrilled to show off this recipe, so thanks for the user who published it! People always say it's the best!!"

"reviewBody": "I've made this several times for various occasions and people love it! However, 2 boxes of Jello are not enough for a 9X13 pan. The version I got from my sister calls for 3 packages of GRAPE Jello with 3 cups of boiling water, a 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple and the same 21 oz. can of blueberry pie filling. For anyone who tried this and didn't care for it, try making it the way I described -- it tastes SO much better and the amounts are just right for a 9X13 pan and the same amounts of topping ingredients. Also, I use a clear, glass pan - I wouldn't recommend putting it in a metal pan as I'm sure this could affect the taste."

The lower layer is very sweet as it is, and the topping of cream cheese and sour cream adds a rich contrast of flavor. Sprinkling about a cup of chopped nuts on top doesn't hurt things, either!"

I've heard though that pineapple negatively affects how jello sets, so that may be it too. The taste of this wasn't too well received, the pineapple/blueberry/raspberry combination didn't really go over well. It tasted \"okay\", but just wasn't really loved."

I made 1/2 of the blueberry mixture (except that I only used an 8 oz. can of pineapple) and 3/4 of the white mixture. I waited until the blueberry mixture had slightly congealed before putting it on the bottom of a Keebler 2 extra servings graham cracker crust, and my crust remained firm. I garnished the cream cheese mixture on the top of the pie with some pecan halves, and it looked as good as it tasted. This combo of flavors is EXCELLENT!!! Do try this…Thanks, Robin."
