Here’s what I did: Melted butter in measuring cup and folded it in with dry ingredients. Measured and added EVAPORATED milk and folded it in. Whisked egg and folded that in. All separately. I felt it much easier to manage. I didn’t flour a board. I sprayed a measuring cup( 1/4 cup) with baking spray and dropped each onto a parchment paper (obviously on the cooking tray). While these didn’t come out like the photo- they were delicious and VERY EASY to make. I also sprinkled the top with a pinch of sea salt."

"reviewBody": "View these as drop blueberry scones. They have the flavoring of a scone base, but has more moisture than a normal dough. \n\nI was out of half and half so I made my own from whole milk and heavy whipping cream (3 part milk, 1 part whipping). \n\nThe dough was really wet so cutting the round disc didn't work - too sticky. Instead I just made drop scones with fresh blueberries. \n\nDepending on how much berry to dough ratio you want in your scone - you might want to reduce from 1 cup to 1/2 cup - all personal preference. I did sprinkle a bit of sugar on top like my Mamma does for a sweet kick. \n\nI am keeping this recipe for the future. Prep was about 10-15 min, bake time was 20 min exactly. I would like to make these with chocolate chips and lemon poppyseed with a vanilla almond glaze next time."

After baking, the scones had no flavor themselves other than the berries. No sweetness at all, even after I added a 1/4 cup more sugar. The only thing I liked was the texture. It was fluffy and not hard, like some scones. I was able to spare these from being inedible by adding a lemon glaze of lemon juice and powdered sugar. Would not recommend this recipe!"

I also didn't notice to add the blueberries with the dry ingredients. so I made the dough a bit loose in order to add the blueberries when the dough was mixed. I will add them sooner the next time. The dough was a loose but still came out good.\nI probably added 1/3 cup flour , 1/4 cup sugar [ some brown and some reg sugar ] Used combination of Light cream and milk plus a little extra . I added another half beaten egg . Then coated the top before and after baking with a custom mix of melted butter, Lemon juice and sugar. \nThese were baked at 375 for approx 25 mins.\nThey came out GREAT . I will be making them again soon !!!"

"reviewBody": "Turns out this is the Perfect scone recipe once I did some research. Here’s the three tricks: I reduce the half/half by 1 tablespoon - maybe the eggs I buy are too large for this recipe. Freeze the butter and grate it adding it as the last dough ingredient (right before the fruit). Finally, mix the dough by hand just enough to make it a bit crumbly. It should not mixed smooth like a cake mix. This gives you that “rough” scone texture. I also brush the tops with half/half and sprinkle sugar for presentation purposes. This recipe is actually very versatile and you can add your own flavors. I used 1/2 c fresh cherries and 1/2 c mini semi-sweet for a “chocolate covered cherries” scone."

I had to add more ingredients and even after adding 1/2 c extra flour and 1/4 extra sugar I ended up pouring it into muffin cups and crossing my fingers. Still in the oven and hoping I did not waste $6 worth of blueberries. No matter how they turn out I cant recommend this recipe as the measurements are extremely off."

"reviewBody": "Like others, I had to add almost a cup of flour to even get it out of the bowl. when I divided the dough in half, I left the first round as listed in the recipe (except for the extra flour). It was not particularly sweet, just mostly doughy in flavor. I added chopped salted almonds and almond extract to the second half along with a sprinkle of sugar on top. It was better but still not a very good scone. I rate it two stars because my daughter doesn't like sweeter scones and I thought these fresh organic blueberries were not particularly flavorful, but she doesn't like sweetened blueberries like pie fillings."

"reviewBody": "Do try this recipe. It is wonderful and the end product turned out so tender and flavorful. The only things I did differently (and only because of preference)was to zest a lemon and add that to the dry ingredients and I made a glaze of the juice of the zested lemon with powdered sugar to drizzle on the baked and cooled scones. The tip I read about freezing the blueberries first was helpful. Otherwise, when working the dough they tend to smash up easily. I may try using plain yogurt next time as a substitute for the half and half. This dough is sticky and, as with any biscuit, you want to be careful not to work it too much. Then just dump it out on a floured surface and pat it out to cut into desired shapes. Using a bench knife for this step makes things so much more manageable. Now get back in the kitchen and try this one again!"

"reviewBody": "I found and made this recipe this morning. I loved it! I did take a reviewers advice and used yogurt instead of the liquid. I DID NOT have a sticky gooey mess as others have said they experienced. But if using the recipe as is, I would suggest using the liquid a little at a time to avoid possible gooeyness. The lack of sweetness is perfect for adding fruit or even spreading with jam or honey when done. I think some people have a very sweet tooth even if they don't think so to have to add more sugar to this recipe. Topping with turbinado sugar before baking is a nice touch. All in all I would not hesitate to try this recipe and take the extreme negative reviews with a grain of salt."
