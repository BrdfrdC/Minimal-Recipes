Seeing that other reviewers had trouble with undone-ness, I thawed my frozen blueberries, strained out the excess liquid and coated them with flour before folding them in. I wonder if the nutty crumble should've gone into the bundt pan first so that there would be a crumbly top. Will try that next time. I ended up drizzling it with a thin buttercream frosting with orange extract. It came out beautifully for an extended family brunch and I was asked to share the recipe!"

I don't usually touch it to test, but it was clearly not done. When I checked it again, it was better, so I took it out. The toothpick still came out clean. I let it cool a bit, and it fell. Then I cut in it to check. It was not done. It was like batter in the middle. I tried to salvage it by putting it back in the oven. I ended up doing this twice for 15 extra minutes 2 times. It was better but still not fully baked. I've never had a toothpick come out clean when it was not done. I guess it's because it's mostly fat - butter and sour cream. Bakers beware. It still tasted pretty good. I joked that it was blueberry lava cake."

The recipe has way too much fat for the amount of flour. It baked up nice for the first 50 minutes, and then it flopped into a pile of mush! If you want a good Blueberry Coffee Cake, use \"To Die for Blueberry Muffins\" recipe and put it in your desired pan instead of muffin tins. That is a 5 star recipe!"

I sprayed a 9x13 pan and then floured it and I think that made a difference in not sticking. I poured half of the batter in added the two cups of blueberries and half of the strudel, put the rest of the batter on top, know that it will be hard to spread out but it doesn't have to be perfect. Be perfect. I tapped with the rest of the strudel and baked for 45 minutes. I will probably be making another loaf this week!"

Put 2 cups of blueberries (didn't add flour to them) in the middle layer instead of mixing them into the batter. Skipped pecans because we don't like nuts in our coffee cake. This is a keeper. I will probably make another one by end of the blueberry season this year."

Chose this for my daughter who loves blueberries. After starting the instructions, I realized I don’t have a Bundt pan so tried a springform pan. Also realized I didn’t buy pecans but walnuts by mistake. AND LASTLY forgot the last step to swirl with a knife. To my surprise, still turned out SO GOOD. Will try again following the proper instructions/ bakeware! Thanks for the recipe"

The only thing I would change would be to decrease the amount of sugar. 2 cups was way too much and made the cake too sweet. The next time I make it I'll use 1 1/4 cup of sugar instead."

This recipe is very moist and I knew I wanted to make it because it had sour cream in it. If using a Bundt pan I would put the cinnamon/blueberry/pecan layer first in your pan so when you flip it you have that on top. Not a big deal thoough- it tastes great wherever it is! :)"

I let it cool completely and loosened it with a plastic knife before unmolding it (whew!). The batter is very thick , and that's probably why the (fresh) blueberries didn't sink. A nice, dense cake but I will probably use less sugar next time."

No changes to the recipe; it was perfect as it was, but I can envision it being used often and perhaps using raspberries or any other berry. This recipe would be great even without the addition of fruit, similar to a coffee cake. The cinnamon, pecans and brown sugar are scrumptious in it. Kudos! A definite keeper."
