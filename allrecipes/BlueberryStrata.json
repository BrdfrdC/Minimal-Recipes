When I took it out of the oven, the bread on top was very toasty and all the cream cheese was still in its cubes. So I stirred it...discovering a layer of scrambled eggs on the bottom. Is it supposed to be like that? Should I have stirred it up before baking? I don’t like the layer of eggs...they are over cooked. The whole dish is soggy now. But I love blueberries and the sauce is sweet and yummy."

I always sub mascarpone for the cream cheese--16 oz total. My family prefers it that way, and the mascarpone melts in better than cream cheese. I skip the topping, since my kids think it is yummy without. Occasionally I will heat a bag of frozen blueberries, add some maple syrup, then use that as a sauce."

I tried the recipe as written first (but only used one brick of cream cheese, just pinch off pieces and arrange them until you have a nice layer) and halved the sugar in the sauce and it was great. I also tried a little lemon juice and cinnamon in the sauce as well as vanilla and cinnamon in the egg mixture and that was fabulous. I suggest if you're planning on skipping the sauce (use maple syrup instead) to add 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp or so of cinnamon to the egg do the flavor stands up to it better (but I prefer the blueberry explosion, myself)"

"reviewBody": "Great MAKE AHEAD recipe. I always read reviews before making any AR dish, so I knew to cut the cream cheese amount in half. Added cinnamon and nutmeg to the milk. Although I did chill this overnight, a trick to making a quicker strata of any kind is to make the recipe as directed through the stage where you'd be chilling it overnight. Then, cover your dish with plastic wrap and place some type of evenly-distributed weight on top -- another baking dish, or a cutting board with a cookbook on top, whatever. (No need to chill unless it's 100 degrees in your kitchen.) It only takes about an hour for the bread to soak up the custard perfectly! I added a bit of lemon juice to the syrup to brighten it up, too. Very, very good."

I will keep it on my list of favorite recipes!\n\nUsed just one 8oz package of cream cheese mixed with 1 tsp of vanilla. Put lots of little blobs of cream cheese all over (tedious!). Added a couple of shakes of cinnamon and more vanilla to the egg/milk mixture. I used Italian bread (because the French bread at the store seemed like it would end up mushy, and the Italian was denser). I also failed to see the \"chill overnight\" when I read the recipe, so, I made it and popped straight in the oven! \n\nUsed fresh blueberries. The syrup was FABULOUS! I'm going to make homemade syrup all the time from now on! (I used 1 cup sugar instead of 1-1/2) and it was plenty sweet.)"

I used frozen wild blueberries that I found at Fred Meyer, they were much smaller but more intense in flavor. I used just a little less cream cheese and didn't bother with the syrup but sprinkled sugar on top instead."

Baked as directed and served with the blueberry syrup (lots left over to have with frozen yoghurt tonight)."

I used whole wheat sandwich bread since it was all I had. Also, for the syrup, I cut back the sugar and water to 1 1/4 cup. It was plenty sweet. I might add some vanilla to the egg mixture next time."

I used about 2/3 of a an 8oz brick and that was plenty and I pinched off little bits with my fingers into the mixture as opposed to 1/2\" pieces. I also doubled the maple syrup to sweeten it up and added about 1 t. of cinnamon. I only used about 8 eggs and that was plenty. I served mine with maple syrup and not the blueberry syrup. This was a huge hit for our Mother's Day brunch."

"reviewBody": "I hate it when people tweak and change recipes the first time they make it and then review it because they are reviewing something different, but in this case I am guilty. I made the strata following the directions but I used strawberries instead of blueberries (I had intended on using the blueberries but they were so expensive and strawberries were on sale). I know it is a major change but it was delicious!! Made it for Easter brunch and everyone loved it. They said it was so good they could not imagine it with blueberries. I will make it again, and I will try the blueberries. Blueberries would be less work because you wouldn't have to do any cutting. I think this is a great recipe and easy to make. Also, I did add a little bit of cinnamon to the milk/egg mix. Vanilla or little sugar to the mix would be good too. I love how you mix everything the night before then before you serve you make the syrup. Will make again."

"reviewBody": "I cut this in half using an 8x8 baking pan and used the leftover Cloverleaf rolls from last night's Turkey Day dinner instead of french bread. (I baked the rolls day before Thanksgiving but for some reason, they hardened up really fast. So, these rolls were perfect for this recipe.) I did use reduced fat cream cheese, fat free evaporated milk instead of regular milk, organic frozen blueberries that I thawed just a bit and Smuckers blueberry syrup (which I just happened to have in the fridge). My husband didn't care for it but it really was no issue because my kids snarfed up the rest. It was great for me because 1) breakfast was cake and 2) they were absolutely silent. Next time, I may play around with the recipe and maybe use something besides maple syrup in the strata. It might be pretty, too, with a drizzling of vanilla icing over the top and make a nice almost bread pudding dessert."

We made a half recipe but used 3 tablespoons of maple syrup and maybe 5-6 oz of cream cheese. We had to add water to the syrup to thin it when we reheated this morning. Thanks for a great recipe."

I did use frozen berries and just gently pressed paper towels on them while in the strainer which helped out immensely with any over-watering concerns. Next time I will mke extra sauce because it's easy and delicious!"

I couldn't find any, so I had to use frozen and it was a little more watery than expected but the bread soaked it right up. The syrup is delicious, you may want to add an extra T. of cornstarch if you are using frozen blueberries because of the excess water. Otherwise, awesome and I will definitely make this a regular!"

I like it with pure maple syrup or syrup made from canned blueberries and thicken it myself.It's easy to tweak this recipe to your personal taste."
