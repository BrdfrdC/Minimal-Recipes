They were too little, so next time I will be combining TWO triangles together and doubling things up inside. But it was all very delicious... taste, texture, frosting.... everything. Five Star for sure. But as usual... they took longer to make than the suggested time. The frosting takes time to make, also. I made it from scratch. A cream cheese and vanilla frosting on allrecipes. Yummy!!!"

"reviewBody": "Used this for inspiration. I had blueberries in the freezer and a can of crescent rolls in the fridge to use up. So I simmered the berries on the stove with a bit of sugar and cinnamon and thickened with a small amount of cornstarch. Let it cool in the fridge. Used about 1/2 or so for the pastries. Rolled out the pastry and cut them into rectangles rather than triangles pressing them together.and flattening where necessary spread a tsp of softened cream cheese that I heated up in the microwave so it would spread nice over half of each piece. Topped with 1 TB of cold blueberry filling and folded the pieces over top and pressed all edges really good. Put on ungreased cookie sheet and baked for 12 minutes. Piped a thin frosting of creamed cheese, icing sugar and cream in a zig zag pattern over each once they cooled a bit. delicious! Nice inexpensive quick and easy dessert. Not master chef worthy for sure, but cheap and easy and tasty. These would be good wrapped up to put in lunches as well. :)"

Figured it looked straightforward and I would chance a new recipe. I used someone else's idea to stir the powdered sugar into the berries instead of doing it individually. Used parchment paper. Could have skipped the powdered sugar topping since I was drizzling with frosting. They taste just like blueberry donuts. The guys went nuts over them!"

"reviewBody": "so I grow my own blueberries and they are very tart. I tried a couple of versions of this and have found that for me the best is to cook the blueberries first with enough sugar to sweeten them adequately. When I just used blueberries straight with the sugar on top they always fell out. This way it is really easy to roll up and is so much more consistent on taste and texture. I also loved the other reviewer's idea of adding some cream cheese so I spread a little whipped cream cheese on the dough before adding the blueberries. Cook as directed and drizzle some confectioners sugar icing on top when they are done. Out of this world delicious!! I will be making it as long as my blueberries last!!"

I also added a couple pinches of nutmeg and a teaspoon or two of cinnamon. No measurements since I made these with a couple of toddlers :). After they cooked, we made a creamy topping of butter, powdered sugar, and Tahitian vanilla paste. They were so good that the two boys (Ages 2 and 5) were trying to steal one anothers' rolls because they had eaten the whole pan full! The 5 year old kept saying \"They are even yummier with the sauce on them!\" needless to say, these will be made again:) They are super easy, very kid-friendly, and a quick make, bake, and cleanup. Not to mention, Beautiful! we dusted the tops of them with cinnamon for looks and it was incredible! Can't approve this recipe enough!!!!"

"reviewBody": "This is a great simple recipe/idea. Like the reviews suggested, I also simply mixed the blueberries with the sugar in a bowl instead of adding them separately to the dough. If you pack too many blueberries in, it does leak out and can make the pastry soggy. It's definitely important to seal the pastry well before baking! I've used other fruits with this too, but a real favorite was Nutella :). Thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Super duper simple. I don't know why I can't seem to get my little triangles folded up nice and neat and pretty like other cooks, but crescent rolls are sort of my nemesis in the kitchen. This time was no exception as the rolls popped open as soon as I got the paper off one side and they came apart in the tube, so I started with a mess. I managed to get them all out in as much of 1 piece as it would but they sure aren't pretty. Good thing my family cares more about flavor than appearances. I drizzled these with a homemade vanilla glaze. My hubby was most impressed with these gems so it was worth the struggle with the crescent dough. I'd make this again even wrestling with the pesky roll dough."

My husband is a big connoisseur of turnovers and admitted they tasted like dinner rolls filled with blueberries.\nTurnovers are supposed to be big and flaky. Next time I'll try making them with puff pastry dough.\nSorry, but quite frankly, I don't see this recipe falling anywhere close to the 4 &amp; 5 star ratings."

Rolled each crescent in a ball and then rolled in a small oval with my rolling pin, I wet the edges and filled with the blueberries and sugar which I had already mixed together. Made sure the edges were very well sealed to save the blueberries leaking and baked on a large Pampered Chef stoneware bar pan. Once they were cooled I piped with vanilla frosting and a dusting of conf. sugar. Delicious, I will me trying these will all manor of fillings..."

Also, rather than sprinkle the blueberries, and then the powdered sugar before rolling it up, I just tossed them both together before placing them on the croissants. Make sure you seal it really well, otherwise the filling will leak. These were really good right out of the oven... and I'm sure they'll also be wonderful for breakfast tomorrow!"
