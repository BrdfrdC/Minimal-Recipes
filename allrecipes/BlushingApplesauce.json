"reviewBody": "Great recipe! I actually use a variety of apples to achieve a more blushed look (and for taste). I only cook for about 15-20 and use my NutriBullet to puree, as we prefer a more solid texture. If you use apple juice instead of water, you can cut the sugar a bit. I've done it both ways and both work out just fine. I add extra cinnamon because my kids love it."

It's the way my mother made it and I have never liked applesauce made without the skins, whether home made or bottled store bought. I've used many different varieties of apples this way. The finished color varies with the type of apple used and the color of its skin."

"reviewBody": "This is very similar to my recipe. However the point of home made applesauce is to reduce sugar intake! Cook the apples for about an hour over low heat, or until fruit is mushy. Use food grinder to puree fruit and remove skins. Add cinammon while warm then refrigerate for best taste."

I think the extra step with the skins was too much labor for no blush. After I added the cinnamon, it turned a bit brown. If you like a very sweet applesauce this would do it though. Thanks for sharing."
