I made exactly as written and the only thing I may do different is to add another 1/2 to 1 teaspoon maple extract as I thought it could use a bit more maple flavoring. But—it is still perfect as is! My mom was the queen of fudge making and I’ve yet to attempt her recipe as it requires double boiler, candy thermometer and more ingredients-so for now—this will be my go to recipe for maple walnut fudge. My husband was amazed when I said I was making fudge and about 5 minutes later I was finished! He said “I thought you were going to make fudge?!” I said “I just did-it needs an hour to cool” and a big smile came over his face! A big THANK YOU for submitting this easy yet DELICIOUS recipe!"

Do use \"real\" maple flavoring (not the artificial stuff)...and like vanilla, if you \"accidently spill\" more into the batter than called for, it won't hurt anything! :) So I gave it four stars instead of five because of that omission of butter -- but otherwise it is a delicious easy fudge!"

"reviewBody": "This fudge was excellent!!! Just like purchased fudge at specialty shops but without the cost! The first time I made this recipe the fudge was very gooey even after being stored in the frig for a few days. I searched the internet for how to resolve gooey fudge and found the answer was to reheat the fudge and add powdered sugar. It would be about 1 cup powdered sugar for the entire recipe. HOWEVER when I made this a second time, I decided to cut the sweetened condensed milk in half and that was the best answer to not having gooey fudge. I used Watkins maple flavoring. The first batch I used half white chocolate bark (shaved) and half Nestle's white chocolate chips. The second batch I used Ghirardelli white chocolate chips. Both chocolate options were good since the main flavoring is the Watkins maple flavoring. **The key to non-gooey fudge is to cut the sweetened condensed milk amount in half.**"

I found, however, that the texture of this fudge was only good after it sat overnight in the fridge - definitely way more than an hour. The fudge smelled so good, I could hardly wait to try it. Maybe I had too high of hopes for this recipe, but when I tasted it I was so disappointed. The texture was ok, but the flavor wasn't nearly as strong as how it smelled. The white chocolate definitely competed for the flavor, which is what I mainly got as an aftertaste. My family thought it was ok as well, but after a couple little pieces, they were fine with me getting rid of the rest. Very bummed, I really wanted to love this recipe."

I doubled the recipe easily and used a greased 13x9 pan, with greased aluminum foil inside (wax or parchment paper would've been easier, I think). I followed the recipe exactly, but I did use the microwave instead of the stovetop; the end result was delicious with a great soft, fudgy consistency, but I think the mixture might've been easier to work with if I would've let it get silky and smooth on the stovetop. I can see how other reviewers think the white chocolate taste is overwhelming - I used Bakers premium bars, and I think any extra maple extract might be too overpowering. It would be a very delicate balance to find beyond the called for 1 tsp. But overall, I think this could"

It still just tasted like melted white chocolate. My husband liked it anyway, but agreeed it wasn't maple fudge! It's a nice, easy recipe though for white choc. There is no way this recipe makes the pretty maple-colored fudge in the cover photo--mine was pure white!"

"reviewBody": "This was delicious and so easy to make, BUT... I don't think I'll be making it again without some major tweaks to the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and used maple extract, as specified in the recipe (instead of maple flavouring, which according to some reviewers is different). I could not taste the maple at all. It was overwhelmingly white-chocolately flavoured. Texture was also much too soft, unless it's stored in the freezer. The walnut-to-fudge ratio is perfect, wouldn't change anything there. \nSo, perhaps it needs more maple extract, and I'm not sure what would give it a firmer fudge-like texture, so I'll probably just keep looking for a more traditional recipe. \nStill, it is delicious, and I will have no problem eating this whole batch ;)\n\n[edited to add: I just reheated the rest of the fudge and stirred in some more maple extract. The taste is perfect now but the consistency is still too soft. I would definitely recommend doubling or tripling the amount of maple until it is a nice brown colour, and store it in the freezer for a firm texture]"

The closer it came to room temp the more it became a sticky mess. Does anyone know why mine should turn out this way? Would like to make again. Would it be better to make stove top?

"reviewBody": "I had never made fudge before, and anything maple is a favorite, so when I found this I decided to give it a go. I followed the recipe, and everything was going well until it was time to add the maple extract. I did the recommended 1 tsp, and tasted of nothing except white chocolate. I decided to add some real maple syrup. I used Grade B, which is darker in color and has a stronger maple flavor. I just kept adding both syrup and extract until I could really taste the maple. In all, I added 3 teaspoons of extract and 1/4 cup of maple syrup. I think the syrup really helped to smooth out the fudge and enhanced the color. Next time, I'll just start with 3 teaspoons of extract and the syrup, and add less walnuts. I'm thinking 1 cup will be just fine. Ultimately, with my additions, it tasted amazing (like maple walnut ice cream, but in fudge form); but, using the original recipe, you're making white chocolate walnut fudge."

Instead of using the microwave, I used a double boiler like I use for making other types of fudge, and I wonder if this is the reason, although that has never happened before. Adding the walnuts seemed to do the trick, and everything came together. I think that I will reduce the amount of butter by half next time because I noticed that it pooled and solidified in some places. Also, I tried the silicone baking cups and found no need to spray them with cooking spray - the silicone peeled right off of the fudge."

Im glad I did.. it was smooth, the only thing is I tasted more of the condensed milk that I would have liked too but that's ok. I think this fudge can be made in so many different variations that Im willing to experiment with different flavor of chips and extracts. thank you for sharing.

I always make fudge using the stovetop way, but I have to say - this was so easy, and even though it hasn't completely set, I can tell it is going to be amazing!! The thing I really like about this recipe is that it frees up my only fudge-making pot so I can make chocolate the same morning, without having to wash the pan in between batches. As another reviewer confirmed, I made this using a double boiler method, and I used Watkins brand maple extract, and a teaspoon was enough! The leftover in the bowl once I poured it into the pan that I taste tested was AWESOME!! This is definitely a keeper recipe. Thank you so much!!!"

However, the consistency is a lot softer than I am used to and a little bit greasy (will probably use less butter or none at all next time I make it). I did not prepare it in the microwave, but rather melted the white chips with the butter and fat-free sweetened condensed milk over low heat, stirring constantly. Added the maple extract and toasted walnut pieces once off the heat. Even after a few hours in the refrigerator and 1/2 hour in the freezer right before cutting, it was very soft. I will probably also add a bit more maple extract next time."

Second, a double boiler works fine if you prefer it over the microwave. Third, a 9x9 pan would work fine in place of 8x8; the fudge would still be plenty thick.
