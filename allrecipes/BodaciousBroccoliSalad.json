Alterations &amp; suggestions:\n1) make ahead so it can chill and let flavors combine at least 4 to 6 hrs prior to serving.\n2) make a little extra of the sauce.\n3) I used good basalmic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar. \n4) I subbed one TBS of honey and Swerve (sugar substitute) for the sugar as three out of five of the guys are diabetic.\n5) I subbed plain greek yogurt for half the real mayo for calories and health.\n6) I omitted the pepper and added a dash of onion powder instead. \n7) I added two handfuls (about 2/3 cup) of Nature Source Organic Salad Topper (has sunflower seeds, dried cranberries, &amp; pumpkin seeds).\n8) Key component was excellent quality broccoli. Got mine from the fresh farm stand so the florets were tender and sweet with perfect crunch.\n---Best of luck and enjoy. Hubby wants more so need to procure more broccoli today."

I think it comes out crispy and the paper towel absorbs the oil really well. I added about 1/4 cup of golden raisins. Didn‚Äôt have red onion so used sweet Vidalia chopped very fine; probably about 1/4 of a large onion. Used 2/3 cup mayo and ?2/3 cup 5% Greek yogurt. I would use less red wine vinegar. I like the taste but it was maybe a touch too much. Will definitely make again!!"

I would suggest that you just finely chop the onion. I have even just used a tiny bit and added it to the mayo mixture. I have made this dish a million times and it is always a huge hit. You can change it up as you want. You can use cheese cubes instead of shredded cheese. Add sunflower seeds or pumpkin seeds. Use yogurt instead of mayo. It is a nice base recipe."

"reviewBody": "After making this for a few years this is what I do that might help others..\nmake the broccoli as small as possible this step takes me about 30 minutes for 4 heads. I do not cook the broccoli crowns at all and only use the crowns NO stems.\nMake the dressing like you do for coleslaw, mix the mayonnaise and sugar until the sugar is dissolved, 2t black pepper 1t salt and double everything else for the dressing use a quality red wine vinegar the cheap ones are bitter, taste the dressing before mixing other ingredients to it. if more sugar is needed add it then. \nI use the 1.5 C of cheese (shredded by me) for a double recipe but add more bacon. A thicker shredded cheese and extra sharp seem to work best in this recipe. Hope this helps with some of the bitterness others are having trouble with."

I used a sweet white onion than I minced. I did buy red vinegar for the dressing, but found it way to tart, so I used some lite rice vinegar that I had. All that being said, the salad was very, very delicious and it was gobbled up at a potluck! Oh, I did add a head of cauliflower and I thought that was great."
