"reviewBody": "I just made this today with boneless chicken breasts . Mine came out tasting similar to a pot roast except with chicken flavor instead of beef. Definitely will cook this again!\n\nThis recipe is good with boneless breasts if you don't have bone-in on hand, though bone-in is obviously going to be better and have a richer favor. For boneless breasts, I used half water, half canned chicken broth.\n\nI do recommend adding garlic, either whole or powder, increasing the amount of onion to taste, and cutting the chicken into strips or chunks to help it better adsorb the flavor. The chicken gets more tender the longer it cooks, so you may want to let it cook a while past being done until it gets as tender as you want it to be."

When the chicken is done just lift the bag out and open it into a large bowl. No straining necessary! I also suggest more spices and veggies. Parsnips add a wonderful flavor, garlic and thyme and fresh dill are nice too, but I guess that is if you want a flavorful broth as well and not just boiled chicken."

I only made two changes: (1) adding about a teaspoon of minced garlic from a jar, and (2) I followed the other reviewers' advice to let it cool in the broth, and the texture was great - very very tender. Yes, it is quite tasteless, but when you can only eat crackers and toast and Jell-o, it's a great change! You can get it slightly tastier by adding salt and pepper beforehand and fresh lemon juice just before serving."

If I'm just doing chicken breasts, then I cook it 30 minutes and let it cool completely, as BODIE358 suggests and it's completely moist and flavorful. I then keep the broth frozen for whatever I need. I do it the night before and make chicken and dumplings (from this site) with it - the soup comes out so rich this way! The crockpot method that Christy Marie suggested is also awesome. It really couldn't be easier."

I used 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp celery salt, 1/8 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 onion powder. This turned out great! This one is a keeper!"

Also, I let the chicken cool down in the broth before shredding it. After removing the chicken, I put the bones back in the broth and let it simmer for another couple of hours to make some AMAZING stock. I let the stock cool in the fridge overnight and then removed the fat the next day for a virtually fat-free stock. Next time, the only thing I will do differently is add some fresh parsley and thyme to the stock to round out the flavors. I got everything to make this for around $4, and it made 4 cans' worth of stock and several cups of shredded chicken. That is a steal both for my wallet and my health!! I will continue to make this every single week because it is so healthy and so versatile."

If you allow your chicken (or chicken bones) to cook with the vegetables/spices you like for an hour or so before straining, you get a nice chicken stock. You'll know if you got chicken stock or if you have chicken water based on how it smells. The water should still smell like chicken noodle soup AFTER you remove all the \"stuff\" from it and it should not be colorless! Now you can make a soup from the stock or you can freeze the stock in ice cube trays (then repackage into baggies) and use it in recipes :)"

I throw out everything but the shredded chicken and the broth (you can also freeze the chicken so it can be used months down the road but I HIGHLY recommend freezing it in a bag with the broth to avoid freezer burn).\nThanks SO much for this recipe -- I have already given it to several of my friends and family! :)"

I will never buy canned chicken again when this is so simple and much more tasty! I did follow the advice of some of the others and it turned out great! I can usually find whole chickens on sale for $.69/lb and the amt of meat you receive can make several meals. Works great to freeze as well. Just be sure and freeze in a little of it's broth to keep it moist. I also bought some ice cube trays and will use those to make my broth cubes to use. No longer needing to buy those very SALTY boullion cubes!"

I haven't made soup yet, but I tasted the broth and it is delicious. Thank you so much! EDIT: Since my 1st review, I have used this method several times; with whole chickens, thighs, legs, breasts (whatever was on sale!) This is a great way to cook a lot of chicken in \"bulk\" and still have a lot of versatility. If you can stock up on chicken of any cut when it's on sale, or the day before it expires at the supermarket, this recipe is for you! You can boil as stated in the recipe, or use plain water and while it's simmering, you don't have to do a thing! I used the stock of soups, and in 1 batch, I had enough to fill 2 chicken pot pies, fajitas for my family and a week's worth of chicken for chicken salad sandwiches (try the curry chicken salad recipes). This is perfect for the budget conscious. Thank you SO MUCH!!!!"

I simmered the chicken just before boiling (following a reviewer's suggestion) and the meat really did fall off the bone. YUM! Also, since I used a 2 pound chicken it only took me about an hour.
