Was also called Bare Cupboard Cake, I use the basic recipe (though use soft brown sugar instead of white) and add Ginger ( both crystallised and ground) , cherries, ground allspice, extra teaspoon of mixed spice, some times chopped nuts and whatever seems suitable. As it is for sharing have used a square tin."

The only adjustments I made were: black tea instead of water (seemed more Irish)and I used a mix of dried fruit (cranberries, golden raisins, raisins and cherries.). I also made my own mixed spice as a reviewer recommended. ( 1 Tbsp. cinnamon; 1 Tbsp. nutmeg; 1 Tbsp. all spice; 2 tsp. mace and 1 tsp. cloves)"

Make sure the fruit mixture has cooled down somewhat before putting in the eggs as they can cook before incorporated into the mix. Just so easy to prepare !!!"

BUT any dark liquor will do. My grandmother would make fruit cake every Christmas holiday. This recipe comes closes to how she would make this cake."

Also a tablespoon or two of Bourbon :) The other alteration was half water, half milk. This recipe was so good I was eating it warm, fresh from the oven. Will make this again."
