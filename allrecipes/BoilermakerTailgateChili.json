"reviewBody": "I've made this recipe a number of times and its always been great. My bf asks me to make it at least once a month. I've always adjusted to my (our) taste. 1) Instead of beef or Italian sausage, I use bison meat- always. 2) I also use a variety of peppers besides bell pepper and chiles- I use peblano, bell, yellow chiles for color, jalapenos, and hatch. 3) Instead of regular tomatoes and paste, I always picked fire-roasted tomatoes or even Rotel, and a can of crushed tomatoes, which is more like chunky tomato sauce. 4) I use different beans. Sometimes I'll use light and dark kidney beans with chili beans. Sometimes I get \"simple truth\" tri-bean blend which is black, pinto and light kidney beans. Overall, I like having variety with the ingredients, but I always stick to the spices and so forth. Its great with or without beer."

"reviewBody": "This is a GREAT recipe that my whole family loves! Close family, extended family and friends all rave about it. I’ve made slight changes over the years since I’ve been making it. I use petite diced tomatoes so I don’t have the larger chunks. For the chile peppers I use jalapeños since that’s about all I can get at my local grocery store. 2 seeded jalapeños adds great flavor. For the beer I buy the Miller High Life pony bottles which are 7-ounce bottles and are the perfect size. I also only do 3 cans of beans. I love beans but feel like 4 cans is slight over-kill. The rest of the recipe I stick to."

Whoever the tool from Texas was that gave this a 1 star couldn't tell his chili pot from his own rear end, just sayin. In Texas, they don't allow beans or veggies, so I cook them all down and blend them, then add the meat at the end so as not to over cook the meat. I also use a blend of smoked pulled pork, brisket and ground venison for the meat. It's a winner, I use my crawfish pot to cook enough to stock the freezer, and I add a lot more chilis for heat, however, the original spice mix was so interesting that I could not resist making a pot and experimenting. It has made all the difference."

I used 1/2 of a 7 oz can. I also added about 3/4 lb extra ground beef. I like my chili meaty. Used 3 strips regular bacon (diced fine). Not hot but has a “bite” to it. Will definitely make again, (now that my wife won't make her chili again.) Suggest you follow directions as best you can first time around, and then tweak to suit second time."

Lots of flavor and just the right amount of heat for me. (Girlfriend thinks it's too hot.) I used Pendery's and Gebhardt's chili powders and Cholula red instead of Tabasco."

I also add a package of stew meat, venison if available or any other game meat that might be on hand. if not, beef works just as good. This is a pepper based chili and becomes very flavorful. I like a bit of kick so I use Jalapeno and Serrano. If you don't like hot, then cut out the hotter peppers, but chili should have a bit of kick in my opinion."

On the day of, I put it in the crockpot to heat up &amp; I felt it was a bit thick so I added about another 1/2 cup of beer (Corona) and another TBS of chili powder &amp; about a tsp more of cumin. I just sprinkled some shredded cheese on top &amp; mixed it in. Oh, I did use fried bacon not bits in a jar. So excited I won! Thx for sharing your prize winning recipe!"

Regardless, it's Fantastic. Highly recommend frying your own bacon (vs. buying bacon bits). Made a HUGE difference in flavor. Also - do not add cheap beer. The beer quality makes a big difference. Don't skip the beer."

I also cut the vegetables in 1/2 inch chunks which made a great chunky chili !!!"

I use 2 pounds ground beef, 1 pound bite sized sirloin, 1 pound jimmy dean, 1 pound chorizo, and 1/2 pound bacon diced and rendered. Makes a really nice flavor profile. I adjust the spices to account for the extra meat because I’m a spicy. Thanks for the template!"

What's incredible is that I make it meatless by using vegetarian or plant-based beef crumbles and vegetarian or plant-based sausage crumbles. There is no difference in taste and texture. My company who are meat-eaters can't tell the difference unless I mention it. I always make it the day before Super Bowl Sunday and have it simmering for at least 4 hrs to elevate the flavor. I transfer it to a crockpot the next day in a warm setting so it stays nice and hot. It really is an awesome recipe."
