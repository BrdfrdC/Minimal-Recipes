I used a full pack of bacon, so about 9 slices (a bit over the 1/2 pound, but didn't want a few slices of bacon hanging around!) so cut the salt back to 1 tsp. Not too salty at all. I did have to keep an eye on the liquid level when boiling the beans as it was absorbed quickly, and didn't have enough reserved for topping up while baking (ended up using just water to keep the liquid level OK while baking) but these were TASTY! Makes a lot. Will definitely make again."

Both methods turned out super flavourful, but I would continue to make in the slowcooker since it's less cleanup and you can set it and forget it. I soaked my beans for 2 days rather than one, but they would have been okay after 24 hours, as I really just didn't end up getting to cook them when I wanted to. My husband loves beans, and he LOVES this recipe."

My only changes were that I cooked the onions a little for color, and I threw the bacon in the oven and baked it soft. They were blown away with the taste! This recipe is a keeper:)"

Not an onion person but the shredding, sauce, and baking made eating it less stressful. And there’s left over ground beef so I stir fried it. Then after 2hrs in to bean baking the cooked ground beef is topped across the beans and baking continues."

The consistency was perfect and the recipe was easy to follow. The cooking time was accurate. It truly depends of the flavor of beans that you prefer. I found these to be much too salty. Also, be cautious of the type of bacon you use. We used a smoked bacon, which gave the beans a smoky flavor. So, it's really all about your flavor preference. Just be aware that all of the bacon flavor will go directly into your beans, since the bacon is not precooked or drained. I will definitely make these again, with some adjustments. Overall, a very nice recipe."

Other than that I usually follow the receipe pretty closely. Sometimes I call them \"cowboy beans\" and add cooked ground beef and maybe some cut up green pepper to the recipe. Regardless, it has been a huge crowd pleaser. I've served these beans at camper rallys, Dutch oven gatherings, family outings and camping trips. Everybody LOVES it!"

Don't add salt or meat to the beans while they're cooking ! In the morning I drained them, mashed up a bit with my potato masher, then added all the other ingredients, including some of the reserved liquid. I cooked some bacon and sauteed the onions in the bacon grease....added that to the beans..I used prepared mustard, and half the brown sugar, and added garlic powder, onion powder. Taste for salt before adding it. Very tasty beans !"

I had read a study about this and it take no longer to cook beans except for about 15 minutes more. I timed this cooking and it took 8 hours in crock pot on high to be servable. If you like them softer I would say 10 hours but they are great without the fuss."

Delicious! And took maybe 1.5 hours."

I did adapt it for my pressure/slow cooker: Soaked the beans overnight, pressure cooked on the bean setting in the morning (35 min), then stirred in the remaining ingredients, slow cooked 7 hours. My kids didn't check when they got home but 2 hours later (keep warm setting), they were fabulous. I don't care that much for beans but I liked these a lot and my kid ate three bowls!"

I cooked for about an 90 minutes in the oven, everyone loved them. I did not add salt, and did add Worcestershire, not too sweet or salty."

America's Test Kitchen suggests that if you really want a creamy, smooth texture without mushy, gluey beans (and no split beans)that you should brine them. I simply added 1T salt to enough water to make 2 quarts with beans and soaked overnight. I did simmer the beans in the brining solution but discarded it before baking. I added fresh water to the pot for that step. The beans turned out perfectly seasoned with great texture! Definitely a keeper!"
