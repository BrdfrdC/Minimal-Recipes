Just want to add, I always used my electric skillet and would increase the sauce to serve it with pasta. Sprinkle more cheese on top for serving. Thank you. I would give it 10 stars if I could."

Go to 10 Italian kitchens you will find ten different versions and ten different opinions. Thats part of the fun. Regional differences, time of year, ingredient availability"

"reviewBody": "The Bracciole is just like Nonna's! but the sauce lacks flavour and needs basil, garlic, oregano and some parsley. This was a staple at Easter and I've missed it these past few years, Nonna no longer cooks. I cut the steak in half lengthwise to make it easier to pound and seared it before cooking the onions. This was finished in the oven @ 350 for 2 hours. Thanks for sharing."

It seems fairly close to authenticate. If it doesn't have the hard boiled egg, it's not. I also remember green or bell peppers in the sauce with the onions."

My only change I would make to this receipe is serving size. I served this to my husband,two 30 year old men and myself and there were only 2 tiny pieces left!!! 6 servings would have been pushing it. Maybe it was just too good!!!\nI would highly recommend this recipe."

"reviewBody": "The main reason I picked this recipe over all the other flank steak recipes on this sight is because it didn't require it to be marinated. That, I think, is a mistake. Maybe mechanical tenderizing would work as well as marinating but it needed something. It tasted great but was pretty tough. Instead of tomato sauce I used jarred spaghetti sauce &amp; served with a side of linguine."
