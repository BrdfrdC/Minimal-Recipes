But, as soon as I saw it, I knew it was going to be delicious. The fat was completely rendered and the meat was so juicy and tender that I didn't want to stop eating it. I served it with colcannon and Irish soda bread. I'll never make corned beef any other way and I'll make it more than once a year!"

"reviewBody": "I have made this about 4 times now. It comes out perfect every time, following the recipe as instructed. (1st 2 times and this time) I did get a salty brisket the 3rd time and we couldn't even eat it, so this time I purchased a low sodium brisket and rinsed it well, patted it dry then did the pan sear. It is soooooo good like the 1st 2 times. I thought maybe I had not put the brisket on a rack the 3rd time cause the juice that ends up in the bottom of the dish with the garlic and onions is very salty. While it looks very yummy, taste it before you are tempted to put in on anything. It's good used very sparingly. We drizzled some over the side dish of fried sauerkraut with onions and potatoes. We sliced the meat very thin and it was falling apart tender. Great meal. Thank you for this recipe."

Had a volunteer group in the kitchen preparing potatoes, carrots, onion and cabbage. Probably had close to 10 volunteers working with me. Served 200 people, there was nothing left but scraps for my wonderful volunteers. First time ever making it and have done so every year at every resort and now know enough to not sell all the tickets or cook an extra amount for us slaving in the kitchen. Will never make my corn been any other way! No longer work the big resorts, have one in the oven right now for my family, delicious aroma is driving us all crazy!"

I follow this recipe to the letter but I add the seasoning packet to 4 Tbs water in the pan and quickly baste once after the first hour. You must wrap the pan tightly however or risk a dry brisket. We prefer corned beef bottom round for a tender meal. Serve with Irish Potato Cassarole for a hearty memorable meal."

"reviewBody": "This was the best corned beef I've ever made! Not dried out at all, and so flavorful &amp; tender! The only changes I made were of necessity as: 1. the brisket I had purchased came with the seasonings already applied 2. My rack wouldn't fit in the pan so I rolled up foil logs to keep the brisket raised 3. I did add just a few extra tbs of water(about 1/3 C total) to avoid a dry finish, but was not necessary! The only change I will make in the future is to add more than 1 onion! They were wonderful! Everything else was according to the recipe. I did carefully seal the pan tightly with foil &amp; went with the 1 hour per pound of meat cook time and there was plenty of liquid in the pan when finished. I did bake a separate pan of carrots &amp; celery with Kitchen BouquetÂ® &amp; a small amount of water for the last 2 hours, and made Colcannon with cabbage kale, leeks and a roasted garlic paste, and some a small loaf of Irish Soda Bread completed the meal. A most excellent recipe I will use again &amp; again! Thank you so much!"

"reviewBody": "This has been my go-to corned beef recipe for years now. It's requested by all my family &amp; friends. Love my mom, but this is SO much better than the boiled corned beef I grew up eating. Try it... you won't go back to boiling. (I usually do 3-4 roasts. Flat cut is a MUST. I brown on the stove in cast iron and braise in an electric countertop roaster oven; wrap the foil tightly around the insert, drop it into the roaster, then set the lid on top.) Also, I think the reviewers who commented it was dry and burned must not have wrapped the foil tightly enough, or they checked it during the cooking. It should be swimming in its own juices by the end of cooking."

One for the family and one for me to have Reubens for a few days after. Well, kids plowed, as did I and the wife and I only had enough leftovers for one Reuben after. This year I'm making two in the oven per this recipe but also have two on the smoker right now. I know it's a variant so plan on smoking for 60 minutes then wrap in butcher paper for the duration."

Use Heavy duty foil and a pan that has a lip so you can get a tight seal. Don't let the brisket touch the foil, the salt will dissolve the foil allowing the steam (water). I doubt a little more water for insurance would change the recipe"

Today I will make it for my third time, as it is now my 'go to' recipe for corned beef."

"reviewBody": "Just made it! I used the dutch oven. Added 1/2 bottle stout beer, browned the meat with worstedshire sauce. Smelled great. I didn't have a rack so used 2 onions sliced thick then put the meat on top of them. Sliced onions and garlic on top. Cooked at 275, for 2 1/2 hours, as it was only a 2 lb corned beef, grass fed and uncured. Then I put in potatoes, carrots and cabbage on top of that. Cooked 1 1/2 hours more. GREAT flavor all of it and veggies. Will do it this way from now on. Thanks!!!"

"reviewBody": "OMG winner!! Iâve been making corned beef for years, typically boil it, sometimes on the stove sometimes in the crockpot, it always turns out tender and lovely but I felt like mixing it up this year and Iâm beyond ecstatic I found this recipe! The negative reviews are confusing, and do not add up but I can only assume that their pan wasnât sealed well enough, and too much moisture evaporated therefore resulting in dry meatâ¦ I happened to have Kitchen Bouquet in my pantry, I had a 4lb brisket and followed the recipe (might have used 8 or so garlic cloves). I made a foil coil (YouTube it if you need to, but take a large piece of foil and fold it up so itâs in a long roll and then shape it into a snake like shape so the meat can sit on it) so that I could bake it inside a 9x13 glass baking dish and have it elevated. After searing I placed the brisket on the coil, added the garlic and onions and then poured about 4 oz of light beer into the searing pan to deglaze it. I let that cook around for about a minute and then poured that liquid over the roast, double foiled it and made sure it was TIGHT! That baby cooked in the oven at 275 for 5 hours. (Based on the recipe that was 6 hours for a 5lber, I kinda guessed). Smelled INCREDIBLE! Took it out to test it and the meat was basically falling apart. This recipe is far supreme to the traditional boil method. I made this one, and then one in the crock pot (boiling method)â¦ Everyone at the table preferred this version (by a landslide) and I will be making this every year until I die! Thank you for passing this on."

We had half the weight in corned beef so adjusted the cook time accordingly. We did get worried an hour and a half in - looked like it was drying out. I cooked in my pampered chef roaster - which has a heavy lid - so we did end up reducing oven temp to 200 for 40 min and the 250 for the last 40 min until got to 195 internal temp. Moist, flavorful and just mouthwatering amazingness! Marked as a favorite and youâre right! This should be made more than once a year! Thanks for sharing!!"

My husband loves corned beef so I've tried boiling it in a regular pot, boiling it in a Le Creuset dutch oven and in the Instant Pot. Until now the dutch oven was our favorite but once I tried this recipe this has been the best. I followed the recipe exactly and would not make any changes. The depth of flavor and tenderness makes the 6 hour wait worth it! Once it's in the oven I can forget about it (no peeking!) for the cook time and go about doing something else. This is an excellent recipe and something different than the same old, same old. I don't think anyone will be disappointed!"

I made colcannon as a side dish and used the cabbage that I had added to the colcannon recipe. It is hard not to get seconds.

Not only was it super tender, but there was considerably less shrinkage. Also it smelled wonderful unlike when I boil it with the cabbage!! I followed the directions and used only 2T of water and sealed the brisket in a double layer of heavy duty tin foil and put it in a baking pan. It was a larger corned beef âabout 6.5 lbsâ so I baked it at 275degrees for almost 7 hours. When I finally unwrapped it it was picture-perfect tender! And it had created about 1.5 C. of water! So donât be worried that it will dry out. It creates its own juice and as long as itâs sealed tightly and YOU DONT OPEN IT UNTIL THE TIME IS UP, it will be PERFECT!"

Using the browning sauce prior to searing adds wonderful color and flavor; putting the onions and garlic on top of the brisket adds even more flavor. I used a scant half cup water instead of the recommended 2Tbl. and it turned out great. My whole family loved it and couldn't get over how tender and delicious it was. I will never go back to the \"traditional\" boiling method - this recipe is far superior. Be sure to seal your braising pan/roaster well and line the pan with foil for an easier cleanup."

However, it was really salty (and believe me when I say I like salt!). I did rinse the meat and dry with paper towels, before processing with the recipe. I read some reviews that said they might soak overnight in water next time they make it. I would consider doing that also, if I ever make it again. My husband wouldn't eat it, but he's funny about anything he's never eaten before anyway. Also, I might not put the Kitchen Bouquet on it. I think a good sear would be good enough. I \"braised\" it in my Dutch oven with foil and the lid on, so the moisture stayed inside the pot. Then there's also the question of how to cook the cabbage, potatoes and carrots if you're not cooking them with the meat (like you would in a boil), or with ham. Give it a try though. It really was pretty good, but consider soaking it."

"reviewBody": "After making traditional boiled corned beef and cabbage as well as various roasted versions for decades...this is THE BEST Corned Beef I've ever made! My husband said it first - \" This is your BEST yet! .\"\nFollowed the recipe as stated. I had a 2.7 lb corned beef and roasted it for 4 hrs. It sat on the stove wrapped for another 2-3 hrs. while I roasted carrots, cabbage and boiled potatoes. Served it with the juices and onions from the pan as well as sou cream and horseradish sauce. DELICIOUS!!\nAlso made Irish Soda Bread muffins on the side...\nThank you for this great recipe! \nNo need to change it people...easy, simple and DELICIOUS!"
