"reviewBody": "I had been looking for a recipe like this for these hot summer months. My parents used to make this when we went camping. I didn't have the recipe but this seems like exactly what my mother made. It appears the frozen juice concentrate has been shrunk by 25% since this recipe was posted because I can only find 12 oz cans. This actually works out great though because you can use the entire fifth of brandy and use 2 cans each of the lemonade and orange juice and increase the rest of the ingredients by 50%. Been a real hot summer so far this year and this will be batch number 3. The fifth is actually about 4 ounces more than what would normally be used but it works out fine for me....lol"

Modifications: 2 cups water to boil tea bags 4 min, use a mix of 2 black and 2 chai. 6 cups water boil to dissolve 1.5 c sugar. Use rest of recipe and allow to freeze overnight. The chai provides the right spice element for winter. Green or black is perfect for summer."

I could only find 12 oz frozen OJ and lemonade so I changed the servings on the recipe to 18 to get everything to the right proportions. Worked perfectly!"

I also ended up adding about half of the bottle of lemon-lime soda to the mix because it was a bit too strong for my taste. This came out the perfect texture and was very pleased with it. I only had about 1 glass left after our super bowl party, and we had a small party. Will definately make again!"

Make it in an ice bucket several days in advance of first use. Easy to take to parties. Usually use caffeine-free tea and Sierra Mist, but the cranberry lemon-lime drink is good, too. Have made it with Stevia instead of sugar, and it was good. Couldn't tell the difference. It's all good."
