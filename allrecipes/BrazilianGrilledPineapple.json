I now use this one instead of the Trisha Yearwood recipe."

The drip pan was almost filled with juice but otherwise the press worked well and caramelized the fruit. Following a suggestion in a review I added a little vanilla extract. I also added a little cayenne for balance. Maybe chile powder might be a good addition or substitution. Served over ice cream this was really good. This recipe would probably work well with mango or peach."

But still brought back the nostalgia. Will be making again."

Yes a ripe pineapple may be a little too sweet. Select a nice pineapple, one that is not over ripe, and you will have a delicious treat. I paired this with pork chops over a wood grill.

"reviewBody": "AWESOME! I've made grilled pineapple before but never cut into wedges. I love it made that way. I can see making this for a crowd and slicing the wedges and serving with toothpicks after they're grilled. My changes were to cut into 8 wedges not 6 and to rub the wedges with the brown sugar mixture as I was out of plastic bags. The flavor was awesome and I will be using this recipe often. Thank you SoccerNut for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "I've grilled these twice now. First time, I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla with the cinnamon and brown sugar then added water to make thinner. Second time, I cut back a little on the cinnamon as I'm not a huge fan and didn't add water. Water wasn't needed at all. It was so good both times. We put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Yummo! The pineapple is soooo sweet and juicy. My favorite dessert."
