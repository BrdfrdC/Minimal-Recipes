,"description": "White rice is the main side dish made in Brazil. This is the way my mom would make it and taught my sister and I. What makes this so different is that we fry it in oil with minced onion and garlic before adding water. You can also use part water, part chicken broth. The secret is to not let it overcook because it should come out loose and not sticky."

It needs to be paired with other food and is intentionally plain to complement your main dish. I didn’t have cal rose, so I used what I had - Japanese rice. Salt and oil really brings out a buttery flavor of the rice. The two of us kept going back for more and finished off the whole batch. Made this with pollo Al horno as the main."

I appreciated the mellow flavor of this rice to go along with several Brazilian dishes, including a Feijoada, that are already packed with lots of flavor. Out of habit, the method I used to cook the rice was a little different and used a little less water (sautéed onion and garlic, sautéed rice for a few minutes, add in water, salt, and cover with tight fitted lid for the same time as directed in recipe). I will definitely make this recipe again!"

"reviewBody": "Hi, I'm the submitter of this recipe. I just wanted to say thank you to all who have tried it and hope that you enjoy it with your loved ones. Although I love this recipe as it was passed on to me, it is very versatile. I play with it all the time! Feel free to do it too. My mom always used vegetable oil but due to personal taste I use olive oil and In addition, I frequently use chicken or vegetable broth, and add more onion and garlic. However if you prefer it to be more subtle then follow the recipe. You can use this method with most types of rice. It works well with brown basmati rice and I have tried it with vegetable medley and brown medley rice too. But beware that It will take longer to cook and may require more tweaking with the water or broth. I always get so many comments about how nice it smells while cooking. Please note that there is one other thing I do frequently... I partially uncover it during the last 5 minutes of cooking. This helps to speed up the cooking and ensures that it doesn't get sticky."

Instead of salt and plain boiled water, I leave out the salt and dissolve two chicken bouillon cubes in the four cups of boiling water required. That pumps up the flavor a lot!"

"reviewBody": "It took me a while to decide on what to rate this dish. Made exactly as written, and we found it a bit bland. But it is what it says it is... White rice. This is a basic white rice dish in terms to flavours. What's special about this dish is the cooking method. It was so fragrant cooking the rice in the oil, onion and garlic mixture. My rice came out perfectly cooked in 20 minutes covered on a low simmer. And for that reason it was good. It was a good basic white rice.. Which cooked up better then good. I probably won't use this rice dish as a side again but it would be great served under a flavourful stirfry or curry. What I will take from this recipe though is the method of cooking.. I'm looking forward to using that again. \nThanks!"

"reviewBody": "Browned white rice in EEVO on medium heat. Doubled onion and garlic measurements and added 2 small cans of sliced mushrooms. Also added 5 chicken bouillon cubes instead of the salt. Cooked as directed. Family is eating now while I take a break from standing over the stove. It is very quiet over there-all I hear is forks tapping plates. A definite thumbs up for this recipe! Dinner is Brazilian White Rice, garden salad (Romaine lettuce, with thinly sliced veggies; cucumbers, onion, carrots, green pepper, radishes, and celery) and baked chicken (legs, thighs, wings) with garlic salt and pepper until crispy-385 degrees, 45 minutes each side ending with skin side up. I have just finished eating dinner. What is great about this side dish recipe is that the flavor is delicate and compliments any dish without competing with it. Perfect dinner!"

Oops. However, despite that mishap, it still cooked fine. This does make a lot of rice; I shouldve realized and halved it, but I didn't. Oh, well, I guess we are having rice with something else this weekend. Hah! Thanks for the recipe!"

I thought maybe it would taste too much of onion or garlic, but it didn't. I did half the recipe and still around 2 cups of rice. Half the recipe makes about 3 servings. The only change I might make for next time is cutting the salt back some. I will definitely try this again."

It is not stated in the recipe but it is important to bring water to a boil before covering and turning down to a simmer. The leftovers will make great fried rice!!!"
