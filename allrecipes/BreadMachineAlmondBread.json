"reviewBody": "I was really impressed how well this came out on my first try. It's delightfully fluffy and just a tiny bit sweet. \n\nI did substitute sunflower oil for almond oil because I didn't have almond oil. I suspect it didn't matter much; I can certainly recommend it with sunflower oil in any event.\n\nI might try it on the 1.5 lbs loaf setting on my bread machine the next time I make it. It's just a little dark on the outside and it seems smaller than other two pound loafs I've made."

(I should add that I used coconut oil, rather than almond oil.) My husband even commented on the aroma. Great loaf of bread with all the extra goodness and health benefits of almond flour and whole wheat. Thanks for the recipe!"
