"reviewBody": "This turned out quite good, however be sure you are ready to feed a tribe of people. When it was all said and done I came out with one 14 inch and two 8 inch Calzones. Also, you need to be sure to roll these very thin otherwise they will be too bread heavy. Additionally, bump up the temp to 400 - most calzones are hit with very high temperatures to achieve proper crusting. Finally, be sure to have plenty of flour on hand for the rollout - the dough was very sticky and needed more flour. The only reason Iâ€™m not giving this 5 stars is due to the portion size and that traditionally sauce is served on the side, not within the calzone itself as it would make the bread soggy. Overall, great recipe and will definitely be making it again - good for a dinner party where everyone gets to make their own 6 inch, etc."

"reviewBody": "My wife braided this like a boss! I know I messed up something since I was the man with the roller... dough on top got to be too thick :( . We have only eaten the ends (a lot of bread because of how we made ours) and one slice from the \"middle\" area. I put the kitchen sink in my side, fresh mushrooms, deli sliced sandwich pepperoni, bacon crumbles, crumbled beef (all pre cooked meats), canadian bacon cut in quarters and black olives. We added sliced mozzarella and sliced Monterrey Jack cheese. We used Bertolli spaghetti sauce. \n\nThings we are going to try next time\n1. more stuff - more cheese and more layers of meat. (her side with pepperoni was only maybe 1 1/2 pieces of pepperoni per slice when all was said and done and it is too much bread for the meager amount of pep and cheese we put in.) We will layer meat, cheese maybe 4 times over next time.\n2. more sauce - not a lot more... I really appreciate Kevin giving us a starting quantity but I think maybe being in contact with the dough pulled some sauce out. It was a good amount when we started but after baking, it seemed to have gone in to the ether. I think next time, base of sandwich pepperoni and then a layer of cheese and then sauce should work well for our tastes.\n3. Bread a bit less bready. Everything worked out great but the bread we use for our pepperoni rolls may be better as it seems to not bake up as thick.\n4. Egg wash is pretty awesome on here - we use one egg with one tablespoon water mixed and brus"

The dough turned out great! I used hot Italian sausage and it was a perfect sweet/spicy. The only thing I could have done was use a better pizza sauce. (I didn't have any tomato paste to make my own and didn't end up having time to pick up some pizza sauce. I improvised and the sauce I made turned out a bit too salty, but everyone liked it and I will be looking forward to making this again!"

I made one following the recipe, and then I made one using alfredo, baby spinach, mushrooms, onions, black olives, mozz, and some Italian sausage. I egg washed for color and also brushed the outside with garlic butter and parm to finish. I had some left over dough that made some decent breadsticks. The dough was a bit wet, so I'll probably back off of the water a bit next time. I will probably also stick to using a stand mixer for better control of the dough. But, not bad."

I made it a second time today with only 1 cup and 3 Tbs of water and the dough looks much better in the machine. Flour moisture content can vary so I would suggest starting with a lower amount of water and checking the dough after s few minutes of kneading."

Grandkids loved it. \n\nThe second time I made it, followed directions for dough and then split it in half and rolled out two rectangles. Also rolled out on parchment paper and then just picked up the calzone parchment paper and all and put on baking sheet. \n\nBy making two, I was able to change up the filling. This is a big hit with all my family."

Lastly, grated some parmesan on the crust for the last minute in the oven - yum!\n\nWe used authentic Italian sausage and pepperoni from an Italian market and it adds to the over all flavor."

Was good, and I'll make again, but the dough was too wet, so I had to work with amounts of flour a bit.

I added the yeast and sugar to very warm water to my Kitchen Aid mixer bowl and l let the mixture sit for 10 minutes (until bubbly). Then, I added the flour, salt and milk. I mixed in the mixer for 5 minutes with the dough hook. Then, I covered the bowl and let it sit in a warm spot for 1 hour, punched the dough down, rolled out on a cornmeal covered pan, filled and baked. AWESOME!!! I doubled the recipe, filled 1 with ham and cheese and the other calzone with sauteed onion, garlic, spinach and feta cheese. The dough was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I will definitely be making these again. Super easy, too!!\nThank you, Kevin K. for sharing this recipe."

I also added teaspoon extra sugar, and a teaspoon extra yeast. I like mine with a little more yeasty sweet flavor. Also I would put this in a 350 degree oven and after 15 minutes turn it down to about 300 to 325 degrees depending on your oven, that is if you like a less dark crust. Plus I used spinach, cheeses,sausage, pepperoni, peppers, onions and drained olives, so needed the extra cooking time, for the inside to cook and the outside not be over cooked, I just turned the oven down. this recipe would make great Breadsticks...just add some herbs and garlic and onion to the mixing bowl...Very Tasty and Thanks for submitting it!!"

For the adults (who are all trying to eat a little healthier these days) I used ham, green and red pepper, onion, and Swiss cheese. We absolutely loved it. One changed I made was to give the calzone an egg white wash instead of butter which work perfectly without added fat. Thanks for the great recipe"

I did not worry about braiding, just folded it all up into one calzone. Brushed with some butter. SO GOOD! Did not use any sauce on the inside of this, but served with ranch and marinara for dipping."

I did not use the powdered milk instead I just substituted the water with milk as suggested by other reviewers. For the filling I also added sauteed yellow peppers and onions. I made the exquisite pizza sauce from this site and served it on the side rather than putting it in the calzone. I've made calzones and stromboli several times before and this one was definitely the best! I will look not further, but will continue to use this recipe. The braiding also worked better than the traditional rolling."

I did have to bake mine slightly longer than stated, and still was able to avoid a tough/hard crust. Great recipe; thank you for sharing!"

I also used 1 T. bread machine yeast for the bread bowls but 2 t. bread machine yeast for the calzone. I do not brush the dough with melted butter.)"

"reviewBody": "10 STARS! I have made this too many times to count over the past year. I use milk in place of the water and powdered milk, and add garlic powder and oregano to the dough. Terrific recipe for customizing with your favorite meat and veggies inside. We like this served with a zesty Italian sauce on the side and no pizza sauce inside. For a double batch, I like to make a cheese filling with 15 oz ricotta cheese, 16 oz shredded mozzarella cheese, 1 egg, black pepper and oregano. Over top of this, we layer: sauteed onions, garlic, peppers, mushrooms, diced tomatoes, rosemary, oregano, and cooked meat or pineapple and ham. The braiding makes a beautiful calzone and is easy to do. About five minutes before it is done baking, I brush it very lightly with butter and a touch of Parmesan cheese. If you make a double batch, make sure you help the bread machine get started with the mixing as it is a lot of flour, but it works in my Hitachi bread maker. Better than what you can get in a restaurant! Thank you Kevin K.!"

For the inside I used homemade tomato sauce, mozzarella, sauteed broccoli/red/green peppers/garlic. I topped the calzones with butter and parmesean before I threw it in the oven. It was AMAZING. The outside breading was so good I could have eaten it plain as breadsticks. The only thing that was a little hard was dealing with the dough because it was very sticky. It was worth it and I will definitely be making this recipe often."

I do not have a bread machine so after proofing the yeast(mixing the yeast w/sugar and warm water for 10 minutes), I added the other ingredients and kneaded it for about 6-8 minutes. After that, I let the dough rise in a covered bowl in my oven on the lowest setting. Rolling the dough out was a breeze and the recipe is really quite simple with delicious results. Highly recommend."

I made half of it vegetarian (ricotta, red and green bell peppers, onions, sliced black olives, mushrooms and mozzarella) and the other half with pepperoni. I chose to dip the calzone in marinara instead of adding to it. I may put the sauce in next time. I think the dough would make a nice loaf of bread too."

I made 1 1/2 times the recipes as some other reader's have done and I mixed it on the mixer. I allowed the dough to rise until double, about an hour. This dough was so yummy, we all made pigs out of our selves! It made delicious Calzones and we where each able to make our own, with our favorite fillings. I loved mine with Spinach, Mushrooms, Onions, ham and Mozzarella cheese. My husband suggested that next time, I leave some dough unused, and fry dough balls as some Italian restaurants do, and make zepoles for dessert. (small fried pizza dough balls, rolled in powdered sugar after frying)"

Basically, after heaping the mixture in a line down the center, use a sharp knife to cut downward diagonally angled \"flaps\". Like this: (right side) //////// (middle) ----- (left side) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Then overlap each side, and tuck in the ends. At least that is how I went about it and it turned out nicely. I subbed 1 tablespoon of actual milk for the powdered; didn't throw off the recipe, despite the extra liquid. I also added another teaspoon of sugar."

I also made individual calzones, and I let the dough rest when it came out of the bread machine and then let it rise for about 15-20 minutes after the calzones were done. Since everyone wanted their own filling, I \"glued\" a piece of the filling (pepperoni, broccoli, etc.) to the outside so everyone would know what was inside each one."

Also, recipe did not say to let rise after forming the calzone, but I made individual ones and the ones I did first (that had some time to rise) weren't as tough, so I would allow for some rising time also. Although pretty good, the filling was pretty basic. And leaked out anywhere I did not seal perfectly. Now that I know a little more about making these, I WILL try again, allowing extra time for the above and being much fussier about sealing the dough."
