I suggest if you want braid it add 1/2 cup flour extra to the recipe or little more until you see a manageable dough. But really the taste of this challah it was superior."

It made two large loaves. Next time I will divide into three loaves since I had to cut the loaves in half for storage. One thing, I have a convection oven so I only baked it for 15 minutes but that was too long. Any longer and it would have burned the crust. So watch it carefully. My loaves came out dark brown but still moist. Otherwise it's a quick and easy way to prepare the tasty bread all year long. I bet this would be terrific for french toast."

Adding the flour then, without additional kneading, adversely affected both the taste and texture of the challah. Next time, I will start out with closer to 5 cups of flour, and see if that improves things."

"reviewBody": "Nope, nope, nope. \nI did what others had said and added 1/2c of flour from the beginning. Not only did this not become dough, I could POUR it like cake batter. When the machine was done kneading, I added more flour (I didn‚Äôt measure but it was a LOT) until it was more of a dough consistency and mixed it again. It was still sticky enough that I had to keep adding flour on my rolling surface because it was like glue. Eventually I got to something that could be braided but I‚Äôm so far from the recipe that I‚Äôd be lying if I reviewed this as anything more than a complete failure."

"reviewBody": "Made this one time and followed the directions pretty closely. Only changes I made was using a stick of butter instead of vegetable oil and used less sugar but more honey and some dark agave sweetener. The taste of this first attempt at Challah bread was phenomenal, but the texture was weird. Unfortunately, I hadn't read the reviews before I got started to be warned about the sticky texture. I baked it anyway, although it was globular looking loaf as braiding it like regular Challah seemed impossible.\n\nLesson learned. Second attempt I once again replaced vegetable oil with butter and cut down on white sugar and added more honey, but no agave nectar since I'm out. I also added about 1/2 cup extra flour and an extra half pack of yeast. I just took it out of the bread machine and must say the texture now is ON POINT! I easily braided it this time and this will probably make a beautiful loaf! I'm letting it rise now and haven't baked it and tasted it, but since the ingredients are pretty much the same I think it will still taste awesome, the half cup flour shouldn't change the taste much (I hope). I just wanted to write this review so I could remember how I got the good texture before I forget it."

"reviewBody": "I have reviewed this bread before, it's one of our favourites. I did say that I made no changes, however, I've read so many reviews complaining about the dough being too sticky. As I'm quite experienced with my machine now, I never put ingredients in and walk away. It's always a good idea to stick around until the dough is just about mixed, but the machine is still kneading. Check the dough to judge if you need to add flour or water at this stage and scrape away any flour from the sides that the machine hasn't managed to include. Do this, and you should have a perfect dough every time. Bear in mind that the dough for challah is slightly more sticky."

I did two triple braids and stacked them, which worked fine. The second time it was very humid so the dough came out too sticky. I over floured it trying to get the rolls to stay intact while doing a single 6-braid (which was not worth the hassle), and then over-baked it trying to get the top to brown more. It still came out well though despite my missteps."

I used ordinary, all purpose, unbleached flour and also needed to add 1/2 cup more than recipe calls for. I used 3 tsp of yeast in all. Dough will rise substantially while in the oven. It turned out perfectly. Note: dough has to be a bit sticky in order to roll nice ropes for braiding. Use flour sparingly for rolling and braiding. Enjoy! We sure did!"

It was INCREDIBLE. I mean, baker's quality. I used APF since I never keep bread flour in the house and I didn't use honey as I was all out and had no problem working with the dough whatsoever. Hubs wanted to eat the whole loaf in one sitting!!! Kids loved it too. I'm not sure if the lack of honey/use of APF changed the texture or anything but I had no sticky issues at all so maybe that'll help someone!"

"reviewBody": "With a lot of tweaking, this recipe turns out well. I live in the Deep South, where the humidity changes everything in the kitchen. By adding a little flour during the kneading process in the bread machine and during the braiding, I found the baked loaves to be as pretty as they should be. The baking sheet or pan needs to be greased for the challah to completely come off of it. I tried using the beaten whole egg for the glaze and found that it made the bread taste strongly of egg, which should never happen with challah. The solution: use egg white. I am grateful to have found this recipe, because I have carpal tunnel syndrome and need a machine to knead for me. Thanks to the person who shared it for making my family's Shabbat more enjoyable, with no need to run to a special bakery for bread, call ahead for it, and so forth!"

"reviewBody": "I make this recipe every week now and I think it is outstanding. One point of disagreement with the reviewers here - yes the dough is sticky, but adding so much additional flour changes the texture away from the tender and light qualities of the original. I've found that if I am diligent about having floured hands and a floured board (but not too much flour!) the stickiness problem drops considerably. It also helps to divide the recipe into 3 loaves rather than 2, and to flour a pastry cutter to help transfer the loaves onto the baking stone. also, to get a super shiny glaze, egg wash once after braiding, and a second time after rising. enjoy!"

I have to say I like Bread Machine Challah I much more. \n\nFor this recipe, I did what other people suggested and used 4 1/2 cups of flower instead of 4, but the dough still came out too sticky. When I braided the dough at let it rise again, it sort of ran together and lost it's shape. When I baked it, the loaves came out a little flat. They taste good, and are moist. I think that perhaps the wetting and covering braids with plastic wrap contributed to the over-softness of the dough. Instead I would suggest rolling out the braid strands with flour to help them keep separated."

If you use more honey, or measure the water in a measuring cup that lets you go over the one cup mark it's easy to get sticky dough. This is easily fixed by turning out on a floured surface a folding a few times. I was raised on challah and this is my favorite - its the only recipe I use now (although I do tend to use 1/2 white 1/2 wheat)."
