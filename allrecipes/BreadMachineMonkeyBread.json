I added dry-toasted chopped pecans, and diced apples. And I added this caramel sauce recipe: 1 stick butter - melt in saucepan. Add 1 cup packed dark brown sugar, and 3 TBS heavy whipping cream. Wisk and simmer till sugar melts and it mixes together. Pour half into dough before going into the oven. Reserve the rest for drizzling as you serve! ~ Laura in CA"

One mistake I did make was I overcooked the butter and sugar and it didn't stick very good to the dough."

As I was flipping the bread over onto the plate, right out of the oven, a bunch of the syrup came out and hit my leg. I ended up in Children's hospital urgent care with a second and slight third degree burn all down my thigh. If anyone plans on making this maybe let it cool for 15-20 minutes before you flip it. Having to go to the hospital is not worth \"just out of the oven\" bread."

"reviewBody": "My family loved this, even my non-sweets eating husband. I halved the recipe (sans raisins) and used a loaf pan (because I don't own a bundt pan), cooked as directed and it still turned out perfectly. I also did the last rise in the fridge overnight and took it out in the morning 30 min prior to baking so it would be ready asap for breakfast. I'm only giving four stars because it's annoying the recipe was written for bread machines... recipes should not be written for specialized and superfluous gadgets in my opinion. \nHowever, I'm really happy to have found a recipe that is an actual recipe and doesn't call for pre-packaged ingredients (pastry dough), and I really quite liked the very slightly cinnamony flavor of the dough. \nThe only real change I made was pouring the melted sauce in the pan instead of dipping one by one...I tried the dipping and the sauce didn't seem to want to stick to the dough balls, but many of the other monkey bread recipes do pouring instead of dipping so I tried that and just allowed the excess to run off when flipped after it was done baking and it worked great. Much easier and less messy too, again, hence the four stars."

It looks nicer and holds up better with pouring the sauce, but it's not nearly as yummy as when you dip each piece first. Also, put down foil in the oven. It expanded a lot in the oven and a few pieces broke loose and landed stickily on the oven floor. Love it. Real crowd pleaser."

"reviewBody": "I wanted to make monkey bread in the morning. To prevent separation issues like some noted, I melted the butter and sugar together and boiled for a good 3-4 minutes, whisking constantly, for it to come together like a caramel sauce. I stuck the pan in the fridge to cool down fast. Once the temp cooled to 115F (safe for the yeast), I just rolled the dough balls (made the night before btw) in the sauce. Since many reviewers said they had lots of extra sauce leftover using the original recipe's dough, I upped the dough by 50%. As a result, I ended up using ALL the sauce but I prefer a more saucy monkey bread. Next time, I will make a tad more caramel to drizzle IN BETWEEN each dough layer. Thank you for the recipe!"

I use my bread machine for the dough and throw my raisons or dates into the dough so they are beaten into the dough and you get the flavour without the texture. My family does not love cooked raisons. I make my sauce with double the butter and double the brown sugar and I put a splash of vanilla and corn syrup. Sometimes I'll put maple syrup in too. I coat each piece and pour the rest over the top before baking. Great dessert to bring to group events."

Pour the whole mess into a pan and bake!"

I skipped the raisins and nuts, but made it pretty with candied cherries and popped it into the oven: ready in 20 minutes, just about the time to put the finishing touches to the dinner and serve it. Then it went on the table nicely warm; ok, there is the hot and messy sauce issue, so you need to be careful when you put it upside down, but all in all it was a smash!"

However the changes I made were similar to making Parker House Rolls - by using milk (not water) , 1 large beaten egg, and bread flour. I also added 2 tsp of almond extract, and tsp each of cinnamon and cardamom. I also used 1 stick of melted butter in the batter.\nWhen the dough rose I melted the other stick of butter with the brown sugar, and added 1 tsp of ground ginger and 1 tsp of vanilla extract.\nThis bread is sticky sweet and hard to put down. \n\nI think the next time I make this I'll try it with rose water, grated orange peel and all the other ingredients used in baklava."

I will definitely try this recipe again and let the dough rise for 58 minutes before making the balls. It was good just way more dense than expected but of course that was due to the lack of rising time! I will also take out the raisins as the rest of my family did not like them. (I thought they were great but I must please the masses!) This recipe mixed up well in my kitchen aid mixer using a dough hook. After checking the cycle for my dough setting on my bread machine I know it needs to mix for 24 minutes then \"rest\"/rise for another 58 minutes. Just in case anyone else wants to try it without the bread machine."

Once my dough was ready, I simply cut into squares and rolled into balls, dipped them in the butter mixture made with chopped pecans (no raisins... yuk!), sprinkled a raw sugar and cinnamon mixture on top, and baked In a glass pie pan. Absolutely delicious!!! I highly recommend this recipe! It wasn't that messy at all and would be hard to mess up. So many variations can be used! Enjoy!"

I couldn't find a store open late on Christmas Eve so I looked for a way to make it from scratch. Our family already loved the version using packaged dough, but this recipe kicked it up a notch and they all loved it! I made a couple of adjustments to make it *easier.* Made the dough by hand (no bread machine) and it was easy to work with it. Let rest for about 50-60 minutes until doubled. Punched down and rolled out the dough and cut it into 1\" pieces with a pizza cutter. Melted the butter by itself. Placed the brown sugar and 1 c. nuts (omitted raisins) into a shallow bowl. Dunked the dough pieces into the butter and then moved to the sugar mixture; rolled til coated and then placed into the angel food pan. Poured the remaining sugar/nuts into the butter and then poured over the top of dough. Let rest another 20 minutes. Baked for 30 minutes. Gone before I knew it!"

I found the sauce to be the major problem- the recipe makes too much, and with so much butter it ends up far too rich and cloyingly sweet. Not wanting to waste any, I poured some directly into the pan both before and after dunking all the dough balls. While it makes for a beautiful presentation, there's just so much it's overpowering. Also, the bread the recipe makes seems to be too delicate to stand up to such a heavy sauce. I'm sorry but I will not be using this recipe again."
