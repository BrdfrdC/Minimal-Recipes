This made a real great thin, crispy crust, which surprised me because it's the first recipe we tried without any oil! In the past, adding more oil seemed to make a better thin crust so I was skeptical, but we made the recipe as written. We did divide it in half and refrigerate it overnight, set it out at room temp for 30 minutes and it was soooo easy to work with. Rolled out half the recipe to about 12 inches with oiled surface and rolling pin, then brushed and baked as directed in the recipe and my dh declared this is it!! This is the holy grail thin and crispy on the bottom with a little chew! Really great recipe Healthy Boy! Thanks! BTW, we refrigerated it before the rise time in the bread maker."

"reviewBody": "I've been using a \"regular\" crust recipe for years, but wanted to make a thin crust pizza. I followed the recipe, but did add some seasonings per other comments (about 1/2 Tbs garlic powder, parmesan cheese &amp; Italian seasoning). The dough was very sticky, so I used a lot of flour when shaping the pie. I wanted to cook it directly on my pizza stone, but it was too thin and sticky to transfer. So I pressed it into shape on a pizza pan and put that on the stone. I baked it for about 5 minutes, then took it out to put on the sauce, cheese and toppings. It was delicious! Will make this again."

The store where I found it had Italian brands offering this grade of flour. It’s the secret ingredient you need to know about. It adds a wonderful crispy yet chewy texture that is superior to the results I got with all purpose flour."

Bake as recommended. Top with your favorites and bake in the oven as high as it will go on a pizza pan covered in corn meal. It should take 10-15 minutes to bake depending on your toppings and your oven."

I typically make the dough the day or a few days before baking and store in a ziploc bag in the refrigerator. Then I roll out the dough on a little corn meal mixed with flour and pre-bake on a perforated pan for just a couple minutes before adding the toppings. Great non-soggy texture! Bake at a high temp - 450 or higher, for best results."

"reviewBody": "Love this recipe! My third pizza using this recipe is in my machine now. I used Italian flour (Antimo Caputo) which is available at Walmart and it worked better than my usual AP flour. I followed the recipe as written but didn't use heated water, as the bread machine heats it. Used a wooden pizza peel with parchment paper on top. The dough with olive oil on top was easy to spread into a large pizza size. Prebaked the crust for 5 minutes then added the toppings. The parchment paper under the pizza made it easy to slide onto the pizza stone and take the finished pizza out. Parchment paper takes the high temps fine and saves the pizza from ending up all over the oven racks! Crust was crisp and delicious!"

"reviewBody": "Direction didn't specify how long to bake after toppings are added. This is our fist time making pizza dough with our bread maker. I made two pizzas with the dough. One in a heart shaped pan and he other in a 12\" pizza pan. The heart shaped one was baked with sauce and cheese for 10 mins. The round one was pre baked 5 min. topped with sauce, cheese and red bell peppers and baked another 7 min. The heart shaped one was more like a hand tossed pizza and the round I was able to stretch thinner and it turned out thin and crispy. We like it, but it's not exactly like the pizzeria."

"reviewBody": "Nice Crust. Made according to recipe. \n\nThe key to good dough is adjusting the moisture content of the dough while the dough is kneading in the bread machine. Due to differences in flour, humidity, etc you can seldom make bread dough using the same exact measurements each time. About 5 minutes into the kneading cycle of the bread machine look at the dough. If it is too wet add flour a tablespoon at a time, giving the machine time to incorporate each addition, until you have the proper dough consistency. If the dough is too dry use the same procedure only adding water instead of flour. \n\nThe dough consistency you are looking for is a soft ball that is slightly tacky. It will lightly stick to the side of the bread pan but pull off cleanly as the machine kneads it.\n\nWhen the dough cycle is complete, transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead 6 or 8 times. Cover and allow to rest 10 minutes for the dough to relax. Put dough between 2 pieces of parchment paper and roll into a 14\" to 15\" circle. Transfer to a 15\" or 16\" pizza pan leaving the parchment on the bottom of the dough.\n\nPrecook the crust on the top shelf of your oven preheated to 450 degrees for 10 minutes and remove from oven. The crust will look like a little balloon. Poke holes on it with a fork and deflate it. Allow to cool until easy to handle and add your choice of toppings.\n\nTo finish cooking slide the pizza and parchment paper from the pan back onto the top rack of your preheated oven and then"

Our pan is about 14 inches round. Wonderful"

Then I added the remaining ingredients and also added about a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, a couple of pinches of oregano and Rosemary. Kneaded for about 2 minutes and let rise for about 30 minutes. I didn't precook and baked it for about 16 minutes. The texture was amazing, it was one of the best crusts I've made."

I was hoping for a crisp cracker crust vs a more dense bread crust. The dough came out perfect from the machine was stretchy &amp; not sticky. In conclusion I would recommend this recipe as it seems it will work every time &amp; is indeed edible, but not gourmet pizza crust &amp; wont impress guests."

Really allows the flavor to permeate the dough."
