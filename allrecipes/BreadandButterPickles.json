I must say, I don't remember them being this salty. These are extremely salty! I'll make this recipe again because the pickles are crunchy and sweet, but I will rinse them and rinse them again to wash off the excess salt. The cucumbers absorb a lot of the salt while resting, and I let them drain well. I also think I'll cut the amount of cloves in half as they are coming thru robustly."

I use 1/8 -1/4 cup salt instead of 1/2 cup, then rinse well after 30 minutes instead of waiting 3 hours and only draining fluids. Pickles come out crispy and delicious, so much so that friends and family are paying me to make them their own full batches (I only charge for supplies/ingredients). Other than the salt issue, the recipe produces well-rounded flavor and extremely scrumptious pickles!"

I also used a bit more celery seed as it seemed to need it. I ended up with seven pints, but had enough of the pickling juice I could have done one or two more pints if I’d had the cucumbers. I am allergic to peppers so I omitted those and just used more cukes. I also let them salt soak for about 6 hours before I drained them, made them very crunchy! They are very tasty pickles!! Slicing the onions VERY thin on my mandolin really made them pop! I also used purple onions, I really like them! Thanks for the recipe!! I always tweet recipes, so I hope you aren’t offended! This is a really good recipe!"

We halved the recipe and used 14 cucumbers, they are dill cucumbers we grew, each between 6-8\" and fat. 1 1/2 vidalia onions, so a LARGE onion(3 onions would be right if you use standard white or yellow onions), and all other quantities we left as recommended when the recipe is halved. Wish we'd weighed the cucumbers, but we didn't. Did not use green pepper. This made 16 4oz jars so right on target for what the recipe says it will yield. Water bath canned them for 10 minutes. Enjoy the recipe, it's a keeper!"

Examples: it's called sweating the cucumbers, doesn't specify canning salt but that's what's recommended, and use pickling cucumbers, the regular kind are too big. We made 1/5 of the recipe and the amount of liquid isn't enough to cover the veggies. I'm new to pickling and this recipe was nothing but frustration, thank goodness I read ahead so I had a clue! The result is just meh."

Did two large bowls of pickling cukes, sliced with a mandoline, 3 large onions per bowl, plus garlic. Added 1/2 cup pickling salt to each bowl. Mixed well, added a bunch of ice, let sit for 3-4 hours before draining and rinsing. After cooking the cukes in the brine, I filled the sterilized jars and processed in hot water canner. 18 pints. Beautiful! Thank you for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I was shocked at how terribly these turned out. Onion to Cucumber ratio is off plus the Cucumber to Liquid ratio was way off. I even doubled the liquids and it was still not enough. As another reviewer mentions, having a weight of cucumber would make it easier to get things right as the only way that I can see 25 cucumbers as being right to the amount of liquid this recipe calls for is if they are mini gherkins. Maybe this is a recipe that a seasoned pickled can make work, definitely not for a beginner like me. Had to toss the whole batch out as it was inedible and certainly not sweet as I would expect a Bread and Butter pickle to be."

It would be really helpful to give the total weights of veggies desired to help out."

I ended up with 13 pounds of sliced cucumbers so I increased the quantities of the components by 33% except for the salt. Additionally, I only used 1/2 cup of kosher salt. I also used a cooler for the salt bath and put some ice on the top to keep cool (I used an igloo cooler and the ice did not melt, it was 78 degrees in the house). I tasted the cucumbers after the salt bath and they we not overly salty (I do not like a lot of salt in my food). I also used what was in the house: red and white onions, and red frying bell peppers. I ended up with 14 pints of processed pickles with very little left over. The pickles are crunchy. This is my third attempt at making pickles with lemon cucumbers, but it is my favorite so far."

The first time, I had used red onions, sliced in rings. The pickles are delightfully crunchy, and the red onion added nice color The second time I made this recipe I expanded on the color variation by using miniature yellow peppers, in addition to thinly sliced green peppers.. The color of the finished product is very nice. In terms of specific suggestions, the quantities in the recipe are not exact. For bread and butter pickles, I generally use larger cucumbers and slice them very thinly. The total quantity of cucumbers plus pepper plus onion should be about 1 gallon, for the amount of liquid generated by this recipe."

My only changes were to add a half teaspoon of whole allspice, I used red bell peppers for the color, and I covered the salted cucumbers in a layer of ice while they were brining. I ended up with 7 pints of beautiful, crunchy, delicious pickles! I did water bath process them for 10 minutes so that I could store them in the pantry.
