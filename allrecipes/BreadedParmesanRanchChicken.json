I do use chicken tenders for the recipe. I usually cook them about 25 minutes, uncovered. Do not overcook chicken, it will be dry and tough.\nThis recipe will make you a hero, guaranteed."

Of course, for just the two of us it was a lot of chicken but we ate the leftovers cold on a salad. I did turn the broiler on at the end for a little while to crisp up the top. It's so easy to make, great for a busy family."

I used plain panko bread crumbs, and a combination of grated and shredded parmasean/romano cheeses. Also added a whipped egg to the butter mixture and a touch of milk to help the panko stick and lots of pepper. If you use panko, keep a close eye on it in the oven as it burns more rapidly than cornflakes or breadcrumbs. Served with baked garlic potato wedges and a salad--great meal!"

"reviewBody": "Excellent! I made a lot of changes, but the quantities were a wonderful guide. Instead of butter I used 1/3 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil to dredge the chicken. I used 1/2 cup of generic bread crumbs instead of the corn flakes, and I used a little over 1 TBSP of homemade Ranch dressing mix. I also used shredded parmesan cheese, but recommend topping the chicken with it 25 minutes into cooking so it doesn't burn. Also, if you tenderize the chicken thin like I do beforehand then total cook time only needs to be 35 minutes. Use a glass dish for easier cleanup. Thanks for the great recipe idea!"

I coated my pan with the olive oil to prevent sticking as well as to help crispen the chicken. Then I dipped the chicken breasts in the ranch dressing. Then coated the pieces in the corn flakes/bread crumbs. Layed the chicken in the coated pan and baked for approx. 45 min until done. Came out great, ate with mashed potatoes and veggies."

Too bland, not crisped enough. My husband thought it was fine, so I may use actual cornflakes and possibly egg to dip the chicken in. I also may make a full recipe to see if that makes a difference. It's so easy to make that if I can get it to have something extra, it might be worth tinkering with."
