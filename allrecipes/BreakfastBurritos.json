"reviewBody": "This was a nice change from the standard breakfast burrito. One important thing to note though is that no way no how this makes 10 burritos. I bought a 16 ounce package of thin cut bacon and there were 13 strips. So yeah, 6 burritos and a leftover piece of bacon. That being said, you'd need to spread the refried beans REALLY thin to stretch a can into 6 10 inch tortilla's. Plan on 2 cans. Loved the fried egg vs. scrambled but the recipe needs tweaked if you plan on getting 10 burritos and serving 10 people."

Almost as good as if I went to the Taco Shop."

Of my mixture into the tortillas &amp; wrap like a burrito then I wrap them individually in wax paper &amp; place into freezer bags and freeze them all when I know for sure my son is going to want them for breakfast the night before I will take 2 out &amp; put into freezer to defrost &amp; when he's ready he microwaves them &amp; breakfast is served if he's undecided or we forget to take them out no biggie it just takes a few minutes more but we defrost them for about 1 1/2 minutes &amp; then full power for about 90 seconds."

I put a layer of refried beans then the scrambled eggs and salsa to the top of the beans, covered that with shredded Mexican cheese or cheddar and topped it with finely chopped raw sweet onion's .and drizzled Taco Bells hot sauce over the fix-ins and roll it up for serving .\nto the refried beans.WOW what a killer BB! You can also trade out bacon for sauce links. That is really good also."

We added bacon, but husband and I both thought the it needed to be cooked more than we typically cook it just to eat. The slightly chewy bacon was not good in the wrap. Also, make sure you get the grease off the bacon very well, or your wrap just tastes like oily refried beans."

I wrap the burrito in tin foil to keep it warm while you eat it (cold burritos can be nasty, especially breakfast burritos). Just peel it back as you devour the burrito. We used Soy Bacon instead of real bacon (we like the taste more), and I agree with one of the other reviews here: do NOT be stingy with the ingredients! Slather it on like this is the last meal you'll be eating for the week. It is VERY rewarding this way. Simple, cheap, and fun to eat."

This was a little bland and I topped mine with a generous amount of Tapatio brand hot sauce because I like it with a little kick. I cut this down to 1 serving, scrambled the egg, and used a Mexican cheese blend. Thanks, I enjoyed this meal."

I think next time I will experiment a little. I think some onions and green peppers maybe mushrooms cooked with the eggs would make this even better. I also wonder how mayo (instead of beans) would freeze? With the bacon, I didnt really think the beans were'nt necessary with bacon. (Though good) I think one or the other (meat or beans)would be sufficient for this dish. These did not go over well with everyone when reheated the next day."

And don't skimp when it comes to putting the items on the tortilla. It tastes so much better when you put 2 slices bacon, and slather on the beans. I cooked the bacon in the oven (I like crispy cooked bacon) and made the eggs scrambled. Then I put all ingredients on tortilla and rolled then stuck in microwave to melt cheese/heat through. I did serve it with salsa, but when you slather the beans and 2 slices of bacon I didn't need the extra flavor of the salsa. I will make this again. Thank You!"

It gives it more flavor and makes it less dry. You can also scramble the eggs with american cheese. Once in a while I will add in shredded hashbrowns for something different. And I love sour cream so I always put that on mine (you can use salsa too if you like)."
