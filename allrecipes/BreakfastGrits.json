Added some chives and served an over medium egg on top. They were delicious! Perfect consistency!"

Her trick to add milk (she never measured it but my guess would be 1/4-1/2 cup), the milk makes them even creamier. I've made what I call \"Breakfast Succotash\" by mixing cheese grits, a scrambled egg and bacon or sausage, mix thoroughly and serve with toast...a happy childhood memory for me!"
