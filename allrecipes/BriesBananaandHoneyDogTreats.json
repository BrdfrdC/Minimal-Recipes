"reviewBody": "First of all, this is a great recipe, but with a couple tweaks, second, if you are an avid baker, you will know that on first glance, 2 cups of water is way too much for 4 1/2 cups of ANY flour, and that you should NEVER add the liquid all at one time, if you are baking anything that you want to roll out. So, I am assuming that those complaining of this dough being \"too sticky\" no matter how much flour you use are beginners, or they would know, that 2 cups is too much to start with, and to slowly add the water until you get a rollable consistency. That being said, I substituted sodium free chicken broth. If you can't find salt free, use low sodium or make your own, and you can use ANY chicken, first boil it, then use the broth; you can also chop the chicken in tiny pieces and add to the recipe, but that does make it a totally different recipe! It also doesn't matter if you have bananas in it and are thinking the furbaby's want \"sweet,\" trust me, I have created many of my own recipes and they love just about any combination in their treats! I use the broth instead of water and add a small amount at a time, STOP adding the liquid when there is just enough to be able to roll the dough. I ended up using about 1 1/4 cups of broth. I use a silicone mat to roll my dough as well. First sprinkle some of the flour on the mat, flour your rolling pin as well, then roll out to about 1/4 inch. \n**TIP I keep latex gloves to use for kneading and mixing, worth buying a box if you bake a lot!"

Only to find out in the comment section that you’re suppose to only add 1 cup of water! I’m actually so mad because I thought I messed something up"

They didn't take nearly as long to bake as the recipe suggests, so that was nice. The dough was incredibly sticky and was only workable after adding around 6 cups of flour and refrigerating it for a few hours. They're easy to make (like most dog treats) and, even though I didn't expect my dog to like them because she isn't a huge fan of banana, she really likes them! I feel this recipe could be a lot easier if it's done without as much water."

"reviewBody": "First- Mixing. It took the better half of an hour mixing and mixing and mixing, because every time you really get into the dough, it gets wrapped like cotton candy on the mixer sticks. I had to use a lower setting in the end- it rode up the mixer to the top in under 10 seconds otherwise.\n\nI read where the recipe meant to have one cup of water, with what is needed after, so I did do that and all, but it was still horrible to knead. \n\nAfter spending about 30 minutes nonstop kneading and adding flour, over and over, the majority of the time with dough stuck all over my palms and fingers, it finally seemed unsticky.\n\nWent to tearing it into the right pieces, making sure it was the right thickness, ect, ect. Turns out, I needed to add about a quarter cup of flour more just so I could push it down without it lifting right back up.\n\nFinally, the sweet relief of putting it in the oven and taking a seat.\n\nThey soon came out, more like really dry, tough bread than anything else. I attempted to fix this by letting butter melt on them to at least make them edible.\n\nBefore and after my attempt to salvage, my pooch turned up her head at it. In fact, before my attempt to salvage, she snorted at them before walking away.\n\nSo- this was a total fail. The only possible reason I suspect this could have failed of my own choice is if for some reason raw honey doesn't work, because I used raw wildflower honey (but now I regret using my best honey.) I had high hopes, but in the end, I'll advise you"

"reviewBody": "Using 1C of water, this recipe made an easy to work dough that baked up nicely. I did sub 1C of ground oats for part of the wheat flour, just to add a little different flavor/texture. At a picnic attended by many dogs, about half really liked these treats. On the plus side, my very picky dog actually liked these, but then she does like bananas. I'd probably try adding some peanut butter next time, or maybe another banana and reduce the water a bit, to give it a little more flavor. I did eat part of one and tasted like a very dense wheat bread with a faint flavor of honey and banana."

These were a huge hit!!!! ---FYI: the dough will be really sticky. Don't stick your hands in it to knead it. I did that and it was a mistake! What you want to do is flour a surface, put the dough on that surface, sprinkle some more flour over the dough, rub some on your hands and then try to knead it or just roll it with a rolling pin. That works much much better :)"

I've been asked several times for the recipe so I know they were a hit. My 2 Boston Terriers loved them. I rolled them a bit thinner and used a very small, bone-shaped cutter. Adorable!"

I only used half of the water the recipe called for and it was still too wet. But I just kept added flour as I kneaded the dough and they came out perfect. i will definitely use this recipe over and over."

I even added more flour.I just had to drop the dough on the cookie sheet and press each one down to make them somewhat flat. Also, they didn't get as hard as the recipe noted.- I followed the recipe exactly."

THE RECIPE WAS SUBMITTED WITH USE ONE CUP OF WATER, ADDING A LITTLE MORE AT A TIME AS NEEDED ~ These dog biscuits require the use of Wheat flour which some dogs are sensitive to, if so its so easy to modify this recipe, simply substitute one cup of wheat flour for 1-1/4 cup of rye or oat flour or ¾ cup, rice, barley or potato flour."
