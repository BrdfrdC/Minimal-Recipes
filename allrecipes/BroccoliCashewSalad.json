All variations turned out quite well but the original using bacon and mayo is probably my favorite. I mentioned the variations just in case one finds their pantry lacking. You'll still get good results without the bacon. If using Miracle Whip instead of mayo, decrease the sugar and vinegar just a bit."

Even the slightest cook changes the taste and I really feel raw broccoli shines through with this salad. Toss the broccoli onion and dressing 30 mins before serving. Added the bacon and cashews at table, I don't use raisins,l. added just under 1/2 cup sugar, and kept everything else same."

"reviewBody": "I love this recipe! I made maybe one fourth of the recipe since it was just for me. So honestly I kind of eyeballed all the ingredients. It was about half a pound of broccoli, one tablespoon of mayo, less than one teaspoon vinegar, and about a teaspoon sugar. I added Cashews and Craisins and some red onion and a bit of bacon. It was amazing! I also ate about half of it as soon as it was done because I was so hungry and it was great, but I really recommend leaving in the fridge for about 2 hours as the recipe says because the flavor is intensified and the broccoli Is a bit softer. I used raw broccoli ( very well disinfected of course). Awesome way to eat veggies!"

Completely devoured!\n\nI followed other reviewer's suggestions and used only 1/4 cup of sugar, and it was perfect. 1/2 cup of sugar would have been too sweet.\n\nI also used Craisins instead of raisins, like one of the other reviewers. Since it was for Christmas, they gave the dish some nice color.\n\nWill definitely make this again for future potlucks!"

My hubs thought it was too sweet, and though I like it as-is, it would certainly do fine with less sugar. I completely omitted the bacon (which wasn't in the recipe I was trying to copy and I don't eat it anyway). Delish!"

After reading the reviews, I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and it is beautifully balanced. I only used 1/2 pound of bacon too, but it seems just right! I'll also be adding my cashews just before serving so they are more crunchy. It tastes SO good! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"

The main problem is that it was overly sweet - the suggested amount of sugar is too much, in my opinion. I like well balanced sweet/savory dishes, but this tasted like a dessert! Also, the sugar/mayo mixture was too thick, and the raisins added even more to the sweetness of the dish. All in all, it is an interesting idea, but the final result was a disappointment. I really wish I could rate it better."
