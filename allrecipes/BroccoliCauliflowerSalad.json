Followed advice of some reviewers and only added half of the dressing but it was not enough for our taste so I added more. In total I’d say I put 3/4 of the dressing which more than enough. I also added some red onion and sunflower seeds per recommendations. Even more delicious. I couldn’t help myself and added pumpkin seeds too."

I always double the broccoli and cauliflower which makes the amount of dressing perfect. Do not skip the eggs if you can help it. Definitely add sunflower seeds as other reviewers suggest, it adds a great crunch. And lastly, make sure you wait to add the dressing, topped with bacon and sunflower seeds, right before serving. SO GOOD!"

I can see the layering, as the instructions state, if you're looking for a nice presentation to serve to a crowd. I scaled this down to 4 servings (1/2 cup each of the veggies). I cut the dressing back again, because I couldn't see using 1/2 cup mayo just for a bowl for myself. The dressing worked very well with all of the ingredients. I also just used one hard-boiled egg. Topped with salt and pepper for a delicious and healthy lunch! Nice recipe!"

I did 1 1/2 cups of each broccoli and cauliflower 1 cup fat free mayo, 2 tbls water, 2 hard boiled eggs 1/2 cup shredded cheese, 1/4 cup sugar, 6 slices chopped bacon, and to add a little kick I also finely chop 1/4 cup red onion. I just mix everything together. \nThe red onion just adds something special! My 7 yr old twins HATE onion but LOVED this, in fact it turns out they wanted seconds and begged me to make it again!"

I was surprised to find that the recipe didn't require the broccoli or cauliflower to be cooked at least a little bit, I mean seriously who eats these vegetables raw? Anyway I ended up steaming in some water for a few minutes until they were slightly cooked though still retaining the crunch thus making it edible. Now for the sauce... it was bad sorry! After reading the reviews, we halved the amount and used low fat Mayo BUT it was still SO SUPER SWEET and ended up STILL BEING WAY TO MUCH!!! I ended up adding some wholegrain honey mustard and it was much better. We let each person help themselves to the sauce and at the end there is still heaps left over. The taste of this combination overall was a bit strange as well - my tastebuds were looking for potatoes as this would've been good with some potatos yet there weren't any... Sorry but won't be making this one again."

AND the veggies can be cooked slightly (very slightly parboiled) for those who cannot digest raw food well--be sure they are still crunchy. I like adding boiled eggs and the bacon is essential. You can also add chopped onion, celery, bell pepper for extra crunch/flavor. Season with salt and pepper to taste and add some cayenne if you like it spicy. Everyone loves it, even those who say they don't like broccoli or cauliflower."

And the only person I saw that ate this and like it was my middle child. So tried it and realized...man it was too sweet tasting but was a sweet mayo flavor. Was not good. So the only thing I could think of that would numb the sweetness without over salting or over peppering was celery salt. It seemed to do the trick after a few shakes here and there and tasting and re-shakng some more. until it was mellowed. I'd say the veggies and bacon were fresh and light. But the dressing really didn't do them justice. Sorry. My advice, cut the sugar down or add more vinegar."

One of my favorites is to use mostly cauliflower and only add the broccoli for green accent. I like to add onions as well, and today for a picnic I added one sweet red pepper, chopped fairly fine. I do cut back on the sugar using balsamic vinegar with it's sweetness, and use light mayo. Different cheese add a nice twist at times, as can finely chopped ham instead of the bacon. This is what I consider a great foundational recipe, with endless variations!"

I bought one of those mixed broccoli/cauliflower bags and just used that. I omitted the eggs (not by choice, I ran out of time to make a few), and after reading a few reviews, I too cut the mayo/sugar/vinegar in half, and it was MORE than sufficient. This flavor is exactly like what you can get in the grocery stores. Next time I make this, and I will make it again soon, I'm going to add the egg, some peas, and shredded carrot. This is how I use to get it at a grocery store in WI and it was just divine. I'm also going to up the bacon. LOVE this recipe."

"reviewBody": "I made this only slightly different to recipe due to other people's recommendations. I used whole cauliflower head, 3 brocolli bunches-cut both into bite size pieces. Made for two functions so I halved each evenly and placed into 2 separate bowls. I omited egg. I used pre-cooked bacon (to save on time), using 6 slices for each bowl of broc/caul blend. Also added 1 cup shredded cheddar to each bowl, and 1/4 cup red onion to each bowl. (i placed cheese, bacon, and mayo blend in just before serving). Mayo blend--I used 1 cup mayo, 1 tbsp white vinegar, and 1 teaspoon lemon juice (didn't have white wine vinegar). I then divided the amount equally and added each half into each bowl. Just enough to coat and give flavor, but not enough to make it too mayonaisy, if that makes sense. 1st group left no leftovers and mentioned they didn't think they'd like but did. Other group not as many tried but those that did, liked it. I really liked it and that's why I'm giving 5 stars. Thanks for the recipe. I was looking for something different and will be making this in future when I have two functions to attend. One prep time, two functions--couldn't be any better!"

A few weeks ago I decided to look and I found this one. It is delicious. My family loves it and it is so easy to make. I substituted lemon juice for the vinegar because I had no way of getting any white wine vinegar in our small rural town. I also prefer to mix everything together instead of layering it. And this second time around I doubled the veges, cheese and bacon but left the amounts of dressing ingredients the same. The recipe was much better with less dressing (and I had wasted some last time). I also leave out the optional eggs. Mainly because I have never ever had a broccoli-cauliflower salad with eggs and it didn't sound appetizing. I still give this 5 stars though."
