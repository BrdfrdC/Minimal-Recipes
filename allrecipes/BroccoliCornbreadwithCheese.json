"reviewBody": "Made it, ate it, loved it. Though I did squeeze the broccoli in a towel/paper towel wrap, I would say a better squeezing is in order for next time. Chopping the broccoli, then squeezing allows more moisture to be blotted out. If you use an overly large onion, that will also add additional moisture, which in some cases, is not necessarily a good thing, as the bread will end up very soft. That is okay, for those of us who like such texture, but any time our food is even slightly moist, my husband calls it 'mushy', which it is not. However - should you decide your bread is just a bit too soft and moist, a night in the refrigerator, followed by careful splitting and a bit of time in the toaster oven will help a great deal. I used two boxes of Jiffy cornbread mix, with Colby &amp; Monterrey Jack cheese. Will definitely make this again, but will use tiny cupcake tins, which should give them a lovely crust."

I used sour cream rather than cream cheese, fresh broccoli rather than frozen, potatoes O'Brien instead of hash browns, and I made my own seasoning. So based on all that, you can see that the recipe is fairly versatile. Next time I make it, I'll make my own cornbread mix as the one I used was a little too sweet for me."

I used two 24 oz containers of cottage cheese, 32 oz bag shredded cheddar (including one third for topping), 4 sticks butter, ten of the 8.5 oz cornbread mix, five 10 oz packs of frozen broccoli, 20 eggs &amp; 35 oz of chopped onions. Baked at 375 for 1 hour and then at 325 for another 30-45 minutes. Cheese topping was overdone, so add that late in the bake time. Note that it looks small before cooking but expands to fill the pan to the top."

"reviewBody": "I made this exactly as printed in the magazine minus about 1/2 cup of the chopped onion (Feb/Mar'14). Make sure there are enough people to eat it because it really is best warm! I had over 1/2 a 9x13 pan left. It really is good. I used a chopper to chop up the broccoli for my kids. Would make a great potluck/holiday item and doubtful anyone else would bring something similar!"

"reviewBody": "This is just crazy good cornbread, I used Jiffy corn muffin mix, which is already really good, and cut the recipe in half. I made it to get my 2-year-old to eat vegetables. I chopped the broccoli and onion really fine to hide them. He liked it, but I was not expecting to love it myself! The cheese, when lightly browned, makes a nice crispy crust on top. Yum!"
