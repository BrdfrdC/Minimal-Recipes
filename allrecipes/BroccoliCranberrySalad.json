My husband bought unsalted sunflower seeds, cherry infused craisins, and real bacon bits (the soft ones) - I thought these differences would ruin the salad, but I am happy to report they worked just fine! I also used one container of broccoli slaw and two heads of broccoli as that is what I had on hand... I also added approx 1/2 a teaspoon of salt to the unsalted sunflower seeds before mixing them into the salad. My husband and I really loved it. Great recipe!"

I have used pecans or walnuts when I was out of sunflower seeds. I added a little salt to compensate. I have used grapes instead of craisins. Use a good red wine vinegar. Let the dressing mixture sit for a bit as the recipe suggests. It does make a difference. You can also add a little orange zest to this for an additional pop."

Also, to add a little more veggie crunch, I add thinly sliced cabbage...and it's, oh, so good! I've only added bacon a few times, but we prefer it without. And for the dressing, I found that an inexpensive light mayo is good, but the red wine vinegar should be of good quality; makes a difference! : }"
