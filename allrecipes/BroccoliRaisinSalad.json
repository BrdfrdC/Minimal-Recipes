"reviewBody": "this salad tastes good, but I will make a few changes the next time I make it. When I read the recipe it felt like a whole cup of raisins and a whole pound of bacon was an awful lot for just six cups of broccoli which is about one whole head of broccoli. it also felt like a half of cup of sugar was an awful lot for only one cup of sauce. I felt like it was too sweet. next time I make it I will only use half a cup of raisins, half a pound of bacon, and 1/4 cup of sugar. that way the taste of the broccoli won't be completely canceled out by the other three ingredients and it will taste more like a salad instead of a desert."

The sauce in this salad is amazing! You can keep adding more broccoli, raisins, and bacon after it gets thinned out and it tastes even better after sitting for a day in the frig. :) excellent!"
