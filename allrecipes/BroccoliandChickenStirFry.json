I read the reviews and used 1/2 c. Low sodium soy sauce. It was still too salty and all you taste is the soy sauce. The sauce is too thick. It doesn't need 2T of cornstarch-1 is plenty. If I make again, I will try 1/3 c low sodium soy sauce and 1/3 c. chicken broth. I'll also add a lot more broccoli and some carrots. I'll do the chicken differently so it doesn't dry out."

We'll cut the sugar in half next time either way. We prefer thighs to breasts, so a lb was cut up in place. There was about a cup of zucchini already cut up, so a cup of broccoli was replaced by that. I'd still increase the broccoli by another cup, possibly using other veggies. We replaced cornstarch with arrowroot at the same amounts, and it thickened mega quickly. Served over brown rice, the two of us inhaled this with no leftovers for lunch."

"reviewBody": "This is a great recipe, with some amendments. I used steam in bag broccoli and after getting the sauce to a boil threw the chicken and broccoli in with it. Like other reviewers, I cut the soy sauce in half and used chicken broth instead. It was still too salty and we like salt! We also added about a TBSP of lemon juice to cut the sweetness of the brown sugar. I think next time we will use 1/4 the soy sauce and the rest chicken broth. It is a GREAT basic recipe and you could use about any veggies you want, and swap out the protein source as well. Thanks for sharing. This will be our go to recipe for stir fry from now on. It’s also quick to throw together."

Then add back salt or soy sauce as preferred. My favorite is Broccoli Beef so I've used top sirloin instead of the chicken. Excellent using just veggies or shrimp as well."

I cooked the chicken first then set aside while I sautéed the veggies as I was worried the chicken would get over cooked. I also added garlic, carrots and mushrooms. I’d make it again but halve the ginger and increase the brown sugar and chilli flakes. Best part was that it was easy to take some cooked chicken and quickly boil some of the chopped veggies to make deconstructed dishes for my littles (18 months and 3.5). 5 stars when the whole family eats all of their dinner!"
