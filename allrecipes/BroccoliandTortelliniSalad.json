Separate strips into 4 batches with paper towels and fold up each into a container for freezing."

"reviewBody": "This broccoli salad is fantastic. I followed the advice of many reviewers before more me and I thank them all for their tips. 1) Only cooked the refrigerated tortellini for 2-3 mins. 2) Blanched the broccoli in super hot water for 1 minute. 3) Double the amount of salad dressing!!! This last bullet is imperative. I put half the dressing on the night before and the other half just before serving it. Also, add sugar to the dressing in baby steps (1 T. at a time) and then taste test it. I personally didn't add nearly the amount of sugar the recipe called for but that is just personal taste. I waited to add the sunflower seeds and the crumbled bacon to the salad until the last minute as well. I was worried that they would get soggy overnight and the crunchy texture is part of the salad's uniqueness in my opinion. This recipe went immediately into my favorite folder!! Thanks AMFC for sharing it!"

I made the brocolli salad per directions except I bought sunflower seeds in the shell instead of the seeds so I substituted with chopped pecans. I would advise to use only 1/2 of the dressing made the night before and toss with the other half in the morning. Add bacon and nuts just before serving. I received raves and wanted the recipe.

I also follow the tortellini cooking instructions since I use frozen and only cook about 3-5 minutes. I have even made this and added in some sliced up grilled chicken and made this a main dish.

"reviewBody": "This was a great recipe. I blanched the broccoli for 30 seconds exactly. Any longer and it would have been too soft. The blanching really brought out the beautiful green in the broccoli. After blanching, I soaked the florets in ice water. Per another suggestion, I made 1.5 times the dressing, added 1/3 of it right after I made the salad. Placed everything in a Ziploc in the fridge for a few hours and before I served it, I added the remaining dressing. I didn't 1.5 times the sugar in the dressing but kept it at 1/2 a cup sine I don't like things super sweet. I also needed to add some salt to the salad after I made it and it could be because I didn't salt the water enough when I cooked the tortellini. I also only used 1/4 of a purple onion. it seems like a whole one would have been too much and it could be because the onion I had was on the larger size. Everyone complimented me and it was all gone! This is going to be my new go-to potluck dish!"

I used light mayo, splenda instead of sugar, 50% less sugar dried cranberries instead of raisins and 5 heads of broccoli. I used the same amount of dressing. Turned out very well and not nearly as heavy as the original recipe. Next time I think I will blanch the broccoli as recommended by others!"

Used 3/4 cup mayo with 1/4 cup sugar and 3TBLS of cider vinegar. Mixed a the dressing, veggies,pasta and craisins together and chilled over night. Mixed in the bacon and seeds right before serving to my co-workers that loved it. What little that was left tasted even better the next day!! Thank you AMFC"

Thank goodness I did...I could eat this salad for breakfast, lunch and dinner! For the dressing I mixed 1/2 cup of miracle whip, 1/2 cup regular mayo, and 1/4 cup sugar (which is plenty of sugar--you could easily get away with using even less than 1/4 cup). I prefer to use golden raisins. Also, I think it is best if you cut up the broccoli into small bite size pieces (only using the florets and omitting the stem/stalk). Absolutely my favorite! Thanks for the recipe!"

I added the broccoli to the last 2 minutes of the boiling tortellini water to make the green \"pop\" in color. I would do this again. Make your dressing up ahead of time so that the sugar has time to melt into the mayonnaise, stirring often. I used all the ingredients, but changed the order a little bit. After the dressing was well blended, about an hour I added it to the salad, withholding the sunflower seeds and bacon. I added those right before serving because I wanted them to still have some crunch. Good salad and would make it again."
