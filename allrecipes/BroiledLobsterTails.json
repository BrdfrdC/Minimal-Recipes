"reviewBody": "Hey everyone I used to work in the kitchen at a nationwide restaurant chain. Here is how they broiled their lobster tails. The kitchen or prep area would prepare the lobster tails a little different but better I think. As the recipe states, to cut lengthwise down the shell of the tail. Now pull the meat out of shell but still making sure tail still attached at base. On the underside of tail, they call it, \"score\" or make 3-4 diagonal, superficial, not deep cuts and close or put together shell so you can lay the lobster meat on top of the shell. Then make or score again 3 superficial cuts lengthwise down the meat on top like you did shell when you cut it. I usually make one cut down center and the 2 other along side or just next to center score. Spread out meat again along over shell. Now this recipe calls for butter and some spices but the restaurant I know they used a mixture of butter, chopped parsley, garlic or maybe garlic powder, and maybe that paprika. Mix the spices and brush on meat and cook. At least this way, it thins out the meat a little so you don't have undercooked thick piece of meat in the center and probably cooks faster. I think that restaurant chain had cooked some of their smaller tails the same way as this recipe but majority of the lobster tails are like this. I'm sure everyone knows what restaurant chain that I'm talking about. Good luck and good eating!!"

Also, the position of the oven rack is very important. Should be about 10 inches from heat source. In general, the flavoring is good, but this is a very poorly written recipe that will not be of help to anyone new to lobster tail broiling."

It was also pretty bland despite doubling the seasoning. I love 99% of the dishes I have made from Allrecipes, but this one was a thumbs down. An expensive dish that did not taste delicious. I would not recommend."

Put them under the broiler, set them on the second rack and set the timer for 8 minutes based on other reviews saying they took so long. After 3 minutes could smell them and shells were pink. Turned the pan and maybe 3 minutes later shells were starting to blacked so I pulled them and they were cooked perfectly. Left the meat inside the shell to cook also. Clearly depends on how close to the top you set your rack in the oven on the cooking time. Delicious!"

A few shakes each of dry spices on each cut lobster tail : powdered garlic, powdered onion and paprika with a drizzle of melted butter on each, about two tbsp total for four tails. Broil highest rack in the oven for 20minutes. Baste with juices from the pan and turn off the oven leaving the door open. Plated some spaghetti (dressed with olive oil, garlic, basil and Parmesan cheese) along with the lobster, just divine. Served with melted butter for dipping."

I used 6-7 oz lobster tails, cooked on second rack from bottom, oven on broil (I don’t have a degree on my broiler) i place day a skewer under lobster thru tail length wise while cooking to prevent curling. Leave lobster meat inside shell. I also used Old Bay Seasoning in place of paprika. Cooked mine for 12 minutes and was perfect!! I will definitely use this recipe again. Hope this helps others."

I melted the butter along with the following ... 1 minced clove of garlic, a 1/4 tsp of paprika and a 1/4 tsp of smoked paprika ... I wanted a slightly smokey, sweet flavour while not over powering the other flavours. Yes, the cooking time instructions are vague ... all I can say is, thank goodness for GOOGLE!! *** The rule of thumb is Broil 5-6 inches from the broiler on HIGH ... *** approximately 1.5 MINUTES PER OUNCE *** I had (4) 2 oz tails = 3 minutes but decided to add 2 more minutes for good measure ... for a total of 5 minutes and they turned out perfectly! ... tender and juicy ***Youtube is also a great reference on, How to remove the lobster meat from the shell, how to prep for broiling for the WOW factor !!... LOBSTER TAILS 101 is a good one. This will be a keeper for next year's Valentine's Dinner ."

If you split the tails press down on one side of the tail and then the other to separate the tail from the shell but not completely. This helps so you can pull the tail up over the shell. Great recipe!"

Once I cut up a whole chicken I didn't eat chicken for at least 6 months and vowed never to buy a full bird again. LOL Breaking the shell on my mini lobster tail was a little eww. Think I'll stick to the pros next time I have a hankering. All in all this recipe was great for my first time. Thank you."

BroIling in low setting on one level higher than the center rack of the oven was perfect. I checked the lobsters in every 5 minutes without opening the oven door. 3 large tails from CostCo which was 1 lb total, tasted perfect! Thanks for the skewer tip that kept them from curling up, and cleaning the vein/intestine that's on the top. I wouldn't have guessed to do that."

I agree with everyone else there should be a timer in the recipe like 1 minute for each ounce and more if cooking 4 or more tails at the same time. I've never had problems with shrimp or crab legs, but this made me nervous. I'll keep trying though until I get comfortable with it. :)"

The inside/bottom of the tail wasn't as done as the outside/top, but that could have been my oven. Ended up broiling for 15-20 actually. Not overdone or burnt, so was great! I also lift the tail meat out of the shell, keeping a bit intact at the end, and resting it over the shell for presentation. Love it!"
