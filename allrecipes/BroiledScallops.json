May experiment by adding black pepper, oregano and or dill."

"reviewBody": "This must be the simplest dish with the biggest payoff. Gourmet “fast food.” I only had a pound of scallops, so I added a half pound of shrimp and I would do it again for more interest. Perhaps even add a few clams for accent. And why only 2 tablespoons of butter? Add more! Why not use some real pressed garlic instead of garlic salt. It takes no time, and it’s so much better. So I melted the salted butter, garlic, lemon juice, and some red pepper flakes in a little pot, poured over seafood and mixed it throughout; I arranged seafood in individual gratin dishes, put the lightest sprinkle of fine Italian breadcrumbs over it. Comes out bubbling hot, goes from oven right to the table. I added fresh parsley at the end and a little cup of melted butter on each plate. A great company dish but simple enough for any day of the week. A keeper."

I brushed a large fry pan and the scallops with the butter mixture, put the scallops in the pan and dusted them with Old Bay. I saluted them 4-5 minutes on a side at medium to medium-high until golden brown. They were great!"

Just watch your broiler, as broilers tend to normally burn your food if you don't pay close attention. Try it! It's EASY EASY EASY!"

Remove the garlic before it turns brown, then add the scallops. Cook very quickly, remove to a serving dish, sprinkle with salt, the lemon juice and the pan drippings."

If your market only has scallops soaked in water, you can fix them by wrapping in a few layers of paper towels and gently squeezing the water out. A hot broiler is a must and keep the scallops about 2 inches from the flames. You should rotate the pan after a few minutes for even cooking."

Just something to think about as your planning."

Next time I will try infusing the butter with whole garlic cloves and then smashing the clove once it is soft. I think I will like the more subtle flavor with the delicate flavor of scallops."

All we had to do was get the scallops, and we had the rest at home.I recommend to save the extra sauce after the scallops have been broiled and serve it with rice on the side. It is also great with lion fish. These delectable scallops simply are better than any restaurant I've ever been to, and this is a MUST TRY AGAIN dish."

I used sea scallops, mixed the butter with the lemon juice, drizzled the scallops with the butter and lemon mixture and broiled 10 minutes. I rotated the pan about three times during the cooking process for even browning. After plating scallops, I drizzled them with melted butter. Absolutely delicious. This will be my go to scallop recipe because it is so simple and quick."

In stead of the garlic salt, I used 2 cloves of crushed garlic. Also pan seared for 3 minutes +/- per side until browned, instead of broiling. Served with easy rice pilaf....probably one of the best new dishes I have made. It is truly out of this world. PS add the pan drippings to the rice pilaf. Amazing. Thanks for posting."
