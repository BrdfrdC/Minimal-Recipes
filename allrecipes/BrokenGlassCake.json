I sure wish I had her expertise here, now, because my version of this recipe was a TOTAL DISASTER.\n I followed it to the letter, but I suspect something gets lost in the communication, . . . not with the original author's talents. It's not too bad-tasting, if you don't mind pouring in into bowls. I suspect the handling of unflavored gelatin is the culprit."

Was not needed. But, instead of a 9x13 pan, it was made in a mold, when she needed to unmold it, placed bottom of mold into warm water until it was able to unmold onto a plate. Placed a plate on open side of mold, turned it over to unmold onto the plate. Spectacular! Nobody has attempted to make it."
