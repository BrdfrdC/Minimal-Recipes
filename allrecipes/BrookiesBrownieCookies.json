I made a half recipe in an 8x8 pan and the cookie layer barely covered the pan but the ratio of cookie to brownie seemed to work. I had no trouble pressing the dough in the pan with my hands. If I make these again I will probably try using one less egg in the brownie as others have suggested for a fudgier texture and maybe add a touch more cocoa powder."

"reviewBody": "Mine turned out wonderful and I got compliments from so many people. That being said, I think the ratio of brownie to cookie dough is a bit off. The cookie dough was definitely way less dough than the brownie dough, which made it hard to spread across the entire 9x13 pan without gaps, and the cookie layer was very thin. It also took much longer to bake than stated (more like 35-40 minutes, not 20-25), and even then the toothpick still had a little brownie on it, but the edges were getting hard, so I just risked it and took it out which turned out fine. Overall a good recipe, I just think there's some things that need to be tweaked."

A perfect recipe no need to change a thing!\nHowever- I did brown the butter for the cookie layer, used only one egg in brownie layer(based on other reviewer comments), and used only 1/2 C chocolate chip (mini). Next time I will use 2 eggs as recipe says, for comparison. \nNo need to make extra batter as some suggested. Just spread out as best you can it will all come together during baking.

We added more cocoa powder and 2 tablespoons of oil and it made the texture much moister. Overall, texture was good but it wasn’t sweet enough. We dusted the whole thing with powdered sugar and it was perfect the second day. We’d recommend doubling on your own. It will fill a cookie sheet nicely."

Mine also had to bake a bit longer than the recipe, but all ovens work differently. I would also recommend waiting to put the chocolate chips in until the dough is in the pan because it is too hard to spread it out with the chocolate. Also, the cookie dough layer will probably seem very thin before baking, but it is supposed to look like that."

"reviewBody": "This is a great recipe. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of five was because of the cookie batter specifically. You would need to increase the ingredients for the cookies because, as you can see in the picture I posted, you can barely taste or see the actual cookie. You should increase the cookie batter by 50% (if that’s even possible ??). Otherwise this recipe could be sold and fetch the baker bucks! One more thing is that my 10 year old daughter made this for me while I was asleep and she had no problem. My family devoured it in minutes. The other downside was that it created a mess of dishes, but that was probably just because of the technique I was using."

Omg these are addictive and the so soft!!I've tried a couple pf others in my quest and they always turned out slight dry, too thick or something or another. This recipe is amazing. However I will be making a few changes next time upon others recommendations, first being the cookie dough spread on to the pan with a steel spoon without the chips and then pressing it in, (it was difficult to spread it in evenly, maybe even chill yhe dough slightly for 10 mins)"

I also lined the 9 x 13 pan with 1 solid piece of parchment paper before placing cookie dough in the pan. I then laid plastic wrap over the dough and used a small roller to even out the dough. It was the perfect amount to cover the bottom of the pan. Baked for 25 minutes at 350 degrees, they were done but not dry or hard. Cooled for 20 minutes and was able to lift them right out of the pan by picking up the edges of the parchment paper to finish cooling. Cut them into squares while slightly warm. We already ate a few! Fantastic!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe is absolute . It started out okay. Slid it in the oven, waited 20 minutes checked, waited 5 more minutes checked and it wasn't ready! Finally after 40 MINUTES, it still wasn't ready!! Like what? I added another 10 minutes, since some reviews said it took a longer. Waited and it still wasn't ready! I covered the top so it wouldn't burn and waited a few more minutes. Finally, I got absolutely tired of it. I decided to dump it on a cookie sheet, flatten it, and bake it. After 30 minutes, it baked! Waited for it to cool to try it and guess what? It tasted like absolute . You'd be better off buying store-bought cookie dough and brownie batter and clumping it to make a brookie."

"reviewBody": "This is by far one of the best dessert recipes I’ve ever baked. I made it exactly as instructed and ran into no issues having enough cookie dough to cover the 9 x 13 pan. Since the cookie dough was wetter than most recipes it spread quite easily. I would recommend whipping up the butter and sugar until it’s extremely fluffy to help with the spreading problem. The balance of brownie to cookie was perfect and not overly sweet. I usually tinker with recipes the second go round but I wouldn’t change a thing with this one. Excellent to take to work or a party. I did end up having to bake mine for 30 minutes instead of the suggested time. I originally made these for my husband to take to work but they were so delicious they never made it out of the house!"

The brownie layer was nice and fudgy. \n\nIncidentally, I think I overbeat the brownie batter with my Kitchen Aid--but the result was this amazing, hard \"coating\" on top that looked, felt, and tasted like chocolate fortune cookie.

Put the brownie layer on the bottom and drop little spoonfuls of the cookie dough all over the top until covered. Works much better because it removes the spreading problems referred to by other reviewers, it's easier to tell when it's done because you can judge the color of the cookie layer, and it just looks prettier in my opinion! I had to bake it for 30 minutes. The cookie layer was dark tan when it was done, almost brown."
