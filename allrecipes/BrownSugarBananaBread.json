I also add pinch of nutmeg and use dark brown sugar instead of light for a deeper flavour. I do find with my oven it may take longer than the required time though, so I make muffins instead for a shorter bake (17-20 min)."

"reviewBody": "This made very yummy banana bread. It was especially good heated up. The bread was pretty dense and moist, but very delicious, and the crust was soft and sticky. I would say maybe add some more spices, and maybe even more cinnamon. I think nutmeg might be a good addition. Very yummy, and was popular with my friends. It's good to use overripe bananas, and also I did not do the plastic bag mashing method I just put them in the bowl with all the other stuff and mashed them in there with a fork, and it turned out fine. I didn't want to waste the plastic. This might only work if the bananas are really overripe though. I also do not have an electric mixer, but it worked perfectly fine by hand."

"reviewBody": "The flavor is good, but “4 bananas” leads to a very inconsistent end product! (Some bananas are nearly twice the size of others.). Also, I have no idea who is able to bake this for only 40 minutes! At 40 minutes, the center portion of the bread was still visibly sticky! Even after 50 minutes, the center was still not done but the ends were almost overly done. I ended up turning the oven down to 250 degrees and leaving it in for 10 MORE minutes. The center was finally done, but the ends were over cooked so they got thrown away. Making muffins out of this recipe worked much better, but I just kept checking them and didn’t write down the total cooking time. Next time I will just use a different recipe."

Though the top of the bread in the middle was kind of gooey, not sure why.\n\nOverall it was fine, but I have made better banana bread."

I prefer a 9\" square baking pan over a loaf pan. It solves the problem of dry edges and a mushy center. This recipe was easy and the brown sugar sends it over the top. You could probably use less sugar, but I think it's good as is. The family loved it and asked me to make more right away, so I've made it 3 times in two weeks."

Because I took out so much sugar from the recipe I added about a 1/4c of unsweetened applesauce. The bread was moist and flavorful. It disappeared!"

At least 3 maybe 4 minutes. \nAlso, I used 1% milk because it was all I had. \nI added walnuts to the dough at the end by folding them in. I covered them with foil and they did rise quite a bit! so I took the foil off. After 10 minutes without, I put it back on because I didn’t want it to dry out. It took 3 or 4 times of me setting 10 more minutes and checking it but it turned out wonderful! I’m not a big baker and I’ve never made bread before either so I’d call this easy. \nI was going to give some to our neighbors but my husband won’t let me.

When the 40 minutes baking time was up, I checked it and the middle of it was still very \"soupy\". So I baked it 5 minutes longer. I did this twice more at 5 minute intervals and finally took it out of the oven as the sides were starting to get way too brown. Still tested wet in the middle. Set it to cool but after an hour the entire middle of the bread just sunk in. When it was totally cooled I removed it from the pan and cut it in half. Except for the very ends, the bread was like mushy oatmeal. Had to throw it out. The only thing I did differently was to use 2% milk instead of the whole milk. Such a shame. It smelled so wonderful when baking!"

Well it needs to be amended for cook time...it definitely takes more than 60 minutes! Now that I’ve read other reviews I see others have had the same issue. Unfortunately I mistook my bread to be finished and when I flipped it out of the pan a glob of uncooked dough slopped out of the bread! I somehow missed that spot when I tested with the toothpick. I will give it another try and automatically cook it to 60 minutes or more and hope it doesn’t burn on the bottom! Any tips or tricks? This so let me down...I definitely should have tested it better..."

After 90 minutes it came out and I had to saw through the outer crust to find a way too heavy looking finished product. The recipe is deficient in not stating the measurement of bananas. 4 could yield anything from 1 to 3 cups. My 4 yielded 2 cups and that was way too much. I packed the brown sugar because that is what I have never seen a recipe that said not to so that may have added to the problem. It's got a decent taste, but certainly not worth every trying again unless a lot of modifications were done and who has time for that?"
