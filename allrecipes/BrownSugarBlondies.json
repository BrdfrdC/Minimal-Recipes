I like how quickly it‚Äôs ready from start to finish. I made the recipe just as directed with 2 exceptions. Firstly, I sifted both my flour and my baking powder. I ALWAYS sift my dry/powdery ingredients. It‚Äôs how my grandmother taught me to bake. Secondly, I chose to add 1 cup of miniature semisweet chocolate chips in addition to the 1 cup of walnuts. They came out so rich, decadent, and chewy üòã! Note: I see that some people are claiming that their finished product came out like cake, not like brownies. Well, that definitely wasn‚Äôt the case here. Something must have been amiss. All I can suggest is to sift dry ingredients as I mentioned above, and hand mix all of these ingredients thoroughly together using a whisk."

I especially like that it uses melted butter so I can make it on the fly without having to wait for butter to reach room temperature. I didn't pack the brown sugar and may use 1-3/4 cups next time as they are plenty sweet. I used both chopped walnuts and about 3/4 cup of salted caramel baking chips. Mmmm Good!"

I think next time, I'll double the recipe and use a larger pan. These are not a thick bar using a 9x13."
