It worked well with this ham and made clean up easy."

An entire glazed ham - even 1/2 of one - would feed us for a month, with all of us tiring of it no matter how good. This recipe was just enough for the three of us with a bit left over for snitching.;) And it was every bit as good as a regular ham would have been without near the work and mess. Hooray."

"reviewBody": "Ok this way but with my family recipe additions I prefer it. Add powdered Keens or English mustard powder to your heat tolerance one half tsp is my preference and a splash of cider vinegar to taste like 1to2 tsps for 2 servings adjust depending on how much glaze you are making and how many ham portions you are doing of course. I like a bit of clove taste...3 whole cloves sweated into the to the glaze mix on low and remove them or a pinch of ground cloves to taste. Cuts the sweet but leaves it savoury flavour. Try this way for more punch tho Mom used the way you wrote it or just honey on her ham steaks when sauteing them."
