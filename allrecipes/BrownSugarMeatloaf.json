The initial sweetness of the bottom portion of the meatloaf was unexpected because meatloaf tends to be savory. I personally expected the sweetness because I made it, but the biggest complainer also added additional ketchup, which I feel adds additional sweetness, to cover up the taste. I think I would make this again without the brown sugar and ketchup. The more savory top of the meatloaf was really pretty good."

I used 1/3 cup brown sugar but instead of ketchup used El Pato hot tomato sauce, 2/3 cup milk and 2/3 cup of French fries onion since I didn‚Äôt have crackers. Everything else was same. This was the best meatloaf I have ever made - the juices served as a gravy over the mash potatoes and the hot sauce with the sugar was NOT overly sweet. And easy, easy, easy. Made right after work, walked the dogs while it baked for an hour and enjoyed a great meal with the family. Thank you for sharing!"

Instead of using an onion, i used a packet of onion soup mix and put the ketchup and brown sugar mixture on top of the loaf the last 15 min of baking. I know it was good since my husband ate almost the whole loaf in one sitting. We will def make this again."

My fiancee doesn't really care for ground beef but I couldn't stop getting her more. That was amazing. And then I had some 4\" cake pans and made them each mini loafs and added the glaze when it was all fully cooked. Turned the broiler on High and lightly burned the topping and we'll, um, I ate 4 of the 6. Great and easy recipe. especially when you have a kitchen aid dough hook doing all the work."

Since I am allergic to dairy I used plain, unsweetened almond milk instead of regular milk. I'm not sure if it is because I live in low elevations, but I find that it needs to cook for 1 hour, 20 minutes instead of 1 hour. This meatloaf makes its own topping sauce, which is really tasty! Once done Just be sure to remove the meatloaf to a platter, mix up the sauce in the pan and then use a spoon to scoop the grease off the top of the sauce."

I did add Worcestershire sauce and a whole cup of ketchup to the mix and added it to the top of the loaf. My ground meat mixture consisted of half beef half elk. I also baked the loaf in a 9x12 glass baking dish rather than a loaf pan. Everyone loved it and wants me to make it again."

It drives me a little crazy reading the reviews that people complain that the brown sugar and ketchup is on the bottom or they say they put it on the top. I wish there was a way for them to update the recipe to let people know AFTER COOKING, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO FLIP THE MEATLOAF OVER AND GET IT OUT OF THE PAN SO THE BROWN SUGAR IS ON THE TOP. \n\nsorry for the all caps. This is one of my favorite recipes and people love it."

"reviewBody": "First off, I have been making meatloaf for over 50 years, and this is the best one yet!!! I essentially followed the recipe, but I did make some minor changes. After reading other reviews, I added 1/2 cup green pepper and celery (because I like them), formed the meatloaf into a loaf, and baked it in an oven-safe skillet on top of a sliced onion. That kept the meatloaf away from the grease, while making it possible to drain off some oil to make gravy for mashed potatoes. Believe it or not, the onions were terrific! This is my new meatloaf recipe! Thank you very much for sharing it."

Just make the meatloaf, (I use crumbled bread instead of crackers &amp; I also add chopped bell pepper) bake it &amp; drain a couple times, 1/2 way thru Poke some holes in the loaf with the handle of wooden spoon &amp; pour 1/2 the sauce over top. (1/2 C brown sugar/1/2 c ketchup &amp; 1 tsp mustard) finish baking &amp; drain any remaining grease. Then put the rest of the glaze on top &amp; turn oven on low broil for a couple minutes. This makes the glaze gooie &amp; sticky. Delish"

I actually mixed the brown sugar into the beef and instead of ketchup i used bbq sauce mixed into the beef as well as coating the meatloaf with the bbq sauce for 15 minutes at the end of baking it. These changes made a huge difference for the better on the brown sugar flavor on the meatloaf giving that flavor in every bite."
