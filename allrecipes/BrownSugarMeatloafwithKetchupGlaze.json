I’d use less sugar in the glaze next time, although it was delicious as is. My husband said it was the best textured meatloaf he’s had. Made great leftovers the next day. I prepared it in the afternoon, covered the loaf pan with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge until I was ready to bake it. Let it set out on the counter while the oven preheated. Removed the plastic wrap and naked for an hour. Might try checking it at 55 minutes next time. Will make again!"

It tasted like candy was rubbed onto a loaf of ground beef mixed in onion and bread. That's what it was actually. My spidey sense told me it was going to taste really bland; should have gone with my super hero power. Just to give a sense of my cooking skills....I made a scratch 10 braid Challah the previous day. So I cut three slices, cubed, seasoned, salted, roasted, crumbed and those were my bread crumbs. I used all top shelf ingredients and followed the directions to perfection. No estimation. Anyways....a bland, weird recipe I just would not recommend."

I used gluten free breadcrumbs instead of croutons because we can't have gluten. I also used only egg white to cut the calories. I'm also tempted to try making it with ground chicken because I think it could work with this sauce."

Secondly I would put the salt in the meat and not in the sauce. The meat was bland and the sauce was salty. I would also scale back a little on the brown sugar perhaps to 1/3 of a cup."

In the future, I would cut back the salt; 1-1/2 tsp was WAY too much for our tastes. Although I typically like things less sweet these days, I did enjoy the glaze, the meatloaf was plenty moist, and this will make good sandwiches, too."
