I was craving brown sugar pie recently and since she's been dead almost 30 years, I couldn't ask her so I found this one. She rarely measured anything, but I can tell you if she made this it would have more like a tablespoon of flour than the teaspoon called for here and only about 4 Tb of butter. That is what I used after reading the reviews about it being too sloppy. I didn't have any trouble with mine making those changes. (Of course, she would have just thrown some flour in by hand and added a chunk of butter! I got as close as I could!)"

It puffed up in the oven and looked beautiful until it cooled. It decompressed and the top layer cracked. That was a sign. I refrigerated it over night. Cut it for dessert and it ran out of the shell over the plate. There is a thin layer on top that resembles chess pie but the liquid underneath does not set and tastes like raw caramel. If you make this bake much much longer than what's written."

Just make sure you have a really good pie crust recipe or just use a ready made one you find in the freezer section at your grocer's. He said this is just as good or better. Love it! Thank you!"

This is basically a dump recipe and can easily be done from start to finish in under an hour (if you have a pre-made pie crust!) The consistency of the filling is that exactly of the pecan pie, but without the pecans. Very rich, so you can serve smaller slices to cover more people. Also might try topping it with whipped cream and or chocolate sauce!"

All in all, a super easy recipe with great flavour and it impressed the dinner guests."

It's nice that the filling doesn't have to be cooked on the stove prior to baking (like some sugar pie recipes). I made this recipe with the No Roll Pie Crust II from this site and our grandmother's would be envious at how little time baking a pie from scratch can take....and still turn out great. The only thing I did that the recipe doesn't state is I put the pie in @ 400 on the bottom rack for 10 mins, then turned the heat down and placed the pie on the top rack for the remaining cooking time. That's just something I do for all my pies because it helps prevent a soggy crust."

I started daydreaming about chess pie. This recipe looked quick and simple, so I did the following:\n\n1. Substituted soy milk and butter-flavored Crisco for the milk and butter, respectively.\n2. Tossed a tortilla in the bottom of a pie pan, because I didn't have a pie crust handy and didn't want to make one. It turned out fine, just with a *very* thin crust, which is what I expected. I only tossed in the tortilla to protect the bottom of the filling while it baked.\n\n3. Made the recipe without any other changes.\n\nResults: Awesome! It's rich and wonderful, just what I wanted.\n\nHowever, it didn't set very quickly at all. After 40 minutes in the oven, I turned the oven off and left the pie in to see if that would help. \n\nI think it might be prettier if I'd chilled it after baking, and only cut into it when it was very firm.\n\nBut, all I was going for was yummy and easy to satisfy a selfish sweet tooth after Halloween, and this fit the bill perfectly."

I made my own crust (which I have never done before) and it came out great! Thanks for the recipe it was delicious I love brown sugar!!"

It hardened and it looks like liquified rootbeer candy or something. A nice dessert to satisfy my brown sugar cravings but I would never serve this to anyone because it looks horrible!"
