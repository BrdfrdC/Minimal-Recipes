"reviewBody": "This was so easy and so good! I just made it for breakfast, and it turned out creamy. If anything, I thought it could use a bit more milk to make it like \"loose oatmeal\" as the author states. It had a great flavor from the brown sugar, not too sweet for breakfast, but you could always add more to taste. My only issue was I think 1/2 tsp cinnamon is a bit much to sprinkle over the rice, so I just sprinkled a little and then after I took my picture, I incorporated all the cinnamon into the pudding. Thanks jajamillion-- I'll cook rice for breakfast this way again. *update- I made this before using Minute Rice. This time I used already cooked rice. The Minute Rice website states 1/2 c uncooked rice = 1 c cooked, so the full recipe would use 4 c cooked rice. I only had 2 c cooked, so I halved the recipe and added the butter. I ended up adding more milk because the pudding got too thick. Still turned out tasty. I definitely consider this a \"breakast rice pudding\" and not one I would typically serve for dessert, but a little more sugar may be enough for some to serve as dessert."

"reviewBody": "This did not turn out like rice pudding to me. Only change I made was using rice from the rice cooker and so I admitted the water. I am guessing, that only instant rice works in this rice pudding? The small amount of cornstarch never thickened the pudding. It was like plain rice with milk with very little flavor. I typically make rice puddings that are thickened with eggs or a vanilla pudding like cream mixture. Then, at the end the cinnamon amount was way too excessive. All I could taste was cinnamon and it turned the whole rice and milk a light brown color, which made it really not look like traditional rice pudding. This style of rice pudding unfortunately, is just not for me. I am rating it a 3, because I want to believe using fresh instead of instant rice was the main issue. Instant, must have a lot more starch. Still, like the rice puddings with the vanilla cream custard base better. The flavor was just not there for me, if even it was thick."
