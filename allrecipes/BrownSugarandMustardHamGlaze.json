I added salt &amp; pepper to taste, a little more mustard (spicy dijon deli style), a few dashes of liquid smoke, and a few tsps ground cloves. I wanted just a little sweet yet more smokey tasting ham. I used a basting brush &amp; basted this mixture on my ham. Wrapped it in heavy duty foil. Placed in disposable roasting pan. Some juice did leak out of the foil. But the finishing product tasted succulent. Very moist &amp; flavorful. A great balance of sweet &amp; smokey. Made a beautiful Veteran's Day meal for my Grandpa. He said it was one of the tastiest hams he has ever had. Thank you for this easy, versatile glaze!"

"reviewBody": "This was an easy to prepare glaze for ham, and I did make a variation (as well as using Dijon mustard as other reviewers have suggested). I used a small ham and a larger baking dish, and after glazing, some of the glaze slid to the bottom of the dish and stood a good chance of burning. My Mom suggested adding some orange juice to the baking dish, which I did (enough to cover the bottom) and not only did it prevent burning but it made a delicious sauce for the ham! Next time, the oj is part of the recipe for me."

It's exactly the right blend of salty and sweet, everyone at our dinner party LOVED it! I only made one adjustment, which was to add about 2 teaspoons of maple syrup, just because the original recipe wasn't quite liquidy enough to glaze the ham. Will definitely make this one again!!! :)"
