After 15 minutes in the microwave, I gave up and mixed a tablespoon of cornstarch with a tablespoon of cold water, whisked until smooth, added to the glaze, and microwaved for one minute on high. Worked like a charm. Two tablespoons of cornstarch would be better - my glaze was a little runny still. I skipped the fresh pineapple entirely, and dropped apple halves in the bottom of the pan halfway through cooking instead. They were delicious. I'll cover the ham with aluminum foil during cooking next time, it was a little dry."

Mix 2 cans of pineapple syrup with an entire bag of C&amp;h dark brown sugar, place pineapple slices stacked on top and on bottom of pan, pour sugar mix over top of pineapples making sure to evenly coat everything. We also serve the pineapple slices separate. I usually have to fix 2 of the large hams to feed my family of 8 and there's no leftovers."

I just put it on low heat and it did eventually thicken up. The glaze added a lot of depth to the ham and the leftovers reheated nicely. This was served with 'Easy Corn Pudding' from AR, and we had a terrific meal."

I usually use a boneless ham as I get grossed out by bones in any kind of meat. I also will use canned pineapple in pineapple juice if we don't have fresh pineapple. The only other thing I do differently is I put the brown sugar on the ham first then cook it then make more glaze and add it about an hour before done then again about 30 mins. later. I kind of tripple glaze the ham!! Great recipe!!"
