"reviewBody": "When the dough was so thick that I had to use my hands to mix it, I should have known this wouldn't be great. It was so thick that the outside is overly done and the center is still raw. Also, the math is a mess. Each half is only ONE tablespoon ? This is roughly a total of 58 ounces so I'm trying to figure out how this would only make 20 teeny tiny cookies? Searching for a better recipe."
