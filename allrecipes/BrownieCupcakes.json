Still tasted great, I highly recommend this recipe to any chocolate fiends looking for a fun recipe to follow :)"

We rent a home and I don't fully stock all the ingredients I keep in my pantry at home for just a month. We're heading for Sunday dinner at my daughter's home and I came across this simple but yummy recipe while looking for a dessert to make with ingredients I have on hand. I followed the recipe exactly and added about 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips. I love the crunchy tops of these cupcakes and the soft middle! If you're looking for a fudgy chocolate brownie, these won't do. But they're delicious with a more mellow chocolate flavor and I'll make them again! I did get 23 brownies from the recipe."

It was just awful I can’t even describe how awful it was just awful. I gave the keys to my mother just to make sure it wasn’t me but now she agrees it’s awful. I don’t know what’s with all these rave reviews saying it’s amazing obviously those people haven’t had chocolate in years. I’m sorry grandma Paige but you need to get out of the kitchen."

I didn't have enough to do all of them in large muffin cups so I ended up making 10 mini muffin size. I tested them first at 10 minutes and they were actually done at 15 minutes. These turned out cute! \nI agree with other reviewers that I'd like to have a boost in chocolate flavor next time. My thought is that next time I will stir some mini chocolate chips into the batter. ( I hate to mess around with the consistency by adding more melted chips or cocoa powder.) I am going to frost these with my granddaughter and decorate with dyed coconut and jelly beans to make little Easter Baskets for a cute dessert."

"reviewBody": "The first time I made these, I did add a pinch of salt and a large handful of really good quality mini chocolate chips before baking. I made half a batch and that made 8 delicious cupcakey brownies. I wondered what it would be like, the next time I made them, to make them without the cupcake wrappers. BIG MISTAKE! BIG, BIG MISTAKE!! They refused to come out of the cupcake pans resembling anything like a cupcake, just bits and pieces. I had to take a knife and scrape out the bits and BITS of brownie cupcakes.\n\nNOTE TO SELF! Next time, make sure to use cupcake wrappers and don't even think of trying to not use the wrappers!!\n\nThey were delicious and super yummy the first time I made them and thought a scoop of good vanilla ice cream would really enhance them."

I followed the recommendation of others and added a pinch of salt. Instead of baking regular sized cupcakes, I made mini cupcakes. I baked for 10 -11 minutes, that's when the toothpick came out clean. The half recipe made 36 mini cupcakes. They were delicious and perfect snack size. I would definitely make these again!"

"reviewBody": "QUICK NOTES: • use dark chocolate • use less sugar • make full size brownies not mini ones FULL COMMENT: I made this recipie in mini cupcake tins. About the batter: The batter was a good consistency but personally I would have added less sugar because it was too sweet for my liking and I would recommend using dark chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet for an extra chocolatey taste that I think these brownies were lacking. About the cupcake: The mini brownie cupcakes took almost the same amount time to bake as the recommended time for the regular size, and when one of the batches came out it still did not look done. After all of the brownie cupcakes cooled down they had really crumbly looking tops and when I bit into them they were rock hard on the top and oddly soft in the center."
