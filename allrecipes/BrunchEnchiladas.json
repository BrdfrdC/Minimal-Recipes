Used 6 eggs, 1.25c of heavy cream and 1/2cup of almond milk and water to bring it to 2 cups total. Combination of cheese that was in the fridge. Will definitely make again!"

I tried to roll the tortillas tightly, but the liquid didn't completely cover them, which I read in other reviews was a problem with no solution. I had to bake them 70 minutes until they were set. The end result was okay, but kinda plain and I would've preferred something else. I brought it to a potluck that had 20 attendees and I took half of it home, so it was a mediocre sell there as well. would skip it."

I didn't mince my ham,cut it in tiny cubes and added small dice peppers, cumin, lime juice, jalapeños, and cilantro the ham mixture. I also blended the egg mixture really well and added about a tablespoon of cholula as well as salt and pepper and some cheese. I would advice the addition of foil about half through the baking time. That was increased to about an hour and ten minutes, just to make sure all the egg cooked through. Would definitely make it again."

Tore up corn tortillas, put half on bottom, then sausage mixture, then other half of tortillas. I used milk because it's what I had, and 6 eggs. Pour over casserole and let sit overnight. I used an 8x11 dish and it filled it perfectly, but took 2 hours at 350 to bake. . I'll be making this again!"

They weren't totally covered with the egg/cream mixture but were in pretty deep. I cooked them with foil until the last ten minutes when I added cheese on top. Since there were vegetarians at the event I was going to, I filled the enchiladas with a mixture of carmelized onions, thawed frozen country hash browns and grated cheddar cheese. I used flour tortillas. They were fantastic. They disappeared from the buffet table. They were easy and tasted incredible."

"reviewBody": "Omgosh, these are sooo yummy! For the filling, I used a combination of ham, half a can of refried beans, half a can of pinto beans, half a small can of green chilies, half a small can of jalepeno peppers, and an tomato/onion/pepper blend found in the produce section at my local grocer. I used monterey jack cheese inside the filling and used the cheddar for the topping. I spread some salsa over the burritos before adding the cheese. This could totally be a vegetarian dish if you want to omit the ham. If you modify this recipe with the ingredients I used, this will be a mexican dish packed with flavor a hint of a kick. The half and half/ egg mixture provides such flavor and creamy goodness."

I used corn tortillas because they aren't as filling as flour, I love these things! I topped them off with deseeded and minced jalapenos. Make sure you cover all the tortillas or they will get hard while baking. So good!!! Instead of putting the corn tortillas in hot oil to soften, you can run them in simmering chicken broth."

I fried 4 slices of bacon almost done then added onions to pan after some time added canned potatoes(diced),diced ham and some mushrooms then 1 can green chilies. scrabbled 7 eggs with milk and cheese and some taco seasoning poured over all this and cooked till eggs were set. I used the (as someone suggested)recipe for 10 minute enchilada sauce. used reg flour it worked fine. put a TLB of sauce on tortilla, egg filling ,grated cheese ,top of spring onions chopped and baked as directed. Now this was some mighty fine eating. I would have to give myself a 5 star..."

"reviewBody": "Updated 2/17/2015: My version of this recipe is a real hit with family and friends. I replace the ham with 1/2 pound each of cooked sage or country style sausage and chorizo sausage. Instead of green bell's, I use red bell for the sweetness and add 1/2 cup of chopped roasted mild green chilies. For my taste, I would add jalapeno's, but since most of my friends and family have a tame palate, I leave the hot stuff on the side. I also replaced the cheddar with a Mexican cheese blend. You could also use oaxaca or asadero cheese in this recipe. I add an extra egg (6 eggs total). For seasoning, I add 1/2 tsp of kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper (to taste), and a \"special\" ingredient...1/2 tsp smoked paprika. The paprika goes very well with the chorizo and adds a bit more smoke flavor. Also, if you really want to turn up the flavor, make your own tortillas! \n\nThanks for this recipe DBLUNCK!"

I took the back of a spoon and pushed down till egg mixture moistened the enchalidas. They were fine but the next time I will make one and half the egg portion. The taste was really excellent and and different than the usual sausage fare everyone makes. Good for Christmas breakfast that can be put together ahead."

I think some green chili's would have been really good as well. Do let these sit overnight as that is what appears to thicken the sauce up. I didn't, and they had to bake longer than the recipe states."

I made very few changes: I doubled the liquid mixture so that it completely covered the tortillas/enchiladas as another reviewer suggested, substituting green onions for a small yellow onion instead. Adding this additional liquid mixture was definitely a must! But because of this, more liquid to cook, I ended up keeping it in the oven probably another 30-45 minutes. Also, I put a ton of cheese on top and baked after that for about 10-15 minutes instead of the cook's suggestion for only 3. This was really very good and we will definitely make it again! Thank you so much for such an easy, crowd pleasing meal! It was incredible!"

"reviewBody": "I made these with my leftover ham from Thanksgiving. I heeded the other reviewers and covered while baking the first 45 minutes. I also added frozen peas. I seasoned the meat/green onion/pea mixture with cumin, white pepper, salt and cracked pepper (I was conservative because it was for a church brunch but will be more liberal next time). I made sure to cover the tortillas with the cream/egg mixture while soaking and cooking. I added another egg and more cream/milk to make sure it was covered. Also, I think it's important to grease the dish - if you don't they might stick b/c of the eggs. It actually turned out pretty and tasted pretty good. I like my food spicy so I am sure when I make it again it will be better - I didn't not add the hot sauce - that would have been delicious I think. A perfect brunch dish. My dish was empty when I left church so I think it was a hit. I also served it with sour cream and \"On the Border\" brand salsa. Thanks for the recipe!"

(I didn't process the ham though, I only chopped it because pureed ham seems weird). Sausage or hashbrowns would also taste great in the tortillas as would mushrooms. These could work like an omelete, you could add or take things out based on personal taste. I plan on serving these for Christmas breakfast. They look and taste fantastic. One piece of advice, don't try to cram too many tortillas in the pan, this will cause them to not lay flat in the pan, which will lead to them not be submerged enough in the egg mixture and then the tortillas will harden."

Instead of ham (didn't have any on hand) I fried up some scrapple. The scrapple made the enchilada. I will definitely make this again. I am gonna maybe use sausage next.
