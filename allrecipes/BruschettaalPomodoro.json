Something that makes the recipe absolutely heavenly is adding fresh mozzerella in with the diced tomatoes, salt, and basil, and tossing together before spooning onto the bread to bake. I recommend using a crusty bread for this recipe so that the tomatoes don't make the bread soggy. DON'T let it set out before cooking. Make sure you watch the time carefully. Just as it is turning golden brown edges, that's when it is the most succulent."

Only thing I did differently was add a bit more salt/pepper and another clove of garlic, but that is just because I like saltier foods. If you enjoy wine I discovered a Malbec by Alamos an Argentinian company worked very well with this recipe."

"reviewBody": "I don't even have to try this recipe because it is exactly how I make mine. Poeple tell me it ROCKS.\nFor the bread part though, I cut french bread thin and brush both sides with olive oil and broil it. You have to watch it closely as it will get brown too fast.Turn the bread over and brown the other side as well.\nThe bread can sit overnight in a closed bag if you have to let it wait. It will stay nice and crunchy. After you spoon the tomato on top of the pieces of bread, we don't broil it but if you do you can also sprinkle a few shreds of mozzerella cheese and melt it. It really does ROCK."

I gave the toasted bread a rub with one of the garlic cloves, then minced it and added it to the tomato mixture. Oh, i also added fresh oregano from our garden!! The taste is amazing, the toasted bread, fresh tomatoes and garlic combine to perfection.... THANX FOR THIS RECIPE!!!! Ada, you're an artist"
