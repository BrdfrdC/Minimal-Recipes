I did make a few adjustments, I used regular french bread, I used the tips posted from a few other Allrecipes cooks. Then, just fine tuned it to my tastes. I added more olive oil &amp; a bit more cheese, I used garlic powder &amp; minced garlic(as posted by another) I also toasted the bread after brushing it with the oil. Added more black pepper too. It is a really good recipe, thanks for sharing it Susan!"

Second: I added two tablespoons of garlic powder. Third: I brushed the bread with olive oil, put a slice of mozzarella on top and baked them until golden brown, then I added the tomato mixture on top unbaked. Like regular bruschetta. It was delicious."

The only thing I'd change would be to toast the bread in the oven a bit before adding the cheese and tomato...my bread was still a bit soft after the 7-10 minute cooking time. I also used a very thin French baguette, so one slice of Roma tomato over the cheese and spices worked perfectly. Also, my friend suggested including a side plate of vinegar for dipping, and I think I'll try that in the future."

The only thing I disagree with is the amount of olive oil, you will need more than a tbs otherwise it is great! Oh and we cooked it on the grill outside. I just put the slices on foil, set it on the top shelf ,on low heat and closed the grill. Turned out great but watch it close."
