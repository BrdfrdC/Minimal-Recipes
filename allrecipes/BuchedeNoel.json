For me, it was too much dark chocolate, but my husband and a few others who are chocolate fanatics just loved it, so it was a success at Christmas! I used some Rosemary sprigs along the \"logs\" (I made 2) as a decoration and it looked very festive. I felt they stuck to the parchment paper, and it did not turn out even like the video. I have made other rolls before (pumpkin roll), and it's always turned out even. The eggs seemed to make it rise out of control! When it settled back down, it was better, but not even all over. I will try this again, because it's challenging and tasted very good!"

I've made many Yule Logs throughout the years using different recipes, but I will not be using this one again. The cake itself is incredibly thin, with little flavor, and the filling far too runny. It's still servable, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it. Not trying to make this review overly harsh, but let me put it this way- in my almost ten years of being an avid baker, this is the first time I've been compelled to write a bad review."

Not sure what the cure for this is but I was able to roll the imperfections to the bottom/sides and then I sprinkled the top with shaved chocolate and powdered sugar. No one was the wiser and it looked beautiful plated and of course tasted wonderful - not too sweet. Next time, I will try baking it longer (the center was very poufed), and possibly letting it cool a bit longer before inverting. Another option is to roll it loosely instead. I rolled it kind of tight and immediately after taking it from the oven."

"reviewBody": "TOTAL NIGHTMARE!!! The recipe called for “heavy cream”. The problem with this is that heavy cream is different in the US,Australia, the UK, Canada etc. Where I live, heavy cream is anything above 14% MF, so I used 18%MF. Well what a drippy horrible mess! The recipe should have called for “whipping cream” or “ 33%MF +”. As well, like a lot of people said, my cake turned out terribly. It would not roll. See the picture. I do not recommend this recipe even if you use whipping cream. Definitely use a different recipe which is what I’m going to do next time! Waste of time. We did have a great laugh though.... :)"

"reviewBody": "My 9-year old daughter and I - neither of us very experienced bakers - made this over the holidays and were quite pleased with the final result! We followed the video and the written directions and found it pretty straightforward. We made one modification - we added fine coconut and mini chocolate chips to the mousse-like filling - made it extra yummy and gave it a bit more texture. Coming out of the oven, the cake did stick to the parchment paper, resulting in some severe cracks in the roll. Not sure what we should have done differently. We did put a bit of shortening on the parchment paper to avoid just that, but were sadly unsuccessful. We decided to put some melted chocolate to cover up the mess - and I think it actually turned out even better! (We just melted chocolate chips with a bit of shortening.) It created a super tasty shell over the cake, giving it a more log-like appearance. We had a distanced gathering with neighbors in the backyard to share our creation and it was an all-round huge hit! will definitely try this again!"

"reviewBody": "The cake is fabulous - as others have said, just make sure to beat the heck out of the yolks! I used the top setting on my mixer for 5-6 minutes. The cake needs the loft that extra air will give. The baking timing is right on - don't leave it in too long. Wrapping in a silicone sheet, then carefully scraping along the back with a spatula when unrolling it, was key. Used the ganache recipe from this site for filling and frosting, then a very cool technique for the bark: spread a thin layer of melted chocolate over a piece of parchment paper, roll it up tightly (doesn't matter what direction), refrigerate til solid, then unroll. The chocolate will break into shards. Work quickly adding it to the ganache frosting - your finger temp will melt the chocolate. Then meringue mushrooms were added. The marzipan snail is my daughter's fabulous addition. \nI'll never use another cake recipe for our buche. This is great!!"

My oven runs hot, so I took it out after 10 minutes but it may have been slightly under, which might be why it collapsed so much. Fortunately, I used all the filling, which made it turn out big enough. Other reviews say there is plenty of filling to do the outside, but I think you need to use it all inside. I followed the directions, including reviewer suggestions to beat the yolks for 5+ minutes. I melted some chocolate chips with cream to very loosely paint the outside to create the bark look. It was light and delicious and I would definitely make it again as it looked fantastic!"

I can see myself using the same batter and filling recipe to shape as a bouche, or turned into a round or square cake with 3 layers (with different baking times and potentially scaling up the recipe by 25-50% for that purpose)"

"reviewBody": "This was a beautiful addition to our Christmas table! Very easy and the mixer does all the work of whipping egg yolks and whites! I was worried it would be heavy but it was anything but. I only gave 4 stars because the recipe- as written- doesn’t include the tips that make the recipe successful. \nI followed other reviewers’ advice and made sure to beat egg yolks for 5+ mins, the same for the whites. I lined the pan with parchment and greased it. The cake rose a bit while baking but- like a soufflé, which it pretty much is- it ended up falling when it came out. I hoped it would keep some of that volume, but it didn’t. It was flatter than I expected. \nThe whipped cream frosting made about 2x more than you need for this recipe. I frosted the outside with it, too, and still had a ton leftover. I’d cut that in half next time. \nThe cake itself is pretty low calorie, compared to others. It didn’t have any oil or butter and had a small amount of sugar. The bulk of the calories come from the icing, which is light and fluffy and not too sweet.\nI decorated with sugared rosemary and cranberries, and some chocolate curls."

Overall pretty easy to do, I sprayed parchment paper really well, was very liberal on the powdered sugar on the tea towel. I followed the tip to beat the yolks &amp; sugar 5 minutes, took cake out of pan after 5 minutes. \n\nI used Christmas picks to decorate, I hate meringue so didn’t want to do the mushrooms. Also found some candy snow flakes at the store &amp; used those as well. Powder sugar on top. Very pretty, flavor was amazing. Love the whipped cream frosting which I will use on other cakes. Overall I’m really happy! Oh &amp; ignore the toothpicks in the cake pic, I was using to hold foil off the frosting &amp; forgot to take them out."

It always brings back sweet memories of our time living in France and the beautiful bouche de noel's in the windows of the bakeries at Christmas. It's authentic and the recipe is a homerun. I do not do more than sprinkle powdered sugar on top instead of frosting and garnish the plate with fresh raspberries or cranberries and perhaps rosemary. Frosting is not needed for flavor since the filling is so creamy and rich. Joyeux Noel et Bon Appetit!"

When I unrolled it they crumbled off into a nice bark which I scored with a toothpick. I also made mushrooms out of fondant and dipped them in cocoa powder for \"dirt\" The cakes came out beautiful and I plan on making them every year now."

"reviewBody": "I only used a quarter of a cup of cocoa in the whipped cream and it worked great. Save about 1/4 the cream filling for the “frosting” on the outside . Also I saved a big step by just using the parchment to roll it up. I had brushed melted butter on the pan and then on the parchment. I left the cake in the pan to cool for about 20 minutes then rolled it and let it sit for about an hour. I then unrolled it, filled it, and rolled it up again right off the parchment. A few chocolate shavings and icing sugar and it was done."

I made the mushrooms out of fondant and made \"bark\" out of some melted chocolate chips, vegetable oil, and creme de mint. My family could not stop talking about it, and ate the entire thing!!"

My family can't get enough however my daughter is gluten free but doesn't like chocolate so I may try this vanilla and spread some fruit preserves and then the cream filling. We will see how it works out."

"reviewBody": "Incredible!!! Follow the others advice to beat the yolks for five minutes and it turned out light and fluffy and delicious! I made the bark by spreading a small thin layer of chocolate bark on parchment paper then loosely rolling it up and putting in the refrigerator and when it unravels it breaks into little pieces which I attached to the log with more melted chocolate. I also made this with the meringue mushrooms. Rave reviews!"
