I use 30% sunkist, 10% Hawaiian punch, 15% dollar store pink lemonade 15% Tropicana orange-pineapple 20%everclear (or vodka if you want a weaker drink) and 10%Malibu rum. DELICIOUS"

I used tang for the orange drink, V8 fruit medley for the fruit punch, simply pink lemonade and simply oj with pineapple juice. Also used Bacardi pineapple. It was so good! Not too strong just the right amount of yum!"

"reviewBody": "I would give this 7 stars out of 5 if that was at all possible. I am a junior in college, and using this recipe, we threw two INSANE parties that drew incredible numbers of people. This is what we used:\n\n3 Gallons of Tampico Orange drink\n3 1.8 qt. cartons of Minute Maid Berry Punch\n6 qts. Newman's Own Pink Lemonade\n3 1.8 qt. cartons of Dole Pineapple-Orange juice\n5 handles of Rubinoff Vodka (we're college students, we're broke)\n\nWe did away with the white rum altogether, seeing as how it's expensive and low in alcohol percentage.\n\nThis recipe was enough to feed 50+ mouths with multiple cups, and everybody absolutely loved it and have been literally begging us to make it a weekly thing. Absolutely cannot stress enough how amazing this mixture is; 2 solo cups' worth will have any person with a normal alcohol tolerance pretty buzzed. Again, 7 stars. Awesome."

"reviewBody": "Waaay more affordable than the real Jungle Juice. We mixed the alcohol with some melon balls and sliced kiwi the night before and put it in the freezer to chill then added the juices and soda just in time for the party to start. You still may want to provide ice nearby as it was closer to warm later on in the evening. If the recipe is followed exactly you will have a punch that is very close to 8% ABV (or about the equivalent of two lite beers per 12oz cup). Add a 750mL bottle of Everclear to bring it up to 10.5% ABV. Very tasty!"

Taste like an adult version of a fruity tropical punch. Very adaptable to tweeks. If in mixed company of adults and children mix up the juice in one container and mix the alcohol in another and let the adults add the alcohol mix to their drink to their taste."
