"reviewBody": "Really great sandwich recipe! I usually have Buffalo sauce on hand but I am out ðŸ˜® so had to use Franks Red Hot. Made on a panini press vs grilling like a grilled cheese- which was a fun twist! This panini method takes longer but when itâ€™s just for two; totally fine! Dipped the finished sandwich in ranch and/or more blue cheese dressing. Super fun, easy and great weeknight dinner! I would recommend thinly sliced red onion but husband disagrees. Thanks Chef Mo!"
