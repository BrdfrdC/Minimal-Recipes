You'll be able to pop a minimum of 10 freezer portions or several big containers in the freezer.\n\nRegarding the recipe, amazing, so freaking good. I accidentally used too much blue cheese but I can barely notice. I'm not sure how to make a smoother, less gritty sauce. I cooked on a very low temp and added my cheese very slowly but there's still a mild grit texture you don't find in processed Mac n cheese.\n\nOtherwise so tasty and good. 9/10"

Only modification I made was I end up adding 2 entire cups of Frank’s because I like it hotter. I could barely taste the heat with only 1/2 a cup. Blue cheese helps it cool down, but still needed lots of water while eating. Great recipe!"

I had a lot of extra sauce so I ended up boiling another cup of noodles, so total of 3 cups of noodles for this recipe. The sauce wasn't too thick as some others mentioned, but since it will thicken as it cools from the cheese, it did thicken up. Not a problem for us, we loved it. Highly recommend this recipe."

I recently found McCormick's Buffalo Wing seasoning packets that I add to the shredded chicken to give it an extra kick. Add seasoned panko on top for some texture and crunch!"

"reviewBody": "This was absolutely delicious, a comfort food that’s so good I can’t feel guilty having seconds. I did make a couple of changes but I’m sure it’s great the way it is too! I substituted diced chicken breast for rotisserie, half of the shredded cheese for about 6 slices of Land O’ Lakes White American (I love how creamy it makes the sauce!). I also finished it off in the oven at 350 with a Panko bread crumb topping (About a cup Panko to 2 Tblsp melted butter, mixed and spread evenly over the top) for about 15-20 minutes. Broil for a few minutes to brown if needed but don’t overcook! Also I left out the Gorgonzola since no one else in my house cares for it but I’m sure it would be delicious baked on top!"

The only changes I've made are decreasing the amount of hot sauce, as my mom has a low spice tolerance, and using less gorgonzola because my brother doesn't like it. I also take out the chicken sometimes if I'm having my vegetarian friend over for dinner, and it's perfect! An amazing dish for everyone, and easy to fit everyone's needs."

"reviewBody": "This was a nice easy recipe. However, I made a few changes. First of all, I used penne pasta. This was mainly because I like penne pasta, but it also makes this easier to eat with a fork. I also think the rotisserie chicken idea is just bizarre. Come on people, use 1 lb. of chicken breast cut into 3/4\" cubes and saute separately. Mix the chicken into the sauce when the sauce is done. Mix it into the pasta. Pour the whole thing into a 9x13 casserole dish. Sprinkle crumbled blue cheese on top (cheaper and easier to find then Gorgonzola). On top of that sprinkle bread crumbs of your choice. And on top of that, sprinkle a little shredded cheddar. Heat in oven on 350 for about 10-12 minutes. Perfect!"

I used chunky bleu cheese dressing rather than the actual bleu cheese. I also used about a half cup of pasta cooking water to thin the sauce a bit. It makes a lot, and is quite filling.
