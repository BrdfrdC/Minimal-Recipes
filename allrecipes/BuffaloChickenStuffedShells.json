I think this would be better as a casserole dish than a stuffed shell but was fun trying. Thanks anyways."

I mixed that in w the chicken/ricotta just before stuffing the shells (so after it sat in fridge to set.) As a test, I put a few tiny crumbles of bleu cheese on top of some of the shells. Came out great. If you love bleu cheese, you could even mix a little bit in with the ricotta. I just didn't want to overpower it."

I was very excited to have this for dinner because I love anything Buffalo chicken. I was kind of disappointed because I felt that I was eating buffalo chicken dip with a fork straight from an appetizer dish. It was too rich as a dinner item. The flavor was very good but my husband, who is also an \"anything Buffalo chicken\" kinda guy, also thought it was too rich as a meal. He suggested to try it again using some ziti pasta and cook it like a baked ziti and add some mozzarella in addition to the other cheeses. I will definitely use the ingredient combination again except that I will try the ziti instead of stuffing shells."

I couldn’t find “whipped” ricotta so I used regular (with no draining) and only used 1/2 cup of the Franks because I am not huge on spicy food. And I only used about 1/2-3/4 of the cheddar Monterey Jack blend. My boyfriend loves spicy food so I made it more for him, but even I loved it - and even he felt the “kick” was strong enough for his liking. I only used 12oz of pasta shells and there was still not enough filling for all the pasta shells, so I tossed the rest, but it still made an entire 13x9 dish full of shells. We have enough for leftovers tomorrow. Great, delicious recipe."

I also put some of the shredded cheese, like 1/2 cup in the buffalo mix. I then put cheese on top and brushed The filled shells with light blue cheese dressing. Still fairly bland. It's missing the creaminess of the buffalo chicken dip or something. I'd either add some cream cheese, ranch seasoning, or SOMETHING else into this that goes in buffalo chicken dip to make it flavorful and more creamy."

"reviewBody": "My boyfriend loves this recipe. I catch him going back to the fridge all night to squirrel away \"bites\" (one while shell). My daughter and I thought the recipe was just ok. The second time I made it I incorporated tiny tiny broccoli florets into the mix for more flavor and texture diversity and added drizzles of homemade ranch on top of the shells along with the cheese prior to baking. Just before serving, I added more drizzles of homemade ranch along with extra dashes of hot sauce and some chives and parsley. Really brightened up the flavor and made it taste more fresh. I'll continue making this since it's a hit for the boyfriend."

I double the meat and ricotta cheese and 3/4 of them I added Frank's Hot Sauce and the other 1/4 added some zucchini split lengthwise, boiling , then cubing them into ricotta mixture. I cut down on calories and did not add the butter. I did not find filling to be dry at all and cheese, chicken and hot sauce mixed well without the butter.\nWe will make this again"

Sauteed some onion and celery to add to chicken mix. Used a 12oz bottle of hot sauce. Made enough to feed 5 and have leftovers. This was so good!!! Thanks!!!"

Also, I did not chill the ricotta mixture in the fridge at all, and I oiled the baking dish, because I think cooking spray is gross. My husband and I both LOVED these; the flavor was amazing. There was not enough filling for the entire 12 oz. package of shells. Next time, I will double the chicken and add spinach. If you are prone to heartburn, take a pill before eating these."

Some veggies or beans could help bring it out.

"reviewBody": "As we live an hour from Buffalo on the PA border, I love the idea of another Buffalo chicken recipe. I am not a fan on ground chicken, but it wasn't awful. Shredded boneless, skinless breast will be a good alternative for next time. The filling made enough for the entire box of shells and I used the Frank's buttery wing sauce as it's closer to actual \"wing flavoring\". I was concerned the shells would be crunchy without sauce coverage, so I brushed a touch of the sauce of the edges of each shell. I see in other reviews it wasn't necessary, but we like spicier food, so the additional sauce was welcome! I used Mozzarella as I was out of the Monterey Jack; I suppose any cheese would suffice depending on your preference. Overall, a good recipe to make again."

"reviewBody": "What a great idea, melding shells with buffalo chicken. Made a few revisions to make the dish a bit healthier: used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and added frozen chopped spinach to have a vegetable involved. I didn't squeeze the moisture out of the cottage cheese, just tossed it in. I did drain the spinach though. Rather then 3-4 hours I let the mixture sit over night, made the shells the next day for lunch. Used texans buffalo sauce and cut the butter in half. My husband says it's a top 10. This is certainly a keeper and the cottage cheese substitution saves hundreds of calories. Avoids that \"brick-like\" feeling from very rich foods."

These were easy to make, though I did have more shells than filling, so I'd rec boiling 1/2 a box of shells. Despite using regular \"Frank's (R)\", these were a bit too warm for Mr. LTH, but I found the heat to be quite mild. I wasn't a big fan of the chicken chunks (but I don't really love chicken, anyway), so I think I'd prefer them w/shredded chicken (BLSL). I agree w/the submitter that these would make a nice party appetizer! I was concerned about the lack of a sauce and that the shells would harden/turn rubbery, but I worried for naught! THANKS for the recipe!"
