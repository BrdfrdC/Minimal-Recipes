(It's good to dry them off a little before putting them in the hot Crisco otherwise it spatters everywhere.) After frying, I painted this sauce on them and let them stay in a 200-ish degree oven until we were ready to eat. My husband and my friends raved over them!"

I only made one change - I did not simmer wings in sauce after they were fried - toss the wings in the sauce. If you let them simmer, they become soggy. Who likes soggy wings! Without the simmering in the sauce, these wings have great flavor and are nice and crispy! I will be making these for the big game today! GO PATS!"

First never use butter always margin. Butter will separate into heavy fats and light. and you can always add more hot sauce go easy at first and preferred is Franks red hot. Know your hot sauce! 3rd drain your wings out of the fryer on cookie sheet lined with parchment and cake cooling rack ( think reheating). Season to personal tastes I add a pinch of granulated garlic and a dash or two of Worcestershire."

The flour thickens the sauce nicely and makes it take on this exciting red/orange color. I've also experimented with different herbs and spices. I use Frank's Red Hot for the main hot sauce."

Only difference I made in the recipe is I brined the chicken wings in salt and pepper water for an hour and then I cooked following the directions. These were so good my son and I are probably going to finish all 24 pieces today. Easiest recipe in the world. Now to find a good blue cheese dip recipe."

As far as the rest of the procedure went (for my records, sorry) went ahead and baked earlier in the morning, then when it came time to eat, tossed in sauce and ran under the broiler. Came out nice and juicy and not dry at all (big fear). Thanks so much for recipe! Oh - I did only simmer for about 5 to 8 minutes as I was worried about the spiciness. Next time go to 15 minutes or so........"

I put all the wings in a large bowl and poured the sauce over to coat. Much cheaper than take-out and just as good, if not better! Thanks for the recipe!"

After deep frying the wings I added the following sauce: Melt Butter and add finely chopped garlic and a couple of pickled capsicums (finely chopped). Fry for a while until fused in the butter. Add some ketchup and Bajan Hot pepper Sauce – I used Aunt Mays Bajan Pepper Sauce – let it bubble and add the wings and turn to low heat … Came out kinda with a sticky spicy kick… Did not take a picture – sorry."

They closed down so I came here looking for a recipe &amp; this was the best one, So I made this one &amp; added 1 tsp. of Garlic Powder and 5 tbsp. of Ranch Dressing, \"Remove from heat before adding the dressing\", then toss over the wings. I like mine crispy, so I don't simmer the wings in the sauce. I took these wings to a friends house for a football game, Everyone was bringing wings, and mine were the best, they were gone first, Everyone loved them."

"reviewBody": "We love these wings! They're our new favorite - even better than what we get at most restaurants! A couple of tips that helped us: the longer you simmer the sauce the spicier it gets. So if you like hotter wings, let the sauce simmer for 30 minutes or longer. Second, my husband likes his buffalo wings crispy, not soggy. To achieve that, he fries the wings separately in a deep fryer, then sets them aside in a bowl. Once the sauce has finished simmering, he pours the sauce over the wings in the bowl and mixes the wings around to coat evenly. It produces crispy and tasty wings every time."

Secondly, I added a dash (1/2 teaspoon) of worschestershire sauce. Also, I used Franks hot pepper sauce (5 tablespoons) not to be confused with hot sauce. I added approx 4 tablespoons of Louisana hot sauce. Put sauce in a bowl when wings were hot of the grease, added them to the bowl and shook them. They were DELICIOUS! *dont overcook sauce as it will seize up, even if it does...can still be used as long as the wings are piping hot)"

"reviewBody": "If you want to reduce the amount of fat and have equally tasty wings, steam the wings for ten minutes, refridgerate for one hour, and then bake for 20 minutes at 400 degrees. Then turn the wings over and bake for 20 minutes more. There is no need to simmer the wings in the sauce. If you want them to be hotter, just adjust the sauce to butter ratio. These wings, steamed and baked, are even crispier than the fried version and very good! Also, there is little need to add extra vinegar. The hot sauce is almost all vinergar anyway. It is better if the extra is omitted."

The texture and the flavor were out of this world! I liberally salted the wings before I added them to the oil and didn't need any in the sauce. We're very mild-type people, so I took the suggestion to use Louisiana hot sauce and I only simmered it for about 5 minutes. Unfortunately, I'm not sure how much hot sauce I actually got into the pan as I just kind of nervously eyeballed it. It worked though and was the perfect blend of enough heat to give it a kick but not enough to overpower the flavor. It was perfection! Thanks for a great recipe. It's my new favorite! PS -- This would be an awesome recipe for a low carb diet!"
