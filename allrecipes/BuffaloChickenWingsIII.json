"reviewBody": "I wish I could give 4 1/2 stars. it's not quite the 5 star, but wouldn't take much to get there.\n\nFirst, I cooked the chicken differently than this recipe. Basically, I have a recipe for BBQ chicken that is perfect and I just used the sauce on this recipe for chicken I'd already made.\n\nSAUCE. Not much to improve on. :) Personally, I'm not a fan of buffalo style ANYTHING, but my husband wanted this so I looked until I found what I needed. He likes the \"sour\" tomato flavoring more than the hot, but the hot is definitely needed. I used home made tomato sauce so mine was probably a little stronger than what this called for. That being said, it wasn't quite sour enough. lol I recommend about a quarter to one half a jar of tomato paste added to the sauce as it simmers. (small amount as that stuff is potent. lol) Other than that, I might add a bit more cayenne pepper. and less chili powder (maybe half what it calls for.)"

"reviewBody": "Great hit at this year's 2018 Super Bowl party. Though I modified it slightly I used a FULL bottle of Franks Hot Buffalo Sauce as the base then added 8 oz. no salt tomatoe sauce 1 1/2 tablespoons of chili powder and I like mine extra spicy I used 2 1/2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper (they are really spicy but not to the point of no return.) Cooked it all together morning of the event in a medium saucepan over medium heat. While boiling stirring from time to time for five minutes. Then placed it in the fridge to let it come together until ready to use. I had the oven at 400...I placed the wings in for 30 min on a baking sheet then took them out coated with sauce and placed back on baking sheet and turned the oven down to 300 for an additional 20 minutes. While wings finished cooking cut celery into strips. Once wings were finished place on platter around bowl of blue cheese with celery and poured remaining sauce all over the wings coating them evenly before serving....Eat and Enjoy!!"

I baked for 25 minutes, flipped 'em, then baked 20 min. more before broiling."

Very good wing overall but needs to be paired with blue cheese or ranch to fully bring out the taste. I prepared precisely according to the recipe and followed the \"inventor's\" comments. Fried for 10 minutes then baked at 250 for 15. I recommend adding a little more Frank's if not using a dip. Other than that, fabulous!"

The sauce thickened up nicely and we absolutely loved the flavor. I will definitely be making these again!"

Dipped the now crispy wings in sauce and returned to 350 degree oven, and basted on another layer of sauce 7 mins later. They were GREAT!!! Not soggy or greasy at all and still finger licking delicious. I did have to add more cayenne though, I prefer a much spicier buffalo sauce! ;)"

I made these with 3/4 cup of Frank's Red Hot sauce, 1/2 cup tomato sauce and 1 tsp of cayenne. No butter. You know what, I didn't miss the butter at all. Not one bit and trust me I'm a latherer of the butter on all things (or I used to be). I cooked the wings for 50 minutes at 400 degrees. Turned out really nice. Then I tranferred them to a cookie sheet and slathered on the hot sauce mixture. Cooked them for another 5 minutes, turned them over, slathered on more sauce, cooked 5 minutes on that side and repeated process one more time. Finally to crisp them up, I turned on the broiler for exactly 7 minutes. AWESOME!!! Thanks for the fantastic recipe, Walt."

While good to begin with, it is much improved with the change in the amount of tomato sauce and with the 10 minutes frying. I had just sworn I would never use this site again because too many 4 1/2 star+ recipes have turned out terrible. But this is such an exception. I use Hill Country Chili Powder purchased from the site Spices, Inc (I hate that McCormick's stuff) and left out the cayenne pepper. Wow were these good. I'd hate to tell you how many wings they each polished off - oink. They are ready to forgive me for for feeding them another recipe from this site. Don't get me wrong - I have found some really good recipes here but I have had way too many failures."

I sprinkled salt, pepper and garlic on them and then baked for 45 min at 400 as suggested by others, dipped them in the sauce, baked for 10 more min, basted again and then broiled them for 5 min at 425. My husband said they were cooked perfect. I didn't care for the tomato sauce in the hot sauce. I will leave it out next time. I make some with buffalo sauce, also some with BBQ (bottled), and some with Teriyaki (also bottled)for my kids who can't take the heat yet. I also bake mine on the broiling pan with a little water in the pan. It makes clean up much easier, dripping don't smoke and burn."
