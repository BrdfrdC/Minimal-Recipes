Served with Cool Ranch Doritos or some kind of chips it's filling and delicious! The only difference is I use 1/4 cup FRANK'S Red Hot® Buffalo Sauce (or to taste) instead of Buffalo Wing Sauce. It's always a hit!"

The first batch was so spicy we could not taste the ranch or cheese at all. The second time by reducing the buffalo was a success! We will be making this again."
