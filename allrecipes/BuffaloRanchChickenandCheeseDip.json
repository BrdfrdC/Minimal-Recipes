"reviewBody": "I’d give this recipe 8 stars if I could, probably more. It is soooo good, I’ve memorized it. We usually end up cooking chicken breasts in a crockpot for some recipe, and save one for this recipe. I often use Franks Red Hot or Sweet Baby Rays Buffalo sauce. I also usually eat it with Tortilla chips, but red Doritos aren’t bad either. I’ve also made it with leftover grilled chicken and that was good, too. So far, I haven’t gone wrong with it. And I’m a huge buffalo wing fan, so this is right up my alley. One of my favorite snacks/mini meals to make. Perfect for movie night or when having company over."

Maybe we used the wrong sauce...we used Sweet Baby Ray's buffalo wing sauce and it's the only thing we think the grease could have come from. Maybe we will try it again with a different sauce, but sure wouldn't make it again as we tried it."
