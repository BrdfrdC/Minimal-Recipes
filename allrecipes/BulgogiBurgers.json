I also placed it onto a baking sheet covered in aluminum foil; baked the meatballs at 325 degrees for approximately 40 minutes. They came out extremely moist and my family couldn't tell me enough how good these were and definitely make them again soon. Thanks you for this keeper!!"

Also, I couldn't find the white sugar so I used brown sugar instead. I halved the recipe since I only bought one pound of ground beef (85/15) but kept the amount of green onions the same. Delicious."

"reviewBody": "My family really enjoyed these burgers! They pan fried beautifully and the ingredients created a sweet, Korean flavored glaze on the outside of the patties. I served them with sesame noodles, but most of my family ate them on hamburger buns. Personally I think the bread hid the bulgogi flavor (my favorte part) so I just cut mine up and ate it by itself. For my family of 5 to all agree on a dish is a big deal, so I will certainly make these again....thanks for the great recipe!"
