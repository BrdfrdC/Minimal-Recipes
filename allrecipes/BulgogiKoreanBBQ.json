After I browned the meat and the onions and I also use mushrooms, I add the marinade to the skillet and use a thickener made from corn starch and marinade, then added the meat back into it. It was good to revisit the recipe. Thank you"

The recipe instructions didn't say to do so, but if you're going to make this dish - remove the meat from the marinade and drain well before cooking. I assumed, that as it didn't say to remove from the marinade, that the liquid was going to make a sauce. Well it did alright. Even though I didn't use anywhere near all the marinade, the dish still tasted like pure salt. I'll try one of the other Bulgogi recipes on this site before I ever try this again."

I decided to pan fry the meat so I added all the meat and all the marinade to the pan, cooked it until the meat was done and the marinade boiled down some then added a little cornstarch to thicken it up.

Even the two year old liked it--and he isn't a big fan of meat. (Hubby liked it so much he asked me to make if for his mother when she visits this weekend.)"

"reviewBody": "Tasty tasty, says my kids but like every asian dish I make they like lots of sauce so I put 2 cups of pinneaple juice to one cup of soy sauce and then doubled it in the recipe. Blended it all up with garlic and three onions and still they wanted more of the delicious sauce. Fried marinated pieces on the pan with the marinade and let half of it evaporate to thicken the sauce and served it over rice. Yum!!!"

I used pineapple juice instead of wine, because that's what I had and it made more sense to me. At first I used my grill pan, but when the house got smokey I switch to a large skillet and we liked the meat cooked in the skillet better. I really liked this recipe. I even made it two days in a row. I can't wait to taste it barbequed in the summer."
