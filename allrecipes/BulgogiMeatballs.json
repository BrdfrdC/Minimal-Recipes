"reviewBody": "10.20.18 I scaled the recipe to four servings, ended up with 26 mini meatballs, they cooked perfectly at 16 minutes, and were plenty tender and moist. They were good, but I didn’t taste quite as much Korean flavor as I would have liked. In the future, I’ll add more seasoning and, perhaps, add some gochucjang sauce. Served with mango ginger rice, some stir fried bell peppers and onions, and a Thai-style peanut sauce for dipping. Thanks for sharing your recipe."
