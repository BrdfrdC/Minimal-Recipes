Also didn't have a lemon so I used lime. It gelled after cooling and it tasted like a fruit salad baked in juiciness. My hubby raved; my dog craved and I liked it, though apple and strawberry rhubarb rule, but that's a personal preference. Thanks."

I made it for my church Thanksgiving lunch and surprised all the older ladies that a guy can bake. I only brought home one small piece from both pies. I had a little trouble finding rhubarb but after four different stores I finally found it. I used frozen for all the fruits except for the apples and had no problems. Make sure that you let them thaw out a little first so you don't have to much added moisture. I also recommend having a very large bowl when combining everything as it made it much easier and very little risk of some of it spilling out. Will definitely make this again.\n\nP.S. I have to thank my wife as she did help with some pointers as I was putting it all together. I was very glad for the help as I didn't want to screw it up!"

I have made homemade fruit pies for years and always find it difficult to get the right consistency and balance between sweet and tart. This recipe nailed it! The various fruit favors had a party in my mouth- WOW! I will say making the pie was a little labor intensive as it took me a while to cut up all of the fruit. I used my own tried and true crust recipe and this pie couldn't have turned out better. Many thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!"

I happened upon a pie at our local farmer's market that included berries, apples and rhubarb and I thought it would be a great compromise for all involved! Then I was overjoyed when I found a similiar recipe in here, that I might be able to duplicate. The filling as everyone has said is awesome! I however made this pie with a crumb top and next time I may even make it into a crisp as that is my preference. I'm not a great pie maker, unfortunately.

"reviewBody": "This is the first time I've ever had, made or heard of Bumbleberry Pie, and since I had most of the ingredients on hand, I had to give it a try. I used 1 1/2 cups each of frozen strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries, thawed and drained, no rhubarb, and 1 red delicious apple, which came up to 1 1/2 cups. I subbed 2tsp corn starch for the tapioca and went with my own crust and this? Is just too yummy. Another commenter said that this pie is very forgiving of substitutions and I have to agree. Like other commenters, I also agree that this pie needs to cool before you eat it or it will be runny. This might also be a good recipe to use for just a one berry pie - either way, I have a feeling this is going to become a new summer staple around my house!"

By the way, my BUMBLEBERRY PIE won 2nd PRIZE. You won't be disappointed with this recipe, fellow pie lovers!"

Next time I'll experiment with instant tapioca. Update: Instant tapioca is no good. The texture of the whole pie was really gooey and weird, and I missed the texture of the regular tapioca beads. It is definitely worth using regular tapioca even if that means sacrificing the deep dish pie."

I halved the recipe for one pie and used my three fruits and as one reviewer suggested, used 4T cornstarch in place of the tapioca since I didn't have any. I also used a storebought crust, just being lazy I guess. So yummy, not too sweet, a little on the tart side from my nectarines, it's just a good all around recipe that you can tailor to whatever you have on hand."

Normally, I have a difficult time making good pie dough, but this one was absolutely delightful, both to work with and to eat. :) I didn't have time to chill it 4 hours, so I only chilled it for 1 - and it still was a dream to roll out.\r\n\r\nI used my own frozen raspberries, blueberries, and rhubarb in this recipe, and the fresh apples called for. By the time I put that into my pie crusts, there simply wasn't any more room for the strawberries - so I left them out, and didn't even miss them. One thing I would suggest: serve this pie when it's totally cooled off, *not* warm from the oven. I served it warm, and the juice from all the berries made it really runny. I was a little upset at first, thinking I didn't add enough flour or something, but when it cooled off, it was a perfect consistency and thickness.\r\n\r\nI will be saving the pie dough recipe for all my pie recipes from now on, and I'll DEFINITELY be making this recipe again!"

(After searching the internet and reading up on the history of \"Bumbleberry \" pie, I decided on this recipe because it seemed like the tastiest mixture of fruit, and I was not dissapointed.) I have made 5 of them already. I have to say that the pie crust is very easy to make, as well as light and flaky, but it was missing the flavor that butter gives to a crust, so I think I will use some butter in it next time. Try it! It's a wonderful addition to your pie recipe collection!"
