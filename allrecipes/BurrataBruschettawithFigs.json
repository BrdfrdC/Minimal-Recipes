I took it a step further and smeared Burrata on Crostini, topped with Grilled Fig quarters/halves, and drizzled with Balsamic Glaze for a baby shower. MOST popular - definitely will be doing this again - and the grill mess is a small price to pay."

"reviewBody": "Made exactly as written. Loved the grilled figs! Loved all of it except ... the Burrata cheese was sort of underwhelming. The creaminess and flavor is great but I felt it over powered the figs' flavor and did not give enough compliment to the balsamic/ fig dynamic on the toast. I think I prefer a cheese with more sharp bite like a goat cheese or such. This was good, just not quite perfection for me."

"reviewBody": "So lovely. I'd never had grilled figs before, but holy whoa, they were DELICIOUS. I didn't even have a grill--I just used a cast iron skillet. My only suggestion for improvement--go ahead and put the fig ON the bread with the cheese, instead of beside it. The combination of the cheese+bread+fig+balsamic is absolutely wild. Fresh mozzarella would also work nicely here. The figs are what make it."
