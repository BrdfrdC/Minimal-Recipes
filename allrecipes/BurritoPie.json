For the layers, I do the following in a 13\"x9\"x2\" - a very light layer of meat just so things don't stick on the bottom. Two flour tortillas smeared with refried beans. 1/2 the meat mixture. Some sour cream and shredded cheese. Repeat. Then top with two flour tortillas smeared with refried beans face down, top with a light layer or sour cream and shredded cheese. Then sliced olives on the half for those who like them. After serving, I top mine with lettuce so I feel healthier :) Yum!!"

I used 8\" flour tortilla and cut them in half to cover all of the 9x13 space for each layer. I think the recipe was a little light on the cheese and I used more than the recipe called for. It's important to have the cheese on the top of each layer to help the whole thing stick together (the cheese sticks to the layer of tortilla above it. The recipe filled the 9x13 pan and was enough for four layers separate by three layers of tortillas. Very good and I'll make it again."

I also added a can of corn and did regular diced tomatoes instead of the ones with green chiles to make it a little sweeter. We found that it tasted better as a leftover after cooling in the fridge overnight- maybe because the ingredients had time to set together? Overall this is an amazing recipe! I'm sure it is just as good without the changes I made if you like spice/don't like peppers."

I added taco seasoning to the meat and omitted the refried beans and taco sauce until later - I also added diced jalapenos to the meat because we like a good kick of spice, and about a half cup of frozen corn. As another user said, let simmer for at least 15 minutes to let the flavors meld. I then layered the meat mixture, tortillas, refried beans, taco sauce, cheese and a few olives. Then repeated these layers a few times- these separate layers helped tone down the mushiness. Then top with sour cream and avocado slices - definitely not low on flavor!"

Tonight I finally excitedly made this with a few modifications. I was very disappointed. Had I not made my modifications I don't think this would have even been eaten in my house (seasoning the meat and doubling the tortillas to avoid mushiness). The refried beans were completely overpowering and the mixture was like eating mush. There wasn't a spicy kick as I'd expect either. While it wasn't horrible it just wasn't good. For the work and price of all the ingredients I dont think it's worth even trying to fix. We'll stick to a layered burrito casserole and just regular burritos. I really wanted to like it, I don't get the high reviews."

I used corn tortillas for an authentic taste. I love flour tortillas usually. I layered a few tortillas as one previous reviewer suggested. It came out pretty good but don’t put any tortillas on top or they’ll crisp up. I would make again for myself but I don’t think it looks good enough to serve a guy-friend."

Next time I am going to season the taco meat with my homemade taco seasoning that I use when making tacos and burritos. This will give it the extra kick and authentic Mexican flavors. Also, I need to play around with the Taco Sauce or make my own. Good base, a lot of room for experimentation."

I have a deep 12 \" skillet and this recipe would have been too much for it. I used one can of refried beans with jalapeños which I mixed into the mean mixture. The other can of traditional beans I spread on the tortillas as other have. Having that stand alone flavor was nice. The extra kick was perfect. My teenage kids loved it. Tastes much like a fast food meat, been and cheese burrito. Makes great left overs. Will definitely make again. Will try using one can of whole black beans."

"reviewBody": "I made this vegetarian by reconstituting 2.5 cups of TVP with 1/4 cup of soy sauce and hot water to cover. Sautéed an onion until lightly browned and added the typical Mexican cuisine spices, TVP and a can of mixed beans (rinsed). Once the TVP was browned, I added a can of Rotel and a can of enchilada sauce to thicken. I heated the tortillas on a cast iron pan until slightly crisp, and then layered the casserole with more enchilada sauce in a 13x9 baking dish. I only used about a half bag of shredded queso cheese for the entire thing since I don’t like too much cheese. Turned out great, everyone had a second helping. Nice change from tacos. Thanks!"

We halve the recipe, it makes 4 nice size servings."
