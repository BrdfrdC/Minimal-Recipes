I ordered the masalas and curry off Amazon. I sampled each one on its own and decided to decrease the curry to 1 tsp. I omitted the cumin. Added about two tbsps extra butter. It was yummy and filling comfort food."

I screwed up when I made this as I had doubled the recipe, but accidentally quadruped the tomato paste!\n\nSo taking that into account, I believe this to be a pretty good recipe - the tandoori masala definitely transforms the dish into a bright red Indian colour.\n\nI will make this again, but next time I will add 50% more chicken, and possibly use chicken breast instead. I may add a couple of tablespoons of sugar as well."

Served on cauliflower rice in our case but got thumbs up, even from my picky 8 y/o."

I don’t do dairy so I replaced with coconut cream. It was delicious, spicy, and everyone had seconds. I served it with saffron rice and garlic naan. I’ll make double next time."

I made two substitutions because of what I had on hand - nutmeg instead of cardamom and heavy cream instead of half and half and yogurt. I also need a new blender because my old one just wouldn't purée the sauce as well as I would have liked. The flavors were perfect, a little on the spicy side, and hubby agreed that this was a keeper."
