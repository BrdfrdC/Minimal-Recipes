"reviewBody": "Man, this stuff is soo good! I made a few changes; I toasted my pecans, used only about 1 1/4 cups powdered sugar, and upped the salt to just shy of a 1/2 tsp. The result was a buttery, not-to-sweet, delicious fudge! I may try upping the amount of cream and using just 1 cup powdered sugar next time; as it was just a touch crumbly. But it held together well, and set up quickly. And did I mention it's absolutely delicious??? It's just sooooo good! Thank you for the recipe!"
