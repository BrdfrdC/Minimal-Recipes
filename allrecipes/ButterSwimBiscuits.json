The appearance was, you might say rustic, but the crusty outside and soft center was quite pleasant and tasty. I confess to adding a little smear of soft butter to the tops after removing them from the oven. My mother, who has been eating biscuits for almost 90 years, pronounced them \"mmm good\". Right now, she is snacking on a leftover biscuit with some molasses--a treat from childhood."

You can also tweak this recipe by adding herbs of your choice, garlic, cheese, jalapeno's, etc."

Just bake and cut when the biscuits are cooked. Word to the wise - of you double the recipe, you don't need to double the baking powder. Just keep it the same and double everything else. Bake in a 9x13 on top of a baking sheet covered in foil to catch butter drips. These freeze &amp; reheat very well. My family loves them."

The batter was really runny so next time I would meter in the buttermilk so it looked more like the batter in the video. I baked it until the top was crusty and a wooden skewer came out dry. Temp in the oven was between 420 and 450 (we are at altitude. ) It turned out yummy! Make sure you cook it until the top and bottom were crusty ... the best part."

Baked for 20 minutes at the 450 and they came out a beautiful golden brown. As for taste and texture, they are almost exactly like the biscuits you get at Popeyes. I love those, so I loved these, too. Perfect little chewiness on the outside and pillowy soft on the inside. I will definitely be making these again - and using the muffin tray to do it!"

"reviewBody": "Excellent recipe! These biscuits come out very buttery and almost sponge-like in texture. Based on the feedback from my kids, they will become a regular part of our breakfast rotation. One important tip: as the dough rises in the oven, it will displace some of the butter, so either use a baking sheet under the dish to catch the overflow or use a pan that is tall enough to hold everything while the dough rises."

They did such a massive oven rise that the butter spilled over (wish I had placed a drip pan underneath a bit sooner), but they came out just as fluffy and beautiful as any biscuits I've ever baked. With this little time and effort involved, I don't see much of a downside to baking these up regularly."

"reviewBody": "After I almost burned the house down because the batter spilled all over onto the bottom of the oven and caught on fire, I will use a larger pan and less butter (1/4 cup is plenty). If you use a pyrex pan lower the temperature to 420 and bake it for 25 minutes. Pyrex cannot withstand temperatures exceeding 400 as the pyrex will explode. This recipe does better in a metal or cast iron pan. I will use it again for a quick biscuit; however, like other reviewers have mentioned, you do not get the layering you do in a rolled biscuit."

"reviewBody": "I made the recipe as is. I liked it, no doubt. However, this recipe does not uses the traditional biscuit dough technique so do not expect it to be so in texture in the final result. I found them dense and a bit on the gummy especially as they cooled off. They were fluffy though. The flavor was OK too. The outer layer browned nicely at the 25 minute mark. This recipe is good if you are in a pinch. Is not bad. Just if you like a true biscuit texture then go with the traditional method/recipe if you have mastered the mixing and the kneading part. I used dehydrated buttermilk which is a life savior. I baked my biscuits in a rectangular pan and I got 8 nice portions. Will be my go to recipe in a pinch!"

"reviewBody": "I made this gluten free and it turned out great! Most biscuit recipes end up dry and flat when using GF flour, but not this one. I used a GF All-purpose blend with Xanthan gum included. Since the pandemic started, I've made these at least three times. They also freeze well, so I can eat what I want now and freeze the rest for later.\n\nOne note of caution - don't wait to bake them once the flour mix has been put into the butter. If you do, the butter seeps through and makes the whole thing soggy. If you can't bake right away, wait to put the dough in the melted butter bath until just before baking."

There’s none of the layered flakiness that I really love about biscuits where you painstakingly mix in slivers of cold butter. These biscuits are pretty cake-like and fluffy in texture. Also there’s a delicious butter flavor around the edges, but not so much in the middle of the biscuit! But they are quick and easy and the result is definitely a biscuit, so if you’re in a pinch for time, it’s not bad. I’m glad I tried out this recipe, but I think I’ll stick to traditional recipes going forward."

Wanted to see how it would be in a cast iron frying pan, 10\" with butter melted on stove top and pan warmed up. It was terrific with a great crusty bottom. Again at 425 rather than the 450 called for. \n5 stars both times."

I have made them exactly as stated in the recipe and have also added garlic salt and shredded cheddar cheese for a variation of those cheddar biscuits at a popular seafood chain restaurant. They are swimming in butter before you bake them and when they come out, but all of that deliciousness is absorbed into the biscuits within a few minutes. Yum! (garlic cheddar pictured)"

Its sticky dough so it won't pour out of the bowl, scrape and spread...I used a spatula. 2. When taken out of oven, let the biscuits rest 5 minutes after to allow butter to absorb. Deliciously buttery!"
