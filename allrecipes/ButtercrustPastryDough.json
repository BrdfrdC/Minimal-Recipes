I also put my all purpose flour in the fridge to get it cold. The key is to keep the dough as cold as possible, this allows for micro bubbles in your dough, which are created when the solid butter melts, leaving air pockets in the dough, which create the flakiness. Freeze your rolling pin before using too!"

I think the technique of using the food processor is what makes it easy and delicious. I've only previously tried to incorporate butter by hand. Oh, and I was too impatient to have the dough sit in the refrigerator after mixing it, but it didn't seem to matter. It was easy to roll and put in the dish immediately after mixing. Oh and it was semi-crispy and delicious in the end!"

Also, we didn't have time to put the dough back into the refrigerator. The apple mixture was made ahead of time and we spooned it onto our dough and followed the instructions for sealing the tarts. We used 7\" glass pie dishes, ungreased, and put two tarts in each dish, back to back. After baking, they slid out of the dishes just fine. Oh, what a lovely taste! I am officially abandoning my grandmother's excellent pastry recipe for this one instead."

"reviewBody": "I will definitely make this crust again. I made it as directed, only substituting 3T of vodka for 3 of the T of water. Just as described, the crust had an amazing buttery taste and was simple to make. I was able to roll the dough out without any additional flour on my board or rolling pin. I left out one star because even though I rolled the dough a bit thinner than 1/4 inch, I still did not have enough dough to make a pretty, thickly crimped edge on either of the two pies I made. Next time, I will make a recipe and a half to make crusts for two pies. When the recipe says it make two pie crusts, I wish it would specify the size of the pie plate. I didn't think mine were that big, but I guess that must be the problem."

"reviewBody": "I have been making this since the recipe was posted. This is my go-to pie crust recipe and it works for everything pie. There are 2 things that make this recipe foolproof: using completely frozen butter (I usually put it in the freezer overnight), vodka (I use half water and half vodka and put it in the freezer a few minutes before I start), and extra liquid. 6 tablespoons are rarely enough, and if you think your pie dough is a bit crumbly and it isn't the most amazing pie dough you've felt, you probably need more water."
