The taste and texture of this is really good, but my personal preference is for it to be a little spicier. I think I’ll add Creole seasoning next time to jazz it up a bit."

Fortunately I had a box of McCormick hush puppy mix on hand. It took the entire box mix to finally get it thick enough to scoop. I think the taste would have been terrific, so I will try it again and either double the dry ingredients or halve the wet. Sorry to rate it so low, but as written it would fry up more like a funnel cake."

But they fried up beautiful. \nAs for amount, I used the adjust feature and went from 8 servings down to 3. It still made 10 hush puppies, which is way more than the 2 of us can eat. Well...safely! Anyway, bear that in mind when making these."

"reviewBody": "I decided to half the recipe. I used a medium cookie dough scoop which is about 2 tbsp. Half the recipe made 23 hushpuppies that were about 2” diameter balls. It took about 3-4 mins at 360 oil.\n\nThat being said, I opted to add a 11 oz can of Mexicorn to the half batch. It was perhaps a bit much so would recommend only doing a whole can for a whole batch. I didn't add onion, but I did add about a tbsp. of onion powder. The batter does thicken up quite a bit if you let it sit while the oil heats but I still added another tbsp of corn meal to it to hold it together as I scooped. \n\nThese hush puppies are fantastic! They are so pillowy and soft and are not sweet even with the sugar. I will definitely be making these again and again!!"

Like the recipe says, you have to keep an eye on the oil temp for sure, but if you keep it in the 365 degree range and keep them to ping pong ball size, they won’t burn on you like some of the reviews say. Serve with honey butter and you won’t have leftovers! Great recipe!"

We couldn't stop eating them! The first batch that came out of the fryer were a little dark, so we turned the heat down a bit and the rest were all perfection! And even the dark ones were good. We didn't leave in for 6-10 minutes, were done way faster then that. After they came out of the fryer we sprinkled with salt and that is all they needed! It does make a ton even with all of us pigging out on them we still had some left, had to save room for the Crab Legs too! I did add some Tony's Creole Seasoning to the dry mix before adding the wet mix, but I don't know if it really made that big of a difference. They only thing that I changed at all, was I only used abut a quarter of an onion chopped up really small because I was a little leery of using that much onion, I don't like raw onion and I wasn't sure if it would get cooked, I feel like the amount I used worked perfect for us. This is definitely going in the book! Try these, you won't be disappointed!!! We are already planning our next meal with these!"

Outside of that I followed the recipe to a tee.\n\nThank you,\nChristopher"

"reviewBody": "These were light and airy. I have never had a homemade hush puppy. My kitchen smelled like the State Fair. The smell even lingered the next day until I opened both doors. I opted to use the large saucepan technique, but really had to keep adjusting the temperature according to my thermometer. I just dont have a deep fryer. I did slightly less than 1\" of oil, as I wasn't going to toss a quart of it. So, I am probably partially to blaim. I suggest a deep fryer, as these quite honestly soaked up way too much oil by the saucepan technique. After reading all the reviews, I made a half a recipe and got about 20~22 and used only 1 1/2 teaspoons of sugar. It seemed like the right amount. Note, if making these, and as another reviewer suggested, they do not reheat well. So, eat hot."

Double the corn meal and flour. And allow the batter to sit while your oil heats up. It will thicken to more usable texture. The final taste was pretty good, what few that were not incinerated. That and the sweetness kept this from being a five star recipe."

I probably added another 1/4 to 1/2 cup each. Then they dropped beautifully into the hot oil and fried up delicious! Also, I made the buttermilk by putting 1 TBSP vinegar into the measuring cup, then adding the milk up to a cup. Then wait five minutes and you have a buttermilk substitute."

I added a jalapeno pepper and can't really taste it, so next time, I think I'll stick with cayenne pepper to really kick it up a notch. Just a note, though. At 365 degrees they brown very quickly (and I didn't add sugar). I found that they didn't need to go the whole 6 minutes. If you cut into them to see if they're done, they may not be totally, but they continue to cook after being removed from the grease so don't wory too much about that. These are absolutely amazing."

Knowing that going in, I halved the amount of sugar--but I still ended up with burning puppies in the pan. I lowered the heat of the oil, but at that point it was too late and every batch burned or didn't cook through. I tried frying smaller sizes of batter, but at that point I was just \"done\" and gave up. The batter itself is nice, and were it not for the issue with the sugar, I'd give it a five."

The fritters turned out perfectly light and fluffy! I also thought the ratio of salt to sugar was right for the average person's taste. So, this was my take on it: I minced the onion and green onion together with a stick of celery (keep in mind I made a double batch) for a little extra homey, rich flavor and about a third of a poblano pepper. I'm not all that into spicy things, but it added a little somethin' to the recipe. I also folded in frozen corn. Last, unless you're a deep frying pro, I would suggest using an icecream scoop to release and drop the batter quickly into the oil. Using a spoon didn't work well because it just kinda dribbled in little by little, cooking unevenly and making my hush puppies look a mess!"
