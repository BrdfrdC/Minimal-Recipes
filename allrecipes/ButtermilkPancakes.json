It IS a fairly thick batter, so the griddle shouldn’t be super hot or else when the pancakes are perfectly golden, you’ll still have some raw batter inside. Add blueberries, and you’ll end up with the best pancakes you ever tasted!"

They’ll be burned on the outside and runny inside. Use medium low (4/10 on my electric stove). Better than any pancake house pancakes. My family raves about these. And it makes a LOT of big fluffy pancakes."

"reviewBody": "I have never felt compelled to leave a review on this website after years of using it -- and years of critical pancake consumption -- but these are by far the best pancakes i've tried, and i've gotta pay my respect. \n\nThis is THE pancake. I don't know if it was the fresh buttermilk or the combo of baking soda + powder or what, but these are by far my family and i's favorite recipe out of dozens. The texture is perfect -- soft, airy, moist, and it has the PERFECT syrup and blueberry sauce absorption rate. It's not dry and biscuit-y, nor is it chewy. These are the pancakes i'd have at a restaurant that make me wonder what they were adding. \n\nPS about the blueberry sauce: It's easy, TRY IT! and use Wyman frozen wild blueberries if you can find them, just throw em in a pot with some water and sugar!"

THE. SAME. ONE. AS. THIS. ONE! Copycats!! They were fine, not amazing and I have to take away another star because they copied Kemp’s!"

I was worried bc the batter was a thick strange consistency but it made a mean pancake! This is my new FAV!"

I recommend leaving the buttermilk, eggs, and milk out abut an hour before starting and you will get fluffier pancakes. tip: do NOT put the butter in with the wet ingredients, pour it into the mixture after you have mixed wet and dry ingredients. this will give you a better consistency!! I also added chocolate chips and it made the pancakes perfect. definitely recommend!!"

"reviewBody": "This is my oldest son's go to recipe. Here are his notes: A few tricks:\nChill the rest of the liquid ingredients before you pour in the butter. That will make the butter form little chunks/flakes.\nLeave the batter a little lumpy. You don’t want to squish the little air bubbles or make the butter melt again by mixing too much.\nGrease the pan with butter and make sure it’s hot before you start pouring the batter (about 325 is perfect)\nWait to turn the pancake until bubbles start forming holes on the surface.\nOnly flip ONCE. Flipping a lot can squish the air out and ruins the fluffiness.\nBest served with buttermilk syrup."
