The problem was that it stuck to the pan so bad, even though I had thoroughly greased it, that I was not able to get it out of the pan! I had to cut the cake into four sections to remove it from the pan, I have never had to do that to a cake before!! If I bake it again, it will be in loaf pans."

"reviewBody": "I, along with many others, hate it when people review a recipe that they did not follow, but instead changed. However, I am guilty of this. I cannot eat gluten, so I made this gluten free. I used Cup 4 Cup premixed all purpose gluten free flour blend, and I also added 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder and around 1/2 cup of sour cream to the cake batter. I baked it at 325 for 77 minutes in a non stick bundt pan. After baking, I let the cake sit for 15 minutes, and it came right out of the pan. Once it was cooled, I made a powdered sugar glaze icing (powdered sugar, milk, vanilla) to drizzle over the cake. It was absolutely perfect! I will make this again and again, thanks for sharing the recipe!"

Thanks to all who gave tips on time to bake so it wasn’t dry. I totally forgot to take a photo and the cake is now completely gone!

Add juice and zest of 1 large lemon - which is about 1/4 c juice, 2 teaspoons vanilla, 1-1/2 tsp cardamom. The only thing I do different is my glaze is 1/2 c powder sugar, 2Tbs cream, 1/4 tsp lemon extract and 1/4 tsp vanilla. Sometimes I just dust with powdered sugar. It has the absolutely best flavor.

I was a bit mad because my cake kinda got stuff to the Pan a little but not enough to break the cake. I buttered it well, but should have used my non-stick spray as I usually do when I bake. Also, I did half powered sugar and made an icing using Rumchata for the other half. AMAZING."

Also I probably use more vanilla extract and lemon juice than listed bc I didn't measure. For cupcakes I set the oven for 350 and cooked about 20min (don't quote me on the time). They came out very delicious. Made them for a Christmas party and it hasn't been a week since Christmas and I'm on my second batch for my house. Very important tip for baking...make sure all ingredients are room temp (eggs, buttermilk, butter). If I haven't allowed things to sit out I sit the eggs in warm water and heat the butter and buttermilk in microwave to take the chill off. Make sure you throughly mix in each ingredient."

I admit I have not tasted it yet, but my sister loves it."

Excellent!\nThis pound cake is perfect to eat by itself or to frost with a good lemon icing. Definitely a go to recipe."

It always bakes in 70 minutes in my oven.The only changes I make are to use almond extract in place of the vanilla and lemon. I also use plain yogurt in place of the buttermilk. (I've made it with buttermilk also &amp; the taste &amp; texture is the same with the yogurt as the buttermilk. I just always have plain yogurt in my fridge.) I like this pound cake best plain but it's good with whipped cream &amp; strawberries, or an almond glaze- even just some butter spread on a piece! Leftover slices of this pound cake freeze really well too."

"reviewBody": "I've made this twice now. It definitely took 90+ minutes for me. My oven is only 2 years old so it should be fairly accurate.\n\nThe first time I did it nearly as exactly directed except I used fresh lemon as opposed to lemon extract. I didn't use any glaze or frosting as i actually really like pound cake on its own and wanted to see if this recipe was good on its own. I liked it but my wife said it was moist but didn't taste much lemon. \n\nSo the second time I used an extra tablespoon of vanilla extract and extra tablespoon of fresh lemon juice. This definitely made it much more lemony to the satisfaction of my wife. I also added a lemon glaze and a simple lemon frosting to add more lemon flavor to the final product."

I also made glaze by mixing juice from the remaining orange with confectioners sugar. I do think that it is on a sweeter side, I prefer my desert a little less sweet. But I know that most people like it this way. It turned out moist and flavorful. I will be making it again, probably with walnuts next time."

When greasing my dish, I also floured it (I have always been told to do that and while I'm not an experienced baker, I did so with this as well.) It still stuck some, I assume this was an error on my end. My biggest issue was the cooking time. I took it out at 70 minutes in and it was already close to overcooked. If I hadn't checked it, I am sure it would have burnt at 90 minutes. May have been my oven but the last one I tried said to come out at 60 minutes and I should have did the same with this one. The buttermilk was a nice change. I like the tartness it provided."

I suspect it will get moister upon sitting, so maybe tomorrow it will be perfect. Next time I make it I think I will double the vanilla and leave out the lemon extract."

The cake was so moist and flavorful! I also baked it for almost 90mins at the stated temp and used a 12in tube-pan. I did beat the butter and sugar for a good five minutes."

If not a fan of lemon pound cake, don't add any lemon and increase the vanilla extract to 2 - 3 teaspoons. The pan needs to be very well greased or the cake will stick. Adding a glaze is a wonderful addition. The cake has a bit of a crunchy exterior which is a great contrast to the moist cake."

I had no lemon extract so used 2 tsp of lemon zest. Nice flavor to eat plain or with added fruit compote/trifle, fresh fruit."
