Instead of brushing the top of the unbaked biscuits with heavy cream, I used an egg wash. I also baked them at 400 degrees. Also instead of dropping them by spoonfuls, I divided each recipe of the dough into 2 and patted them into circles and cut them into wedges-8 wedges per 1/2 half of the dough. They were delicious!!!!! Make sure you put the sugar on top of them, it makes a huge difference."

Using normal white sugar on top still worked fine. I used the suggestion of the food processor for adding the butter and will be doing that from now on - worked like a charm with cold butter from the fridge. These were more moist than other shortcakes I've made."

She told me it was really easy and they definitely turned out delicious esp with fresh whipped cream on top. We also subbed brown sugar for the turbinado and cut in half to make 5 pretty big biscuits. Will definitely make again, this would be great for a summer picnic where everyone could assemble their own."

I added an extra tablespoon of buttermilk in my third batch, and it was my best batch by far. I served sandwich style with fresh whipped cream and strawberries. I think we will be having this often this summer!"

"reviewBody": "I think the recipe is good. I had some strawberry sauce from Chef John's recipe ready in my fridge and decided to prepare these biscuits. As some mentioned, be watchful of the baking time and the temperature. Adjust both as needed depending on your oven and baking sheet. I served it with a bit of vanilla ice cream and it was good. I might make this recipe again but with the original strawberry sauce to compare. If you have some fruit sauce try this recipe for the biscuits just follow the suggestions above and you should be fine."

Add about a palm full of brown sugar and a half of a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dry ingredients. It won’t seem like much but the subtleness of those in this recipe make a really intriguing depth of flavor. Thanks!"

I made buttermilk with whole milk and lemon juice, used mild to brush the tops before baking and used regular sugar for the tops. Still came out great. It might be even better with all the \"right\" ingredients, but was great just the way I made."

I wasn't sure what turbinado sugar was, because I'm a cook and not a baker, but I used Sugar in the Raw and it turned out great... Turns out they're the same thing. Lol these biscuits can be used with any number of toppings, such as whipped pumpkin cream cheese, and they are amazing."

As for the butter milk I mixed a cup of milk with 2 Tbsps of vinegar for 10 minutes. \n\nOnly thing I would change next time is less strawberries. The shortcakes have finished, and I'm left with the strawberry mixture. Would recommend using 5 cups instead of 8."

When mixing, resist the urge to over-mix and, if in doubt about correct amount of milk, don't be afraid to err on the dry side, adding a touch more as you reach the dough for the last few biscuits at the bottom of the bowl"
