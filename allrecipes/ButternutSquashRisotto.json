Reduced chicken stock to 3 1/2 cups and followed the recipe for the rest of the preparation. The result was a very flavorful side dish because of garlic and paprika. Paired well with a walnut-crusted baked tilapia."

I discovered this out of desperation. I didn't want to bake the squash to get the flesh out; it takes too long, and I'm terrible with a paring knife. Peel the bulbous end first; it gives you something to hang on to. They can get quite slippery."

To make it more of a meal I poached 2 chicken breasts and shredded them. I added them at the very end. I also added more parmesan because, well, why wouldn't you? This was a big hit even with my 4 year old, and my 7 month old!"

I added garlic and diced mushrooms, cooking them with the onions in the butter. I also used 1/3 of a cup of parmesan cheese, and only used 3 cups of broth (inclusive of the cup used for the puree). I mixed in the puree closer to the end, and seasoned only with a bit of pepper after the cheese was fully blended in. It worked out perfectly. Tasted delicious. Will definitely make this again."

I also added a bit more parmesan and a dash of brown sugar, and used shallots and garlic instead of onions (as I was out of onions). All worked nicely. At the very end, last thing - I added some cinnamon, but I likely wouldn't do that next time as it changed the taste to much, and I liked the taste before I added the cinnamon. Thanks for the recipe."

I make it as the recipe states except that I throw all the roasted squash in right before I start adding the broth most of the squash melts down to give the whole dish a creamy, hearty flavor. Some of the pieces stay whole as well and adds to the perfect consistency. The best compliment I can give is that not only does it satisfy my foodie side of the family, but my picky toddler and no-frills hubby always clear their plates! (We call it fancy mac and cheese around here)"

I chose to roast my butternut squash in the oven (instead of steaming it as the recipe directs). I cut the squash in half (length-wise), brushed the flesh with olive oil, salt and pepper, some high quality lightly dried sage, and roasted it (flesh up) until it was completely cooked. I scooped the squash out with a fork and added it to the risotto as it was cooking. It's dishes like this risotto that make fall such a delicious, magical time of year."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is a good base, but with a few tweaks it can be changed from bland to delicious! Like others have said I cut and placed the butternut squash in the oven for an hour at 400 which made it so much easier to mash. However, next time I will probably get a can or try some other method in order to make this quicker. Added in some cinnamon, nutmeg, and garlic (with the onions) in order to give it some flavor and it tasted amazing! I actually did use quite a bit of chicken stock (~4 cups) in order to make the arborio rice become soft and make the dish creamier so I would suggest placing the stock cup by cup and add more if you feel like it is needed. Also, I added the butternut squash after the first several cups of stock in order to make sure the rice absorbed the liquid properly. Perfect dish for fall and if these extra ingredients are added, the dish becomes both sweet and savory."
