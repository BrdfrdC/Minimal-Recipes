To make it keto I used a small head of cauliflower instead of the potatoes. Followed the cooking method exactly. Came out great. Served in bowls with a dollop of sour cream sprinkled with chives.

I added: 1 large yellow onion, chopped ½ teaspoon sea salt 3 garlic cloves, chopped 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage ½ tablespoon minced fresh rosemary 1 teaspoon grated ginger And Chopped parsley at the end after blending all the soup together. I also deglazed with one cup of white wine after sautéing all my ingredients before adding chicken stock. It came out very good, definitely recommend."

I chunked the 3 lb squash into 1\" cubes, I didn't have any potatoes, I used 1/2 sweet onion, chopped fine, 2 stalks of Celery chopped fine, 1 medium Carrot chopped fine, 64 oz of low sodium Chicken broth to cover all of the squash and veggies, a healthy dose of Italian Spices, and boiled @ med heat for 1 Hr, (because I fell asleep). Removed it from the heat, Mashed everything with a potato masher, added 16 Oz of whipping cream, 1/2 block of Philadelphia, and 2 generous scoops of sour cream, and Sea salt and course pepper to taste. Mixed all of that together, and let cool overnight. Tonight, Soup was awesome when reheated."

You could add apple and or more carrot, whatever is in the fridge! My second go at it I threw in two apples, one potato only, maple syrup and brown sugar. This is a basic recipe that's good for learning cooks. You can customize it and build from there. Mmmm! P.s. this soup is HOT as it simmers. Watch out. I spilled it on my hand and had a blister bigger than a golf ball. I've got a huge scar now :( Wear mitts with soup!"

If there wasn’t apple or rosemary added, this recipe would have had an incredibly bland flavor."

"reviewBody": "It’s not done yet but I can tell this is gonna be fantastic. I substituted sweet potatoes for regular potatoes, added a couple teaspoons of minced garlic, and about a cup and a half of chunky applesauce to a doubled recipe of the soup. Even before the vegetables are cooked, the broth has incredibly nice flavor. I’m using two butternut squash freshly picked from the garden. … and now it’s done and the flavor is amazing. The applesauce adds just a bit of sweet brightness. Tips on peeling the squash were helpful. Pierce the skin and microwave for 2 minutes, and peeling with a vegetable peeler is pretty easy."

"reviewBody": "I love this recipe because it’s simple and a great base but having made it over the years there’s a few things to consider. If you like a sweeter soup, roast the squash (425F for 50 min cut in half). Browned butter gives this a great flavour - I browned butter with ginger and garlic then added veggies and you end up with more flavour to season. Coconut milk, sage butter, curry, cinnamon - you can add whatever and this is going to change the flavour to your liking. Last up a blender purées the best so if you can transfer it in batches it’s worth it for silky smooth soup. If using celery, cook it with butter ahead and chop finely."

My wife doesn't usually like squash soup but likes this."

"reviewBody": "Fabulous soup, great for a fall or winter dinner! As some of the other reviews suggested, added a sweet potato and apple, along with 1/2 tsp each of nutmeg and curry. Added 3 cloves of minced garlic to onion and celery mix and sauteed first. Then added carrot, squash and sweet potato mixture, sauteed for another 10 minutes before adding chicken stock. Added heavy cream after blending. Might be easier (and add extra flavor) if squash were to be roasted first. Also less chance of taking off a finger whilst paring the squash!"

I add a dash of mild curry powder, a couple of bay leaves, paprika, nutmeg and cinnamon because I enjoy a spicier and more exciting soup. Some might like the bland version; personally I found it a bit boring the first time when I made it as it was written. I’ve made it several times since and have explored with various flavours. I’m quite pleased with the soup as it is with these minor tweaks and therefore feel 4 stars is justified :)"

"reviewBody": "I got a butternut squash in my veggie co-op so I decided to make this soup today. I had all of the other ingredients handy so it seemed serendipitous that I should make this recipe. As always, I read other reviews to see suggested modifications.\n\n1) Veggies: I reduced the potatoes down to 1, as suggested by most. I didn't have any sweet potatoes on hand (which some have also recommended and sounds great) but the white potato I had on hand worked. Some people suggest to take out the celery because it is stringy but I think it lends flavor so I just chopped it finely to eliminate the issue.\n\n2) Cooking - I followed the recipe pretty closely but did roast the squash first as it was too hard to cut. And I also used coconut oil to saute the veggies as I think it adds a nice sweetness to soups of this style.\n\n3) Spices - Most people agree this needs some spices. I used what I had that seemed to be a good flavor fit - cinnamon (commonly recommended), garam marsala, cumin and cayenne. Just a dash of each. Then salt and pepper to taste.\n\nThat is it and it was delicious! I added sour cream to one serving and left it off the next. I could go either way.\n\nI did roast the seeds too to sprinkle on top! Rinse, dry, mix with olive oil and salt. Roast on 400 for 30 minutes or until brown. Adds a nice texture and flavor sprinkled on top!"

This one was fantastic!
