I switched the butter for one heaping tablespoon of coconut oil, the chicken broth for two vegan chicken-like bouillon cubes (Not Chick’n brand) and four cups of water, a half teaspoon of sherry, a pinch of nutmeg, and a half teaspoon of Creole seasoning. I’m certain that it would have been delicious made exactly as directed."

My additions are 2 Tbsp Cinnamon, 1 Tbsp Nutmeg, 1 cup applesauce. I saute 1 chopped medium onion, 1 clove garlic, celery and 2 cups grated carrots. I doubled the squash. I blend all with a hand immersion blender. Excellent results!"

I take out a bowl the night before and let it defrost. Be aware that thawing in the refrigerator takes quite along time. Pop it into the microwave for a quick eat and serve. Love this!"

Roasted all veggies in oven first — diced about 3 sweet potatoes, 2 peppers (red and yellow), one onion, 5 carrots, and butternut squash. Placed all on baking sheets lined with foil, brushed with olive oil, roasted in 400 degree oven for about 30 minutes. Browned garlic in melted butter, added the roasted veggies, 1.5 boxes of vegetable stock. Simmered for about 30 mins, seasoned with a few shakes of cayenne pepper. When everything nice and tender, used a submersible wand blender to purée. WOW was this yummy!! My family dubbed it a keeper, and I agree! Was great with the cayenne kick."

I cooked the initial vegetables in olive oil instead of butter this time because we have a dairy free lunch guest, and I added a touch of Chipotle Chili Powder (probably between 1/2 teaspoon and 1 teaspoon) to give it a little light heat. Great way to change the dish up and make it a little more flavorful! Definitely doesn't need cream or anything like that because the texture is great on its own. Definitely going to make it again."

I used a yam instead of a sweet potatoe and I added a package of firm tofu before I blended the soup for a little added protein, I also added a little nutmeg. This soup will become a regular fall meal for us for sure,"

It was very thick so I added just a 1/2 a cup of coconut milk and it was a lovely consistancy and taste. I will definitely making this soup on a regular bases."

I didn't have carrots or celery so I just added more sweet peppers and celery seed, coriander and ginger. \n\nIt was an awesome side for brats for a nice cozy dinner at home. You could add smoked sausage to it for a heartier soup meal for the guys like mine who want meat with dinner. Mine likes it on the side, so I used fresh sausages and grilled them."

I didn't even have to use salt and pepper because the combination of vegetables were great on their own. I made this soup with butternut because that is what I had on hand but I am sure it would be just as tasty with acorn squash as that is one of my two fave squashes. I used two good sized bell peppers; one yellow and one red. It is not your typical squash soup. It is more savory than sweet. It is so good I will be bringing it to our Thanksgiving family get together."

I made it as written with the exception of the celery (we didn't have any.) I thought I might have to add cream or milk, or additional seasoning, but it was fine as is. This will be an autumn staple for us!"
