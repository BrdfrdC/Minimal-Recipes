I didn't have any butternut squash, so I used two acorn squash and substituted half a can of pumpkin puree for color and depth of flavor. I kept the brown sugar and cream cheese just as directed. I added a pinch of ginger and two pinches of nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon. I also roasted my acorn squash with Garlic, cayenne pepper salt and black pepper. So this was sweet and creamy with a little kick. Very flavorful. I will definitely make this again."

Next time, I'll add the sour cream before I blend, little chunks in the pot didn't smooth out even over low heat. Should have known.\n\nReally good though! I'm putting some in the fridge for the week, and freezing the rest!!"

It was very rich - next time I’d go heavier on the chicken stock and lighter on the butter and cream cheese. Microwaving the squash is faster and easier than oven baking. A dash of pumpkin pie spice on top makes a nice garnish."

I just cut the squash in quarters (seeded) and popped it into my cooker (on the rack) with 1 1/2 c water, and cooked it on \"steam\" for 7 minutes. I vented when it was finished cooking, and the squash just fell off the skins. Then just continued with the recipie (adjusted for 4 servings) and it's fantastic!!!"

"reviewBody": "I have made this soup many times. It is the best soup ever. I frequently double the squash when cooking and freeze half for a second batch, since cooking the squash is the most labor intensive part of the soup. Lots of times I cook the squash ahead of time when I have my oven on for something else. Let it cool, and remove skins. Then I refrigerate it and use it a day or two later for a quick meal. I only use 4 ounces of cream cheese and 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar. The acorn squash really ups the sweetness. especially when cooked until really soft."

Since I had a bit more squash than the recipe called for, I used 1/4c brown sugar, but I think I could have left it at 1/3c as it was still quite sweet. Again, having extra squash, I didn't add any extra broth, and I really liked the consistency as it was. Couldn't have made this without my Ninja mixer. I think it's time I get a food processor, as I definitely plan to make this often."

I added a carrot and some celery with the onion, along with a few garlic cloves. I also used a spaghetti, rather than an acorn, squash. I used about 4oz of goat cheese (it was what I had on hand), rather than the cream cheese. Some cayenne and curry powder for a nice, savory finish. Delicious!"
