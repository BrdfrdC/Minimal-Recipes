I do add good white wine and a good apple; I don't add the nutmeg. And it's my experience that if it sits in the refrigerator overnight the flavor is greatly enhanced the next day. But usually I can't wait and have to have a little cup right after it's made. Like with any soup, crusty bread on the side is a must."

This makes 10 servings at 1 point on WW green plan"

Next time I will make sure to get Granny Smith as I’m curious what that would do to the flavor profile. I also used a mix of chicken bone broth and vegetable broth (just what I had access to). It had at first delicate flavors, but became more complex the more I ate it. Will definitely try this again."

She was pregnant at the time. She made this wonderful soup only to find that she had an aversion to leeks and onions due to her pregnancy. She’s couldn’t eat it. However that photocopy has become somewhat tattered over the years from many references to it as we have enjoyed this soup over and over. I decided to look to see if I could find it online and here it is! Needless to say, it got printed again!"

I used a very large Jonagold apple (sweeter than a Granny Smith). I also used coconut milk instead of cream. Everyone loved the soup and so did I. It is a keeper. Thanks."

I used by blender to puree the soup in batches as I do not have an emersion blender. By light cream , I assumed half and half and used that. I alway use \"Better than Bullion\" to make chicken broth. Also used frozen and defrosted butternut squash. Used a pink lady apple as that is what I had on hand. Very good soup and easy to make. Makes a ton, so I froze half of it."

Even though I salted and peppered it while cooking, I found that I needed to add more salt and pepper to my own individual serving --- it just needed extra flavoring. It was a very filling recipe served with a salad and rolls and great for a cold night meal."

I don't usually cook with leeks but I think that might be the key ingredient that takes this soup to the next level. My whole family, even the meat lovers, enjoyed this soup!"

"reviewBody": "I really liked this, I used all frozen veggies including the butternut squash. I also added a small can of pumpkin and just eyeballed the nutmeg and cinnamon. I doubled this and made it in a crock pot. I also added frozen sweet potato, which I found at Walmart, because it was organic, it was more expensive, but you can find regular frozen sweet potato at Market Basket. Because all of the veggies were frozen it took eight hours on low and my crockpot is fairly new so it runs really good, your crockpot may vary in time, but you can just set it and forget it. I used a hand held blender to blend and it was a big hit!! It all went. I served this with grilled cheese sandwiches. You could serve this with just about any sandwich or fresh bread and a salad. Enjoy!!!!!"

I also took the advice from some of the comments and roasted the butternut squash. A small handful of fresh herbs (thyme and sage) brought it home! Don’t let the purée step stop you!

I always have fresh nutmeg so grated some in. It really added a nice flavor. Separated some and added light cream and some apple cider to that. The recipe is very good without cream and cider but I prefer it with. One other difference is I used vegetable stock so I can let my vegetarian friends try it. I will definitely make this again.

I also add a sprig of fresh rosemary while the butter and onions are cooking. Do yourself a favor and put all the ingredients like the apples, onions, carrots etc into a food processor before cooking. This soup can get quite chunky if you don't and that means more time in the blender later. I see a few people here don't add the cream. I personally like it much better wth the cream"

I made the recipe as written, except I didn't use a leek and I used milk instead of cream. I prefer a little thicker soup so I thickened it somewhat at the end. I precooked the squash for about 5 minutes in the microwave (pricking it several times), to make it easier to cut. I made a double batch and it used about 1/2 of my squash (so I cut the rest in cubes and froze to use the next time I make this). I made this last night and my house still smells SO good!"

Also a fuji apple since I can't have granny smith ones. \nAlso I HIGHLY advise you use 1/8tsp nutmeg and taste it first- nutmeg can REALLY overpower the flavor of a dish easily! I found 1/8tsp was plenty. I added a few dashes of cinnamon and a pinch of cayenne as well- Made for a nice mix of savory, sweet, and spicy! \nI only used 1/4 cup cream, but honestly it would be fine without. I also used dry vermouth in place of white wine (I always do this, it's never let me down) and found it added a nice flavor. I can't have ACV, but I can see how that would be tasty as well instead of wine (but only like a tablespoon or so). My husband typically isn't a fan of pureed soups, but this one he liked!"
