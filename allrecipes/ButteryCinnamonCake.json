I'll try the suggestion from others to pour some of the syrup into the bundt pan and let the cake rest in it while pouring the rest over the top. Only because I did feel there was a lot of wasted syrup. I'll also omit the water from the syrup. I baked 40 minutes, but might check at 38 next time. It's definitely great with coffee."

I definitely like the buttery flavor of the drizzled cinnamon and butter. But, I thought the cake was very crummy probably from being in the oven 5 minutes too long which dried it out. I think I will try it again, but this time I will reduce the cooking time by testing it sooner, reduce the amount of baking powder, replace shortening with vegetable oil or butter, and add a bit more cinnamon to the batter. We'll see how that works."

Less than half broke off and came out, the rest stubbornly stayed in the pan. So I remade the next day, only changing two things, I greased my pan THOROUGHLY, right before adding the batter. Then, instead of flouring the pan, I used 3/4 cup sugar and 1 TBS of cinnamon (mixed together) to sugar my pan. Cake came right out, no sticking. I love this recipe, I didn't have adjust for high-altitude either."

Since I had just received a bottle of Torani Cinnamon Syrup, I used it. Very good. After tasting it, I realized this is the kind of cake I prefer to add nuts to, like banana bread. It will go great with a cup of coffee. I also believe it will get more moist and flavorful each day as it sits and soaks up all the cinnamon syrup."

The result has a strong cinnamon flavor I love.\n4/6/18: I replaced the shortening with butter (2/3 cup is 10 Tbs + 2 tsps). Also, I used brown sugar instead of white and my glaze was thicker.

I don't think I'd make that change since the topping here probably has better texture and is cheaper. Likewise, some reviewers spoke about how good the cake was hot, I liked it better the second or third day after the topping has set and the flavors melded. I would cut half, or so, of the sugar called for in the recipe for the cake itself out and substitute a less refined sugar for all, or most, of the sugar in both the cake and topping recipes. Butter is better than shortening too."

"reviewBody": "The cake turned out really moist for me and the syrup was excellent. I also tweaked the recipe but it was already a great recipe to start with. I like alot of flavor so I also added 2TBS to the batter and used dark brown sugar instead of light or white. I beat the batter extremely well each time an ingredient was added and until it was smooth as a babys bottom. I also sifted all my ingredients together. With the syrup which turned out excellent, I added 2 teaspoons cinnamon.I only substitued the white sugar with dark brown and brought to a boil then turned it down to a simmer and whisked it for about 5 to 7 minutes and it turned into a beautiful dark brown thick glaze. It was delicious just make sure you flour your pan well and give it time to cool in the pan."

I baked it for 45 minutes and it was done. I will probably make this again, taking the suggestions of more cinnamon in both the batter and the glaze and using brown sugar in place of white. I think I would also make a simple syrup then add the butter so the glaze isn't so runny. We did like the fact it was not overly sweet. Thanks, Leta."

Also - don't forget to flour the pan (like I did) otherwise the cake won't come out in one piece!"

In the glaze, I added a couple of tablespoons of maple syrup to give it some depth and I used dark brown sugar instead of white."

Otherwise the cake itself was on the dry side - not that this is necessarily a bad thing, as the dryness works well with the sauce - and wasn't quite as enjoyable the second time around. I will definitely make it again, but will reserve its preparation for times when enough people will be on hand to enjoy it fresh."
