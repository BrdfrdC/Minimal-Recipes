Turned it up to high for about 4-5 hours.\nInstead of bone-in chicken pieces I used boneless chicken thighs, and dried dill instead of fresh.\nMy family ate with no complaints! We enjoyed the soup with some stoned wheat crackers. It makes great left overs the next day.\nThank you Star20 for the great borsht. 5 stars...would make again! :)"
