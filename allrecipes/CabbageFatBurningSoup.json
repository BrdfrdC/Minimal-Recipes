It over takes the flavoring of the soup. If we use beef as our protein…. We get the sour cream out…. It tastes like stuffed cabbages. Ditch the canned green beans and go fresh or at least frozen. Chopped asparagus goes nicely in this soup… We split our “tomato juice”… 1/2 low sodium V8 juice and 1/2 Spicy V8 juice. Zucchini is also popular with the family…. This soup and I F…. Pshhhh… I lose weight like crazy and fast."

To my bowl I do add a dash of sea salt, cracked black pepper, a few dashes of green tabasco and sprinkle of dried Asian garlic to suit my taste buds before serving. Does not affect weight loss and imo brings flavor up to super delicious!"

"reviewBody": "Infinitely too much sodium for me!!!! I'd sub out the juice for the juice from no salt added diced tomatoes and add more tomatoes. I'd skip the broth and onion soup mix and replace with low sodium bone broth. And, because I really do need more protein than 4 gms per serving, I'd add at least 2-3 ounces of chicken per serving. What's nice about this recipe is that you CAN add other vegetables to it, so I'd probably replace the canned green beans with fresh, and add some baby bella mushrooms for both taste and some extra vitamins and minerals, and consider adding more chopped zucchini and maybe eggplant. Mmmmmm....."

For dieting purposes everything ingredient must be sodium free, can tomatoes must = quantity of broth; and normally prepared with these only cabbage, celery, fresh onion, can tomatoes &amp; broth only.

I just v-8 instead of tomato juice. 1 regular and 1 spicy, it wakes it up a bit. Instead of beef broth I use better than bouillon, as much as I need to flavor it the way I like. This time I tried it with 1/2 green cabbage and 1/2 red. It turns out I like the red better. v8 and red cabbage are also healthier than just tomato juice and green cabbage. An excellent soup. It just needs some real beef in it which I'll try next time. Some protein is also good for weight loss and it will make this soup healthier."

Also added two envelopes of onion soup mix instead of just one, some salt and crushed red pepper flakes. This made so much I had to transfer to my largest pot mid-way. You can also add a second can of green beans easily. Was absolutely delicious! Eating a bowl right now so decided to leave my review! Thanks for this recipe! Delicious!"

"reviewBody": "I love this soup! I make it fairly regularly or when I get a craving for it. It is heavily tomato based so if you do not like tomatoes, I would take caution. With that said however, my husband isn't a huge tomato fan, but he does enjoy this soup. I don't make any real modifications to it. Sometimes I may swap out the green beans for a kidney bean on other bean just because I may already have it on hand. I also sometimes use V8 instead of pure tomato juice as it adds a little more flavor. Mostly I make it because I just like the soup. The fact that its a diet soup is a bonus when I feel like eating it for that reason. Last note is that this recipe makes a HUGE amount of soup. If I am not sharing with family or friends, or planning to use for a week of dieting, I'll only make a 1/2 recipe."

It needed to cook longer than 15 minutes for the celery and cabbage to get tender. I would guess 45 minutes. I opted for the V-8 juice. Skipped the dry onion mix and added salt, 2 bay leaves, and a big splash of Worcester Sauce. Tasted good but next time will skip the Worcester as hubby didn't like that flavor in this soup."

"reviewBody": "It works. I’d been on a 6 month journey to lose x amount of weight on a program that pays you to lose weight. You pick amount you want to lose and the amount of time to do it in. I’d been doing great (slow and steady with proper calories/nutrients) but I found time closing in and unfortunately, I’d overreached a bit. I found myself needing to lose 8 pounds in 1-3 weeks. I set my sights on achieving it in 10 days and then I prepared to do this cabbage soup diet for 10 days straight. I shot past my goal. Won my many benjamins and am super grateful for the recipe. But maaaaan, I hope to never have to do this again. If I never see another bowl of cabbage again, it’ll be too soon! It tastes decent enough. But the same food 3x every day for 10 days was tough. Felt like I was on a juice diet. \n\nTwo things that were not listed that I feel would be helpful to others: pot size and serving size. I used a 12 quart stockpot and it came to the very top, so plan to use that size or bigger. Serving size is 355-360 grams for 15 servings if you make attempt to drain juice as you scoop, which is what I did. Will be a lot more if you ladle it on in there for the true “soup” experience. I used quart sized bags for each serving. I put all bags in a huge bowl in the fridge &amp; it was just grab, dump, heat, and eat. Fun times. Anyway, it does work. It’s filling and I didn’t feel weak or fatigued even with regular strength training/ cardio."

A lot of the measurements are odd amounts or uncommon in the sense most canned food does not quite match the cooking directions. \n\nIt would also be nice if the measures were based on how many cups/weight of celery, cabbage, carrots, etc. I bought the required amounts but while I shopped the sizes varied immensely in everything from fresh vegetables to cans. \n\nUltimately, I had to guess if things would work or not. I will wait it out. If it gives results then I’ll up the review from 4 to 5 stars. \n\nSIDE NOTE: I added half a jalapeño for flavor and a sprinkle of oregano leaves spice."

"reviewBody": "Some tips and tricks for those looking to meal prep lunches for weight loss. First off- I loved this soup! I made it as it was written. I did add some Crystal hot sauce to individual servings to change it up from time to time. Make sure you use a large stock pot if your going to do the full 15 servings. Once completed I had about 9 quarts of soup (this depends on water added mostly, I just covered all the veggies per the instructions). This is roughly 2.5 cups per serving. If your going to eat only 1 serving a day, you will need to freeze more than half right away as after 5 days it won't be fresh."

I work in a hospital where I rarely get more than 5-10 minutes for lunch, so I took the suggestion of another reviewer and put a serving of this in my Vitamix along with some bone broth and drink it on the go…. It tastes like a thick V8 smoothie. I’m high-functioning autistic and have a hard time with the texture and taste of veggies but this is a way I can easily add them in my diet."

"reviewBody": "I was hesitant about making this soup when I saw the 2 quarts of tomato juice in the list of ingredients. Even while I was in the grocery store, I thought about bypassing the tomato juice and making the soup without it. Despite this, I went ahead and stuck to the recipe. I decided to make a few modifications. I used vegetable broth instead of beef, increased some of the present ingredients, and added collard greens, green onions, jalapenos, and my favorite salt-free seasonings. I make soups frequently and normally increase the ingredients so the soup will last throughout the week. Upon completion of the soup, I was pleasantly surprised of the outcome with the tomato juice. The soup actually tasted wonderful. I was expecting the tomato juice to be overpowering and it was completely balanced in taste and delicious. I chose this recipe due to the number of reviews and I must add to those positive reviews. I tried to attach my photo, but it was too large. Fantastic Recipe!"

It was delicious after that. Just a few suggestions if you’re looking to improve the flavor!"

Followed the recipe. Got creative by adding some leftover fresh spinach, parsley and low salt beef broth. Served it with a loaf of Artisan Bread from Panera. It was so satisfying, we all needed a nap after eating it. I don't know if it really is fat burning but the carb count is low so it fits into the meal plan we have to do for a Type 2 family member. Just don't add any salt. You get enough from the Onion soup mix and then what occurs naturally in the ingredients."

I have never used the onion soup mix before, that was a nice flavor addition and will do this from now on. I also did not use green beans or celery. Instead i used asparagus, chick peas and black beans. I kept the carrots, onions, peppers, tomatoes and cabbage but i did not measure anything just added until i was happy with the amounts. I also had a cucumber that needed to be used so i chopped it up and threw it in the mix. I did not need as much as this recipe called for as it is just me eating it so i made a decent size pot (rather than my large stock pot) and was still able to freeze portions for later."
