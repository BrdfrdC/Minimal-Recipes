I think adding another can of tomatoes (with juice) may make up for that extra half cup of water. Twas great!"

Did not drain, as too much flavor would be lost. (Wasn't much fat any way) Stirred mixture before adding cabbage to pot. Brought liquid to boil, covered, and simmered for 20 minutes. Stirred, cabbage still raw. Cooked another 20 minutes, stirred, rice burned to pot, cabbage still too raw, although rice was done. Cooked another 10 or so. Cabbage now crisp tender. Removed from heat, stirred and tasted. Very bland, needs more spice. The recipe definitely needs work. I prefer not to cut cabbage smaller to get it done sooner. Not sure if I will try it again or not."

Also I didn't like the fact that it didn't give you any idea how much Cajun seasoning to add. We halved the recipe because there are only 2 of us. We used 1 tsp Cajun seasoning and tasted no heat. We like spicy dishes, so next time we will add 2 tsp. Great recipe , thank you!"

It definitely did not call for enough liquid to adequately cook the rice (unless it was supposed to be minute rice - which was not indicated) I added one more can of tomatoes and a can of rotel as there was no spice at all. In addition I still needed a bit more water. The other issue I had was the lack of salt and pepper called for - I added quite a bit. At the end of the day this recipe was just ok and I would not likely make it again."
