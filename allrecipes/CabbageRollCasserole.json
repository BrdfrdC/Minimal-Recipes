I also added Worcestershire sauce, basil, oregano, lots of salt, pepper, and some red pepper flakes into the hamburger mixture. Great suggestions! I used spaghetti sauce rather than tomato sauce because I didn’t have any. I threw in some shredded cheese into the combined mixture before cooking. When taking off the cover after an hour, extra cheese was put in top of the 2 containers before cooking for another 10 minutes."

Chicken broth instead of beef plus about a tablespoon vegetarian \"beef\" Better Than Bullion. for a deeper, richer flavor. Used about 1.5 cup or so basmati rice which I partially cooked in the microwave, (directions on back of rice package) before adding it to the rest of the mixture. Just a bit of black pepper.

This dish is very easy and can be prepared much earlier in the day. I let this \"rest\" for about 10 minutes prior to serving. Family rave review."

Because my brother is crazy for cabbage rolls I put the recipe in 2 8x8 pans. I added a tsp. each of Worcestershire, cider vinegar, and minced garlic to the recipe because we like lots of seasoning/favor in our food. I added the onion, salt and pepper to the burger when I browned it. And lastly I added a can of diced tomatoes for more texture. The casseroles are baking right now and our mouths are watering. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"

First mistake? I baked it for one hour and it was far from done. Rice and cabbage under done and the whole thing still very soupy. So I increased the temp to 375 and cooked it uncovered for 30 minutes more. Still far from done. So I put the whole thing in a large skillet and cooked on top of the stove for another 30 minutes. We ate it at that time but dinner very late and certainly not worth the effort!"

Second, the rice was not even close to being cooked after an hour and a half, even at 375 degrees. I cooked for over 2 hours and then the cabbage was mushy. Third, very bland tasting and needed a lot of spicing up. I’ll be finding a different recipe as this one was a waste of ingredients."

"reviewBody": "I like this way better than cabbage rolls because I am a cabbage-aholic, and this dish gives you cabbage in every bite. I think the addition of carrots (in the video) is genius - not because I need to add veggies, but because it tastes great. The one issue: My rice overcooked. When I make this again, I may simply add the rice later. I made a couple of changes: I added garlic powder when cooking the beef because I cannot stand the smell of unseasoned hamburger cooking, and I'm glad I did because it amped up the flavor. The other change: I used my own canned tomatoes instead of store-bought \"crushed\", and I braced them with a small amount of my own canned tomato sauce. One more thing: \n I cut the cabbage in large 1\" pieces, which is probably why mine did not turn mushy. All in all, this recipe is a keeper, and I will be adding to the rotation."
