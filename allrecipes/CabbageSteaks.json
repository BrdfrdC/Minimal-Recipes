But I also like to change up the flavors occasionally and substitute sesame oil for the olive oil, gochugaru (Korean kimchi pepper) for the black pepper and drizzle with just a bit of rice vinegar to serve as a side to Asian inspired dishes. Both versions a favorite in our household!"

I cooked them 10 minutes longer than the recipe said. They didn't seem to be cooked all the way. I don't know maybe I cut them too thick. I really wanted to like this recipe because it was so easy. I will make it again but I will need to make some changes. Not sure what yet."

I only did one tonight in a pie pan in a small convection oven as I wasn't sure that I would like it, and that's all the room I had. It did take the listed 45 minutes so I should have done all of them in the big oven to be more efficient as I am sure they'd reheat well. I can do the rest of them tomorrow."
