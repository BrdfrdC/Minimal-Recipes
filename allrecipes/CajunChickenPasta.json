I'm not a big fan of bell peppers so I used more mushrooms and 1/2 a pound of asparagus, cut into 1 inch chunks with a bit of longer saute. I had a cup of parmesan &amp; pecorino romano blend cheese in the fridge so I used that instead of just parmesan. Dad still raves about this so I'll be making it again this weekend, just in time for the return of football."

The dish was delicious, for 4 of us (2 Teens/2 Adults) with only a small amount of the shrimp and vegetables left over. I also cooked 1 lb of linguini, mixing in about 6-8 oz, rather than just 4 oz, and serving the rest dressed with olive oil and parmesano for the teens to supplement! That all disappeared!"

Removed the chicken from the pan while I cooked the peppers mixture. (for a little longer than 3 minutes). Doubled all the spices at the end and I added extra heavy cream. It was runny but it thickened with a little time. And of course, I used a heavy, cast iron skillet. Delicious and not very difficult at all. Hubby loved it too."

Also used fresh garlic that I added with the veggies. Don't be shy with the spices and butter. I imagine the variations of this recipe are endless. Will try mixing and matching sausage and shrimp with the chicken in future."

I used fusilli pasta (spiral) which was great for soaking up the sauce.

"reviewBody": "I have made many recipes on this site but I felt compelled to review this specific one because it was so good!\nI used light cream in replace of the heavy cream, left out the lemon pepper and black pepper and used a small can of mushrooms. I added seasoned salt instead of the regular table salt because this is a staple seasoning for me and added dried oregano along with the dried basil. I also made my own cajun seasoning as recommended by another reviewer and that worked out great. Leaving out black pepper was a good idea because the heat from the cajun seasoning was enough and glad I made that decision.\nI saved some pasta water just in case I needed to thin out the sauce but I was pleased because I didn't need to use a slurry for thickening but did use the pasta water for a little extra moisture.\nThis dish had amazing flavor and this will be a recipe I will make again."

I made changes the 2nd time and we loved it. First I used a rotisserie chicken out of laziness. I tossed it with the Cajun seasoning then added it to the sautéed veggies along with fresh garlic. Instead of the cream I added about 1 cup of chicken broth and 1/2 cup of white wine. I added fresh basil along with the salt, pepper and lemon pepper. I also added juice from 1 lemon. I thickened the sauce a bit with corn starch before tossing in the fettuccine- I increased the pasta to 8 oz. Delicious and 5 stars."

I removed the chicken from the pan while making the cream with only the veggies in the pan, then added back the chicken. Keep the chicken foil tented while dealing with reducing the sauce so it stays nice and tender. That being said, the recipe takes longer to make than stated if you take a few extra (but I feel necessary) steps."
