"reviewBody": "I had to triple the recipe due to having 14 people over for Easter brunch So I didn't make the sauce but I followed the recipe omitting the celery, carrots and dill. The first two cause I don't like them and the dill cause once I got everything going and the rest of the herbs in, it's didn't need it. The vegetable mixture is pretty fragrant by itself. I mixed everything up and formed the crab cakes the night before and took them out to come to room temp about 30 minutes before popping the into the oven at 350 for 25 minutes. I turned them over about half way through. I couldn't keep people away from them. Everyone made some comment about it being the best they've had etc. I frankly don't cook crab often, and will def not be making this for such a large crowd again in the future only due to the expense of crab meat. But according to Hubby, I need to keep this recipe handy, in case he gets a craving."

"reviewBody": "If you are a fan of the \"Maryland\" type crab cake, which uses less filler, then this is not the recipe for you. I live in the Deep South where we like food spicy, full of ingredients and full of flavor! This is by far, the best crab cake we've had to date. I did not add all the crab to the mixture at once, reserving about 1/4 of the chunks to press/gently work into already-made patties before cooking. I broiled some under high heat, about four minutes per side. It was good, especially for the health conscious. I fried the rest, which is how we preferred it. So delicious! Also, if it seems like the mixture won't hold together, add crumbs. And pop the mixture in the freezer for 15 minutes before forming patties. Thank you for a fabulous recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I made this for New Years special dinner. It was amazing. I skipped dill. Also, I keep it simple wherever possible so I just combined all ingredients except crab, eggs, breadcrumbs and sautéed all together- much easier and tasted fabulous. Then cooled the veggie/spices till room temp, combined with eggs and cracker crumbs. I lined 6 oz ramekins with Saran Wrap and put 2/3 c. Of crab mix in each. Sealed them up and refrigerated for 2 hrs. Then you can pull pre portioned to cook when you want. Also, I baked at 350 for 25 min instead of sautéing to save calories- was amazing! If possible make sauce day before to give time for flavor to develop. I used low fat mayo for healthier version without flavor sacrifice- enjoy!"

"reviewBody": "I only had 8 oz of good crabmeat, so I halved the recipe. I did not have Creole seasoning but used Cajun seasoning (same difference, I believe). The combination of veggies and spices produced a nicely flavored crabcake. When forming, the mixture held together very well and also during the pan-frying. The dipping sauce included with the recipe has a good, spicy Cajun flavor. I happened to have some homemade garlic aioli and honey mustard that I also enjoyed with the crabcakes. Thanks for the great recipe, Tracy!"

"reviewBody": "I must admit I was prepared not to like these. What, no mayo? What’s with all the herbs? (I used fresh). It also seemed liked an overload of seasoning and way too many vegetables for the small amount of crab. I thought Hubs would appreciate them even less. His sensitive innards would never be able to tolerate all that Sriracha in the sauce, I thought. But he said he wasn’t interested in having any crab cakes anyway, so I proceeded. But he tried them and ended up eating two of them – we were both surprised at how much we liked them! So different, so flavorful, spicy and fresh tasting! Proof that sometimes it pays to go outside of your comfort zone and try something new and different."

"reviewBody": "I have made this recipe twice: the first time without dipping sauce, and I used some fresh parsley I had around, and made my own cajun seasoning. It was very good (4.5 stars). The second time, I made it according to directions (2.5 stars-- maybe I misread them): dried parsley flakes do not hack it for me; Tony Cachere's seasoning has way too much salt; and I have to believe that there is a typo on the dipping sauce: we could not eat it, way too salty. IMHO, make it with fresh parsley; add 1/2 lemon's juice, cut the Tony Cachere's seasoning in half; use one tsp of basil. Better yet, make your own cajun seafood seasoning mix: 1/2 tsp salt,1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp white pepper, 1/4 tsp cayeene, 1/4 tsp crushed peppers (like you use on pizza), 1/4 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp thyme, 1/4 tsp oregano, 1/4 tsp onion powder-- use 1/2 of this mix and add salt judiciously after tasting the final mix before forming the cakes. I don't know what to do about the sauce-- the cakes are so good alone we don't need it anyway.\n--Bill"

"reviewBody": "Similar experience as boomzila’s 12/26/12 review w/ our first four crab cakes not holding together. Wonder if using fresh vs. canned lump crabmeat could be the cause (ingredients list does not specify although Tracy mentions using fresh in her lead in; if using canned crab, suggest not only draining {which was done} but also squeezing out any excess moisture {which was not done}). Cracker crumbs were added and the remaining mixture was left in the fridge for awhile which then made the cakes bind together noticeably better. The crab cakes were pretty tasty although a bit salty. If made again, the following changes would be made: (i) use the Creole Seasoning Blend by Joslyn from this site and omit the Tony Chachere's® Creole seasoning (homemade allows you to control the sodium content); (ii) to better bind the mixture if using canned crab, add three large eggs instead of two, use 14 Keebler Club® crackers, and refrigerate the crab mixture for at least one hour; and (iii) eliminate pan frying in oil by baking/broiling them as other reviewers did. We wasted ingredients by making the spicy Cajun dipping sauce as Tony Chachere's® seasoning made a salty sauce for our tastes thereby elevating the overall saltiness of the crab cakes . . . no one used the sauce after an initial taste test. We’re only rating the crab cakes as the sauce need not be an integral part of this recipe."

I have a feeling that if I had broiled them they would have held together without the additions. Be careful when adding creole seasoning, some have drastically different salt contents and its hard to adjust when you shouldn't taste the mix with raw eggs in it."
