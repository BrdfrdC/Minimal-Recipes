I cooked the roux until a little past peanut butter brown color. It turned out perfectly! I also added diced smoked sausage to the pan with the onion, garlic and bell pepper. I substituted canned tomatoes and chicken stock because that's what I had in the pantry. Overall, this is a great dish that's easy to prepare and tastes delicious!"

"reviewBody": "What I love about this recipe is that the roux is easy to make and deepens the flavor of the etouffe, for a truly authentic taste. It's the better etouffe recipe on this site. TIP: The recipe is perfect as written, but I also make it with an extra tomato added OR 1 tomato and 1 can of stewed or diced tomatos. The recipe is really flexible, so you if you like tomato flavor, sometimes I even add a 1/2 cup or 4 oz. can of tomato sauce. It tastes amazing as long as you get the roux proportion right! :) I also like green onions, so I top it with a T of chopped green onions like I do my baked potatoes. Delicious! My family always asks for seconds!"

I used fresh shrimp and made a quick broth from the shells to sub for fish stock. I don’t know what “seafood seasoning” is. If it’s Old Bay I’ll I pass. I added Creole seasoning, and skipped adding the cayenne and hot sauce. It turned out delicious."

"reviewBody": "This is very good, but I learned from some excellent Cajun cooks to make the roux in the microwave. Just melt your butter and flour and stir, microwave for about three minute intervals until you get the color you want. It usually takes about nine minutes for a peanut butter color or a little longer for a darker roux. Use a large glass bowl to prevent an overflow. I have never had a burn using this method. When the roux is done, I mix in the vegetables and put in a pan on the stove top and proceed with the directions."

It makes it a rich flavor vs a floury taste. It will go from a light brown to burnt quick. It needs your full attention to keep stirring to achieve the color. Then quickly remove from burner or add the next ingredients quickly to stop the browning. Recipe as is... IS PERFECT! I like it spicy. This time instead of the cayenne pepper I'm going to try chipotle pepper."

We don't have crawfish anywhere near me so I went with 2 lbs of peeled shrimp and I also decide to cook the onions, celery, garlic and green pepper in oil first and then took them out and put them aside while I made the roux. I couldn't find fish stock so I used a 8 oz bottle of clam juice and that worked out fine. Once I had the sauce going I put in the diced tomatoes for 5 minutes and then added back in the onions, peppers, celery, garlic mixture and then added the peeled shrimp for 10 minutes until they turned pink. Served it over rice, but it would probably look better with a formed cup of rice in the center sprinkled with some cilantro or parsley."

Taste them at 5 mins, and unless you live at high altitude, they'll be done.... Happy Cooking!!!\n\nOops, forgot to add...

I lived in Louisiana for five years and although it's not \"required\" I can't live without catfish with my etoufee (see picture with fish!) I didn't have any fish stock so I used chicken broth and helpful hint: I learned from a food blogger that you can simmer your peeled-off shrimp shells in water or other stock to turn it into \"seafood stock\"!"

"reviewBody": "The author must be from the N. O. area. Cajuns don't normally use tomatoes of tomato products in their gumbos though there are about as many recipes as there are cajuns. The basic recipe is a 50% oil to flour mixture for the roux, the cajun trilogy (onions, bell pepper &amp; celery), almost any combination of meat &amp; seafood you can imagine, black pepper &amp; salt and innumerable variations of herbs and spices. It is hard to mess up a gumbo if you get the roux right, it is the key to the recipe. Incidentally, the darker you can get the roux without burning it, the better the taste. Be very, very careful, however as it gets darker since the slightest bit of burned flour will taint the gumbo and there is no known remedy for that."

"reviewBody": "This is an ok recipe. I am from the heart of the Cajun Country. I will tell you, we use 1 stick of margarine / 2 pounds of seafood (ie: 1# Shrimp &amp; 1# Crawfish or 1# Crab meat &amp; 1# shrimp or 2#'s of crawfish, etc.), 1 can of Cream of golden mushroom soup, &amp; 1 can of cream of celery or cream of shrimp. We also add the water to a good thickness. Not heavy and not thin. Chicken stock can be used also. Additionally, 1 cup of crawfish fat, if available. After all the seasoning, we do not use heavy amounts of cayenne because you do not want to over power the great seasonings of onion, bell pepper, celery, etc. Also add 2 tbl. spoon of tomato paste. We do not use fish stock. Reason, it doesn't stay long with the fish stock in it. We also do not use chopped tomatoes."

"reviewBody": "We love creole/Cajun recipes and this one is excellent. Tasting it after adding the seafood(old bay) seasoning I thought it would be too salty but when served with rice, it came out perfect. I felt the heat was spot on with the amount of cayenne in the recipe but if you are not keen to spicy foods you will likely want to reduce it. Crayfish isn't readily available where I live so I opted for 2 lbs of shrimp. I do feel the cook times are a little off and reduced them slightly. I've made roux numerous times and it does take a while to get right. Overall it took about 30 minutes start to finish until the dish was served. I only have to kick myself that I forgot to get a loaf of crusty bread to go along with it."

What sucked about it is it didn't look anything like the picture. I followed the recipe exactly. When the roux got to be a \"peanut butter\" brown it was still very runny and oily. So I took the suggestion of one of the reviews and cooked it a bit longer to a \"milk chocolate \" color, at which point it actually started to thicken up but was still quite runny. But then everything is a dark brown-the vegetables and seafood. Nothing was pretty or presentable about it. I will definitely make this again but next time I think I'll use butter instead of oil and see if that doesn't make a difference. Oh! I did make brown rice instead of white rice as we don't like white rice as well. Also, I couldn't find crawfish anywhere so I doubled up on the shrimp."

"reviewBody": "Absolutely wonderful recipe to jump off of. For the roux, I used 1 stick of butter because by eyeballing it, I didn't think 1/3 cup was enough. Cooked it to peanut butter color, whisking constantly so as not to burn it, and had zero problems. And that was my first time making roux! I had to omit the bell peppers because of a picky eater, so I just increased the onions to compensate. I also used a large can of medium-heat Rotel instead of the fresh tomatoes, and was so glad I did! I made the mistake of draining some of the liquid from the can, I won't do that next time because I had to then increase the amount of seafood stock to get the consistency right. And instead of the seafood seasoning, I used 1.5 tablespoons of \"Slap Ya Mama\" seasoning. Once it got close to the desired consistency (a little thinner), I added my 2 pounds of crawfish tails from our last crawfish boil, let it simmer about 10-15 minutes, and it was beautiful. It got a Ragin' Cajun's nod of approval (he had thirds ), and was hot enough for an East Texas country boy who loves his spicy food. For those who can't hardly handle pickled jalapeños for the heat level, SEASON CAREFULLY. This will be crazy hot for you... But for us Southerners, it's perfect. (Tip: I use the rice you steam in the bag in the microwave. So much easier.)"
