When I tried the recipe as written, it was too hot, and combined with the amount of pepper, it was close to inedible. I cut back on the green onions and parsley because 1 cup each is a ton and you just don't see that much in the photo. I think you can even go less. But, after the changes, the whole family ate it and enjoyed it. Thanks! Will do again."

Was surprised to learn that none of these were included and was excited to try the plethora of spices. I followed the recipe to the exact measurements. I even bought all the fresh ingredients. \n\nI made one mistake and added to much salt, which I immediately tried to scoop out. To compensate, I added the rest of the whipping cream and added some 2% milk (under the direction of my husband). \n\n An hour later, I am still tasting the warmth of this dinner. What a sensation to the palate. The such was hot but not overwhelming. I savored every piece. Never had thyme in my food (that I know of), WOW! \n\nFettuccini is definitely the serving pasta. And you put have Italian Bread, Carangi's serves the best seeded load and New York Bakery has the best sandwich roles and tomato pie."

"reviewBody": "we loved this recipe--thank you!!\nSo, I have been making this for almost 7 years now!! I make it 3-4 times/year &amp; I make enough that we eat it for several days. I have made it every which way adding this or subbing that until we found the way we like best. We like it thick like alfredo, so I start out making a roux with 1/2 c unsalted butter &amp; 1/2 c flour. After the roux is done I stir in 1 qt 1/2 &amp; 1/2. I saute my green onions (the whole onion + the green part) in a smidgen of butter in a separate pan &amp; add it to the pot. Add all the herbs &amp; spices-I use all dry. I also add about 1 1/2 T of garlic powder &amp; about 3 T of Cajun seasoning. I heat until it starts to boil &amp; it will be thick. Place on back burner on warm while starting the fettuccine. Noodles take about 12 min, so when they have been in for 6 I turn up the heat on my sauce to med &amp; I add my cheeses (little @ a time) &amp; 2 lbs of med shrimp &amp; 1- 12oz pkg of Imitation crab sticks cut into big chunks. Let the seafood heat up &amp; it is done. I also LOVE fresh sauteed mushrooms with this, but have to add them separately because kids won't eat them. Thank you so much for a recipe that we have enjoyed for years &amp; will continue to do so!"

I adjusted the recipe by using 1/2 &amp; 1/2, used corn starch to thicken, omitting the white pepper, using only 1/2 teaspoon of black ground pepper and just a touch of red pepper flakes, omitted the swiss cheese and added a splash of vermouth. If I have seafood in a dish, I like to taste the flavors. The changes I made allowed the seafood to shine."

Either way, I changed a few things from the original so I don't use the recommended amount for the spices I tend to just guess on it. The other changes made is that I use swiss and mozzarella instead of parmesan, I also switched the scallops with chicken I pan fry the chicken with garlic salt and seasoned salt and add lime before mixing it in with the sauce at the end. Either way, it has become my best dish that keeps evolving and one that my family keeps asking for."

Plus by cutting down the spice, the \"flavor\" of the pepper shone through, which I really liked. I used a pound of shrimp and no scallops (we're on a budget), and added some button mushroom caps that I wanted to use up, which sort of took the place of the scallops pretty well. We really liked this meal."

The fresh herbs made for a very nice presentation and the spices made for a nice Cajun flavor without being overpowering. Don't overcook this into a clumpy clabbered mess like some of the photos show. The sauce should creamy. Anything else and you overcooked it. If there is anything negative I could add it would be that you could reduce the salt slightly, but that is just a matter of taste."

Due to some substitution comments, I made the following substitutions: I put in 50% more scallops, added 3 cloves of minced garlic, mushrooms, and green peppers that I sautéed separately and added after the sauce boiled. Substituted part of the salt and white pepper for Cajun seasoning. I sautéed the shrimp and scallops with butter separately until they were almost done, and added them at the end with the cheese. I definitely agree not to make the pasta until the sauce is almost done, and that simmering as long as possible makes it richer. Everyone LOVED this. I'll be making it again!"

To allow myself more time with guests I pre-cooked the pasta and pre-steamed the shrimp and the scallops. This allowed me to simply make the sauce and fold in the pasta and seafood with a five minute turn up of the heat at the end to heat the dish back up to serving temperature. \n\n2. I halved all of the pepper measurements. I and a couple of my guests like our food mildly spicy on occasion, and a couple of my guests are crazy for hot/spicy food, so I figured half measurements would work for all of us. Even at half strength this dish is HOT HOT HOT. I could not imagine making this dish at full strength even for the spicy lovers.\n\nThis dish was amazing, and I will most definately make it again!"
