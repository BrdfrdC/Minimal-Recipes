"reviewBody": "I thought that this was a solid recipe. I'm wondering though if the people who claim that it was far too salty were using table salt instead of kosher salt. I started with half the salt and found it a little bland. So I actually added a teaspoon of MSG instead of salt. And that seemed just about perfect to me. I did not add the pepper flakes. I thought the heat level was good and did not need to be increased. One thing that I did find initially was that the thyme just felt like little sticks in my mouth so I put the whole thing in my spice grinder for 10 or 15 seconds. That seemed to take care of the thyme problem and mixed everything up very well."

If you have to go out and pick up a bunch of spices to make this work, you might as well just grab one that's already done. I really like Dede's Cajun Cuisine's southern spices. Pre-mixed, ready to go, so I can just get to cooking without the hassle of having to worry about if I have the right portion of spices to make it work. Check it out https://dedescajuncuisine.com/"

"reviewBody": "It was basic, so I added celery seed and dried minced onions to copy part of the holy trinity. I like to emphasize the flavors of what I am going to be making in the dry mix. IE, I include dried mustard in my bbq rub because I add mustard to my liquid bbq sauce. And I never add salt to my rubs. I have high blood pressure and carefully regulate my salt. Also, it is so flavorful that you only need a small amount to balance the flavors on your tongue."

However, I did add a little bit too much Cayenne because I was careless and moving too quickly so I might cut that back a little bit next time. We both like really spicy food, and it was a gradual build-up of heat but as we can ate dinner it got hotter and hotter, which is fine, but we weren't expecting it. But I will definitely be making this again!"

Something seems to be missing for our tastes - perhaps a bit of chili powder (like in the brand of Cajun seasoning blend we purchase). We are very sensitive to salt and I cut that to about a half of a teaspoon. We'll see how this tastes on shrimp in a few days. Thanks for sharing a tasty recipe."
