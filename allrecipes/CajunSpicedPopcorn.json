Didn't have onion powder, but had the rest of the ingredients and adjusted to taste... didn't bake it either, just added the spice to regular popcorn we made on the stove.\n\nWe felt that it needed a little sweetness, so we added a drizzle of maple syrup along with the melted butter we poured on top.. made it perfect!"

Used Orville's Naturals lightly salted bag of popcorn ......which I shook the seasoning right in the bag of popped corn. I loved the spice of the cayenne and the tang of the lemon pepper. Yummy!"

"reviewBody": "This was really good and addictive. I made this with microwave popcorn and used about half the recommended spice/butter mixture for it. I also used seasoning salt instead of regular salt. I baked it but only for about 7 or so minutes as I got concerned about burning it. One thing I did do was line a baking sheet with some parchment paper before I put the popcorn down. This made removal easy because I was able to just lift out the parchment paper and it made cleanup even easier (no greasy pans). Thanks for the recipe!"

I also only roasted it for maybe about 8 minutes. By the way I was temped to skip the time in the oven and I am glad it did not, it mellowed the flavors and blended them nicely. Thanks for the recipe."
