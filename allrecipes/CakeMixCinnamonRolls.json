"reviewBody": "These were excellent. I was afraid they would be too cake like or too sweet but they werenâ€™t. Next time I will put them in two pans - maybe a 9X 13 and an 8 X 8 because they did not cook evenly when crammed into just the one pan. I had to remove the edge ones (by that I mean eat them haha) and put the rest back in the oven for another 15 minutes. I think giving them more room will help with that. I used my kitchen aid mixer to knead the dough and probably used closer to 5 c flour. I dipped the cut rolls into melted butter then placed them in a pan that was sprinkled with 1/3 c brown sugar and pecans. I drizzled a little extra melted butter on top. Highly recommend and will make again!"

Thus resulting in a double batch which is fine by me. I added my own filing and topping because I was only looking for a different dough. The dough was not better or worse, just different. I did find however that the dough was easier to work than standard bread dough. Nice take on an old classic!"

"reviewBody": "These are very good! I wish, though, that I had watched the video. I followed it to a T, including Step6, which was a total disaster. Instead of trying to make the rolls, dip them in butter, then dip them in sugar/cinnamon and then letting them rise, the next time I will make the rolls, put them in the pan, let them rise, brush on the butter, then sprinkle on the sugar and pecans. So much easier and cleaner! I am going to try them next time with the \"Perfect Cinnamon Roll Icing\" mentioned in other posts. I guess it depends on how you wind up cutting them as to how many you fit in the 9x13 pan. I had a few leftover with nowhere for them to fit. Put them in another pan. Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed."

HOWEVER, the flavor is awesome and Iâ€™ll make this again and again even though I butchered it this time around. The dough was so sticky I just rolled it the best I could, literally scraped it off my counter top into a 9x13 pan and baked it like a cake. Glazed it and served it warm. It was really good! This will be my go to cinnamon bun recipe. So easy, especially if you have a stand mixer and a dough hook. And Iâ€™ll definitely pay attention to the amount of flour next time I make it!"

"reviewBody": "I've made several different Cinnamon Roll recipes from this site and this is the best. The taste of the roll itself, minus the sugary goo inside, is excellent. It is the easiest to roll out, which is a major plus, and it is easy to remember with few ingredients and nice round numbers. I made a few mods, and I realize that triggers people, but personally, I read reviews for ideas on how to modify and substitute. My mods, I believe, have no bearing on the quality of this recipe. I make them because I have trouble following rules. If your triggered by mods, please ignore this review. So, I only had 15 oz of cake mix, I added a small box of vanilla pudding and an egg. I used a little more than a tablespoon of Instant Yeast, and used bread flour (because that's all I had). If anything, I believe the bread flour would make it harder to roll out. Oh, and I didn't measure the flour usage too well and I'm sure I used over 5 cups."

My feeling is if you're going to go through the trouble to use yeast and wait for it to rise you might as well make the real thing, it will have better flavor, a crispiness to the bottom and best of all they don't go stale as fast."

This was during COVID-19 and I didn't have enough packs of yeast but had bread rapid rise, so my third pack was that and I put a little too much the yeast taste was overwhelming for me. but Hubby loved. THE BEST THING ... I froze 1/2 the roll for later. Brought out, thawed, sliced let rise 30 min - baked etc.. These were the BEST oh My !! they were better than the first 1/2. Freezing to save for later - works.. NOTE they will still rise in the frig. I vacuum sealed the second 1/2 of roll after flash freezing it."

However, I've noted this posting utilizes a third pack of yeast, as compared to the previously posted identical recipe which only used 2 and resulted with a more dense texture. The addition of a cake mix provides limitless options. Why not a strawberry cake mix with a preserve filling, or lemon cake mix with coconut filling? Trust me. You will love trying this one! I'm going to try a carrot cake mix with cinnamon raisin filling and cream cheese frosting next."

"reviewBody": "I made this twice. After reading all the comments about how wet the dough is and how it makes about 2 dozen large rolls with all the flour that is added, I halved the recipe and only used 1c of liquid (1/2 c water + 1/2 c almond milk) with 2 teaspoons of yeast - 3 packages seems like way too much! I did not want to make such a large quantity so halving it worked out well for me.\nI ended up adding about 2 1/2 c of flour. I still got 10 good sized rolls and baked them in a 9 x 9 pan. I didn't dip in butter and sugar and used a cream cheese icing instead but felt it needed more cinnamon flavor. The bread flavor was good and the texture was pretty light but I would not consider it cakelike as some people described. \nMy DH really enjoyed them so I made it again a few days later using the other half of the cake mix. This time I sliced into 9 rolls so they fit perfectly into my 9 x 9 pan. I increased the amount of cinnamon to 1 1/2 teaspoons and dipped the top side in cinnamon sugar (no nuts) this time.\nBy the way, I use sewing thread to \"slice\" my rolls. Just wrap the thread around where you want the cut, cross the ends of the thread and pull. You get a nice clean cut without squishing or flattening the rolls. I also used someone's else's tip of smashing down the center of the roll so it does not rise in a dome shape. \nI'm wondering if anyone has had any luck freezing the rolls? It would be so convenient to take out as many as needed and letting them thaw and rise before baking so"

I used 3.5 cups (along with the cake mix) and it seemed about right but still took at least an hour to rise (yes, I kneaded the dough at least 10 minutes). After rolling them out and putting them into the pan, it took a little less time for them to rise, and they turned out beautifully. They were good, but not delicious, and even though I had a crowd to feed and they were grateful for them, no one said how good they were. They were sort of \"meh.\" I'll keep looking for the perfect cinnamon roll..."
