"reviewBody": "Delicious but there are a few errors in this recipe. recipe says “lightly floured surface” but you’ll need more flour than that. Do yourself a favor. Cover the area with parchment paper where you plan to knead, cover that with 3/4 cup flour (but keep an additional 1 3/4- 2 cups on hand in a bowl) and add to that from bowl as needed. Then knead dough directly with rolling pin. Wax paper between rolling pin and dough is not necessary. I found no “Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe Spice Cake” mix at neither Target nor Market Street. But at the latter, I did find Duncan Hines Signature Spice Cake mix. All errors considered, I’d still make this recipe again as it was very tasty. However, personally, I preferred the cookies that I didn’t roll out as thin as 1/4 in. because I like them more soft than crunchy."

We really liked this recipe since we were looking for a gingerbread cookie that wasn’t as bold flavored as some recipes."
