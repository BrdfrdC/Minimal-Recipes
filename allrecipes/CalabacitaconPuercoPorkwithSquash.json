"reviewBody": "This is one meal that has been a favorite in my family for many generations with one difference. We use chicken instead of pork. Not as much liquid or maybe none needs to be added since the squash (Calabacita) releases a lot of juices. The dish is simmered on low heat with a tight lid as a last step."
