"reviewBody": "This recipe was actually extremely easy and amazing, but I did do things a little different. 1. For the BEST and most tender meat, I used Zoup Bone Broth and no water (almost a gallon) and cut the boneless chuck into cubes and added to the broth. I allowed it to tenderize for 4 hours on a slow boil. 2. I added an 8oz can of tomato sauce and a tbsp of tomato paste. 3. I added about 3 tbsp cumin, 2 tbsp each of garlic and onion powder. I also added 4 tbsp of Knorr Beef Bouillon powder to taste. 4. I saut√©ed minced garlic and the onions for the soup with olive oil into the onions were a translucent yellow. 5. I let the soup slow boil with all veggies for an hour, and added about 3 celery stalks cut into 1/3rds. Overall, the soup was a HIT! So flavorful and my family loved it! Add some Mexican rice to it for an even heartier flavor!"

The sliced fresh jalapenos and lime for serving is a must ! This soup is really wonderful and we will definitely make this again."

The one thing I noticed is my family had to take the soup out of the bowl, cut it up and put it back to eat it.. I thought that was a waste. I follow everything but cut everything small, further I use marjoram, garlic, green beans, and hot pepper as well as dice a couple very hot peppers into the soup. \nAbsolutely wonderful..

Add minced garlic when you add the onions.\n2. I also use Better than Bullion beef paste for extra flavor (and salt!) add some when browning the meet and add some to the broth while cooking. It makes a WORLD of difference in the heartiness of the broth!! Beef Bullion would work too.\n3. Add one yellow squash and one zucchini."

I season the meat with Badia Sazon Completa. After adding tomatoes and broth, I add a teaspoon, or slightly more, of cumin, coriander, Mexican oregano, and Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning along with 2 bay leaves. When I add additional water, I put a few shakes of Knorr's powdered chicken bouillon and sometimes toward the end I add torn corn tortillas for flavor and thickening."

As for the rest, just a lot of chopping! Also, use fresh corn on the cob. I read reviews where they said it came out mushy. Fresh is the way to go!"

I rarely waiver on the ingredients unless I am adding more meat or decreasing quantities so to make a smaller batch. And yes, I do use chayote and add the radishes. Since I live in the Rio Grande Valley, chayote is pretty easy to obtain from my local HEB. I prefer the can Rotel Diced tomatoes (roasted, if available) with green chili's...a little extra heat adds to it. C"

"reviewBody": "I added fresh chopped garlic, a little boullion, an extra potato, an extra carrot, and two extra ears of corn. Instead of a medium/small cabbage, I used a large cabbage. This recipe was incredibly hearty and tasty, but there was less broth than I would like, so I made a second smaller pot of just beef stock, cabbage, and onion and then added it to the original soup pot. In traditional caldo de res, you wouldnt normally use tomatoes, and while it did add some flavor, I felt that it didnt taste as authentic. I would also suggest chopping up one jalape√±o and adding it to the soup in the last ten minutes to give it a kick. \n\nThis recipe fed six adults for three meals! I will be making it in the future, but with the amendments described above."

Not being much of a meat eater, I liked that the soup is predominantly vegetables. During the harvest it is easy to use all of the available vegetables from the garden. The only thing I needed from the store was the beef, beef stock, and the lime!"
