I added a 12 oz. package of frozen baby limas along with the canned beans but didn't precook them and they weren't cooked enough. Tonight I added all the leftovers to a pot and slowly simmered them about 30 minutes, and this is the dish I remember loving."

I also use 4 cans of beans-usually add black beans to what recipe calls for and drain and rinse all but the baked beans-Bush's of course! Reduce the brown sugar but sometimes add a little molasses, use more onion and a little green or red or both adds to the flavor levels. Great recipe-for us it's a meal and add some corn muffins-perfect!!"

It's not quite as sweet and the peppers add something is was missing!"

I love sweet things, but not this. I think in order to enjoy this recipe you have to remember 2 things. 1-this in no way is reminiscent of ham and beans &amp; 2-if you make this you better like pork and beans. Sadly I doubled recipe so it was a waste of time and ingredients."

If it’s supposed to be a baked beans side dish, it doesn’t have that flavor profile either. I tasted it after adding each ingredient from the recipe. It started tasting off to me after I added the vinegar (and I love vinegar). Even before I added sugar I wasn’t a fan, so I don’t think it’s the sweetness. I wanted to like this, but it just didn’t make sense to my taste buds."

When I make this again, however, I will reduce the amount of brown sugar because it was too sweet for me. For my taste, I might even skip the sugar altogether or maybe substitute molasses, and throw in a half cup of cut green beans just for color and crunch. Otherwise, a great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This is a mandatory dish at our family reunion. I rarely measure anything and change it up every once in a while, but even though they never come out the same way twice, everyone loves them. I use all of the listed ingredients with the exception of dry mustard, I use prepared and I use cider vinegar instead of white. I also cook the bacon until crisp and remove and drain it leaving some of the bacon grease in the pan to saute the onions in. I cook the ground beef separately so that I can drain the grease off of it. With the exception of the pork and beans, I drain and rinse all of the other beans. I use dark red kidneys, baby butter beans because they are closer in size to the others and pinto beans. I always add lightly sauteed red and green bell peppers and sometimes hot Hungarian wax peppers. I also sometimes add sauteed matchstick cut carrots. If I have an opened bottle of barbeque sauce in the fridge, I put some of that in as well. I have made this with all ground beef and with beef and sausage, either way it is alway a hit. I take it to the reunion in a six quart slow cooker and I am disappointed if there is not any leftover since it's just the two of us and it makes too much to be practical to make regularly at home. You really can't go wrong with this when you adapt it to suit your tastes. If you don't like really sweet baked beans, use less sugar. If you like a little heat add hot pepper. The key to a successful recipe is to taste as you go and adjust accordingly."

I use as a main dish, not a side dish as it is filling. Sometimes I lighten it up by using turkey bacon (or less real bacon) and less sugar to reduce the calories a little. It's really delicious. It doesn't reheat very well though. If you microwave leftovers it just doesn't taste the same as when you eat it the first time."
