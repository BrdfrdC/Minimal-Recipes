Used BBQ sauce vs. catsup, reduced brown sugar in half, used apple cider vinegar vs. white wine vinegar. Browned the celery with the hamburger and onions as many reviewers didn't like the uncooked celery taste/texture. This casserole is heading to a neighborhood picnic with the bacon crumbled on top of it today. We sampled it and it's delicious!"

My entire family loves it.\nI do make it with a couple of tweaks. Typically, I also add a can of drained green beans and a can of drained wax beans. Really, any type of beans will work in this casserole! I also use just regular white vinegar, and often substitute prepared mustard for the mustard powder.\nA really hearty, fiber-filled dinner option!"

"reviewBody": "I made these as a replacement for Boston style baked beans to accompany BBQ Ribs. Just wanted something different, these fit the bill perfectly. I deleted the ground beef and added a can of great northern beans I had on hand, I made no other changes. These were a big hit with everyone at the gathering. They were a little soupier after baking the first hour covered than I really wanted them to be so I baked them another 30 minutes uncovered and the consistency was perfect. We all love all kinds of beans so next time I may add more kinds of beans, but that will be the only changes I make, these will be added to the rotation as a Casserole with the ground beef but also as a substitute for other baked beans. Very versatile recipe, loved it."

One pot had 3 strips bacon that had been browned then removed, then added beef, onion and celery including tops! The other pot I heated EVOO and added the onion and celery …. browned everything in each pot....followed by half the bean mixture to each. I used BBQ for the veg version ( wishing I had liquid smoke )and half BBQ and ketchup for the other, red wine vinegar because it was low and I'm trying to use it up and mustard powder. ( I added a little extra ketchup and mustard powder to the meat version because the man is a fan of both). Also, chopped the cooked bacon and threw it in the meat pot. I did not add any sugar because I was making sweet cornbread....I simmered on the stove covered for ease of preparation. This is fantastic!! Thank you Kathy!!!!"

Bumped up everything in the sauce by another half recipe. Added 1/2 cup smoky Bbq sauce instead of more ketchup, and 1/4 cup of maple syrup instead of brown sugar (3/4 cup brown sugar used). Used prepared mustard instead of dry mustard (2tbsp). Added 1/2 cup of red peppers. Very happy with the results! Next time I'll use one less can of beans, so I won't have to tinker with the sauce so much."

"reviewBody": "As other reviewers have said before me, you can mix any beans &amp; achieve a great dish. I didn't have all the beans listed - I used northern beans, pinto beans, a can of mixed beans &amp; baked beans. I also replaced ketchup with tomato sauce &amp; some sausage for the bacon. I cooked it all in a crock pot. The recipe is not something I would ever have tried but it popped up when I was looking for something else. I read quite a few of the reviews and decided to go with what I had to make it as close to the recipe as possible. Really glad I did. I'll be making it again with all the ingredients as listed. Thanks to the poster."

I substituted rice wine vinegar for the white wine vinegar, used regular mustard instead of mustard powder and eliminated the celery completely. It turned out perfectly, not watery but just right. I served it with a loaf of freshly baked bread and the family loved it. Economy wise it was also fairly cheap, I only used 1/2 pkg bacon and everything else I had on hand! Great potluck recipe too!"

"reviewBody": "This is close to a recipe used by my mother years ago. I was happy to find it because she never wrote hers down.\nThis is a VERY good recipe as-is, however the next time I make it I will cut back on the brown sugar by about half and add some sort of hot sauce. I used Sriracha on it after my first taste and enjoyed the kick it gave it, but that may be too hot or garlicy for some. You would have to be careful not to 'over sauce' this however as there was still quite a bit of liquid (soupy) when done. Maybe cut the ketchup in half and replace with Franks or Sriracha and cook the last 10 or 15 mins uncovered on lowest oven rack.\nRegardless, even if you make it as the recipe calls for, it's excellent and my entire family asked why I had never made it before. They loved it."

Even with the extra beans 1/2 C brown sugar was too much. 3. 1/2 C ketchup also seems to be too much. Too ketchupy. 4. As far as I can tell, Lima beans and butter beans are the same thing (ingredients list on the back of can of butter beans says \"Lima beans\"!). This was particularly confusing as the recipe wants me to drain the Lima beans, but not the butter beans!!! :-)"

It's nice to make and bring something that both vegetarians and others can both enjoy! I make this at least once every 2 weeks for him in his recipe rotation and he (we) never tire of it. Try this recipe! Oh, and I use whatever beans I have on hand - as long as you use the pork and beans (or baked beans) the rest of the beans can be any combination and it always tastes great!"

My 3 guys were a bit disappointed there weren't any leftovers to take home! I will make this as a main dish at home again because its tasty, very filling and especially very economical!"

"reviewBody": "A budget-friendly family favorite. However, I do make it a wee bit more economical by starting with dry beans, and cooking them in water with a ham bone from our last ham dinner. Once the beans are cooked, I remove the bone and let it cool. In the mean time, I place the beans in my crock pot with all of the standard ingredients, sometimes going lighter on the ground beef and bacon. Once the ham bone cools, I remove any usable meat from the bone and put it in with the beans. Let it cook for several hours on low. The dry beans don't have the additives that canned beans have, so its a bit healthier, and I usually get enough tasty meat from a ham bone that the family doesn't notice that I used less bacon and hamburger. A win for everyone."

I used one can of chili beans, one can of kidney beans, one can of black beans and one can of great northern beans. I sauteed the onion with the ground beef. I let the meat cook a little before I added the onion so I wouldn't need to add any oil for the onion. I only used 3/4 cup of sugar and eliminated the bacon. I'm sure the bacon would have put it over-the-top amazing, but I didn't want to bother to defrost a whole package from my freezer to use a little here. I will be making this again. Very tasty!!"

As written this recipe is the bomb so meat eaters try it, you will love it. Since then i have become a vegetarian. So is my son and kinda picky so here is what i did to tweak it for us. No ground beef, used 1 cup tvp. No pork in beans, just veggie baked beans. No ketchup (my son hates it), so drained a can of diced tomatoes, pured and used 1/2 cup of that. No bacon and for the smoky flavor I used 4 chilpolte peppers in adobo sauce, pured. My son also hates mustard of any kind so for that mustard tang i used1 small can of diced green chilis. I also used apple cider vinegar because I love it better than white. Everything else was the same as the original recipe. Yes, that was major tweaking on this otherwise awesome recipe but WOW! It came out very very yummy. For you veggie peoples give this tweaked version a try :-)"

(Always use baked beans, though.) Some suggestions for alternates: use shredded roast in place of hamburger, use full cup of brwn sugar but exchange tomato sauce for ketchup, use sausage and 1 lb bacon. You really can change this recipe to totally suit your family's taste or to make it a sidedish instead of the main dish. Also, it freezes well: put leftovers in ziplock baggie to freeze- pop in microwave or heat on stovetop for quick meal. THANK YOU!!!!!"
