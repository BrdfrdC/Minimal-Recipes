I'm not a huge fan of the raw seaweed so I substituted a mixture of flower eggs milk and butter blended together for the seaweed and rice. Couldn't find my soy sauce but luckily I had some tomato paste that believe it or not was a great stand in. The crab wasn't really my style so I used some ham and ice always loved fruit so I used some pine apple. \n\nNow I was feeling a little creative so I added some cheese over the whole thing and instead of rolling it just left it flat. Normally I would be totally fine eating it raw but last week I got food poisening so I decided to cook it. I know the traditional method is to fry it but I baked it for my health. \n\n5 stars. Best sushi ever."

I did alter the fat content by replacing the 1/4 cup of mayo for 2 TBSP of light mayo...big difference if you are trying to lose weight! :) Also, if you don't have a bamboo mat like me you can use a clean heavy towel that is folded into a square with some plastic wrap to roll it up (there are videos on youtube and articles on how to do this). Overall good recipe! I'm going to try it next time with cream cheeese. :)"

"reviewBody": "This recipe was easier than I expected, but requires changes for it to work (at least for me). As prepared, this recipe only made 4 rolls, and the rice was spread too thinly even then. The rice seasoning also had way too much vinegar for my liking.\n\nSo here's what I recommend for a recipe that makes 6 rolls using \n\n2 cups rice (this requires spreading the rice quite thinly, so take your time)\n\nRice flavoring (goes into the rice after it's cooked, as described in the recipe):\n1/4 cup (4 tbsp) rice vinegar\n1/4 cup (4 tbsp) water\n2 tbsp white sugar\n1 tsp salt\n\nFilling:\n- 3/8 cup (6 tbsp) imitation crab meat\n- 2 small avocados\n- 1 small cucumber\n- Mayonnaise is optional. I left it out and the rolls tasted very good nonetheless.\n\nOnce the rice is ready (cooked, combined with the vinegar mixture, and cooled), split it into 6 equal portions and spread each portion as evenly as you can onto the nori. Split the filling into 6 equal portions as well, prior to adding individual portions to each roll.\n\nOtherwise, follow the original recipe.\n\nAnd don't forget to get some Japanese soy sauce, fresh or pickled ginger, and wasabi or horseradish if you like to have something salty and spicy to dip your rolls into!"

"reviewBody": "Just like the \"real thing\"! I made the first batch inside out (nori on the outside) because I forgot to flip them, but honestly, it tastes the same regardless, and it's much easier to make them inside out, so that's how I'll make them from now on. I also shaved the cukes with a veggie peeler, which gave me thin, long strands. It's faster and easier than cutting those tiny spears, and all you need to do is put a few strips on each roll; the length is just right. And finally, I used the recipe on the package of sushi rice, which has different concentrations of vinegar/sugar and also uses salt. I'll be making this often!"

I found that there was not nearly enough rice for the amount of nori sheets stated in the recipe (maybe I laid it on a little too heavy). I ended up making only half (4 rolls). I also found that the crameat filling amount was not adequate. I used whipped cream cheese &amp; a little mayo for the surimi mixture &amp; added some hot sauce to spice it up. All and all, a fair effort with decent results. The recipe was easy to follow and I'm sure I'll become more adept with practice."
