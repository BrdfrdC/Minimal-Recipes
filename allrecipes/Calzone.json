After mixing dry ingredients, I slowly added the water until dough formed a ball in the food Processor. (Had to add a bit more flour as it was too sticky.) Rolled dough into a ball, covered with plastic wrap in a lightly oil sprayed bowl. Let sit for 30 mins....then proceeded with recipe. I prefer the food Processor method over the bread machine as it was quicker. The results were the same with either method."

The dough was pretty sticky so I found that the best way to separate it was not to roll it out but just pull blobs of dough and stretch them out with my hands to be in the right shape. I also found that the dough ended up being pretty thick so you have to really stuff it with as much cheese and toppings as you can fit to get a good ratio. \n\nI added some italian seasoning to the dough as well, but otherwise made it exactly as the recipe was written!"

The bread was fantastic and super easy! I didn't have dry milk, so I substituted the water and dry milk with 1 1/4 cup liquid milk. It rose beautifully and tasted great! Halfway through baking I brushed with butter and sprinkled with grated parmesan cheese. I highly recommend to try out this recipe! We will be making it the day after spaghetti night from now on."

For the people that complain it makes too much \"crust\" have you done what the poster suggested and cut it in half? No, I didn't think so. I mean, why do something intelligent when you can complain instead? When I make the dough any left over gets made into garlic bread sticks."

We opted to use leftover smoked sausage and also left the pizza sauce out to serve on the side for dipping. The entire family loved it! We'll add this into our regular pizza night rotation."

I also added ingredients to the filling that we like; garlic, onion, bell pepper, mushrooms and parmesan cheese. I used olive oil in place of the melted butter on top of the calzone. The dough was soft and chewy inside and had just enough crunch to the outside. This will recipe will be repeated in our home. Try it, I'm sure you will love it!"

I rolled the crust thin, did not mess with the lacing this time, added some spices on the top and served the sauce on the side, as many suggested. It was perfect and I will make it regularly. I used mozzarella with home made cottage cheese (less fat and salt and no preservatives) and added onions, garlic and green peppers, no meat. I split the dough into 5 pieces, made 2 small calzones and one small pizza and froze the other two. Loved the thin crust pizza, as well as the calzones. The frozen dough is just as good as the fresh. Can't wait to try different combinations! Thank you for the awesome recipe and all the helpful comments."

"reviewBody": "I gave this four stars because while it was delicious, there are parts of the directions that could be improved. For example, when we made the calzones, we wanted individual sizes so that we could each choose our own stuffing. It says that the recipe makes four, but those are HUGE calzones. Also, it didn't say what thickness of dough to roll out, and our calzones ended up with crust that was too thick (when you took a bite, it was mostly bread) and didn't have enough cheese (we'll be adding more next time).\nAlso, be warned. If you make the individual calzones and don't seal the edges tightly enough, the stuffing might start to seep out while baking.\n\nOverall though, this made a yummy dinner! We'll definitely be making it again."

The filling could be anything you desire, but I followed with the recipe and used pepperoni (turkey) and cheese. Kids and husband were huge fans of this for dinner, and we are already planning on having it again for Halloween."

I could tell while rolling them out, that this dough was very airy and light. The end result was great and gave a nice chewy texture to the calzones. I made sure to put a few vent holes in the calzones and they took about 30-35 minutes to cook on a pizza stone. I also brushed them with garlic butter and sprinkled with italian seasonings. Thanks for the great recipe!"

I made the dough in the bread machine then divided it I only maked 1/4 of the dough the rest went to the freezer. I rolled it realley thin and filled it then baked it on my pizza stone. It was readey in 15-20 min. I put cornmeal on the stone to keep it from sticking and it worked accept where the sauce came out on one side it stuck a little. Will use this one again!"

We love supreme pizza in my house, so I added red onion, sausage, canadian bacon, black olives, mushrooms and green pepper. I was a big hit that night. Needless to say, no left overs made it! LOL!!!"

First, I follow recipes exactly and think it would have been great. But... I told the hubby what I was putting on it and he said great. Rolled out the dough, put on the sauce, cheeze, pepperoni, olives. Then, he says, hey I want sauteed mushrooms! So, sauteed mushrooms are prepared and added to the prepared calzone. But wait, we are not done, now he wants bacon. So bacon is added. Now, the sauce has run and needs to be dabbed up with paper towels and the dough has risen. So I wrapped and baked. It turned out good, but much larged then any calzone I have every seen. LOL! I am still giving it 5 stars though. Will definately make again, will just make sure \"ALL\" ingrediants are ready before assembly and once assembly begins, no additions allowed!"

This recipe for dough was very good.\r\nI made the dough by hand, and also used milk in the place of water and dry milk powder, as I didn't have any on hand.

Used one less T. of water. When the dough was done, I put it in a bowl in the fridge for 3 hours while I was gone. We are not fans of pepperoni and so I didn't have any. I made a sloppy joe filling. Rolled dough out as stated and cut it into 4ths. Put a heaping 1/2 cup on each plus cheese, then folded over and under like pie crust and used a fork to seal. Let rest on the stove for 15 minutes. These bake bigger so next time I will cut it into 6 pieces. My dh said \"don't make them any other way!\" Oh but the ideas are endless. I LOVED the dough, can't wait to dip it in spaghetti sauce. Thank you!"

Then I made individual hot-pocket type calzones and filled them with sausage, sauteed green pepper, garlic and onion, pepperoni, mozerella cheese and sliced black olives. Right before I took them out of the oven, I sprinkled on some mozerella cheese and a little more Italian seasoning, so that it melted on top. Loved the crust when it came out...crispy but soft on the inside. I dipped in marinara sauce. Next time I'm going to try a spinach and ricotta combination. Thanks for the great recipe!!"

I made two large rectangular calzones and had left over dough. I sealed the dough and froze it for future use. In the calzone I added some ricotta cheese to the mix. Its a versatile dough so you could be creative with the filling. My husband requests that we have these again soon. Thanks for the recipe."

"reviewBody": "I think this is a pretty decent recipe, and I will most definitely make it again. That being said, I did make some changes to the recipe: I let the dough rest for 30 min. after it came out of the bread machine because it was too elastic to roll out right away. I also folded in some garlic powder, salt, and crumbled Italian herbs into the dough before I rolled it out. I put garlic powder into the melted butter that I brushed on top, and I sprinkled grated parmesan cheese on top of that. I thought the calzone was just a touch too bready, so next time I will discard about a third of the dough before rolling it out to make the ratio more to my liking. This is a fun recipe to play with!\nEDITED TO ADD: I decided that I didn't want to throw out the extra dough, so I ended up splitting the dough in half to make 2 separate calzones for us all. Worked out beautifully and eliminated the waste!"
