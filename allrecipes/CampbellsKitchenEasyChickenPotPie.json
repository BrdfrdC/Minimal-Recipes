I add the following to this recipe: increased chicken to about 1 1/2 cups (I had extra chicken and wanted to use it all) 1 can cream of chicken soup, about 12 ounces frozen mixed veggies instead of canned, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 onion chopped (I saute it first), 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning and ground black pepper to taste (I use about 1/2 tsp. because we like spice but 1/4 tsp. would probably be enough). Also, instead of a pie plate I used an 8 inch square glass baking dish. I think it's easier to cut and serve from a square dish. My husband took the leftovers to work for lunch!"

"reviewBody": "Really easy! I gave it 3 stars because I made quite a few changes. Like other reviewers, I used 2 cans of condensed cream soup. I've used many different kinds, but this time, I tried cream of celery and cream of mushroom with roasted garlic. I cooked the chicken with some olive oil, poultry seasoning, and a little chili powder. I also added some potatoes--I cut 4 small/medium potatoes into 1/2 inch cubes, boiled them in water for 5 min (just before they were done, so they would be firm enough to mix), and drained off the water. I mixed all this together with frozen mixed veggies, some black pepper, and dried parsley. A few times when I made this, the poured crust didn't cook evenly. This time, I made drop biscuits with 2 cups of Bisquick and 2/3 cup of milk and dropped/spread them on the top of the pot pie. Then, I covered the dish with foil and baked the whole thing for about 50 minutes at 375F."

I also lowered the temperature to 350 and cooked it for an hour. It was a HUGE hit...even the pickiest eater loved it. I didn't season it as there are some watching sodium etc. But we did use cracked pepper per serving to taste."

I added a couple tablespoons more of milk to make it thin enough to spread. Came out with a golden crust after 25 minutes. Tried this with leftover beef with great results. Will make again and will try different cream soups like chicken, celery, etc."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was easy, and I think it's a good base recipe. But it was very bland. It reminded me of eating from a school cafeteria. First off, salt, pepper and some other spices are a necessity. The filling would be good if maybe you cubed up some Velveeta and let it incorporate to make a cheesy sauce inside. Maybe also use a cheese soup base. The crust needs something, too. It's also very bland. The crust had a nice crunch to it and overall the casserole had a good consistency. It was just missing flavor."

I basically went by the instructions except I went to the deli and had them slice chicken for me (to a #10) and cubed it at home. (I use 3 slices for a serving of 6 &amp; it's more than enough) This little step saved a lot of time! I also use different soups; cream of chicken &amp; cream of potato, etc... but I always use 2 cans &amp; on the veggies I may use 1 or 2 bags, it depends how large my pie plate is. I'm going to try a different crust today because I like a more flaky crust. There's really not much to it and everyone will love it!!! A winner!!!!"

I then sauted mushrooms and onions in the same pan. In a bowl i mixed 1 can of cream of potato and one can of cream of mushroom, 1 bag of mixed frozen vegetables, the mushroom and onion mix and the chicken. I then added that to my baking dish and sprinkled the top with salt pepper and garlic powder. I mixed bisquick with milk until smooth and i evenly spread over my chicken mixture. This was perfect and i'll definatly make this again."

I added another can of the chicken soup and used fresh veggies instead of frozen, which improves almost any dish! I also added some fresh crushed garlic - yummy! To cook the chicken and veggies I threw them all into a pot and boiled it for about 15 minutes. When baking it, I am glad I watched it closely, as I cooked it in my convection oven and only needed to cook it at 350*F for 22 minutes."

"reviewBody": "This is one of our favorite recipes. It is great to take to potluck dinners, new neighbors or sick or recovering friends. It's very versatile. I use different soups - cream of mushroom , cream of chicken, cream of celery and my favorite - cream of potato. I use two cans of soup, sometimes using the same and sometimes two different ones. Then I use one can of Veg-All plus any leftover veggies in the fridge. I also use about 2 cups of chicken - sometimes I bake it in the micro with spices, sometimes I buy one of the roasted chickens at the grocery. You can also use ham. I usually make a double batch and either freeze one or give it to someone. These freeze wonderfully. To freeze, I usually put them in the little individual loaf pans. Makes it so easy to take out one for lunch."

The crust was the best part but the sauce did seem like it was missing something but I also used the reduced fat cream of chicken soup which is probably the problem. Next time I will try adding some additonal seasoning like garlic and maybe poultry. The crust looked like it was going to be super thin but it puffed up nicely"

Baked it for about 40 mins..voila! Now I need to buy more crusts to use up the extra filling I have left."

Nevertheless, I did add Adobo to my chicken mixture. It didn't save it by much. I think the thawed out frozen veggies, which was part of the recipe, just washed out the flavor of the soup, chicken and spices. In addition, I was disapoointed with the biscuit topping. It came out pretty as a picture, but was so bland and did not enhance the dish at all. This one is not a keeper for me."

To the topping I added a shake of garlic and about 1/2 t dried italian herbs to impart some more flavor. I found that it was ok but DH loved it and said I should make again. I really feel it would have been better with the mixed veggies. Perhaps subbing 1 can for cream of potato would also be good(?)"
