I made these changes, based in part on other reviewers' ideas: 1) I substitute one can of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic for one of the Cream of Mushroom cans. Delicious! 2) instead of potato chips, I use fried onions bits. I put them IN the casserole, then also use them for the topper in the last 5 minutes of baking. 3) Sometimes I throw in some shredded mozzarella, if I want a cheesy version, but it's quite rich without it."

"reviewBody": "Iâ€™ve never been a fan of tuna noodle casserole, but for some reason wanted to give it another shot. This was really good! I used kluski style noodles instead of regular egg noodles. I also used cream of onion instead of cream of mushroom (because I had both of those things already on hand) and panko with garlic butter instead of bread crumbs and regular butter (also because thatâ€™s what I had on hand). It was really good! I agree with the other reviewers about needing to double the breadcrumbs though, especially if you want the entire thing fully covered with them vs a slight sprinkle. I hadnâ€™t intended to change the recipe around, but I didnâ€™t want to go to the store so I just used what was in my cabinet. I think it would be good either way though"

"reviewBody": "Great recipe. Makes a simple, but hearty meal; winner every time! I do make one small change. Instead of using breadcrumbs, I use Ritz crackers, and before baking. I crumble the crackers all over the top. No need to measure, just cover to your liking. Then I place pats of butter all over the crackers, again no specific amount, just to your taste, then bake it. Cover while baking, removing cover the last 5 minutes. Gives it a crunchier top, and makes the dish just a tad richer, depending on how much butter is used. \n\nI also occasionally substitute cream of chicken soup for the mushroom when we have a dinner guest that doesnâ€™t like mushrooms. Works just as well, and doesnâ€™t change the taste at all in my opinion."

We did add salt and pepper to the dish after it was served, one of my kids thought it didn't need the extra seasonings, the rest of us did. They asked for it to be in rotation for our menu. Hubby suggested adding Parmesan cheese to the topping so I'll give that a try next time- I just saw it in some of the other comments. Overall pretty good, just needs a kick of seasoning."

"reviewBody": "I didn't have any milk so pretty much had to wing it. I followed the recipe otherwise, but added about 3/4 cup of water (added and mixed in some to each can of soup separately and some to the noodle and tuna mixture.) I realized that cottage cheese is basically milk so threw in a little of that too. Mixed in some shredded cheddar because I'd never tried it that way before and to hopefully moisten it further. Added some onion and garlic powder and a few red pepper flakes. I also doubled the suggested topping and topped that with crushed Lays 'tater chips. I let it set up for 5 minutes before serving so it holds together better. The result was fine, but using milk really would have made it perfect. Still will definitely eat and enjoy this version though!"

I used the ingredients called for but/except: I had no breadcrumbs on hand so used Pepperidge Farms country style cubed stuffing, which I crushed in a ziplock with a rolling pin (walaa- breadcrumbs!) and used about a cup with 1/2 stick melted butter fluffed together over top. Also I added dill weed ( fabulous w tuna), Natureâ€™s Seasons, and garlic powder, as well as sliced black olives, diced onions, and shredded Colby-jack cheese, all mixed in. My husbands mouth is watering waiting for it to come out of the oven."

"reviewBody": "I made something very similar but added 12 oz. of Velveeta Mexican cheese. I split the recipe in half and made 2 dishes: one half of the recipe with a can of condensed mushroom soup and the other half of the recipe with half of a can of condensed chicken soup and half a can of condensed cheddar cheese soup (I put less Velvetta in this one to tone down the spicy and used chicken soup because one person in the fam is allergic to mushrooms). So I used 3/4 of the Velvetta cheese with the mushroom soup one and 1/4 in the other. The last 5 min of cooking I topped one half with bread combs, 2 halves with french's onions, and 1/2 with the jalapeno toppers that are like french's onions (personally the jalapeno ones were my favorite topper). Both came out super good and the whole fam loved it and they are hard to please with new recipes. The one with chicken and cheese soup you could taste the tuna more. I think having more Velveeta cheese and more mushroom soup overpowered the tuna in the other. I would make both again and I would like to try it without cheese like it says in this recipe."
