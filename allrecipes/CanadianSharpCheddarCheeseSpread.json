I use the basic cheese ingredients and to it add: onion powder, cayenne pepper, worcestershire sauce, 1/4 c butter, 2-3 T beer, a dash of hot sauce and 3T of smoked paprika. It keeps well in the frig and also freezes well"

"reviewBody": "I love this kind of stuff but was unsure of my wife so I made half the recipe in case I had to eat all of it. My only change was substituting green onions for the red, using the whites and greens. It was very good and she enjoyed it also. I'll be making this again but adding some crab meat. Our local supermarket sells their own crab/cheese spread that tastes so much like this spread as the base."

I use a half cup butter also, half as much black pepper and a few Tbsp of beer (or near-beer for those who prefer no alcohol). It is a huge hit and everyone wants the recipe. For US cooks, use 1 cup grated sharp cheddar if you can't find the cold pack."
