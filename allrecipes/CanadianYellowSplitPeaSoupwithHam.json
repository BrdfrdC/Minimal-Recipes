Came out fantastic although it’s far from the original recipe."

Surprisingly, the soup was ready to eat in under two hours, even though I kept the heat at a simmer and had the lid barely tilted to let a little steam out, as the recipe instructed. I left out the salt, since so many reviewers said it made it too salty. I guess my ham wasn't salty because I had to add ham to my bowl as I ate it! This is a very easy recipe and makes a big pot, so we'll be enjoying leftovers for awhile."

I don't know whether my ham was saltier than some or if it's just my personal taste - but I never ended up adding any salt and thought the result perfect.\n2. I noticed pictures of the finished soup showed some large pieces of carrot that clearly hadn't started three hours earlier as diced carrot. Rather than dicing all four carrots, I sliced one and added it about 45 minutes before the soup was done."

I used chicken broth instead of water, I also sauteed the onion with a pound of sliced mushrooms before adding to the soup. I omitted the salt and used a chicken bouillon cube. I had leftover boneless dinner ham and cubed it. I also used the celery heart and leaves, not just the stock, and also added a diced red bell pepper. I simmered for a couple hours and it turned out delicious ."

The only adjustment I would make is to double the recipe for even more soup. It didn't last long here. So good!\nUpdate: This works beautifully in my instant pot! 45 minutes on soup/stew and it's ready. No changes to the recipe, easy peasy. Make a double batch, great leftovers! Sometimes I make it without ham if I don't have any and it's still delicious. I add in some chicken bouillon, careful with the salt, you can always add more later."

"reviewBody": "This was great. Made a few minor changes: I forgot to buy yellow peas, so used green, and I actually like the colour better. Didn't have a ham bone, but had leftover bite sized pieces (say a pound or two) in the freezer from our Christmas ham. Used maybe a 1/2 teaspoon of salt at most (plenty comes from the ham). As some others recommended, used 4 cups low sodium chicken broth, 4 cups water. After simmering 2-1/2 hours, I removed about 1/3 of the soup, blended with immersion blender, and poured back in. Simmered for another hour for good measure. Fantastic results - will make this again!"

Some folks like pea soup thick, some thinner; more/less salt, or pepper? Adjust recipe seasonings to your own tastes, obviously. I've made this with a big, smoked turkey leg..awesome. Thin it with water when reheating, if you like. Left overs are great and this soup freezes well too. MAKE THIS PEA SOUP RECIPE! I was impressed."

I cooked it covered in the crock pot (because I'm lazy) all day on low though I did turn it up to high for an hour in the middle of the day to push it along. I had to add some extra ham at the in the last hour because there was not much on the bone. I didn't add salt till the end only because my dad once made split pea soup with too much salt and I didn't want to face that problem. I set the lid ajar near the end until it hit the consistency I was looking for. So simple, so good, my house smelled heavenly all day long. A real keeper!"
