I doubled the butter and brown sugar cause I wanted extra sauce to dip Easter ham in. Simmered about 10 minutes. I also added a dash of both cinnamon and red pepper flakes (other reviewers recommended) and it was amazing! Sweet and a little spicy. I’ll make these often - they were so easy and different from ordinary veggies!"

EASY recipe and great with strong meats (had it with venision). You can decide which sweetener you want to use; I used honey with a touch of molasses. Cook it down to desired consistency but DON'T overcook the carrots. Fresh dill makes a huge difference if you like."

I actually was planning on leftovers since my daughter &amp; her husband do not liked cooked carrots. They decided to try them along with my grandson. After the first bite, they disappeared. They asked for more next week. All my grandsons will be here so I'm thinking I will plan better so they get cooked correctly and I will triple the recipe :-)"

I also doubled the sauce hoping it would give him A major win because he doesn’t normally eat carrots! Adding this recipe to my A+ list."

I followed some of the reviews and sliced on the diagonal ~1/4\", boiled for 2-3 min, then moved to a frying pan that had the rest of the ingredients melted in it. I continually stirred for a only a few minutes, and they got nice and coated with the glaze. Delicious!"
