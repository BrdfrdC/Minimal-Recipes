My hubby and have always purchased these kind of pecans when we go to a flea market, and when I saw how easy this recipe is, I knew it'd be perfect. I didn't really know what the weight was of the Ziploc bag, but I followed the same ingredients, and instructions, and they're absolutely freaking delicious! They're toasted, salty and sweet, with that tiny hint of cinnamon! I wouldn't change a thing, and I plan on making this in the future. Thanks for sharing this! üòÅ"

I HATE cooking, but I make this recipe every Christmas for teachers, family, friends, and co-workers. I get asked for the recipe every year and everyone loves it. So, even though I HATE cooking, I make it every year. I missed the part about the recipe update and ended up with 4 lbs of slightly sugar flavored pecans. I couldn't figure out what was wrong. I went back and read the recipe only to discover that the sugar has been cut by 2/3 and the salt was cut as well. What was a yummy, sweet and salty Christmas treat was reduced to boring pecans with a very slightly sweet flavor. Definitely a stretch to call them candied. Luckily, I was only able to do half of my 8lb batch at a time, so my second 4lb batch made using the old recipe is 5 stars."

I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup, not because it's too sweet, but there's more than can be adhered to the pecans. Substituting brown sugar is a great change, as is adding some cayenne and maple syrup."

Found this recipe and I have made it five times already. Only thing I changed was reducing the amount of sugar a little bit. Seriously so good. \nI like to do half of these candied pecans and roast some plain pecans at the same time. I then lay them out on a piece of wax paper and mix them together then drizzle (more like drench lol) with melted semi sweet chocolate chips. It is heavenly!"
