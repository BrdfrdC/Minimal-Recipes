I did not use OJ, instead substituted with 1/2 cup water; and 2 tsp cornstarch to help thicken the syrup mixture. Can't wait to make it on Thanksgiving Day and serve to our guests. It's quite delicious! Love this recipe!"

Cut the recipe in half, added ginger and cinnamon and made with a mix of oj and mango juice. Yummy. I like the idea of baking the yams ahead of time, I cut them up and then let them soak in the syrup until I bake it. Great recipe for kids to make."

"reviewBody": "Far too much syrup for this quantity of potatoes. Heating then cooling just ends with the yams being very soft on the outside and very firm on the inside. I would recommend dicing the yams and spreading them on the pan without any pre-baking. If you do go the pre-baking route note that it varies by size. Smaller yams will have to be pulled out well ahead of the larger ones. 35 minutes is also way too long for just heating the yams through."
