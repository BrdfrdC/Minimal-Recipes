"reviewBody": "This turned out to be a gooey mess! Worst thing I’ve ever made. Mixture did not set. Discarded the whole thing. I will never use this recipe again. Having done some research on fudge making after this failure, I discovered it didn’t set because it was not brought to a high enough temperature. This recipe makes no mention of bringing the mixture to a boil which is probably what’s needed for it to set. Also I think one single drop of food coloring is all that’s needed to make it look like the photo. My gooey mess turned out a pale green. To the person who submitted this recipe, please make instructions more precise. Do not assume we all know the fact that candy mixtures need to be brought to a high temperature in order to set."

"reviewBody": "This fudge is absolutely beautiful if you leave it white and allow the peppermint chips to color it. When food color is added, it was amazing how few people try those in comparison to the white. I think the fudge was delicious but remember it isn't that super-soft refrigerator fudge everyone has gotten used to- it has texture and body which makes it far easier to present without snagged or pulled edges, or smeared tops. The one thing I would leave out, unless everyone likes strong mint taste, is the peppermint extract. I had quite a few comments that the mint was a little \"too much\" and I would have to agree. The peppermints flavor it nicely all on their own! This is 5 star if you cut down or eliminate the extract. Nice job!"

I set it in the refrigerator for 6 hours and it still had a sticky texture- which is strange because I also made two similar ingredient recipes and they set just fine. I was able to cut it into squares but the tacky texture made it difficult to work with. Also, I lined my pan with non-stick aluminum foil which worked great."

"reviewBody": "First of all, I make A LOT of candy to give as gifts at Christmas and am always on the lookout for new and pretty candy recipes. Well, I made this but mine came out looking nothing like the picture. First of all, I think this would have been much better IF ithe chips and sweetened condensed milk were combined over a double boiler. Yes, mine melted just fine as the directions said but it thickens really quick because of the direct heat. I stirred my peppermint flavoring in off the heat (and the mixture really started thickening up), then the crushed peppermint, and finally the red food coloring. By time everything was combined, mine was more pink than white. Big disappointment! Not sure how to get it to look like red marbled swirls as shown in the picture. \nFlavor is okay - nothing special to me and I do like peppermint candy. I taste more of the sweetened condensed milk than anything. Don't think I'll waste either my time or money making this one again."

I did add more peppermint extract at the recommendation of other reviewers. I tasted it with the amount recommended in the recipe, and I could barely taste any peppermint at all. If you're like me and you like a good minty flavor, you'll want to add more. Also, at the recommendation of other reviewers are used one half vanilla chips and one half white chocolate. The result was a very creamy soft fudge. My husband is allergic to chocolate and this is his new favorite fudge."

"reviewBody": "The recipe, as is, took almost two full boxes of candy canes. I started making this to use up old candy canes from last year but ended up rushing to the store to grab another box. Despite this, the fudge turned out really well. I would suggest leaving out the food coloring as the candy cane pieces make a great pink-marble effect. For an decorative element, just leave a few larger chunks of candy cane to sprinkle on top before the fudge cools. The fudge really cools fast through! Melting the chips on medium heat allows the fudge to cool very quickly, making it thick and requiring lots of muscle to stir. Overall, I will make again, but with a few adjustments."

I recommed busting your peppermints first, the chips don't take long to melt at all. Oh and I saved some to sprinkle on top before I cooled it! I think this will be my yearly Christmas candy??"

"reviewBody": "It is a tasty fudge. But I made it last year and the 1st batch didn't set as \"fudge\" your recipe calls for too much condensed milk. It should only need one can which here is 8 ounz. Last year I did it your way and it was too wet and sticky and wouldn't set. Then I redid it and with less condensed milk and it was more like a fudge. This year I forgot about the the way I did it properly and followed your recipe again and once again 14 ounz of condensed milk is way too much. Basically a waste :("

"reviewBody": "I would have to agree with a previous reviewer... do not use Ghirardelli vanilla chips (my grocery store doesn't carry any other brand of vanilla chips so I had no choice). It ruined my fudge! After it began to melt in the saucepan, all the oils started to separate and oil dripped everywhere while trying to transport it from saucepan to dish. The peppermint oil isn't nearly enough because it barely had a minty taste. It sets up quickly and I had just enough time to add the peppermint pieces before it hardened. After transporting it to a dish, I had to get paper towels to sop up all the oil on top. Then I put it in the fridge.. big mistake! It got so hard you could barely take a bite. Very few people ate it and I ended up throwing most of it away. I will stick to regular fudge from now on."

I served this with a large selection of cookies and this didn't make the top of the favorite list. I imagine if it were served alone, folks would eat it and say it's pretty good, but I don't think the taste really wow's anyone. I suspect the attraction is how festive it looks."

I used a mini food processor to chop up the candy canes, which was much easier than using a meat tenderizer on them like I started doing. I used 12 candy canes, and it was plenty pepper-minty."

"reviewBody": "Thank you for this!!! I cannot eat chocolate so fudge (and holidays in general) are difficult for me to have desserts. This was my first ever attempt at fudge and it came out sinfully divine. I made it for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. It has this wonderful texture, you just can't help yourself. I didn't crush candy canes. I got lucky and found white chocolate candies filled with candy canes at Costco, so I grabbed them up. Then at the last minute I found Andes white and peppermint bits at Target. I added all of the Costco candies and a handful of the Andes bits, everything melted down perfectly. Then I sprinkled the Andes bits on top, beautiful. Oh! I also didn't add any food coloring, since it isn't good for you (LOL! Who cares when making fudge, right! Silly.) but it was very pretty regardless, nice pink color. I suggest you cut it into small pieces just because it is so rich. Enjoy!"

Doubled the mint extract because I wanted it extra minty; a few drops of red food coloring and it's peppermint candy pink! So cute and festive! Only problem I had with the recipe was the instruction to melt over medium heat - I assumed the condensed milk would keep the chocolate from burning, but it didn't. The candy doesn't taste burnt at all, but there are little brown flecks in it. Please use a double boiler to melt the chocolate!"

I leave out the red food coloring, as it tends to come out light pink, and isn't esthetically pleasing. I leave mine in the fridge over night before cutting. It is quite sweet/rich, so I usually cut it into small pieces."
