Then I drizzled in high quality olive oil, and reduced balsamic vinegar. Then salt and pepper.\n\nTo make the balsamic reduction, just boil it for a short time till it's about half the quantity. It becomes thicker and more syrup like. Cool, then use for drizzling."

Threaded on toothpick as per recipe, but next time, will add another tomato and possibly another cheese as well. Very nice appetizer - thanks for posting."

"reviewBody": "I made half a batch exactly as the recipe called for and half drizzling with reduced balsamic vinegar. The half I made according to the recipe was spectacular! The half drizzled with balsamic vinegar and olive oil was awful. The balsamic vinegar conflicted with the flavor of the fresh mozzarella.. or something. I'm not sure what the conflict was but there definitely was one. While it sounded like a good idea that half of the batch was inedible. \nBut the ones made according to the recipe - what a treat! They were packed full of flavor. The only thing I used that was different in mine was sea salt rather than regular salt. Not a big enough change to alter the taste. It's just what I keep on hand. \nA note: When it says drizzle the olive oil over the top... use a light hand. A tiny bit of olive oil is all that's needed."

I did not marinate the cheese as others have suggested, but just added a wine vinegar with the oil and seasoning before serving. Next time, I will marinate half of the cheese to add extra flavor for those who like it. While the family liked it, I noticed that they picked off some the basal leaves. It was too much basal for them. So next time, I will mince the basal and sprinkle it over the tomatoes and cheese. This will add the flavor without the family focusing on the \"green things\"."

Use the marinated mozzarella balls that you can find in most stores that have olive oil and Italian herbs and spices.Assemble cherry tomatoes and cheese on tooth picks and put on your favorite serving dish. Then drizzle balsamic glaze over them and dot the tops with basil paste. A little sea salt over the top won't hurt either. You can buy the glaze by the vinegar and the basil paste is in a tube by the herbs in the produce section. They will disappear quickly at your next party."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is also great with cubes of Feta cheese. The Feta gives it a nice kick of saltiness. However, I like making this into a salad, and toss in sliced black olives with the basil, cherry tomatoes and small mozzarella balls. Suppose a pitted black olive would work with this too. We live in the Mediterranean and this is a standard dish when having guests with grilled meats and fresh aglio e olio pasta."

"reviewBody": "I had this appetizer several years ago at the wedding of a cousin in Italy --- the groom is a chef and has a restaurant on the Italian Riviera. At the wedding, the \"Caprese\" was offered on a skewer, the tomatoes being a bit larger than our \"cherry tomatoes\" - and - there were two of everything separated by a basil leaf (not folded). We have made these many times since, using a toothpick with small tomatoes and tiny mozzarella balls for a cocktail party \"finger food\" --- and using a skewer for serving with a dinner. I can tell you this, as I am sure you have heard many times, an essential of the Italian table has always been that the ingredients are the stars and are used when in season, bought from weekly itinerant farmers' street markets. In Italy, \"picked-fresh\" tomatoes are very accessible and plentiful, and so this \"appetizer\" is not a big problem for the 140 plus wedding guests. There is no vinegar involved --- the \"fresh-picked\" tomatoes were delectable on their own (as they are here when in season) and so the fresh mozzarella and basil (Liguria is famous for its basil, and it was there that Pesto was born). The only thing that is used is the best Olive Oil and fresh lemon juice, with a bit of salt, if desired - and, as I recall, this is true when this \"salad\" is served in Capri, where it originated, as well as other places in that area. Of course, one can \"tweak\" any recipe to taste - just thought I'd contribute to the discussion, for what it's worth."

Trickiest part is pronouncing it (I always forget how to pronounce this word for some reason.. \"cah-PREHY-zay\": for my future reference :-)\r\nI used a marinated mozzarella so didn't add salt, pepper, or oil. Will chuck on a splash of balsamic next time. I used fancy cherry tomatoes which were a variety of types/colors but the best tasting were definitely the red cherry tomatoes- so I will stick with red in future. I used slightly-longer-than toothpick-length, skewer size (fat) wooden picks and they were perfect. Quite yummy! Thank you!"

I made just some slight modifications: since I had globe basil(very tiny leaves)in my garden, I threaded grape tomatoes &amp; mozzarella balls on the toothpicks, stood them in a glass pie plate, sprinkled them liberally with basil leaves, &amp; then drizzled them with olive oil &amp; about a tablespoon of soy sauce. (The soy is an addition my girlfriend always uses &amp; it provides a nice extra note of salty acidity.) The guests loved them &amp; all commented on the convenience of the sticks!"

Cheese, basil and tomatoes are not something either Hubs or I would make a point to snack on, so this was an ideal way to get us both to eat something good for us - not to mention they looked kinda cute on the plate. I didn't halve the cherry tomatoes - I thought they looked prettier whole. The fresh mozzarella balls are called bocconcini and are packed in a watery brine. They're worth seeking out to make these."

The tomatoes and basil were great. It all fit on a toothpick perfectly and looked beautiful as a side for a pasta dish my husband made. Just the cheese. Because it looked so good and I did not follow the directions perfectly, I will try again. Next time I will use small squares of mozzarella and not marinade or add until time to serve. Should be a quick and easy fix. I will also drizzle with olive oil, sparingly, just before serving. At that point I will update my review."
