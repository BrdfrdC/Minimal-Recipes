I broke the graham crackers in half and pressed them right up against each other on the cookie sheet before pouring the mixture. If you have room for 28 crackers on your sheet, the thickness of the topping will be just right."

When I removed from the oven, I sprinkled 6 oz. of chocolate chips over the top and allowed them to melt and then spread over the top. After the bars had cooled for about two hours, I lifted the foil out of the pan and sliced into squares. Ooey, gooey delights! Thanks, Haresj for sharing your recipe :)"

Then baked for 5-7 minutes until it was all bubbly(make sure to check on it, so it won't burn). Then used 2 hershey bars on top and spread evenly. Sprinkled with toffee bits. Would be great to take to a party or special event."
