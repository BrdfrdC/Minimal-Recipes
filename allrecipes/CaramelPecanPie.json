It was difficult to cut through the halved pecans so the next time I will try using chopped pecans. The halved pecans look beautiful though and I am not sure how the chopped ones will affect the look. It would be nice to see a picture of someone who used chopped pecans. I will definitely use this recipe again. I made my own crust Butter Flaky Pie Crust for allrecipe. I like the idea that there is no Karo Syrup in this recipe."

It’s absolutely DELICIOUS! The caramel is sweet enough but not so sweet that the pecans can’t be the star. I haven’t subbed out the candies for the ice cream topping caramel but based on other reviews it may be worth it if you’re short on time. I don’t mind so I melt a good caramel candy brand. try it.... you will LOVE IT!"

I've tried several pecan custard reciped that went straight from the oven to the compost. \nThis pie is too pretty to cut although I did gently move a top pecan over and stole a spoon ful to taste. Delicious little pieces of pecan throughout, lovely melt in your mouth flavor.\nThe mix is super loose going into the pie shell but don't worry. It comes together beautifully after 40 minutes. Will jiggle when coming out of the oven.LET IT SIT. LET IT SIT \nA couple of hours at least until it thickens...yummy!"

"reviewBody": "I made this last night. it is really good. The pecan flavor comes through very nicely and I made it less sweet than it calls for. I used 40 of the individually wrapped Kraft camels. The result was not a huge carmel flavor, but good. I think next time, I will see if I can find better carmels with a stronger carmel flavor. The recipe calls for 3/4 cup of white sugar, but I strongly recommend you trying less than this. I used 1/4 cup and it was plenty sweet for me. Sweetness is a tough one though as everyone likes different levels of sweetness. The main thing to keep in mind here is that its easy to add sugar after the pie is done, if you find its not sweet enough for your taste. You can always add some powdered sugar on top. But its impossible to make the pie less sweet once the sugar as already been made. So best to add less sugar and add more if needed. Its also hard to find a good pre-made store bought crust, so I always recommend making your own. This recipe is a keeper to be sure."

I then poured about 3/4 into egg mixture to temper it. Once I mixed that, I poured the egg mixture into my Carmel. it worked brilliantly! \n\nThis is the first \"homemade\" or \"from scratch\" pie I've ever made."

"reviewBody": "This was a very easy recipe. Upon reading reviews I did make a few changes. Used brown sugar instead of white and reduced it to 1/2 cup. Omitted salt (salt in butter). I did use caramel candies (Brachs) which took awhile to melt. Just b sure to melt on low. Other people have suggested using Smuckers caramel topping to lessen the time. I cooked for 40 mins as my oven cooks fast. After 20 mins, I covered edges of crust with foil so it didn't burn. It will be puffy when you take it out. Don't panic. It will settle down as it cools. I also microwaved 6 caramels, pat of butter(1/2 Tbsp) and dash of milk for drizzle on top of pie. This was first time I made it and will make it again."

It will puff when you cook it and might look like it's going to crack when you take it out but it will settle as it cools and end up looking beautiful."

Not difficult at all....the changes I made were to rough chop the pecans in the mixture then makes a concentric circle of pecan halves on the top. When I say this pie was spectacular, well that's truly an understatement...family said it's a game changer!!!! Unbelievably delicious...everyone raved about it. Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe!!"

Followed recipe exactly and didn't have any problems, used a homemade crust. There wasn't anything wrong with the pie, it just didn't \"wow\" me like I was hoping. Good enough I wasn't embarrassed to serve it, but not good enough to take the place of my regular pecan pie. Really glad I made and tried this recipe but probably won't make again. Thanks for sharing the recipe."

So I used the entire bag.\n \nPer other reviewers, I used 1/2 cup of sugar, Brown sugar. \nI added the brown sugar to the caramel mixture so it would dissolve.\nI doubled the pecans and used a deep dish ready made crust.\nI cooked it for 10 minutes at 400°. 10 minutes at 350°. Then lightly covered, 30 minutes at 300°. \n\nIt wasn't too sweet or too caramelly (is that a word?)\nNext time I might add some chocolate chips. Mmmmmmmm\nWill definitely be making again."

"reviewBody": "I had to make my own crust, to avoid a problem that's been plaguing me recently. I accidentally used salted butter in the crust, so it was way, way, way too salty. Haha, it was a surprise for mother's day, so I couldn't ask for guidance on salted or unsalted butter. That is the only qualm I had with my pie, but it had nothing to do with the recipe. The filling was amazing, mom loved it! The caramel was a journey and lesson learned in melting and mixing.\nIf you have any trouble mixing the caramel, boil a bowl of water and put the bowl containing the mixture and caramel onto the pot, the caramel will melt again in time and it will be easy to stir together, it took me about fifteen, twenty minutes. Once it was melted together, it was all good.\nSo, melting and mixing was a little challenging for the beginner (me), but overall, the pie was wonderful!"

I tried the ice cream topping caramel and personally found it to be inferior to the wrapped caramels. It's not that hard, just open them and slowly melt them, it's worth it. Let the mixture cool a bit before adding it in unless you want scrambled eggs in your pie. I boost the amount of pecans a bit and add an airline mini-bottle of Gran Marnier to take it over the top. Don't over bake it."

I knew it had caramel melted into the filling, so I used that as my guide to choosing a recipe. This one certainly did not disappoint! I think it tasted almost exactly like the bakery one I missed, only perhaps with more caramel? I might reduce the amount next time to 28 caramels, as that was suggested in a few of the other recipes I looked at. The only change I made was to add extra pecans, as they are my favorite and one cup was not enough. I probably used more like 1 1/4 cups, and then added a bunch of halves to decorate the top with. This pie received rave reviews this thanksgiving...everyone adored it!"

"reviewBody": "I LOVE this recipe!! I am always asked by my sister to bring pecan pie for the holidays. (My sister LOVES pecan pie!) This year she said, bring pecan pie but don't put anything \"strange\" (she meant brandy) :) Anyway, that being said, I didn't tell her this had caramel in it although she loves caramel too. Well she Loved this. More surprising I was never a big fan of pecan pie as I found most of them so tooth jarringly sweet that I just couldn't come to like pecan pie. That is until this recipe! I did cut the sugar to 1/4 cup of white sugar and a 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I made 2 on 2 different days and both turned out PERFECTLY!!! Both baked at 350 degrees for 50 minutes. I used Werther's soft caramels and used 33 pieces (I couldn't find any of the Kraft caramels) but the Werther's worked great. I also cut the caramel to 33 pieces. I was surprised that some had bad luck with the pie being runny and not setting up or taking longer to bake. I always use an oven thermometer even though my oven has always been spot on for temperature (there's always a first time). Also, I find now days, the \"large\" eggs today are the small to medium eggs of \"yesterday\". I ALWAYS buy \"jumbo\" eggs in the super market, (but usually buy my eggs from people who have \"backyard flocks\" and these are ususaly heavy hens and lay BIG eggs). Possibly the runny pies that didn't set up were due to small eggs? To those people, I say get jumbo eggs and an oven thermometer! This recipe? AMAZING"
