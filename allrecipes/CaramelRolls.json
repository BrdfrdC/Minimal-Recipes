"reviewBody": "These are wonderful caramel rolls! I chose this recipe as it made a smaller amount (but can easily be doubled for company) and it used a bread maker. The rolls are extremely tender and just the right sweetness without being too sweet. They also keep their freshness over several days when well covered. Just pop one into the microwave for 20-30 seconds to warm. I did need to use about 2 1/2 cups flour (instead of 2 cups) and I substituted milk for the water as I didn't have the powdered milk. The recipe should say that it makes 9 servings. Cut the rolled dough into 9 equal pieces which fit perfectly into an 8x8 pan. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thank you!"
