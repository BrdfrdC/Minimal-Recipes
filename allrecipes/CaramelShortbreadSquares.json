"reviewBody": "I'm a cook, but I'm not a baker, so I was certain I'd screw these up, but thankfully everything turned out WONDERFULLY. I read through the reviews to get a sense of where people commonly had issues, and the changes I made were that I buttered the pan prior to adding the shortbread, by doing this it prevented everything from sticking to the pan (some people used parchment paper). I cooked the caramel on lower medium heat and started by melting the butter first, then adding the rest of the wet ingredients together and then the brown sugar last, I stirred constantly with a whisk or spoon and kept my heat at medium low, I never quit stirring until I was pouring the caramel on top of the shortbread, and it turned out absolutely perfectly. I melted the chocolate in a hot water bath (heated water in a bowl and then submerged a pyrex measuring cup with the chocolate chips in it into the bowl so they'd melt inside of the measuring cup from the heat the water provides through the glass) and they melted within a couple of minutes with some stirring. I also used coarsely ground Himalayan salt on top of the chocolate before I let it cool - it's a fabulous addition, and I highly recommend, it's a perfect salty compliment to the sweetness. I used a knife heated with warm water to cut my squares and it went smoothly as long as I kept the knife warmed. I stored everything in a plastic Tupperware so the shortbread softened quite a bit, and now I have a huge container of these decadent sweets to enjoy through New Years! I'm saving this recipe and I will make it again and again, and I recommend you give it a try if you're thinking about it and these sound good. You can do it!! I bet finely chopped walnuts would be a good topping too, maybe even in addition with the coarse salt."

"reviewBody": "I made this exactly as written. I didn't have a square 9x9 pan so I used two 10x4 inch pans but it ended up being the same overall dimensions. Having worked with shortbread before I knew to put down parchment paper which is a life saver and keeps it from sticking to the pan. I cooled the shortbread for about 20 minutes and then the finished bars for about 45 minutes or so. Overall this is a good recipe and I think I will put some sea salt on top when I make it again. Be careful when making the chocolate because it doesn't take much to overcook it. 1 minute 40 seconds should be enough time."

It will be 'soft' when you take it out of oven (don't worry, it will firm up as it cools). Loved em but too rich - the milk choc on top should be semi-sweet or dark or mix as many others have pointed out. They're great, but seriously I probably have 100 cavities now after having a few. Great recipe!"

I always keep a can or two of sweetened condensed milk on hand and use the entire can for this recipe. I don't bother to measure out 1/2 cup. It's likely more than a half cup, but it turns out perfect."

For those that thought the caramel was too thin on the shortbread for the 13 x 9 pan just 3x the recipe for the caramel and you will have a lovely layer of caramel. The crust was wonderful as was the chocolate top. Be sure to take the time to cool each layer as recommended. Otherwise you will have the chocolate and the caramel running together. Huge hit with the family. Definitely worth the effort!"

"reviewBody": "This is Bakery Chef type desert but homemade. So easy to make to get a decadent dessert. I will try semi sweet chocolate chips next time. \nI had only one issue in the beginning when cooking the caramel sauce. The sauce started to boil at medium heat then it began to get dark brown spots in it. I turned down the heat to low kept stirring and the dark spots incorporated back into the sauce. The sauce still boiled at low and I took it off at 5 minutes as instructed. It tasted great. My son who doesn't usually likes real sweet desserts liked this because of the crunchy shortbread.\nSuggestion for getting the best results. Cool the shortbread completely before pouring the caramel on it, then let cool on counter (allows caramel to stiffen up) before adding chocolate topping. Use an off set spatula to spread chocolate onto caramel. Then cool the whole dessert in pan in fridge before cutting. Use a sharp knife. Put cut squares in plastic container keep in fridge till 45 minutes before serving. Seems correct the crumbly crust when first baked."

The first batch I went by the recipe completely, the second batch, I used sweetened condensed coconut milk and a mixture of milk and dark chocolate. The second batch had a nice added coconut flavor, though the caramel took longer to set up. I melted the chocolate with a little half and half (about 1/4 cup) as recommended.\n\nA note, when making the caramel, first melt and heat the milk before adding the sugar. Some of the sugar burned at the bottom of the pot first time around.\n\nDefinitely a keeper!"

Then I'd beat it vigorously with a wooden spoon put it back on the heat and boil for another 5 minutes at that point you will have a true stick to the spoon caramel mixture number 3 for me the chocolate coating on top was way too much and I prefer dark chocolate so I melted dark chocolate put it in a baggie and put pretty drizzles across the top. I also used some flaked pink Himalayan sea salt and gently sprinkled it over the top Sublime!"

I also added a generous dash of salt to the caramel - not enough to make it a \"salted caramel\" or anything, just enough to balance out the sweetness. It was a bit nondescript the first time I made it. Just about 1/4 tsp of sea salt seemed to make the caramel stand out more."

My first batch of caramel burned slightly, but was still usable. It seemed I didn't really have enough caramel to cover so I made another batch and discovered that I had only put in 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup (oops). Did the second batch low and slow (with the right amount of sugar LOL) and had no issues. Will definitely make again, and again."

We used parchment paper to line the pan, cooked the caramel on low heat and stirred constantly, and added a tablespoon of butter to the chocolate chips (these were all tips suggested in another review.) \n\nMy suggestion: I added some sea salt on the top of the chocolate layer to cut the sweetness a bit and it added a wonderful layer of flavor. You don't need a lot. \n\nGive it a try and enjoy!"

The caramel took a while to boil because I left it on low heat so I did not scorch it. After I put the caramel layer on, I put it in the fridge to chill for maybe 30-40 minutes before putting the chocolate layer on top. You need to work fast spreading on the caramel layer else it will start to harden. I greased and floured the pan as another reviewer suggested. I used a plastic knife to go around the edges of the pan (I used a non-stick pan) , turned the pan upside down and the contents popped out. I then put it on a cutting board to cut into small squares. Took some time to make but the result was worth it."

You really need a couple of hours at a minimum for everything to set properly - and the caramel layer is a bit time-consuming in order to avoid burning. I cooked on low heat and constantly stirred so had no problem. I did use dark chocolate instead of milk for better balance of flavors. These are really good and worth making but just take a bit more time and attention than something I consider quick and easy."
