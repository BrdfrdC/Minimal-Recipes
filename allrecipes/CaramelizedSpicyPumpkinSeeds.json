When I haven't done this beforehand some of the shells seem woody to chew on."

"reviewBody": "What am I missing in the directions that no other reviewer has mentioned???? I've read it over a few times now. The recipe states to mix together the initial 3 TB. sugar &amp; other spices and set aside. Next, spray seeds with cooking spray, sprinkle with salt &amp; bake. Then, add olive oil to pan with the final 2 TB. of sugar, add seeds, &amp; stir until sugar melts &amp; coats the seeds. Right? So, my question is......when do you add the sugar and spice mixture to the seeds? Before you bake them? Can I just carmelize the sugar and spice mixture to the seeds in the final step with the olive oil? What did the rest of you do and how am I the only person to notice that the directions are off?!"

Next time I'm going to double it because it creates a nice crunchy sweet coating and helps the spices adhere to the seeds better. I also used Pumpkin Pie Spice since it has most of these spices in one jar. All in all, I highly recommend this recipe."

Chili powder would probably be good to use instead of the cayenne, too."

So, cooking method was a bust for me, but since they turned out delicious in the end, I gotta go 5 stars!! Also, added double the cinnamon; it was a little heavy on the cumin for me."

"reviewBody": "So this is my first time ever making pumpkin seeds. Also my first time ever caramelizing anything. So I saw that a lot of you liked it better with brown sugar so I gave that a try but I guess brown sugar doesn't melt down as fast as white sugar does because I cooked it for almost ten minutes and it just wouldn't melt. So next time instead of putting the pumpkin seeds in with the brown sugar to melt I will cook down the sugar then put in the pumpkin seeds. Other than this they are awesome Just like candy but better!"

Also didn't use ground cinnamon and made sure to use chopped ginger root. The seeds burned a little while in the frying pan, but that turned out to be beneficial for stronger flavor. SO good!!"

"reviewBody": "I made this three times this fall!! First I think my pumpkin seeds actually measured 2 1/2 cups, and I soaked them in heavy salt water 24 hours. Make sure you allow the seeds to DRY! I did change the baking time to about an hour as I like mine really toasted! Two of the times I changed the sugar to dark brown sugar (just the sugar you caramelize) Plus adding 2 tbls olive oil and 1 tbls butter to the pan. You have to stir this constantly and just when everything is coated get it into the other sugar. When I made this per directions it was just as good! I did what others said with the cayenne by making it a 1/4 tsp. I'm told to keep making it this way!! Thanks for the recipe!!"

I've always just done the salted and seasoned kind...never any with sugar. These came out great. The flavor is very good. I got my sugar carmalizing in a little butter before adding the seeds, tossed them in the spices, threw it back in the warm oven for just a minute (to see if I could make them crunchier) and let the boys try them. I'm buying another pumpkin today so I can try to get the seeds a bit crunchier but the taste is great."

I had to roast mine in the oven a bit longer than suggested and I ended up bumping up the temp to 400, next time I'll prob do 10-15 mins at 400 - just because its quicker.

And beware of popping oil when you add the seeds. \n\nThese tasted fantastic and I didn't have cayenne pepper nor ground ginger on hand. Just finely diced candied ginger bears and added a few shakes of nutmeg. I would also reccommend ramping up the cinnamon and brown sugar quantities. Just delicious."
