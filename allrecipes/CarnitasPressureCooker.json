I definitely recommend this step.\n\nThis was very excellent and will probably be in regular rotation. It's perfect for inside tacos, enchiladas or even tamales."

I used about 2 lbs of meat, but only cut the seasonings in half for a little extra flavor. As suggested, I added 1 tsp of coriander and I felt like the flavor came through very nicely. I didn’t have any orange juice on hand, so I used 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar. It added the acidity necessary and I honestly didn’t notice the difference. When it was finished cooking, I shredded the meat and broiled it in the oven for a few minutes to get it nice and crispy. Looking forward to making this again very soon!"

"reviewBody": "I've made this several times now in my Instant Pot and it is delicious to us! I scaled the recipe down recently as I had a small roast (~2.5 lbs), but I left the amount of Chile powder (used ancho chili powder), paprika, and garlic the same--just wanted more of those flavors than less of that day. Recommendation on 6qt IP is to use 1 cup liquid, but I used 1/2 cup OJ + 1/4 cup lime juice and it came out perfect. As make ahead meal, shredded meat and stored in container. Strained and reserved juices from IP into another container to add a little to baking dish to reheat in oven, covered, 275-300F and broil in last few minutes to crisp up meat a little. Perfect for my tacos and enchilada dinners! Thank you for the recipe!"

I changed it a little: I used more garlic, reduced the salt to 1 tbs, I omitted the olive oil, I forgot to cut into cubes so I cooked in slow cooker for 6 hrs, shredded meat and returned to juice on warm for 60 minutes. This is the best ever carnitas!!"

I decreased the salt but kept all the other seasonings the same and it was perfect! Instead of fresh onions and garlic, I used powder. After it cooked in the pressure cooker, I toasted up the meat and raw onion in a cast iron pan in some oil and served it on corn tortillas that I toasted on the open flame of the gas stove and topped with fresh pico and avocado! Perfection! I’m definitely saving this recipe and will stick to the higher spice to meat ratio."

I did add coriander as others did, a quick saute and then 40 minutes in the pressure cooker before a quick release. The tacos were even more excellent topped with Cabbage Pico de Gallo recipe also from this site. Will make again!"

Shredding was super easy. This was my first time making Carnitas. I scaled the recipe for a 3 lb Boston Butt Roast and set the pressure cooker for 45 min with natural release for 15 minutes. I also added 1 tsp of coriander as others suggested. Other than that I made it as written. We had it 2 ways. I made up the other ingredients and made a carnitas salad bowl like at Chipotle, and my son had carnitas tacos. Both great. I highly recommend his recipe."

(Be sure and add some of the juice to the pan to keep things moist) So good and will be making again! This would be a great one for company!"

After 15 minutes of depressurization I added diced onion and simmered out the remaining water for 20 minutes leaving a wonderfully rich and flavorful pork that shredded easily by mere stirring. No need to crisp in the oven.\nThe seasonings are subtle - hold back on the salt. The pastured pork flavor and mouthfeel are sublime. I served it in tortillas with some pickled red onion, roasted diced poblano, and crumbled feta."

I used a gallon ziplock to \"rub the pork with the seasonings\" and oiled in the same bag after that. I browned my pork chunks before adding the juice and cooking. I added 3/4 t coriander per other reviews. Like others I broiled it afterwards for a bit leaving the juices in the pressure cooker. Good and very easy. I also only cooked 45 minutes since it was a smaller roast."

I also sautéed the meat and onion before pressurizing it to bring out the flavors. The meat tastes absolutely delicious! My husband liked it a lot as well."

I followed the recipe exactly, but did shorten the time to 50 minutes with a 15 minute natural release. Also- the one thing I feel is a must- line a baking sheet with foil, spray with nonstick cooking spray, then shred your pork on the baking sheet (removing any icky fatty pieces). Sprinkle about 1/4 cup of cooking juices on top. Broil on high in your oven for about five minutes. Turn or stir around, then broil a few minutes more. Gives the pork those nice crispy edges."
