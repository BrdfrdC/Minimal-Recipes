I usually leave out the water chestnuts but I always add either chopped walnuts or slivered almonds. I’ve swapped the grapes for apples. I’ve address dried cranberries or omitted the cheese.

Now that I have made it and read reviews, I am sure the recipe would improve a lot with changes (i.e., less poultry seasoning, add nuts), but I’m so blah about it that I doubt I will try the recipe, again."

I had some Miracle Whip that needed to be used, so I went with that. It worked well here. I never added Swiss cheese to chicken salad, but it really complements the other flavors. After reading reviews, I cut back on the poultry season which I think was a good call. After testing, I did add more of the spices. I'll have to get some croissants....this would be great served on those. Thanks for this gourmet-like chicken salad!"

I was looking for some sweet to put in my chicken salad made from leftover roti chicken...the grapes were perfect. It was good enough for the fussy eater in my house.

I used less poultry seasoning than recommended. I used purple grapes of course. And I substituted sour cream and vegenaise for half the mayo. No green onions. No swiss cheese needed but might try that next time. It is so good."

"reviewBody": "Very good after 2 hours chilling; much better the next day. A a few adjustments based on other reviews: I added the seasonings (using 1/2 tsp only of poultry seasoning) and lemon juice to the diced rotisserie chicken, and put that in the fridge while prepping the other ingredients. Used celery, green onions and chopped water chestnuts per the recipe, and black seedless grapes. Subbed about half the mayonnaise with sour cream. A great way to use leftover deli chicken. Served with ritz crackers the first day ... Hubby loved it on sandwiches the next day"

I think water chestnuts instead of walnuts is great, it gives it a great texture and crunch. I didn't have green onions on hand so I added some finely chopped yellow onion and it turned out fine, I don't even know if it made that much of a difference. I used fresh chicken breasts and the way I cooked them made the chicken tender and juicy which added to the overall taste and texture I think. I will definitely be making this again!"

I usually season the chicken breasts with salt and rosemary and cook with olive oil. I then toss the chicken into my food processor. What a lifesaver since I'm always making such a large batch and also want it less chunky to go on a sandwich roll. For ease, I use an Italian blend of shredded cheese. I omit the water chestnuts and celery because I think the grapes are the perfect compliment on their own. I make the dressing as stated but sometimes need more or less. Just depends on how much chicken I've cooked."
