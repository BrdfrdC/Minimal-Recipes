"reviewBody": "This was soooo good. I actually used the yolks too. I just added them when adding the wet ingredients and it came out fantastic. If you are having problems with sticking like another reviewer mentioned, than that can be prevented by making sure your waffle iron is very hot before you spray the oil and add the waffle mix. This recipe made 11 waffles for me and we saved the remainder in a ziplock bag in the freezer. And they were even better after putting them in the toaster the next day. It had that crunchy taste that I love in my waffles. I still added syrup to mine though. I didn’t think it was overly sweet, but definitely very flavorful. My husband loves his with peanut butter and honey."

"reviewBody": "Disastrous experience making this today! My husband poured the first batch of batter into our waffle iron. Because I had read concerns about how these waffles burn quickly due to the high brown sugar content, my husband opened the waffle iron earlier to check the waffles. Well, when he opened the waffle iron, the waffles were soft and split in half, each half stuck to either half of the griddle despite having been oiled adequately. The waffles did come off the waffle iron easily. So, for the second attempt, I oiled the waffle iron again, and let the batter cook longer. When the indicator light showed that the waffles were ready, I tried to open the waffle iron but it was stuck! My husband and 22 yr old son then tried to pry it open. They determined that the “release button” on the waffle iron was functioning correctly (you could see the lever on the underside of the waffle iron move when the release button was depressed). So it was actually the waffle batter that had caused the waffle iron to stick together! After much effort, we finally pried the waffle iron apart, and peeled the over- crisped waffles off the griddle plates- but also ended up breaking a part of our waffle iron in the process. :( We decided to make pancakes out of the remaining batter. Had to watch these closely as they burned easily. In the end, the pancakes and the mangled waffles were tasty, but quite sweet so you didn’t really need maple syrup. I would prefer the batter be less sweet so I coul"

The apple was cooked down on low, with butter, a touch of salt and some Brandy to reduce it all down. I also used all white sugar, only because I was mistaken in thinking I had some at home! I do want to try it with the brown sugar, because I think it'd give them a deeper flavor. Either way, these were a hit!"

After the initial reactions of surprise, delight, incredulity and awe that he cooked something so delicious for me wore off I asked him how he made them. Thank you Carol! This is now part of our weekly menu. He added a little nutmeg to them to make them a little extra spicy, and whole eggs instead of just the whites because, and I quote here, \" Why would anyone not use the best part of the egg?!?!\" :) Thank you again!"

I have a Black &amp; Decker belgian waffle maker with no temp control, but a light that goes off when they're ready, and I find I have to leave them in a minute or two longer for a crispier waffle, but that is all. I was looking for a recipe for a waffle I could eat on its own without syrup or any toppings, and this was it! Wonderful, moist waffles that I can just grab to go. I brushed my non-stick iron with clarified butter instead of cooking spray, and I had no problem with sticking or burning. I'm having one right now with a coffee! I think I'd like to try them with apple or peaches! Mmmmmm! (I'm going to tweak them slightly and make them for dog treats, too! I had quite the appreciative audience while I was making them!)"

"reviewBody": "Made this today after my daughter tried Eggo Cinnamon waffles at a friend's house. I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazingly good! I did not have too much of a problem with sticking thanks to my cooking spray. (I used to brush on vegetable oil and wonder why I didn't think of the spray before I read it here!) When a batch stuck a bit, I pried it off gently and resprayed the surface. \nThe waffles were not crunchy which was fine - I put them on a tray in the oven to keep them warm until they were all baked and it crisped them just enough.\nThe flavor is amazing - it does NOT need syrup as many mention - even my syrup-crazy daughter didn't use it! My husband isn't a big waffle fan and thought they were great. Used the leftover yolks in scrambled eggs and also had fresh fruit - great Sunday breakfast and not all that much more effort than the Bisquick box. \nA definite repeat especially since the three children already lobbied to add this to our Christmas morning breakfast tradition!"

My daughter put peanut butter on hers and went on and on about them. My wife and I are simple butter and syrup waffle eaters, and they were the best waffle recipe I have ever made. I kept a close watch on them since so many reviewers had trouble with them burning(no cooking spray either). No problems whatsoever. Only issue...the recipe was not enough to feed the five of us. It made 12 rather small waffles, and on our waffle maker, we need at least 16! I know we will make these again, so I will just adjust accordingly."

I used whole eggs, adding the yolks to the mixture before adding the fluffy whites. I also substituted a little less than a cup of almond meal for the same amount of flour and melted butter instead of using vegetable oil. Turned out to be perfect (not sure that my \"twist\"really changed anything, as it was the first time I tried this recipe but if you want to try, you will not regret). A lot of batter, will last for a while at my household of 2. Lucky me!"
