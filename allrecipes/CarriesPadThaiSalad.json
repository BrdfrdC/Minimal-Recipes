I soaked the noodles like the recipe said to, but I didn't realize until later that the noodle package said to boil the noodles. My bad. Just be sure to check the package and do what it says."

"reviewBody": "I liked it but prefer spicier food. Also the Tamarind concentrate was difficult to find. I finally found it at Whole Foods and it was nearly $12 for a 4 oz jar....yowzer! Also who the heck has flaxseed oil on hand? I skipped the oil since I already broke the bank on the Tamarind. I stir fried some top sirloin cut up/seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder and added that. My wife will probably like this because she can't tolerate anything spicy. Next time I'll probably use shrimp in the dish. Thanks for this recipe"

"reviewBody": "This was very good! I recommend having all the ingredients prepped &amp; ready before cooking. It comes together quick! My rice noodles required a bit of cooking; not sure if I should have used hotter water or if it was due to a brand difference. I used macadamia nut oil &amp; sesame oil since that was on hand, otherwise it was made as stated. Next time I will reduce the sugar, since it was a bit too sweet for me. It was flavorful and could be used as the whole meal."
