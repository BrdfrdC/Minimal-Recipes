My only suggestion is to let it bake for maybe 55 mins to an hour when cooking in a 9x13 pan. Iâ€™ve made it multiple times and each time they were still wet in the middle which caused the cake to drop from opening the oven. I would recommend baking it for 55 mins then let it sit in the oven unopened until it cools. Just made it again right now and opened it after 45 mins and it was still not ready. Let it cook another 10 and it was fine but the middle dropped. Iâ€™m going to try baking it a little longer and cooling in the unopened oven and hope this stops it from dropping in the center."

It turns out that all the baking soda/powder makes the cake rise too much so that it can't support itself and ends up collapsing. I think it would depend on what pan you used to make it in, but I found that some of the cake had some strong baking soda flavor. There are definitely better recipes on this website for carrot cake."

"reviewBody": "I love this cake. It tastes amazing. Only thing that sucks is the frosting recipe, it becomes too runny because the instructions say that you should mix everything together. DON'T! You need to beat fist the butter and the cheesecream and when they're properly incorporated you add the sugar slowly and stop beating as soon as it is properly incorporated. The problem is the sugar meeting the cheesecream directly, that's why it becomes runny. When you mix butter and the cheesecream first the butter prevents it from happening. And then put the frosting in the fridge for a while, so it doesn't melt."

As much as I can appreciate any tweaks or personal touches it would be helpful to indicate if cook time was altered as well... ie adding extra c. Carrot would have been perfect for me as I had them on hand, but do I bake it longer? All these things go into a great recipe...."

"reviewBody": "I found this recipe to be dry and flavorless so I decided to do the thing that so many people on this website hate; I took advice from other reviewers and made changes to the recipe on my second and third try. The advice I took from others is the only reason the cake now comes out perfectly moist, flavorful, and will be kept in my recipe book for generations to come. So here's the adjustments I made: I used 1 cup of apple sauce and 4 Tbs of oil, I upped the carrot amount to 4 cups, I upped the vanilla extract to 3 tsp, I upped the cinnamon to 2.5 tsp, and I added 1 tsp of nutmeg."

Not the recipe. Anyways I had some left over and put it in a 6 in round pan which turned out nicely. And I loved the way the cream cheese frosting turned out. Also my first time making cream cheese frosting"

It was spectacular!"
