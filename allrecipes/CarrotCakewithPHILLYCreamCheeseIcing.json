"reviewBody": "This is the carrot cake that I always make. However I adjust the recipe a little bit because it is so high in calories.\n\n I cut out some of the oil and use about 3/4 cups oil and 1/2 cups pumpkin to moisten the cake. I also cut the sugar in half. You don't need all the sugar because of the sweetness of the pumpkin, carrots and pineapple.\nThis way the cake is almost healthy! \n The other thing I do is to use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. The flavors of the brown sugar and the pumpkin give the cake a lot of character and a robust autumn flavor.\n I would imagine using the recipe as it is would produce a pretty good cake as well. It's just a bit too fattening."

No need for the frosting...these are delicious and plenty sweet as they are!"

"reviewBody": "So far I've made this Carrot Cake 3 times and everyone has raved about it... making me a complete star in the kitchen!! I did take some suggestions from other recipes. For example I divided the sugar (1 cup white and 1 cup dark brown instead of 2 c. of all white sugar) and used slightly less crushed pineapple. I'm going to make it again tomorrow but use a total of 3/4 c. canola oil and 1/4 c. chunky applesauce instead of the 1 1/4 c. oil. I'm going to increase the cinnamon to 2 t. For the icing I will use only use 2 c. confectioner's sugar and no lemon. But I will add 1/4 c. chopped pecans. I really love Carrot Cake!!!"

I also added 1 cup raisins microwaved for three minutes in two cups water with orange extract and sugar and then drained. Recipe exactly filled a 9*13 cake pan."

I did not put in cloves since they were so spendy I used a little allspice. I also used a glass baking dish. Got rave reviews at the party."
