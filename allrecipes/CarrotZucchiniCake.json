"reviewBody": "I loved this cake! I made just a few small changes in the recipe to make it healthier. Instead of 1 1/2 cups of oil, I used 3/4 cups coconut oil and 3/4 cups applesauce. I added about 1/2 cup of pecans as well. I baked this in a 9 x 13 pan and halved the icing recipe. I felt the icing was a bit too sweet and would increase the cream cheese and add less sugar next time. This was a real hit tonight with a group of friends and I'll definitely make it again."
