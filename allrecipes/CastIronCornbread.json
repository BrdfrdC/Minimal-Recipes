The cup + one half of buttermilk makes a very moist cornbread. I have another recipe that was similar but used 2/3 cup sugar VS 3 TBS honey that this recipe calls for-- my family preferred this recipe hands down. The balance of ingredients is perfect."

"reviewBody": "I love Chef John recipes but I'm definitely struggling with this one. I have tried it twice now, and will continue modifying. I tend to not like things too sweet but with this recipe I would say to add extra honey and if possible, some chopped up canned sweet corn, maybe 1-2 tablespoons. Additionally, I have had better luck reducing the flour by 1/3 cup and adding 1/3 more cornmeal to help it taste less flourish. Chef John says to put leave half the melted butter in the skillet but I would say add most of it back in to the cornbread so you don't get that browning and burning around the edges."

I used a store-brand wildflower honey and two pinches of cayenne, though I couldn’t taste any spice in the finished product. It is a little bland on its own and needs a little bit of condiment or to be served as a side for chili or bbq. I just had a piece with some honey drizzled on top along with a piece with a little fig jam, and both were tasty. If I make this again, I might try adding jalapeños to the batter."

I also melt the butter separately and preheat the skillet in the oven till it is frying hot then drop the half portion of butter into the hot skillet followed by the batter. I love cornbread cooked in the cast iron skillet because it adds a little extra browned crunch on the bottom."

I'm not sure what the cayenne is playing at but I think the addition of jalapenos chucks may be decent.\nAlso I next time I am going to add all the dry ingredients together and then add the buttermilk then the eggs whisk and let sit for a bit like 5 minutes then add in that butter mix and pour right back into that cast iron. \nI would make it again because of how easy it is to prepare"
