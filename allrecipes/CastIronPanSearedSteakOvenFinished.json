"reviewBody": "I'm not a big fan of marinading rib eye steak since it's already tender enough. Cooking time called for was way too long for my taste. Depending on thickness of steak and personal preference for doneness, times can be adjusted up or down. Just keep in mind that when cooking at such a high heat steak can easily get overdone. Place dry (no added oil) cast iron skillet in oven and heat to 500 degrees. Bring steaks to room temperature. When oven has reached 500 degrees, pat steaks dry with paper towel, lightly oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper on both sides. Remove skillet from oven, place on stovetop, add steaks and cook on high heat for 30 seconds each side to sear. Put skillet with steaks back into oven. Cook for 2 minutes, flip steak and cook for 2 more minutes. Remove from oven and let steaks rest in skillet lightly tented for 3-5 minutes. If desired, top with small knob of butter and add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice."

"reviewBody": "Interesting concept. Lost a point for the marinade and the oil.\nBeen cooking steaks in my cast iron pan for many years now without the marinade and never with oil. \nA properly seasoned pan does not need oil...it just needs to be real hot and the steak will lift easily.\nI find that between 1 and 2 minutes per side is all that is needed for the sear and that 5 minutes in a 425 degree oven is enough for a 1\" steak...if not too much. I like medium rare.\nI agree with the Pinot Noir and butter and prefer Montreal Steak Spice as the seasoning, but salt and pepper alone is every bit as good.\nI learned this method from a good steak house almost 50 years ago and always have the best results. Thick steaks with good marbling are the best candidates for this method. 1\" thick is as thin as you want to go. Good steaks don't need a marinade."
