Seared 3 minutes per side and baked in 275 oven for 2 hours. Came out medium to medium well, thought because it was larger than the 4 lb called for I would be okay, next time I will check temp at 1 1/2 hour mark to be sure. Still tasted great and my friends that came over kept telling me how good it was and he make prime ribs ALL the time but uses the 500 for 1/2 hour method then turn it off for the next 2-3 hours, depending on size."

I followed the directions to the T..although next time I will cut down on the onion..also this is a rich sauce, if your looking for gravy you'll have to use less beef stock. But this dish doesn't really go with a thick gravy, does it! My husband didn't even need to slather on horse radish!! He loved his Xmas Eve meal!"

My roast was 4#, not 4.5 but I like my meat medium so I decided to keep the time the same as the recipe. Meat came out rare. other side dishes were done so there wasn't much to be done about it. i microwaved some pieces for the folks who don't like rare meat. I was so disappointed I didn't bother with the gravy."

It was simple, gave the outside of the roast the browning needed, and kept the inside so moist and tender with the low, slow roasting. I already had the roast in when I realized I'd forgotten to pick up beef broth, so I had to substitute a package of au just mix and water. But otherwise I followed this pretty closely, just adjusting for the size roast I had."

Don't expect the gravy to be thick, it's more like a very pourable \"coat the back of a spoon gravy.\" Don't be afraid to add the beef juices to your gravy that accumulate from the resting (foil covered) rib roast. I didn't sear the roast dry, but added just the thinnest layer of canola oil &amp; a pat of unsalted butter to create a nice brown sear before going into the oven.\n\nOne of my dinner guest said this was the best tasting, fork licking prime rib he ever had!"

"reviewBody": "I typically doctor up recipes to my liking, this time I used the recommended ingredients. Only needed 2 minutes on each side to sear on med high cast iron, 3 minutes would have overcooked. I used a lot more red wine than called for, which really hit the spot as the ribs were roasting. I also added the stock over time - only about 2/3 of recommended- to allow it to reduce. I have tried several of the rib roast recipes on this site, and while all of them have been good this one is the absolute bomb. There are lots of ways to roast a rib, but the cast sear is THE way to go. And the from scratch gravy is basic but it dominates - I recommend adding it to everything you serve."

"reviewBody": "A cast iron skillet makes for a great stove top to oven roasting pan. I disagree with the instruction, \"130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for rare, about 2 more hours.\" If you cook this to 130 and then let rest you will not have a 'rare' roast. After roasting and resting a final temperature of 130 - 135 is medium rare. I like the slow roast method but I should have seared the top fat cap longer than I did. It didn't have that crispy 'crust' that I like so much. Also, I didn't use wine in the gravy because we have a couple of people who don't care for the taste of red wine."
