After fully squeezed, place on tray AND BAKE FIRST before putting ingredients on, otherwise it won't hold up. While these instructions are in the video, many people wouldn't watch it so these instructions should be in the written ones so that people who print it off have them. Tastes fine, bad instructions; and cooking the food is 90% of the job."

Spread and patted firmly on parchment paper. Baked 450 degrees for 20 minutes. I flipped onto a pizza pan with holes, added well drained canned chicken, thinly sliced sweet onion, topped with mozzarella and baked to a delicious golden brown cheesy deliciousness. No sauce needed. It was better than regular pizza. I reheated in a skillet to maintain the crispiness of the crust, it was almost better the second day. Low low carb."

After I loaded it up I baked it on the second lowest rack to help the crust become crispy. I topped mine with A few pepperonis, shredded baked chicken breast, diced onions/peppers, and Italian cheese. Next time I make it, I’m going to bake it raw."

If you follow the directions as they stand, there is no way that you cannot have a crumbly mess. ..given normal , without juicer, scenarios. There is no binding agent here. What holds the dough together? Cauliflower and cheese? This needs other agents added. Some have added almond flour, cocoanut flour, rice flour , tapioca ..there is no way this completely holds togethe without a binding agent. Great thought, tho."

"reviewBody": "My first try was a success, probably cooked it longer..I wanted it a little crispier and more brown around the edges.\nI put a whole head of cauliflower in the instant pot for 5min and quick pressure release. I put it in the freezer for a few minutes to get cool. I mashed it up and put it in a cloth, as recommended, to squeeze the water out. Mixed it with mozzarella, cheddar( about a 1/2 cup each) dried parsley, an egg and tsp garlic. I didn’t have parchment paper but I see why that would be helpful. I sprayed my pan with Pam. I put mine on the pan pretty thin. I flipped it about half way and part of it stuck to the pan. I let it cool, then topped it with pizza sauce, mozzarella, green peppers and olives. It turned out AMAZING! My husband is not a fan of cauliflower and he loved it. We are doing a low carb diet and this hits the spot for a pizza craving."

"reviewBody": "GREAT base recipe, though I admit I modded it. Doubled it and added 1/4 cup almond flour, as well as fresh basil and some cooked ground turkey crumbles. We actually dehydrated the cauliflower for 8 hours first (prepped in the morning and let it sit) to pull some of the moisture out of it. It may seem like an excessive step but it did a great job of helping us get the “dough” into a more dough-like density. The bake was spot-on: 450° @ 15 minutes. Dough was shaped into a flat disc with a pita-like thickness (1/4” or so).\n\nThanks!"

"reviewBody": "I went to the farmer's market last week and needed to do something with the cauliflower before it went bad. I've been wanting to try pizza for a while and I stumbled upon your recipe and I loved it. \n\nI made a few changes: I microwaved my cauliflower about 8 min, cooled it, squeezed out as much liquid as I could. I like cheddar cheese so I used a sharp cheddar blend and baked the crust about 15 min. I made my own bbq sauce had a layer of parmesan cheese added some leftover chicken &amp; onions to one half and ham on the other and baked another 15 min at 375°.\n\nI am completely satisfied, it turned out great and will definitely make again."

Then I put on a clean kitchen towel and used my potatoe masher and mashed the water out of it. I spent extra time on this step and actually used two towels. Instead of fresh garlic in the crust, I used garlic powder and Italian spices. I took another piece of advice and after I pre-cooked the crust (20 minutes), I flipped it before topping it. Then after topping, I cooked another 20 minutes. It was wonderful! I would absolutely make it again trying different spices and cheeses in the crust."

I used a juicer as another reviewer suggested and used the pulp from the juicer and instead of steaming the cauliflower, I put it in a pan on top of the stove as Chef John suggested in his Cauliflower pizza recipe. This is a very good crust and held up to a lot of pizza toppings. I will definitely make this again and maybe next time I will try to brush the crust with olive oil before baking."

Encountered a problem in that when all ingredients were added and mixed, there was a moderate amount of fluid in the bowl. Had to use a slotted spoon to fish out the cauliflower. Guess squeezing the cauliflower before mixing it all together would have gotten the excess fluid out. Might be helpful is that step is added to the recipe. Thank you."

Didn't squeeze it out, so used a tablespoon or so of gluten-free flour to soak in the extra moisture. \n\nIt was so very very good topped with pesto, mushrooms and zucchini -- and caramalized onions.

I didn't like the comination of flavours, but of course, that is just personal preference. This recipe made quite a bit, so I made small rounds and ended up using them just to melt cheese on as a side dish. I think I'd rather just bake pizza toppings into a casserole and eat it that way. Next I'll be trying the keto crust made with pork rinds on my continuted quest......"
