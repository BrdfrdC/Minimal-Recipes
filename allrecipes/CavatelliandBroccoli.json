I prefer my broccoli to have some crunch and the parboiling made it fall apart."

In a wok I sauté the garlic and red pepper flakes. Then throw the steamed broccoli in. When broccoli is done, I zest one lemon and squeeze the juice of the lemon into the broccoli. Then I throw the cooked cavatelli into the wok and mix it all up and cook for a few minutes longer. The lemon gives it a really good flavor."

I added seasoned salt, Italian seasoning and a sprinkling of kosher salt, not regular salt. \nI liberally salted the pasta water with kosher salt and reserved some of the pasta water to add to the sauce. I also added a little olive oil as needed while cooking to adjust the moisture of the dish. I think adding some chicken or shrimp to this would be awesome too.\nI served a tomato, cucumber and onion salad on the side with a homemade dressing of olive oil, red wine vinegar, kosher salt and fresh crushed black pepper. This added a burst of color and freshness to this dish.\nThis will definitely be placed in my rotation of recipes."

Blanch broccoli in water with garlic, and then pasta goes in the same water. I sauté about 5 cloves garlic sliced thinly in EVOO with salt, pepper and crushed red pepper with a pat of butter and then add about 1/3 rd cup of white wine- usually Pinot Grigio. After the pasta is al dente, add to the pot with broccoli and cover for 2 minutes. When finished, put in a big bowl and add as much romano cheese as you like!"

Followed the recipe except for two things: 1) Rather than draining the water from the broccoli, I took the broccoli out and reused the water to cook the pasta (wanted to save water, but may have also made the pasta more flavorful), and 2) I didn't measure the salt or red pepper flakes, just used a few dashes to my taste. I can't imagine using as much salt as some people have said you should. The olive oil, red pepper, and cheese add plenty of flavor. This is a simple, quick, and delicious meal."

Use lots of garlic, crushed, then sliced. Not minced. And saute the broccoli longer, high heat, like a stir fry. Get fresh cavatelli, not hard. And make sure you have enough olio to lightly coat the pasta. And please..... Grated Romano cheese on this dish only! And plenty of crushed red pepper flakes! No black pepper! Don't ruin this dish with salty pasta water!"

The kids thought it was a little spicy but they all ate it anyway (even my super-picky 12 year old). I didn't really measure the cheese, but you can never have too much parmesan! Did boil the pasta in the same water as the broccoli (well salted). Next time I will add some Italian seasoning &amp; maybe try the chicken broth. Sounds good."

I do drain the pasta water.\nAlso, I often make it w/ shell, penne, or bow tie pasta for a change of pace. It is not etched in stone that it has to be cavatelli. Great summer salad as it does not spoil like salads w/ mayo."

Also, add plenty of good grated cheese not Parmesan; i.e. locatelli. AND don't forget to add plenty of salt to the pasta water before adding the pasta (do not overcook it....al dente!!) Keep some cooked pasta water on the side to add to pasta if gets dry. That's the way you make it! You can also add some pepper flakes for a little ommp! This recipe is not Aglio e Olio...it is cavetelli and broccoli....aglio e olio is different."

"reviewBody": "Here's wha6t I did, cobbling together from the other comments...\n\nBring chicken stock (about 2 qts) and about 1/4 cup of salt to a boil to blanch your broccoli. Get it to a boil, then submerge the broccoli for 2 minutes AT MOST. Remove it and shock it in cold/ice water. I usually separately cook a package of frozen chopped broccoli (cooked just enough that its not a brick anymore) to add to the mix later.\n\nDON'T DISCARD the water. Set the broccoli aside.\n\nPut 1 lb (2 if you're adventurous) of frozen cavatelli in the broccoli water. Bring to a boil, then boil for about 5-7 minutes (don't cook it till its floppy. It'll continue to cook while you prep the rest of the meal) Set aside. \n\nHeat 1/4 cup of olive oil in a frying pan. Add to that 3 (hugely heaping) T of minced garlic. Also add 1/4 to 1/2 C of chopped red onion. Sautee over low heat for maybe two minutes, then add the broccoli (and the previously frozen stuff) and sautee for another 4 minutes.\n\nAdd 1 cup of the broccoli water (do this earlier if the broccoli or garlic is burning) and sautee.\n\nSautee for 4 or 5 minutes.\n\nAdd the pepper flakes. Or don't. It's already good by itself. Right before serving, add the parmesian cheese and toss.\n\nEnjoy"

"reviewBody": "I simplified the cooking process on this one. I just boiled the broccoli, drained, and then added minced bottled garlic and about 1 tablespoon of salt along with the olive oil. I let this mixture sit while I boiled the pasta. I think it is important to season the broccoli prior to mixing with the pasta, otherwise you end up with a bland combo. Also a key part in boiling any pasta is adding salt to the water in order to compliment the true flavor of the pasta. Next time I may add some sweet Italian sausage or sauted chicken along with the broccoli into to serve as more of a main course."

"reviewBody": "This was a hit at my house. I read the remarks about putting the pasta water in the broccoi at the end so that the pasta could absorb some of the flavors. I was worried about this making the broccoli too mushy; not appealing at our house. I ended up cooing the broccoli in a big pot of salted water, removing the broccoli into the pan and cooking the pasta in the same salted water while the broccoli was sauteing. Worked for me and I wasted less water."

Except they called for only 12 oz. of cavatelli and 2 bunches of broccoli, but I would say that Linda probably has it right - with more pasta and broccoli, it would be a little less oily, which was my only complaint about Celantano's recipe. I also think it would be good with a little pasta water thrown in to diffuse the oil. Salt is key, don't skimp."

Definitely follow the advice of others and heavily salt your pasta water and add a ladelful or 2 to the mix when combining the broccoli and pasta. A pat of butter adds a little richness, definitely use more parmesan too! With the changes you'll have a nice quick and easy weeknight pasta dish."
