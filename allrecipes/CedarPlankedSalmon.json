Also, it's a waste to use green onions in the marinate. I saved mine to place on the filets after they're cooked. The garlic &amp; ginger overwhelm the marinate with their flavoring, so the onions contribute little."

"reviewBody": "Let me start by saying cedar plank salmon is the absolute very best!! I've been doing it that way since I first tasted cedar plank salmon at Anthony's in Seattle. I always used a simple lightly-seasoned approach but read this recipe and tried this variation. It's excellent. A few suggestions: 1. I buy cedar fence slats at the lumber yard and cut them up. MUCH cheaper. 2. I leave the skin on. 3. I heat up my grill on high and then put on the planks. I then let the planks warm up. The salmon is cooked by the hot plank, steam coming from the plank and the hot air inside the grill. 4. 20 minutes is too long for my grill. I like the salmon to do some browning on top but take care not to over-cook any fish."

I kept the salmon skin on, made multiple cuts and placed the skin side on the plank. I also added few slices of Lemon on top. The result was great with many compliments from our guests 😋"

I let this marinade for 2 hours this afternoon (soaked the planks for the same amount of time). Cooked on the center of a Weber gas grill set to medium with a heating plate. The grill thermometer showed 500 F. Set a timer for 14 minutes for a first check and it looked perfect so I pulled it. It was moist, flaky perfection. Highly recommend."

Mix in a bit of 100% maple syrup plus a bit of diced shallot. 1-2 minutes to go on grill, hit it. Instant caramelize. Finish with a small squeeze of lemon, fresh pepper grind and taste the flavor of it all. BTW: This can be done in an oven with reliable broiler function."

I soaked the planks for 6 hours and oiled the top surface prior to putting the salmon on it as suggested in another review. The planks did not go on fire, the salmon cooked to perfection and I was able to easily wash the planks after dinner with hot water. This allows me to use them again. Will definitely keep this recipe and do it again."

One little tip I would share, is let the cedar planks flare up a lot, this gives the salmon a bit of a “crisp” to it and imparts a lovely smokey flavour. We have enjoyed it countless times with asparagus and riced cauliflower - thanks for sharing it!!"

The changes I would make the next time: marinade longer, marinade deeper in the marinade, either remove the skin or cook skin side up so the cedar flavor is absorbed more into the fish. (I do like crispy skin.). Also, would cook it less time - it continued to cook and the last piece we ate was a little firmer than I prefer. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with burning planks. But I had no fire under the wood."

I followed the ingredients exactly, and highly recommend the extra effort of fresh ginger and garlic over the dry stuff. The only thing I did differently was I baked it in the oven. I still used the cedar plank and soaked it, then I lined a cookie sheet with foil and placed the plank on a wire rack over the cookie sheet. Baked at 360F until fish was 145F inside and it came out moist, flaky, and tender."
