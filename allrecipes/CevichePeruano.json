"reviewBody": "I am from Peru and our typical Peruvian Cebiche uses no potatoes, no celery, no cumin. \nWe basically cut the fish into 1/2-inch pieces (I love Bass or Tilapia), add salt, pepper, chop fresh cilantro, a bit of garlic and lime juice (about 8-10 limes). Fish has to be cooked in the lime juice. You can add shrimp/clams/octopus, it's optional. My family loves the original Cebiche, fish only. Add some fresh Aji Amarillo (Peruvian chili, looks like the Habanero but its taste is amazing and unique) or Aji Amarillo paste - you can buy them at any Latin Market - and mix it with the lime juice. Add some lettuce on the side as well as peeled &amp; cooked sweet potato (just a slice per person) and add some corn on the side as well (about 1/4 cup. \nDon't forget to add the onion (I use red onion - julienned red onion)."

My mom says its interchangeable - she usually makes it with lemon. And usually served with sweet potato &amp; corn (not regular potato). The sweet of the sweet potato and corn is supposed to counteract the the tangy-ness of the ceviche. Although I admit I sometimes serve it with chips (like the Mexican version)"

I've never seen white potato served in a cevicheria...but the sweet potato is a must. The onion should be sliced and this should NOT be eaten over crackers if you want authentic. Usually it is either plain fish (bass is more common than tilapia) or a lot of mixed sea creatures you won't find for sale in the States. Like a lot of Peruvians, I prefer the pure fish version."

The only changes I would make in the future would be to add more habanero because I like it spicy. Also great the next day with pita chips.\n\n*edit: I noticed that another user actually cooked the fish by sauteing it but it should be noted that in a ceviche recipe the fish is \"cooked\" through the lime juice marinade. It requires no heat. I hope this helps!"
