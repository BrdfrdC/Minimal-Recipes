Close the waffle maker and cook until the steaming stops and the chaffle is well browned, about 3 minutes. Don&#39;t overcook, as that will make it chewy. Repeat process with remaining batter."

"reviewBody": "Thank you for the recipe! It is with all due respect that I say the following. The values you listed for the macros are entirely dependent on the exact size/weight of the egg and the particular mozzarella used. Some mozzarellas will have more carbs. I am not trying to be picky by mentioning this. If one is really trying to be accurate and trying to limit their (or count) their carb intake, accurate macro measurement is necessary. This may not be entirely apparent to those who are new to keto or low carb living. I am new to this site but it looks wonderful! Jeff"
