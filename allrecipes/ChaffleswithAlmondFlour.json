I found that by increasing the almond flour to 3T, adding 1T sour cream or greek yogurt + 1t water + 1/8t of baking powder with a pinch of salt is a great alternative and produces a dryer result."

"reviewBody": "I was making just the egg and cheese chaffles as a savoury base for bacon and tomato. Adding the almond flour and baking powder completely change the texture. I found that otherwise the chaffles are quite greasy. I was in the mood for a treat this morning, so I added vanilla to these and then had a little bit of real maple syrup over top. Absolutely excellent. I will be adding the almond flour and the baking powder to savoury chaffles as well. For the savoury ones, I like adding spices into the mix, like onion and garlic powder or even curry powder. TIP: I make my own almond milk in a Vitamix. I save the resulting fine almond powder and I bake that until it dries out and I store it in the fridge. That works really well as almond flour in chaffles and is a huge cost savings."

I made it according to directions and then I put it in my butter coated small skillet and put spinach, a slice of bacon, some sauted jalapeno peppers and some about 28 grams of cheddar cheese to melt, then added my tuna packet and it was incredible. I love sandwiches and have missed them, so this will be my go to from now on!!! Thank you for a delicious bread substitute recipe that was super easy!!!"
