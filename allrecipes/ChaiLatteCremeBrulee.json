"reviewBody": "I did all the instructions correctly but to me it seems like the texture of the Brulee was a bit off. It may be due to the spice and other added ingredients. I baked it for longer than the time asked due to the Brulee seemly uncooked when taken out. I cooled it for 6 hours and caramelized the sugar. Once cracked into it seems a little gooey. I would prefer the original recipe."
