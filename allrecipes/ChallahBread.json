"reviewBody": "This recipe didn‚Äôt explain the technical side of making challah. It did taste and smell like Challah but the texture was all wrong. The braids all melted together into some strange Cronenberg-like shape. \n\nI didn‚Äôt understand the first part to ‚Äúbeat‚Äù the dry ingredients then fold it? Do I need a a spatula or a spoon or just my hands? The dough was sticky and then became so elastic that when I had to roll out the sections to braid after proofing they kept snapping back. Also asking to measure in diameter is silly. How long are these things supposed to be!? Lastly there was no mention to cover the bread to make sure the outside doesn't firm a hard crust. The crust i ended up with was that of a bagel and I had a blow out on the top. I think I'll look of another recipe elsewhere."

"reviewBody": "I think this is an absolute perfect base recipe for this bread. You can make it as it is and use it in so many ways, or modify for your purposes, which limits the usefulness. For instance, you can add more honey and eggs into the bread, brush honey with the egg on top, and it'll be a great treat, but not exactly usable for sandwiches. As it is, it's a great, subtle tasting sandwich bread that you can put anything on, like a brioche.\n\nI made it exactly as written except for two minor changes: I rested the dough for 15 minutes after first mixing it to allow the flour to absorb more water, and I baked it for about 5 minutes longer to get it to a 195 internal temperature. The resting allowed me to only use about 7.5 cups of flour, making it as fluffy as possible, and at 45 minutes and 195 degrees, it was not burned, but was perfectly done. It was sticky, but 1/8 of a cup of flour during kneading was enough to keep it mostly unsticky. Eating it, made as it is written, the slightly eggy taste of the eggwash brushed on top makes it addictive. I honestly just kept eating more and more of it to try it with different things, from cheese to honey, to butter, to summer sausage, and it just enhanced everything."

I made two loaves, one plain egg bread, the other with cinnamon sugar. It is very good. I made a few adaptations due to other reviews. I used 3/4 cup honey, and added an extra egg white. I would not change the recipe I used today. However, It was a little overcooked at 375 for 30 minutes. I think I would bake it at 350 next time. And the bottom was really dark so I would use either a stone or put down parchment. Overall great texture. I am not much of a cook and I am pretty pleased with the outcome. And it looks lovely!!"

I reduced bake time to 30 min and added wine-soaked raisins, a bit of extra honey, and 1 more egg. I am seeing suggestions to use just the egg yolk instead of the whole egg; this may be advisable to reduce the wetness of the dough. Color and the crust were lovely-- use parchment paper for easy clean-up."

It was my first experience making challah and I noticed that there was either too much liquid or too little flour. The dough was sticky even after kneading it for quite some time. I had to add a lot more flour and I braided it while still sticky. Also, it did not need 40 minutes of baking. I'm glad I removed it about 10 minutes earlier, otherwise it would be dry if not burned. Overall, it's a recipe I want to keep."

You can use cake flour to make it super airy if you wanted to. This is good with warm butter - Or you can use a little whole milk in place of the water for super nice tearing if you are using it for Shabbat. So many possibilities. Great recipe. It's the only one I'd use. You can pretty much do whatever you want to it and it turns out perfect."

As traditional challahs are served I left it whole for everyone to pull off their own pieces at the table. THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE! I should also note that I used my regular kitchen aid which really helped. Whisk for wet ingredients and switched to the hook once I started adding the flour - life saver."
