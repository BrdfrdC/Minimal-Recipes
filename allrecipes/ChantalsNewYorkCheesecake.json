I followed the recipe exactly except that I used double the butter in the graham cracker crust because 2 tbsp didn't seem like enough. (I actually wasn't sure if 15 graham crackers meant 15 of the whole big rectangle sheets that they come in, but I did use 15 of those and it seemed like an appropriate-sized crust.) Drizzled with some decorating gel to celebrate our team for the super bowl. :-)"

I love making it before I go to bed, let cool in the oven, get up in the morning and transfer to the fridge. Sometimes there’s a crack but it’s not very often. I just fill it with topping if there is. No. Big. Deal. The flavor is what matters and I’ve had over 50 different people try this guy over the years and everyone has always loved it."

I followed the recipe precisely, twice, and both times the finished product came out with the filling very dry and the crust very over baked. Baking at 350 for 1 hour and then leaving it in the oven for 5-6 hours with the door closed is far to much time. The cheesecake still cracked and as mentioned earlier produced an overcooked result. If I make this recipe again I will reduce the overall time to 2 hours."

It did crack but that may be because I couldn’t help myself and opened the oven door. So, I had the cracked slice (so I could pretend it had less calories lol). My boyfriend grew up in NY and told me it was the best cheesecake he ever had. I agree! Even his extremely opinionated and picky eater business partner said this is the real deal. I will make this cheesecake again and again! Thank you Chantal, for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "This was my first attempt at baking cheesecake. The filling was a little sweeter than I wanted it. I also changed the crust so that there was more butter and some sugar in it to make sure the crust will stay together once it sets in the refrigerator. I used whole wheat digestive biscuits instead of graham crackers. Make sure your ingredients are at room temperature. My cream cheese was still a little cold and it was too thick for my hand mixer to beat it. To resolve that, I let the cream cheese and sugar sit in the oven on low heat (60C) for 10-15 minutes and that did the job. Notes: I steam baked it with boiling water. In the end, one hour was not enough for the cheesecake to be fully cooked (I found out after letting it rest in the oven for 6 hours). What I did to fix that was steam bake it again (at the temperature in instructions) for nearly 15 minutes. It turned out perfect and I loved it. My mother approves of it!"

I will definitely be making this recipe again soon. Thanks for sharing"

I used a blender for the cream cheese and sugar, then I used a wooden spoon for the rest. I did, however, slightly whisk the eggs before blending with wooden spoon. The difference? First go around, used a blender the while time...only 80% of filling fit in pan. Second time, only used mixer for cream cheese and sugar...all of the filling fit. I followed suggestions and set a timer for 60 minutes. I did not touch the oven door...did not peak. The timer went off and I turned off the oven and went to cleaning. Approximately 2-3 hours later, removed from oven, removed from pan and refrigerated until the next evening. I have been asked to add this Cheesecake to bakery menu. Bravo...its a keeper. -Baker Betty"

This is the easiest cheesecake recipe to make and can be used as a base for many different flavors. It is the only one I have ever made that doesn't crack and it is so creamy. The 2 very most important directions to follow are... Do NOT overbeat. And leave it in the oven to cool. I set my oven for 1 hour and it shuts off after an hour. I don't open it at all to check on it or anything. The next morning, I put it in the refrigerator and that night, it is perfect for dessert! The cheesecake will come out perfect every single time."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe with some slight modifications. First starters, I use a different graham cracker recipe. 15 graham crackers, 1/2 cup butter, 1/3 cup white sugar, and 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon.\nAs for the cheesecake itself, I follow the recipe exactly as is, but being extra careful how I mix everything. I use a mixer for the cream cheese and sugar until smooth. I then switch over to a wooden spoon for the milk, eggs, sour cream, vanilla, and flour. Once everything is mixed, I will use the blender for a quick sec at the end to make sure it's smooth. \nI also highly recommend a water bath! Wrap the springform pan with some heavy duty aluminum foil and place in a larger roasting pan, then pour boiling water in the roasting pan before placing in the oven.\nAnd just like the recipe says, cook for an hour and then turn off the oven without opening the oven door. Leave in the oven for 5-6 hours and then I refrigerate overnight until I'm ready to serve."

"reviewBody": "My first time making cheese cake and I chose this one because of the simplicity yet authentic outcome expectation. The only changes I made were subbing half-n-half for milk, shortbread cookies instead of graham crackers for the crust, and added Hershey's chocolate syrup to make it a chocolate swirl cake. I had to cook it an additional 20 mins after it cooled 3 hours as it was too loose/not set up in the middle. The next evening my husband, who is from Bronx, NY, had it for his birthday and said it was better than the best NY restaurant cheese cake he had ever had... and he is very particular. Texture was perfectly smooth, nothing like the dryer, chunkier, cheese cakes I have had, and not sour but sweeter. I will be making this again! Yes, the top is dark due to the chocolate, not burnt or dry."

I used the exact ingredients, the only thing I did differently was cooking it. I wrapped my springform pan in foil and placed it in a large dish of hot water (based on some other reviews). After one hour of cooking the cake looked like batter still, so I kept cooking it ~15-20minutes. Just till I could see a little bit of firmness or coloring on top. I turned off the oven and let it sit for only 3 hours, because I didn't have time for 6 hours. It was just barely toasty on top, perfect color!! My husband absolutely LOVED it and said it was the best dessert I've ever made! Thanks!!"

I’ve added vanilla bean with extract, vanilla bean paste, or just extract. I always use a Bain Marie. Otherwise I don’t change anything. I cook it exact same temp and leave the door closed for at least 4 hours. If this recipe doesn’t work for you, you’re probably not getting ingredients to room temp or over mixing. And don’t use low fat anything, you will NOT get the same amazing results. All of my lumps did not disappear before I put it in springform. I take it off stand mixer as soon as it looks incorporated, then a few folds with my spatula."

This causes the cake to rise and split (yesterday’s version looked like a soufflé). 2. Cook at 325 instead of 350...I’ve done it on both and 325 worked better for me. 3. The recipe doesn’t call for a water bath which gives it a nice cheesecake consistency. If you want a more custard-like texture, do a water bath. 4. Line the bottom of the tin with parchment paper if you want to remove this from the tin. I had issues taking it off. This cake has only cracked twice for me and I just hide it with a fruit compote."
