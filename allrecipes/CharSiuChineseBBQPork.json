I marinated it 24 hours, with the tenderloin cut up into 3\" wide chunks. Wow! I baked it at 350 degrees for 40 minutes - flipping the pieces after 20 minutes. I did place them on a rack - which I normally do anyway - and poured a cup of water into the baking pan. I have used NOH chinese barbecued pork packages for 40 + years. This is better!"

Simply take 6 to 10 half-inch to one-inch slices of boneless pork chops, use a Jaccard ( you passionate at-home chefs know what I mean here ) or meat tenderizer mallet on each slice before placing in the marinating bag. Following step 2: TRIPLE the sauce for marinating ( OVER-NIGHT ) and saving the reserve ( in a separate container ) for basting, dipping AND pouring a generous amount on the last step of the mentioned \"Baked Fried Rice\" recipe.

"reviewBody": "love it on the grill. However, I've been kind of lazy lately and broiled it in my toaster oven. I followed the marinade, placed the pork in a ziplock, marinated for at least 3 days on accident, made it extra tasty. The only substitute was really teriyaki instead of soy, makes it more sweet, less salty. I also don't like ketchup, used some Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce instead and then reduced the brown sugar. I don't usually measure everything, just kind of eyeball it, but am usually pretty close. Between broiling in the toaster oven and the gas grill, can't really tell much of a difference. 15 minutes on broil makes it pretty glazed in the toaster, no need to flip, but you clean up and cook time is a little easier. If I'm making a lot for many, I bust out the charcoal grill and it really steps it up a notch."

Given the shape of a tenderloin, I took that to mean SLICES and this made the pork VERY dried out after cooking...even though I didn't cook for half as long as recommended and basted regularly. A similar recipe read “cut pork roast in half lengthwise and each half again lengthwise forming 4 long thick pieces of pork.” That makes more sense! 2 halves might even be enough."

However, the hoisin sauce and the Chinese Five Spice used in this (and most char siu recipes) have unique and distinctive flavors that some people will dislike immensely. \nI made this per the recipe with three exceptions. I had no Chinese wine so substituted garlic red wine vinegar that I had on hand, I omitted the traditional red food coloring, and I marinated the pork for 18 hours to maximize the flavor. It turned out fantastic, the wonderful char siu flavor I was yearning for. I couldn't resist eating a few pieces hot off the grill but the remainder is destined to be an ingredient in my fried rice. After cooling, I vacuum sealed the meat into 4 portions for freezing and future use. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!"

Pieces we’ve had in restaurants always seemed smaller diameter than ours. I marinated the pork in a gallon bag for about 28 hours. I followed it exactly except for two changes: 1st I left out the red food coloring. 2nd, I did not have any Rice Wine so I substituted Apple Cider Vinegar per a substitution link online. My husband was thrilled with the flavor. I don’t recall tasting the 5 spice in restaurant BBQ pork but we really enjoyed this."

I cut out the red food colouring, only used 1.5 tbsp of honey, and added 1 clove of minced garlic and the taste was still way off. It was too sweet and the marinade didn't soak into the surface of the meat like it was supposed to.\n\nI've never used ketchup in Chinese cooking for a good reason, and this \"char siu\" just proved to me why you should never use ketchup in traditional Chinese food. The marinade became too runny when I brushed it onto the meat near the end. I'm never making this recipe again."

The port did turn out well, but the sauce wasn't spectacular. The food coloring made it look more authentic, but it didn't add anything beyond turning the meat a bright red and staining my hands when the bag I was marinating in slipped.\n\nThe taste was fine, but not out of this world. I probably won't make again, there are other recipes I enjoyed more."

"reviewBody": "I like this recipe and have made it three times, with modifications the second and third time. Some observations: Chinese use pork butt for Char Siu because we love the fat and it really is part and parcel to the authentic dish. That said, I used tenderloin the first time, pork sirloin roast the second, and pork shoulder the last. The latter/fatter cut was better in flavor and juiciness, but of course, less healthy.\n\nI do like pretty red colored char siu but against my better judgement, I used the full 2 tablespoons of food color which was huge overkill. I went with 1 tablespoon the second time and it was still way too much and stained my cutting board. Food coloring is terrible for our bodies so cut it way back, or not at all, or as suggested, substitute red bean paste or boil down some beets if you want it red. \n\nI also like five spice, but take care how much you use. It will overpower all other ingredients. I suggest 1/2 teaspoon or less.\nReserve 1/2 cup of the marinade for non-cross contaminated basting before you bag up the meat, and marinate it no less than overnight. It needs to be in the soup that long to penetrate. Don't cook it for an hour or you'll overcook. Use a thermometer and pull it at 145 degrees and let it rest. The water pan is a good suggestion if you are using leaner cuts. A whole butt roast makes a lot, so I portion it up and freeze pieces for later use. I just made \nChar Siu, doufu, fan (BBQ pork tofu over rice) using bean paste as the main seasoning f"

We marinated our tenderloins for 8 hours (cutting the two into four 2-inch thick loins). He cooked this on the charcoal grill over indirect heat as directed, but He kept the water pan in the whole time. The loins being only 2 inches thick reached 145° in 40 minutes, so watch your time. I cooked the remaining marinade on the stove-top, adding in some cornstarch to thicken it and he basted the meat. Next time I'll make a batch and half of the sauce, it really was great tasting, but we really had to stretch it. We served over white rice with broccoli, all a great combination. Just a note, if you have a green egg cooker, there is a YouTube video on how you can cook this like the Cantonese do by hanging it in your grill."
