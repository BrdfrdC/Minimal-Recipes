I tried multiple dough recipes and always came out with hockey pucks.\nI have made won tons since forever and do them very well. This recipe is a God send. Today is Saturday and Fr. Jamie is coming Monday. I was down to the wire and you saved my neck! Thanks ever so much!!!! Glad you are so smart!"

(they are not cheap)\nA time saving tip is use instant mashed potatoes... there is no difference in the outcome or taste.\nAlso, WonTon wrappers are a good substitute for perogie shells"

These came out delicious and pretty (I have celiac disease, so I made my own gluten free dough). I did some with caramelized onion added to the filling too, which I thought stepped the flavor up a notch. \nMy only complaint would be the lack of measurement for salt and pepper. being a first time maker, I didn't have a starting reference point to go off for seasoning the filling."

"reviewBody": "The 4 stars are because it sounds and looks so good. Plan to try this, but need some clarification. Written recipe says 2 TBSP filling and the video says 2 TSP. I guess I'll try it and see. Will post an update soon. FOR MY UPDATE: I'm sticking with the 4 stars. I had to use square wonton wrappers as none of my local stores carried round ones. Used 1/2 cream cheese and 1/2 ricotta as I was not able to find farmer's cheese. I was able to fit a hefty 1 tsp of filling into the wrapper and the square worked just fine. They came out great. I've never made a pierogi before, but using the wonton wrappers was a breeze. Like others, I had WAY more filling than I was able to use with my package of wrappers. I think the package had 50 wrappers and I had enough filling for at least another 25. No biggie, I'll just get two packages of wrappers next time. I froze the ones that I didn't cook right away and am going to try them from frozen tonight. Can't wait to try a batch with some spinach worked into the filling."

We all liked these, and I've made cabbage, mushroom and sweet pierogis using the wonton wrappers as well. Not quite the same consistency or flavor, but a heck of a lot less work."

My boyfriend has the idea to serve them on a bed of iceburg lettuce with apples and green onions and it was amazing definitely making these again sometime although they take a long time to do even cheating not making the dough."
