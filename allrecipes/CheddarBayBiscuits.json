It made 21 biscuits, so I think next time I would add 1cup of cheese. Even the video, the dough looks like it has more cheese than 3oz. I've never been to the Red Lobster, so I don't have anything to compare it with."

Seattle WA. It's made exclusively for Red Lobster &amp; has 4 packs of biscuit mix that make 10 biscuits each &amp; pkts. of garlic herb blend to mix w/melted butter to put on top. All you add is shredded cheddar and water &amp; butter. The are EXACTLY like what they serve at the restaurant! Yummy!!!"

Prior to baking, I brush them with: melted butter, fresh minced garlic, fresh parsley and chives. This gives them a nice crispy top and very moist interrior. After cooling, I wrap them in 2's in plastic wrap and put all in the freezer bag. Pull two out, defrost and bake on 300 for about 5 minutes."

"reviewBody": "personal opinion, they meant to say 3 c. baking mix rather than 4... Tried it the way it's written. Okay, I used a gluten free 1 for 1 baking mix, and my water/milk was coconut milk made from coconut powder according to directions, and if anything it was lighter rather than heavier than milk, and probably extra cheese, more than 3 oz. It came out a very dry dough, so I added about 3 tbsp. plain yogurt to moisten it up a bit, but still not enough. Was very crumbly, just barely holding together, and after baking sufficient time, tasted doughy, and could not taste the cheese much either. Also made more than 20 rather large biscuits. So that's why I think they meant \"3 cups\" baking mix. I may try it again someday, with that adjustment."

I followed the instructions and the ingredient list was surprisingly basic, but the results were spectacular. Everyone loved them and said it was a new family regular. Cheddar Bay Biscuits ftw!"

Versatile, since I served these with soup, as sausage biscuits in the morning, and then as dumplings for stew the next day. I may try what others have suggested and add a little Old Bay if I'm serving with seafood."

The 1 1/3 cups of water was a little too much for the 4 cups of biscuit mix and I had to sprinkle in some extra mix to make the dough stop being sticky and turn soft and pliable. I would recommend changing the recipe to say add water until the dough forms. I would also go so far as to make extra garlic butter for dipping the biscuits, because it was so good."

The 1st time I made these, I did the drop type biscuit, but wasn't wowed by the \"look\" of them. Since, each time I've made them, I don't roll them out either, but I've shaped the dough the square, then cut the square into 8 smaller squares."

I did not add the spices to the biscuits directly but did use them as directed in the butter used to finish them. \n\nThey were a hit although I think Ill increase the cheese next time.. I used extra sharp cheddar.\n\nI had purchased the red lobster brand mix at costco and was annoyed when I got home and found out that the cost of making the biscuits was just about doubled by the cheese I had to add to the mix. This version is every bit as good as the mix and a lot cheaper."
