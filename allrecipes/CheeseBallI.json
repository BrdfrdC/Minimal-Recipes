I made sure to get dressing and seasoning mix in 1 oz envelope, not the dip, as one reviewer urges. This was too firm even at room temp and so salty as to be inedible. I tried \"fixing\" it to no avail. Sorry...sometimes the old fashioned way is best. I learned my lesson and will stick to my go-to recipe. (may try with half pkg of dressing mix...)"

I don't think I would have liked it without the green onions b/c it would have been way too bland. You do not need 3.5 cups of cheddar. I used about 2 but will do 2.5 next time. I'm pretty sure I didn't use 2 cups of pecans b/c I didn't measure that part just chopped and rolled till they were covered."

It came out perfect dish loved by everyone. Thanks for recipe, hints, and substitutions everyone."

"reviewBody": "This was super easy and really good! I thought the entire packet of ranch dressing mix would make it taste overpowering... It didn't, and was great! But it is VERY important to get the \"dressing\" mix and NOT the \"dip\" mix! Otherwise, it would be waaaay too salty- I have made that mistake before. I had to omit coating it with pecans, due to someone having an allergy, so I chopped half the amount called for and only added it mixed in to one side. (I made cute flags to label each side.) For a little kick, I added in some diced jalapenos. This was loved and will be a keeper in regular rotation for parties &amp; appetizers!"

Texture might have been softer if I had, but it tasted fine."

My husband initially turned his nose up at it, but was the first to dig into the leftovers and complained when it was gone, and he is extremely picky. I make two balls out of this recipe and usually immediately freeze one of them. It freezes wonderfully, but as it almost always gets pulled out and eaten within 2 months (we LOVE it) i can't vouch for its longetivity. Thanks for a great recipe. I usually add a dash of worchestershire sauce and a little garlic."

For the Ranch dressing use salad dressing mix. I used a food processor to finely chop the pecans. Put that in a plate to the side. Then I mixed the cream cheese, cheddar cheese and dressing mix in the food processor. I formed the mixture into a ball with my hands and then rolled the ball in the finely chopped pecans.

This year, I wanted to get rid of the MSG that is in the dressing mix, so I substituted Pampered Chef's Garlic Garlic seasoning (which is basically just minced garlic, minced onion, etc.) and a couple of tablespoonfuls of buttermilk. Came out great. :)"

"reviewBody": "This would probably be okay, but the Hidden Valley ranch dressing mix I bought (and I DID make sure it said dressing and not dip!) was in a new looking packet...I think they have now upped the salt in this. The packet I bought weighed only .4 oz, but that was the only one I saw that said dressing mix. I love salt, but this is so salty...I am so disappointed. I added extra cream cheese in hopes it would take away some of the saltiness, but it didn't. I made these for Christmas gifts, but now I have to throw them out...big waste of money and time for me."

I only used 1 1/2 cups mild chedder cheese and 1/2 cup of very finely chopped ham. i forgot to add green onions like someone suggested but i can't see why it's really needed once you add the ranch. i did use almost all the ranch i left out about a table spoon because as i poured it in it seemed like more than enough. Covered it in choppped peacans (which i hate) for decorative purpose. but you couldn't even taste the peacans at all! To me it just added a little texture and very pretty coating. I will make this at every party! and even for a midnight snack sometimes."

"reviewBody": "Definitely a very simple way to make a good tasting cheese ball. Nothing to brag about to the world, but comes in handy if you need something simple to take to parties. The pecans give it that \"classic\" look and crunch and the 2 simple cheeses are better together than expected. I will say the quantities for this are huge. I realize the quantities are easy to measure, but you will make multiple cheese balls out of these quantities. So be prepared before you make it - you'll either need to be at a huge party, or be desiring to keep some at home for a few weeks. Go from about 1/3 of the recipe if you want just a normal size cheese ball."

I also don't use the pecans, but instead use the extra shredded cheese to cover the outside of the ball. Plus, since I'm a Packer fan, I sprinkle a little parsley on the outside, so it's \"green and gold\" for gameday! : )"

I made the small balls and rolled them in finely chopped/almost ground pecans. Everyone loved them."

I doubled the recipe and made two large cheese balls the pecans and two large cheese logs I rolled in pecans. I toasted the pecans which gave them an added sweetness and crunch. I also only used about 1/2 - 3/4 oz Ranch dressing mix and this was plenty, any more and it would be too salty and over-power the other flavors. I, too, only added 2 1/2 cups sharp cheddar cheese. More and the cheddar would have over-powered the other flavors, probably because I did use sharp cheddar. Both the plain and the pecan were equally enjoyed by the wedding guests."

For easier blending, using a stand up mixer with the flat blade, or use food handling gloves for hand mixing. If using packaged cheese I use Kraft's Meixican blend, if using freshly shredded cheese, I use co-jack. To roll in the pecans easily, I spread the chooped pecans on a sheet of saran wrap. Then simply roll the log (or ball) onto the pecans, wrap up in the saran wrap and pop into the fridge! This is best with Ritz crackers or those little chicken biscuit crackers by Nabisco."
