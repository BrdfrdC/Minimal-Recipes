I think I would have liked ricotta better. Too much filling, too little batter. I’ll look for another recipe for cheese blintzes."

"reviewBody": "I used Basic Crepes from AR as the base as this is our favourite recipe, I doubled the recipe which made 12 crepes with a 1/3 cup scoop. For the cheese part, I think the recipe submitter means dry curd cottage cheese or farmer's cheese as the cottage cheese we know is too liquidy. I used ricotta cheese and the texture was perfect, next time I would add lemon zest to bump up the lemon taste. I used a 1/8 cup scoop for the filling and I had enough for 12 exactly. I baked them in a 350 degree oven as 425 is way too high for the delicate crepes. My grandmother fried them in butter after filling then sprinkled buttered bread crumbs over top. I served with apricot sauce and my sons loved them.\n#AllrecipesAllstarsCanada\n#InternationalFavourites\n#FacelessNoMore"

"reviewBody": "This a good recipe but I would suggest some modification. 1) Double Crepe batter and adjust thickness with milk to the consistency of Heavy Cream. Leftovers freeze well for about a month. 2)Place the Cheese in a fine sieve or cheese cloth lined colander overnight to firm and dry. Drained Ricotta works very well, or, depending on your part of the country, Friendship Farmers Cheese is a classic choice. 3)For an Extra Crispy exterior, saute over medium/high heat in Butter turning until Brown and Crisp. 4)To finish sprinkle with cinnamon sugar OR Top with your favorite Fruit Preserves and Sour cream. I'm partial to Strawberry or Blueberry! Enjoy...JJ"

"reviewBody": "I had two problems with this recipe. The crepe batter was too thick and after struggling to get it to spread in the pan, I added water to make it workable. I had the opposite problem with the filling. It was very thin and difficult to work with. Even after beating on high speed for 5 minutes, it was still not really smooth, as called for. The thinness of the filling made it hard to get much filling inside the crepes and there was a lot of filling left over. I wonder if the cottage cheese should be drained before adding?"

"reviewBody": "These were delicious! Be sure to use full fat cottage cheese - I used low fat (what I had on hand) and it went runny when baked, but the taste was fantastic! I doubled the batch and made some plain crepes for the kids and had just enough filling, ending up with 12 filled crepes and 8 plain. I will definitely do this one again"
