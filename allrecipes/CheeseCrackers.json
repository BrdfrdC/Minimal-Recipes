Recipes like this I put together but only place a few in the oven to not only give the recipe as written on honest try before I make my variations. From the 1 recipe I enjoyed several varieties of crackers that boxed in the store would cost a pretty penny!!"

The crispy, cheesy flavor is so much better than any commercially made cheese crackers. I made no changes to the recipe. The dough didn't \"roll\" into balls, I had to compress balls by hand and I found it much easier to flatten them by hand rather than with a fork. We could taste the red pepper in them, but it's just a hint of heat. I'm putting a bit more pepper when I make them just for us as we like spicy foods. I've also made them twice for coffee hour at church and they were a big hit there, with people coming back for more.... and more."

They are cheesy and buttery and just a tad spicy (even the guests who shy away from spicy food enjoyed them). And the leftovers (like I said, it made a lot) were great for the next week or so (in an airtight container)."

"reviewBody": "Tasty. I just made them, and am already imagining them alongside some cream of tomato soup or with an iced glass of tomato juice w/lemon, or maybe with some different dips. They were done in my oven in 23 minutes. I baked them on parchment paper, so I don't know how they'd come out on a plain cookie sheet, but with all the butter --- probably fine. One possible tip: Maybe it's our high altitude, but the cracker dough didn't \"roll\" into balls for me. They needed to be compressed by hand and \"formed\" into balls. I wondered if they would fall apart during the baking process, but they came out fine. I'm thinking of trying some pepper-jack cheese in them next time. Or some fresh chives. How about oregano or basil ? They're a fun, new treat, though."

Next time may try topping with sesame seeds and a light dusting of paprika. The heat wasn't overwhelming so everyone enjoyed them. I almost forgot the last pan and they were golden brown--a bit too done! 25-30 min. was perfect in my oven. My suggestion would be to watch carefully after 20 min. because once they begin to turn color they over cook very quickly."

Instead of red pepper flakes, I used cayenne pepper (1/4 tsp. plus a couple of extra shakes) to get the flavor I was looking for. I was surprised what a difference the rice krispies made -- they lighten up the crackers and give them a nice crunch while still letting the cheesy flavor come through. Be sure to cool them on paper towels when they come out of the oven to absorb the excess fat. This recipe also makes a lot which is good because once you taste them, you're going to want more!"

I had been searching for a gluten free cheese cracker recipe that my kids would eat. \n\nI tried the recipe with white flour so I would know what it's \"supposed\" to taste like. Then I made it with brown rice flour and gluten free Rice Krispies. Tasted the same, the kids love it. We used extra sharp cheddar cheese from Tillamook, the kids won't eat it plain generally but it was great in the cracker."
