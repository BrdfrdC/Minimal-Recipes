I used spicy cheese dip instead of velveeta. I live in California, not originally from here and I think velveeta is outlawed here. It was well received but I was disappointed that it didn‚Äôt hold its form and plated more like mashed potatoes. I‚Äôll have to look for my family recipe. Not sharing that but you‚Äôll be ok with this. Maybe add additional egg or eggs ."

I had reduced the recipe from 10 servings down to 5, using the serving adjuster on the recipe page, and all was great. \nI came in to print the recipe for future use, but the serving adjuster isn't behaving properly. Last night, the milk and water amounts were like 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon. Today, it's showing 2 Tablespoons, a teaspoon, and a half a teaspoon, each, for the milk and the water. Something seems amiss here."
