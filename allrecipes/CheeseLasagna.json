Mixed with one egg, parsley, some mozz, some parm, some fresh ground pepper. I added more veg to the sauce. Baked for 45 min covered, 20 min uncovered. If the top is not brown enough for your liking, turn on the broiler for a wee bit. Let sit at least 15 min before cutting. There is no need at ALL for using no boil noodles. Buy your favourite non-no boil brand and use them as is without boiling. It turns out much better."

I also added chopped parsley to the ricotta and included more mozzarella on each layer instead of only at the top. It turned out pretty well and is a nice basic recipe. Next time I think I would use a little less egg (I only used 2 since it was half batch so maybe 1.5 eggs?) and I would probably add more garlic and some veggies like spinach and mushrooms or a little crumbled sausage. It‚Äôs a nice basic recipe that doesn‚Äôt take too much time."

As written, I'd give it about 4 stars but with a few tweaks I'd give it a 5. \n\nNormally I hate rating a recipe after tweaking it, but here's what I did a wee bit different:\n\n- Added 5 to 5 1/2 cups of sauce instead of 4\n- Used oven ready noodles and baked for 1 hr 15 min\n- Added a cup of shredded mozzarella to each ricotta layer\n- Added a tsp of Italian seasoning to ricotta mixture\n- Only used 2 eggs\n\nReally easy to do, very delicious dinner. Will be using this recipe from now on."

"reviewBody": "It's ok, but not amazing. The ricotta bechamel sauce in this recipe is overpowering. I used only 2 of the 4 eggs called for &amp; the lasagna was still way too strong on ricotta &amp; egg flavor. I added extra parmesan &amp; mozzarella to help balance out the bechamel as the bechamel seemed really thick &amp; worrisome, but those cheeses couldn't compete with the amount of ricotta involved. I heard other people say the sauce needed to be increased so I increased it dramatically but it was still not enough sauce. This recipe is great for teaching the basics of lasagna, and the end result was still ok, but it wasn't the astoundingly fantastic experience that lasagna can be. Thank you for a good starting point!"

If you have a 9x13 pan, and the noodles are standard size lasagna noodles, then you'll only need to cook 9 of them (maybe 1 or 2 extra, in case one tears) to make the noodle layers."

You do not have to boil the noodles ( just use the regular noodles) layer as usual, mix 1/2 cup water with sauce left in jar, prior to baking pour around edges of dish, cover tightly w foil , when done let stand w/ o uncovering. Then just serve as usual. \n(I usually mix 1 thawed, squeezed, pkg of frozen chopped spinach to the ricotta mixture). Can also be made w meat in the sauce."

It was the first time I had ever made lasagna, so I didn't know exactly how many noodles I would need, so cooked the whole box. They were whole wheat noodles. Used 2% milk mozarella cheese and low fat ricotta cheese. Used chunky tomato pasts sauce. Could have used a little more than 32 oz., at least in my opinion. But the in-laws went back for more. They couldn't believe it was the first time I ever made lasagna."

Then, as I was about to put it in the oven I realized I forgot the Italian seasoning so I just sprinkled some on top. I definitely, definitely want to try adding spinach next time. As some other reviewers alluded to I think you could do with using slightly less noodles and slightly more cheese and sauce. Thank you for the great recipe!"

When mixing the cheese and eggs I added in a bag of mozzarella cheese to it to get the extra cheesey flavor throughout the dish (otherwise it would not have been cheesey at all). Also, on top I added some mild cheddar cheese as well to make it look more like lasagna. With those changes it came out fantastic. - Thanks for the recipe."
