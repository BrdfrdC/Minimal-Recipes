"reviewBody": "Great base recipe to tinker with, I used Beyond Beef crumbles, used 2 eggs, topped off with real mozzarella and garnished with parsley. Be aware, if you cook with plant based \"meat\" you have to conteract the dryness and make up for the lack of natural oils and grease. I use a combination of cheap beer and water while cooking the \"meat\" and add tomato based sauce as needed while simmering. It was perfect, kudos to to OP of this recipe. Cooking times and amounts were spot on. I live at 7000 ft so this can be dicey at times. So thank you."

"reviewBody": "I just tried this recipe .I have to admit I did what I usually critisize others for doing,I changed the recipe some, from the beginning.I like to use ricotta in these type of recipes and don't usually use cottage cheese.My boyfriend and I really liked it and thought it was very tastey.I used 2 oz more of the ricotta because it was cheaper to use a big container then 2 small ones and they only had 32 oz ones.I liked the meat sauce but it just seemed too thick from the beginning and I felt that using all that tomato paste it was going to get thicker.I aded some water(maybe 1/2 can) and rinsed out tomato paste can.After cooking the sauce for just a little while,following the recipe, it started to stick and was pretty thick.I ended up adding more water then and before I added it on top of the manicotti.It worked good that way.Next time I might add a small can of diced tomatoes to get more liquid with taste(not just water although that worked fine)to it.My boyfriend usually doesn't like meat sauce on cheese manicotti,he likes a a meatless meal sometimes, but there was no complaints and a lot eaten.I used garlic powder instead of the salt.I like to control my salt and my garlic so I have never been fond of using garlic salt.I had never made roasted garlic before,I was not sure I could do it right.It was very easy and delicious.We used the leftover garlic on bread with butter.Delicious and it seemed to work very well in the sauce.Thank you for this recipe."
