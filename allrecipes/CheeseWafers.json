Left out the red pepper flakes, and increased the pepper sauce just a bit - less spicy than my usual \"Cheese Pennies\" from Maida Heatters Book of Great Cookies pp. 269-270. Added a few TBSP. of heavy cream to dough at the end to make it a bit more malleable and hold together and make into a nice roll."

"reviewBody": "A few changes are needed. Make sure both the cheese and butter are at room temperature and cream them together BEFORE adding the flour. This will help the dough come together. Also recommend adding a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce. \nOther optional ingredients include smoked or regular paprika, which add both taste and color if you are using a white cheddar. \nIf you want them crispy, you must slice them VERY thinly. I happen to like them a bit soft. You can also omit the chopped pecans, and put a pecan half on top of each wafer, secured with a bit of egg white for different look."

Stir in cheese, hot sauce and pepper flakes, THEN add the flour , etc., to make any kind of workable dough. I would also suggest finely chopping the nuts and that the wafers not be sliced any thinner than 1/4\", otherwise they shatter during removal from baking pan."

Rather than adding all the cheese, I kept 1/2 back then put 1/3rd on rolled out pastry, folded in 3, turned &amp; rolled again, then repeated twice more. This gave a nice - almost puff pastry - wafer, rather similar to a Dutch brand of Cheese Crispies - also used 50% cheddar, 50% gouda cheese."

I put paprika on the top of each wafer before I cooked them. I also put a pecan half on the top. After experimenting they were good. To each ones taste how spicy and hot you like them. But the basic recipe is good."

I made a batch according to the recipe and another one with a milder cheese and different seasoning. Both were great. One batch needed a little water to form a dough. (Perhaps it depends on the moisture content of the cheese.) Both batches sliced cleanly with no crumbling and held their shapes fine. Nice non-sweet treat!"
