"reviewBody": "I liked the idea of this recipe because I'm supposed to be gluten free. We like Hamburger Helper occasionally and this was perfect as I could use gluten free mac. I did adjust a bit just for our personal taste/cooking style. I always precook my burger when I buy it and freeze it. So, I sauteed the onions in butter, garlic and onion powder. Then I added my thawed burger and water. After the noodles were done, it looked a little dry to me, so I added about a 1/4 C milk. I added about 4 TBLS of sour cream, just because we like it, some shredded mild cheddar and another 2 oz of Velveeta (it wasn't creamy enough) We loved it! Great, easy comfort food! Would be great with crumbled bacon and/or mushrooms too!"

This recipe is a little more natural - but you are still using that processed cheese, which reduces the value of a 'homeade' recipe further. Good recipe, but the boxed kits are easier and you get basically the same thing."

I use a whole pound of ground beef, gluten free macaroni, and grate a block of extra sharp cheddar (instead of the processed cheese). I also add the optional cumin and chili powder as noted in the recipe. My teenagers love it."

"reviewBody": "I like this recipe because it's versatile and hard to break. I made a lot of changes to fit what I like and what I had on hand. I used a pound of ground beef to start. I ended up with about 1 1/2 cups of minced sweet onion so threw it all in. I like the idea of cooking the macaroni with the sauteed onion and ground beef and seasonings because the pasta absorbs more flavor that way. I used 2 teas. dry chicken bouillon, a generous few shakes of garlic salt, McCormick Steak seasoning which has various herbs, salt and pepper. When the pasta was cooked I threw in a handful of chopped fresh parsley and 8 ounces of grated sharp cheddar cheese. I don't ever have Velveeta on hand. I forgot the sour cream and it turned out wonderful anyway. I will make again soon!"

Drain the cooked pasta then add it to the meat mixture. I'm not a fan of Velveeta, so I used Asadero and cheddar (about half/half in portion). I did not add minced onion, I used french onion dip instead of sour cream at the end. Easy and quick."

I used 1 lb of ground organic turkey, 2 tsp of both garlic and onion powder, one qtr onion, 1cup milk and 1cup water and about 2.5 cups rotini since i did not have elbows. i also omitted sour cream since i did not have. i used mozzarella but not a full 8 oz. it was really good and a great alternate to the box. will def make again and would prob add a veggi like broccoli."
