I think other reviewer's bacon idea would be a nice addition too."

I basically used the filling from 'Slider-Style Mini Burgers' from this site and added in the chopped dill pickles. We thought these were great and was a fun twist on a regular cheeseburger. Served them w/ ranch and 'Roasted Onion Mayonnaise' from this site for dipping. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)"

I made half of it the way it was written and for the other half I used the meat, cooked and crumbled bacon, onion, bbq sauce and cheddar cheese. One pound of meat definitely is not enough to use all of the egg roll wrappers, but it easily fed my family. Like someone else suggested, I thought it wasn't enough oil, but I just let them cook on one side and then flipped them. It was less than 4-5 minutes on each side, but just watch them and you'll be fine. I'm definitely making these again."
