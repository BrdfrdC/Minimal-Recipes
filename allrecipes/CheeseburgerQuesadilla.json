Using 1 lb. of hamburger made four 6\" quesadillas. I didn't have any sweet relish, so I cut up dill pickles. I also just squeezed some ketchup and mustard on the quesadilla which was easier for me. To knock it up a notch, I did add a 1/4 tsp. of cumin to spice it up and used 6 inch homemade tortillas!"
