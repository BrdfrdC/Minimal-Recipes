Definitely more work than I want to put in for a regular weeknight or even weekend meal, but much less than a true beef wellington. Great for special occasions!"

"reviewBody": "I made this last night for dinner, it was so fun to make and looked gorgeous! I made two of these, one beef and bacon, the other a meat alternative, both worked out really well. I seasoned up the meat how we like it, and for fun, added pickles. I think next time I'll add sauteed onions and use slices of cheese because the shredded left a little empty cavity on the top of the burger after the cheese melted. I have only worked with puff pastry a few times, definitely remove it from the pan while cooling. By the time we were done with dinner, the remainders were nicely darkened on the bottoms. Thank you, Chef for another great dinner!"
