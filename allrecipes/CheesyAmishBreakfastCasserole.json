I have made it three times since discovering the recipe, last month, and I think my favorite thing about it(besides it being delicious)is how versatile and customizable it is. I have used different cheese, used ham instead of the bacon once and use a shallot instead of an onion to give it a more subtle flavor. don't be afraid to make this dish and play around with it."

"reviewBody": "This is incredible! I do not usually like the texture of these type casseroles at all, but this one was different. I read lots of reviews and ended up making 2. The first one I used the \"crispy crowns\" air fried until very crisp and then added to the bottom as a \"crust.\" I cooked a small amount of spicy sausage and onions and then added drained rotel, onions, garlic, green chiles, dry mustard, white pepper, and the \"real\" bacon pieces from the bag (because I didn't have regular bacon) in a skillet. I added the eggs (9), cottage cheese, mozzarella in place of cheddar because that's what I had, and topped it with sliced colby-jack in place of the swiss. In the second one I omitted the potatoes to keep it low carb and plan to use low carb tortillas and add colby pepper jack when I warm them and use the casserole and Cholula chipotle sauce to make spicy breakfast burritos! Thanks for the flexible recipe!"

I always fry up the hash browns &amp; cool before combining with other ingredients. I also add a couple Tbsp chopped fresh garlic, salt, pepper, paprika, and McCormick (?) Montreal steak seasoning blend. I've changed up the meat to include turkey or regular sausage, bacon, or ham. I've done all 3 at once to total up to 1 pound of meat. Depending on what I have in the kitchen, I try to add some veggies for color, texture, and flavor. I've tried red or green bell pepper, mushrooms, green onion, parsley, and fresh chopped green chile. I add &amp; cook these with the onion and garlic and spices, then cool. I add more eggs and/or cheese to adjust if mix becomes too thick."

"reviewBody": "This was outstanding! Very creamy, cheesy, and delicious! I was wondering about the whole cottage cheese thing, but it turned out wonderfully -- I'm guessing because that provided the dairy to the eggs that you normally get with milk or cream. Everyone had 2nds when I took it to work, and the 6 person team ate an entire 9X13 pan. I will definitely make it again! I added an 8 oz pkg of sliced mushrooms to the party (sauteed first), and did mine with 1/2 bacon and 1/2 sausage. Because I added items, I also added 3 more eggs for an even dozen and it worked out perfectly."

I'd recommend using diced hash browns instead (maybe precooked a bit to make sure they're completely done). For some reason I think I expect shredded hash browns to always be nice and crispy, and this felt like it was shreds of cheese that didn't melt!"

"reviewBody": "I was really nervous about the cottage cheese but it def helped the texture and moisture. This really wasnâ€™t that cheesy so some cheese on top could help because it was actually a little dry but maybe I cooked too long? Awesome base recipe to use and add your own fixings to. Itâ€™s really not a lot of meat either so I ended up throwing in some pre cooked sausage crumbles (about a cup) just to make sure it was hearty enough. I served with tomatoes, green onion, and avocado on sourdough with Louisiana hot sauce. I did also broil the top at the end cuz the bottom felt done but the top hadnâ€™t gotten that nice color yet."

I layered potatoes, sausage, cheeses and poured eggs over. Would definitely combine eggs and cheeses next time - didn't like the finished look. 50 minutes was perfect baking time in glass 9x13."

I added in a half of an orange bell pepper and half of a tomato both diced and cooked with the onion bacon mixture. It added a bit more depth and well help clear out my fridge at the same time. Super easy! The precooking of the hash browns took off about 8 minutes of my cook time once the egg mixture is added. Since I precooked the hash browns while I was working on the onion mixture it didnâ€™t take any extra time in the kitchen. Highly recommend!"

I made a much larger one than the recipe calls for upping the amount of ingredients. I also put both Bacon &amp; Jimmy Dean HOT breakfast sausage in it. It took about an hour and a half to cook so I covered it in foil until the last 20 minutes. I took it to work and put out salsa, jalapenos, corn &amp; flour tortillas, Sour cream and cilantro. I went to my desk to get my phone to take a picture of it AND LITERALLY... IT WAS GONE IN 10 MINUTES!!!! Excellent recipe!!! 10 stars!!!"

I followed the directions for ingredients, but used sausage instead of bacon and sprinkled some onion salt &amp; pepper into mix. I made it night before &amp; baked it next morning. Next time, I'll use more sausage &amp; a couple more eggs. Mine wasn't as cheesy as video, but maybe that's because it sat overnight. Definitely DO NOT SKIP COTTAGE CHEESE! I couldn't tell it was there, but I believe that is the reason this one is my favorite. This would be very good with ham too."

I made lots of modifications and substitutions: *5 slices of brioche bread (but any white bread would do) instead of hash browns *added 12 oz diced chiles. *used low-fat cottage cheese and low-fat Mexican shredded cheese mix * used turkey bacon since I prefer that to pork * only used half of small yellow onion (my husband is sensitive to onions) Some seasoning probably would have helped give it a little more flavor."

Then I added 1/2 t ground mustard, 1/2 t garlic powder, 1/2 t salt, a few shakes of black pepper and a pinch of cayenne to the eggs. Unlike those who make a crust with the hash browns, I mixed them with the eggs and cheese as directed in the recipe. I might go slightly heavier with seasonings next time, but it was delicious as prepared. I made the casserole the night before and popped it in the oven the next morning for my company, which is as simple as it gets. They went back for seconds. Great recipe!"
