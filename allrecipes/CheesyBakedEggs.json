To reduce the water, I drained the cottage cheese overnight. \nFor punch, I added 1 small can of chilis (drained), 1 teaspoon each of garlic and onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper and red pepper or chili powder. Still satisfying and healthier, with less fat and salt."

"reviewBody": "I am not much of a cook but I made this recipe for two of us. I did two things differently. As recommended by another reviewer, I used 16 ounces of ricotta cheese in place of the cottage cheese. Also I FORGOT to add the flour, however when I took it out of the oven it was perfect and puffed up something like a souffle. We both loved it!! There was so much left over that the next day I gave it to my sister and her husband. Refrigerating overnight sort of deflated the souffle effect, but it tasted just as good. They absolutely loved it and I shared the recipe with her. I also made a ditalini salad I found on this website to go with the egg dish as a side dish. It had ditallini, black beans avocado,...if you search it, you will find here. It also was excellent and it went well with this cheesy egg dish. I will make dishes again very soon!"

"reviewBody": "I've made this recipe a lot, and have gotten so many compliments. It's great for company - you get an egg dish without having to stand over a pan while guests are there. I made it mostly as written the first time, except I had to use cheddar cheese instead of pepperjack (for the kids). With the cheddar, it turned out too salty for my taste. Now I just use about 1/4 tsp of salt instead. Baking the eggs makes it taste like there's a crust on the bottom. This one is a keeper - so versatile and delicious!\n**Edited to add: almost 3 years later, I find myself going back to this recipe (with just a pinch of salt instead of the called for amount) over and over, and have served it to brunch guests so many times - our family still loves it!"

Since I only wanted to make it for him, I scaled the recipe down and used a mini ceramic loaf pan. I also didn't have cottage cheese so substituted ricotta cheese and used shredded cheddar instead of pepper jack. I also added sautéed mushrooms, spring onions, green pepper &amp; 1/2 a diced peperoncini. My husband loved it!! It was finished baking in 30 minutes. I'll def be making this again!!"

"reviewBody": "I've made this recipe a gazillion times down through the years. Everyone likes it. I've made it for breakfast, lunch, or a meatless dinner--mostly for 6-8 people. I would suggest not blending the cottage cheese, as another poster suggested, because it adds nice texture to the dish. I use the small-curd cottage cheese. I use plain Monterey jack instead of pepper jack. Some people don't like spicy, and spicy can be added on top with salsa, etc.\n\nThis recipe is from an old book from the '70s or '80s called Frugal Gourmet Cooks... something--American (or maybe another of his books)listed under crustless quiche. I still have the paperback. Chunky tomato sauce or green chunky salsa is good with it, and for a change, we like chutney of the Major Grey variety on it."

Yes, its probably rather fattening but its not something I would eat every week but great for a holiday brunch or special occasion. It could certainly be made using low fat ingredients but since its not something I would eat often I will prepare as written. I have made something similar using cream cheese but I liked this even better. I can see the potential for adding just about anything including basil,vegetables and ham. It was creamy and delicious and will keep this recipe as one of my favorites!"

Throw it together so quickly and sit around for an hour visiting with your guests and family over coffee or mimosas and still present an awesome breakfast. Salsa Fresca takes it over the top!!! I use shredded cheddar in the recipe with extra available to top with on the plate. I've never added vegetables, etc., but now I will sure give it a go sometime!"

I basically followed the recipe except substituted butter-flavored cooking spray for the butter, but looking at the ingredients, felt it might be a bit bland. So, I took some suggestions from others and added some rosemary, onions and about half of a Serrano pepper. Also threw in some garlic powder (about 1 tsp), and about a tsp of baking powder to make it fluffier (which someone else had advised). Even with all those strong flavors, the final product had a very subtle co-mingling of the flavors. It definitely needs some type of topping -- we used the sour cream, salsa and sriracha."

Before starting, I adjusted the serving size to 4 which is still more than 4 average folks would eat. I prepared the recipe exactly as presented with the exception I added 1/2 cup of chopped onions and 1 cup of small cut broccoli florets. Another version I tried, instead of chopped onions I used chopped water chestnuts... All versions so far are 5 star in my book. Even with the smaller serving recipe I still baked 1 hour @ 350° and the texture and taste were excellent... I topped servings with salsa, your choice mild, medium, hot. Then all I had to do was eat, sit back and enjoy the compliments.... -Jornie1"

"reviewBody": "I got this recipe from a friend a few years ago and have made some variation of this dozens of times since then. My recipe includes a teaspoon of baking powder, which makes it puff up nicely. As written this recipe is five star, but here are some other things you can do. If you want to speed up the baking process, put it in a preheated 400 degree oven for 15 minutes, then turn the heat down to 350 for another 20-25 minutes. I sometimes add spinach and mushrooms instead of diced chilies. I usually use just 8 oz. of reduced fat sharp cheddar to cut down on fat and calories, and I use eggbeaters instead of whole eggs. You can substitute olive oil for the butter, too. It keeps pretty well for a few days, but is best when it's fresh out of the oven."
