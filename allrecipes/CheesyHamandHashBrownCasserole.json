I expected this dish to weigh in heavy but I suppose it isn’t heavy because it lacks eggs. I try to sneak in veggies when I can &amp; added mini orange and red pepper rings &amp; a bit of chopped onion. I split the measurements right down the middle (6 servings) for Hubs &amp; I which afforded us a hearty dinner entree served with a side of jaw dropping bings (it’s all about the sweet and salty for me!) &amp; accompanied eggs the next morning. Did I mention how easy to make and clean up is a breeze. Married nearly 40 years Im so over menu planning and cooking I just want to sew for my granddaughters and dote on my dog. Whose with me? Thanks all recipes you help make that possible with meals like these."

I also made it for my daughter’s swim team for breakfast after an early morning practice; received rave reviews and was gone in a flash. \n\nNo substitutions to the recipe, but for advice, get the largest bowl you have to mix up all of the ingredients. The frozen hash browns may clump a little and when trying to coat and mix, they tend to spill over the sides a little bit."

I made some changes by adding 2 finely chopped jalapeno peppers &amp; a bag of frozen spinach, and substituted plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream &amp; cream of mushroom for cream of potato soup. Adding the spinach made it too much for my 9\" x 12\" baking dish, so I ended up with a big pan &amp; a smaller pan. I could have added 20 minutes to the baking time (I added 10, but it could have been browner.)\n\nAnyway, it's a great recipe that I will be making again &amp; again."

I used it as a one pan dinner casserole to use up some left over ham, and served with a salad. Really hoping I can tone down the salt next time."

I used pork sausage (mild) instead of ham, added a small onion, about 1/2 c. of sliced mushrooms, and half of a large green pepper. I sautéed the veggies in the same pan that I cooked the pork sausage. I used 2 cans of mushroom soup which seemed to go along with the fresh mushrooms. And, last, I used pepperjack cheese instead of cheddar and still put the Parmesan cheese on the top. I mixed it all up, except for the Parmesan, put it in a casserole dish, and cooked as directed. Still similar to the original recipe, just changed the protein, added some veggies (oh, I sprinkled some oregano and thyme on the veggies when I sautéed them), changed the flavor of soup and cheese. Now I have my version and the original recipe still to try. I am sure it is equally as good! We really liked this and went back for seconds."

Combined those together and then added the liquid ingredients that were combined in a separate bowl. I only had 1 can of potato soup and 8 oz of sour cream so added 1 cup or so of milk. I made a second smaller casserole because it was overflowing my 9 x 13. It reheats well in the microwave. Came out delicious, moist and creamy not too cheesy. It's going into regular rotation for venison sausage instead of ham. I like that you can add any vegetable to customize the casserole.\n\nThanks for this recipe!"

I froze individual portions of this great comfort food that I could reheat for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Go ahead. Make it. You won't be sorry. Rich, comforting, delicious food. Straight up."

This is so simple yet so good and versatile. Thank you for the recipe!! :)"

I used 3 8-oz pks of diced ham, probably a cup of extra sharp cheddar cheese , about 4-6 oz of peppermint jack and spread Mexican cheese over the top. I had a 9x13 pan plus a deep dish pie plate. It was really good! I will probably brown the potatoes some next time. Very versatile recipe! As you see, I tweak everything!"

"reviewBody": "okay, so this is obviously delicious per the flavorful ingredients (cheese, sour cream, cream of potato, more cheese). It's oh-so-creamy and cheese is gooey throughout. I used mild cheddar, but I wish I had used sharp instead (flavor would pop a bit more). With all that plain, white potato, stronger flavors can't hurt. One thing missing from the recipe that I think is essential is salt/pepper. I added some, but could have used a bit more (I guess I was relying on the parm to work on its own.) By the way, the parm was good, but maybe could use a little less (and more time for it to brown, perhaps?) I think a nice layer of cheddar on top would be good as well, instead of parmesan, but it was good either way."

"reviewBody": "This is a great base recipe for a cheesy hash brown casserole. I substituted a 16 oz. kielbasa cut into small pieces for the ham and cream of chicken soup (instead of potato). I also added two teaspoons of dried onion flakes and one and a half teaspoons of powdered ranch dressing mix (like Uncle Dan's) to the potato mixture before baking. To top it off, I sprinkled one and a half cups crushed butter crackers (Ritz) over the casserole and added the parmesan cheese on top of that. Despite thawing the hash browns before using, this recipe needs at least 70-75 minutes to cook potatoes and meld flavors. My family enjoyed this dish, and my teenage kids said the crunchy top tasted like Cheese-it crackers; I will be making this again."

Everyone loved it, even my 1 year old Grandson.\nThe only thing I changed was I swapped bacon bits for ham.\nThe only thing I would do differently next time, I would not put shredded parmesan on top. I would use grated parmesan. The reason for this is the grated parmesan formed a thick crust that you couldn't cut through. Thank you for a fantastic recipe."
