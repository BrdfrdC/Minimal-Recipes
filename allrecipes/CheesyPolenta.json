I added 2 cloves of minced garlic and used 1/2 Cheddar 1/4 grated Romano and 1 /4 Mozzarella to make up the 4+ oz of cheese. My only complaint is it wasn't firm enough so next time I'll add more cornmeal and use a coarser grind. \n\nQuestion: What do fans of this recipe think of adding a drained can of whole kernel corn (or similar amount frozen, but thawed and drained) to this recipe? I may try it."

I salted, peppered, and added a dash of garlic to my liking and was done. Very simple b\nrecipe but 110% on the flavor. I served some braised short ribs over this."

I usually pour the cooked polenta into a glass 8x8 or 9x13 (if I double the recipe) pan to let it set and firm up a bit and then cut into squares / rectangles for serving. Thank you! One thing I recently learned is to put the polenta in at the beginning with the water / milk and then bring to a boil and stir. This avoids lumps. The results are delicious!"

"reviewBody": "This is the basic recipe for polenta, very simple and turns out just fine every time. I use parmesan instead of cheddar cheese so I usually cut the salt due to saltiness of the cheese. If you want it to be a little creamier as a base for meat and gravy you can stir in extra milk a little at a time during the first few minutes of whisking. It depends on what I am serving it with, sometimes I do add another half cup of milk. I leave it more firm if I am planning to use the leftover for a veggie lasagna or grilling it as a base for seafood with a creamy sauce. This dish is versatile, inexpensive and simple."

Not sure what I did wrong but with the cost of the cheese and the polenta itself this side dish was not worth the money even if I could have got it to set up. The flavor was very blah even switching chicken stock for water."

The only changes that I made were to use 1% milk instead of whole, because it's what we had, and to add way more cheese, because I'm from Wisconsin and there is no such thing as too much cheese. I used a mix of Asiago, sharp cheddar and mild cheddar, and it was perfect. 10 star recipe!"

I can imagine using up several cheese ends to make this, it's nice to vary and not have all one cheese, and some fresh herbs stirred in at the end might be nice too. This is a really good base recipe that you can adjust on a whim. We found that 2/3 to 3/4 cup of this recipe is enough as it is very filling. I served it with a grilled sausage and asparagus. The remainder is in a loaf pan chilling in the fridge for slicing and pan frying."

I mixed the corn meal w water and then added it to the milk and boiled. It cooked up SO fast!

"reviewBody": "I made this twice as instructed with water; it tasted great. Then I made it a third time following a suggestion here on the site, and added broth (I used low sodium vegetable instead of chicken). I wasn't crazy about the taste at first, as it tasted like more like broth than polenta, but after I added the cheese (I used grated parmesan instead of mozzarella) and pepper, it was excellent. The broth makes it much yellower in color.\n\nI also followed another suggestion and whisked in the polenta with cold liquids instead of hot, then brought it to a boil. I did that all 3 times and I had no clumping.\n\nLastly, I cooked this on an electric stove. Be aware when you're letting it simmer after bringing it to a boil. Electric stoves take much longer to cool down, so even if you bring the heat down to low immediately after it hits the BP, it will continue to boil. I would suggest turning another burner on low, and moving it to that one to simmer."

I put the leftovers in the fridge overnight and planned to have it fried the 2nd night. I sliced it from the loaf pan and tried to fry it but it seemed to melt down and fall apart. I was never able to flip it. So I ended up scooping most of it out of the oil and we still had some crispy bits which were tasty but I think the basic polenta needs to be thicker in order to be able to fry it. I will try again next time by adding some more corn meal to the pot so it firms up more. Thanks for the recipe!"
