Oil(instead of corn oil) w/2Tbsp of butter . I really had excellent results... ANYONE rating this recipe Negatively who didn't follow it is being very unfair to submitter of this and is inaccurately rating a recipe they did not make.. sweet potatoes are not even close to russets and it was a unfair review. \nAuthentic Eastern European potato pancakes are grated on a box grater..the shredded potatoes are more of a hash browns kind of result..these were not heavy or like glue or anything but light fluffy and had ALOT of great flavors.\nMy very small differences like oil I used was based on potatoes are good in peanut oil and I didn't have any corn oil..I also like Hungarian sweet paprika on my potatoes. Chives I had fresh and needed to use up.. grated onion I always add to my Lithuanian potato pancakes so I added in these...but I followed measurements and other ingredients as per recipe and these were delish.. I will have one in the morning with a runny yolk fried egg! Eggs over easy w//runny yolks are delish with potato pancakes!\nThank you for sharing you really good recipe!"

I used two large russets and it made 10 patties. Next time, one large potato should be plenty for our family of 4. Also, would be yummy for breakfast. Everyone liked except my child that doesn't like potatoes or cheese. They were a bit greasy (high in fat), so keep that in mind when you are pairing with other dishes."

Otherwise, you'll just end up with a gloppy, mush that will not turn out well :( Having said that, this recipe was easy, quick and delicious. A little bit on the salty side, but nothing that either cutting back on the butter/salt beforehand, or just using ketchup afterward, can't take care of (^v^)"

"reviewBody": "I made a few changes to make it vegan, and it turned out great. Even though I was just using leftover boiled potatoes (and a bit undercooked), I'll be making this again, with the same changes I made. I smashed the potatoes (there were still some chunks), which I think is less a hassle then shredding. I used \"swiss\" and \"parmesan\" cheese from my Uncheese cookbook, bacon-flavor bits, vegan butter, soy milk, and Energy Egg Replacer. I also added some green onion and basil (only because I had some, but I'm sure it would still be good without them). And unlike another reviewer who said that her's came out pasty, even after 10 minutes of cooking, mine was never pasty, not even to begin with, and 10 min would have been way too long. I cooked each side for about 2 min at about 325 degrees, and they all came out to be nice and golden and crispy."

I used light cheese and egg beaters, and shredder instead of grating because I'm lazy and my food processor is a time saver.\nMy two year old gobbled them up, and this is a really fussy toddler."

"reviewBody": "I thought this recipe was okay. I think, I may be more of a purist when it comes to hash brown potatoes potatoes. This had a lot of flour and cheese for my taste. For the potatoes I used one bag of Simply shredded potatoes. I added the optional real bacon bits. To reduce the calories I baked them instead of pan frying. I sprayed a non stick muffin tin with cooking spray, filled all 12 cups, then sprayed the tops of the hashbrowns and baked them. That avoided using the 4 tablespoons of corn oil and 2 tablespoons of butter. Calculating the calories, as made, they equalled 136 calories a hashbrown muffin which is fantastic. I accidentally forgot the baking powder, but really wish I wouldnt have. It is necessary because they will be very heavy without it due to the amount of flour in this recipe. I baked them at 380 degrees for 45 min."

"reviewBody": "Loved it. It was very easy and delicious. I added shredded yellow squash to amp up the veggie content, omitted the bacon but didn't need to increase the salt, between what it called for already plus the cheese, it was just right. I fried it on a griddle with just a light coating of oil and it turned out beautifully. Then I seasoned Greek yogurt with some sugar, garlic salt, chili powder, ground mustard and served it with the 'cakes instead of sour cream. Sriracha on my own (kids don't like heat) and it was moan worthy."

"reviewBody": "When I found I was out of potatoes, I substituted them for yams. Cut the recipe down by a quarter...that's right, bacon-potato pancakes for one. I do work out 3-4 times a week and this isn't a regular thing for me so, I swear I'm healthier than this post will lead you to believe. \n\nAnyways, this was more like a paste going into the pan as opposed to pancake batter. Subsequently, it became clear about 10 minutes in that it would have to come out of the pan as a paste as well. That's okay, impromptu chef-as-creative-genius, voila. \n\nThere really isn't much that holds this together so, all in all, this is more of a breakfast paste than you spoon feed yourself rather than pancakes. I would have preferred just the 4 pieces of bacon I put into the batter."

"reviewBody": "We enjoyed this recipe. I made one adjustment (other than scaling the recipe down to serve 3, which yielded 6 large cakes). I needed to make them wheat free, so I omitted the flour and subbed a Tbs of dehydrated potato flakes. This gave them the body needed to hold together. They were flavorful and hearty!"

I didn't add bacon or onion salt and used all cheddar since I didn't have any Parmesan. The first batch were not cooked long enough so they were gooey on the inside, the second batch I turned the heat down a bit and cooked them longer and they were perfect. Thanks for sharing the recipe. I will definitely be making these again."

Tasted great though, LOVED the bacon addition, which I fried up three pieces and chopped for these. Very good!"

I do think that they might be better with shredded pre-cooked potatoes, as they were a bit gummy, but living in Mexico, I cannot get russet potatoes, and our potatoes are high in water content. All in all, well worth making again. Like another reviewer suggested, I think I'll add minced onion next time. Great side dish with ham and succotash! Thanks for the good recipe."

It didn't quite fit, as it calls for uncooked shredded potatoes, but I decided to wing it anyway, just mashing the potatoes. Glad I did, as these were delicious. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and would only change it by adding some fresh minced onion next time."

"reviewBody": "Excellent! I grated the potato into my salad spinner full of cold water, then rinsed the potatoes and spun them dry. I omitted the onion salt and added 1/2 of a small white onion, finely diced. Instead of bacon bits, I fried 3 slices of bacon and crumbled it into the potato mixture. Initially I made 3 large pancakes then for the next batch I did much smaller ones, about a Tablespoon full each. We really liked the crispy edges. These are a little peppery, which we like but if I were making these for company I would cut the pepper to 1/2 tsp. Thanks for a great breakfast treat!"
