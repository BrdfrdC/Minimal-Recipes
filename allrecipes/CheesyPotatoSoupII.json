I used Velveeta cheese - pretty close to 16 oz., cut into cubes. My son is gluten intolerant, so I substituted gluten free flour and the soup thickened just fine. I'm just learning to cook gluten free, so I was pleased this came out so well. I skipped the garnish at the end, but other than that I followed the recipe to the tee. I will definitely add this to my regular list of menu items."

They serve it with sliced avocado, a circle of red or green baby bell pepper and a sprinkling of popcorn on top. I used Velveeta when I got home &amp; it turned out great. Spread the avocado out like stems. Top the stems with a circle of pepper &amp; place a popcorn in the middle of the pepper. It will look like a flower on your soup. Beautiful presentation for guests! I serve it with Red Lobster Cheese Biscuits."

I substituted 16 oz of Cheddar and Monterey Jack for the processed American cheese and I also added about 2 tbs of garlic to the onion / butter saute. You will also need to add salt and pepper to the boiling potatoes, which the recipe doesn't mention. Finally, I completely eliminated the celery. I didn't see the need for it. I am giving this 4 stars because of the changes I made, but it was a wonderful comfort dish on a cool autumn day. I will definitely be making this again!"

"reviewBody": "Let me start by saying I LOVE a good potato soup. But I had a lot of trouble with this recipe. I used eight potatoes (large baking potatoes), but that was WAY too much potato. I couldn't even fit all the potato into the pot. It was impossible to stir the potatoes, and some burned to the bottom. Maybe I should have used small yellow potatoes? The recipe doesn't really specify. Also, I don't eat American \"cheese,\" so I attempted to substitute with sharp cheddar--but since real cheese doesn't come in prepackaged slices, I didn't know exactly how much real cheese to add. The end result was a thick paste, somewhere between soup and mashed potatoes. It was not particularly cheesy or flavorful--just tasted like potato. I'll keep looking for a more precise cheesy soup recipe."

Then I pureed them with a little of the potato water and a big spoonful of cooked potato chunks. It was a great way to add more vitamins... and it thickened the soup also.\nI served this with some homemade bread and a salad with bleu cheese &amp; garlic vinaigrette. It was a fantastic meal for a cold night."

I used a combination of Velveeta &amp; cheddar instead of sliced American cheese. I used chicken broth instead of water and I used evaporated milk as opposed to the other. I added salt, black pepper and onion salt. I added chopped ham and bacon bits. The soup turned out great and my family of 4 (and one guest) ate it all up in just 2 days! Thanks for the great recipe!"

The Pancetta gives it a really nice flavor, especially if you like meat in your potato soup. I think I only used four slices because that's all I had left but I'll try adding more next time. I just sauteed it with the onions and butter (left out the celery) and the soup turned out really nice."

I used all broth instead of water, added carrots and garlic to the saute, and a pinch of red pepper flakes and white pepper while sauteing. I used ten small yukon gold potatoes and hand mashed them in the pot after cooking - that way I only needed to use half of the flour/milk mixture. For the cheese, I used half velveeta and half tillamook sharp cheddar (shredded). I, also had to add about a TBLS of salt along the way. Now it is fabulous!!"

I didn't have cheese slices, so I used Mild Chedder and Monterrey Jack and even sprinkled some parmesean.
