My favorite: add a clove or two of garlic along with the onions, and add 1/4 cup white wine in place of 1/4 cup of the first cup of stock. I sometimes replace the full cream with half-and-half and it's fine. This recipe is great with all kinds of mushrooms and stocks -- chicken, beef, veal, even vegetable stock. The only thing I don't change is the cheese. I have to have that real Parm!"

"reviewBody": "First time ever making risotto, and I was skeptical, because I once went to a restaurant in the West Village with risotto in the NAME and it still came out poorly. This dish has a reputation for being tricky! However, as long as you follow the general technique, this is a very forgiving recipe and it was incredibly delicious. Like, it’s not even restaurant-quality risotto. More like high-end restaurant-quality risotto. I used baby Bella mushrooms and Arborio rice because I couldn’t find carnaroli. I also used some chopped basil in place of the chives. Added a couple extra shakes of cayenne. Also, I used my cast-iron skillet and it worked beautifully. So what to do for next time? This is pretty perfect and it would be hard to improve. I might try adding a bit of truffle oil for extra umami flavor, though."

Would also be fantastic with some halved cherry tomatoes! *note, I have also successfully made this using regular white rice. Not quite as creamy, but still very tasty!"

"reviewBody": "This turned out great. Watch Chef John's video before making this. In it he gives an essential tip: drape a towel over the pan handle after removing it from the oven. Otherwise you may be tempted to grasp the 400 degree handle as I did. Ouch! \n\nOther than that, it came together nicely. After burning my hand, I had to get my wife to finish it so we cooked it a little long and the risotto was a little drier than I had intended. It finishes quickly so watch the consistency near the end so you can remove it from the heat when it looks like you want it to.\n\nIn any case, it is delicious. I could not find carnaroli rice (went to WalMart and Publix) so I substituted Arborio rice as Chef John suggested. Other than that, I made it as in the recipe. I recommend it highly. I served it with a baked Cornish Hen. Wish I had cooked two so I could have the 2nd one with the leftover mushroom risotto. Yum!"

And I would have used a little more chicken stock, I used chicken stock in stead of broth because it ha?s a much richer flavor. And I added shallots instead of yellow onions gave it a different flavor, and I used shredded Parmesan cheese. I’m going to say that I’m very happy with how the risotto turned out minus the little under cooked rice but was really good in the end."

"reviewBody": "Another great recipe from Chef John! This was delicious. Packed with flavor! I did add/make minor changes. I used white wine in place of chicken broth on 2nd round of adding liquids. I added fresh parsley and some basil. I added some minced garlic while cooking mushrooms and onions. I added shrimp (i cooked the shrimp in some chicken broth before i started risotto and then set it aside). Lastly...i added a little Asiago cheese at the end with the parm cheese. It was so incredibly yummy! You can really do so much with this recipe!! I watched Chef John's cooking video a couple times before starting. I think that helped me. This was my first time cooking Risotto. I was terrified...but it turned out perfect. Just follow his instructions and you'll be alright!"

Although that is usually true of all Chef John's recipes. I did omit the cayane and I couldn't find the rice he mentions but used the standard standby risotto rice and it worked out great. The mushroom flavor is superb! We served it with steak and artichokes and made for a wonderful meal."
