I had made a clam and pesto sauce for pasta a couple nights before, and noticed many of same ingredients in this recipe when I went to make chowder from a pound of fresh scallops I'd got. Added a sweet red pepper and fresh chopped parsley. I also added the mushrooms a comment suggested instead of the bacon, used fat-free milk of lots of dry milk powder in place of the cream. Scrumptious. Wife loved it, too!"

I doubled the bacon and potatoes, added maybe an extra half cup of chicken broth, used the biggest yellow onion I could find, substituted the fresno pepper for 4 slices of minced jalapenos and crisped the bacon. Also couldnt find fresh tarragon so I had to settle for dry but it was all lovely.\nI thought the crisped bacon added some nice color and wonder if red potato skins would look nice next time. Will def try again."

The crispy corn added a different texture and it tasted great. I’ll definitely make this again."

I felt that the scollops didn't pick up the flavors enough so I had to cook much longer, luckily they didn't get overcooked.

I think I loved this more than my husband but he really liked it too. I didn't like the taste of tarragon - it was my 1st experience with this herb and it has a licorice flavor which I wasn't fond of and don't feel it enhanced the chowder. I think I will use fresh thyme the next time - which I keep in the frig. I also used a cherry red pepper - about 3/4 of it and the heat was just fine. Thank you for a great recipe - I will make again soon - only with the cheaper bay scallops!"

The red flecks are really pretty, though, so don't cut back too much. I like a little heat, and my DH loves heat, so we are happy. I just keep cooling milk handy...Oh--do take some of the potatoes and mash them, as Chef John suggests. It makes the soup much creamier--the way we New Englanders like it."
