I usually start with 3 or 4 pounds of chuck, equal amount by weight of onions. I add saut√©ed mushrooms and 2 diced raw carrots before putting everything together to simmer. I use much more sweet paprika--1/2 cup, more garlic also. And I have found that it takes more like 3.5 hours for the beef to get to that fall-apart stage I love so much. So good to see that my tinkering with this has ended up so close to yours!"

"reviewBody": "What a nice surprise. (Picky husband loved it. I didn't use the word \"goulash\" until he confirmed that he loved it.) I followed the directions aside from using a pork shoulder (It's what I had in the freezer.) To compensate, I did use beef broth rather than chicken broth. Be patient and let this cook for many hours uncovered. I let it cook for 3-4 hours and the meat was so very, very tender. You can't go wrong letting it gently simmer for hours, the meat will only get more tender. In the final half hour, I added some rough-chopped mushroom and 1/4c of sweet red wine. Again, simmer UNcovered since you want the vast majority of the liquid to boil off. The consistency should be similar to a ragu. I plated this by ladling the sauce over spaetzle, then I put a big blob (1-2T) of sour cream on top to swirl into the sauce. I used half the suggested amount of cayenne as hubs doesn't care for much heat."

Our only changes were to use 1.25 pounds of stew meat and added vegetables during the last 30 minutes as we are trying to eat less meat as we get older, increase fiber with vegetables, reduce expenses and reduce costs as well. The spices gave us a slight burning taste afterwards but I added a spoon of unflavored greek yogurt on top of mine. We couldn't crush the caraway seeds but I will find a way to next time to get the full flavor. Definitely, a recipe that I want to make again and for company as well. Looking forward to leftovers now."

My father was Hungarian and this stew was made sometimes, always my father's favorite, but all the kids loved it too. It was so good it never lasted more than one night even though a big batch was made. My mother made the actual dumplings to pour this over but the broad noodles will do in a pinch. The caraway is an absolute game changer with this stew, and the bay leaf flavours it subtly with its taste. I love this stew!"

"reviewBody": "I grew up eating a recipe of Hungarian Goulash made from paprika, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, water, and a little mustard. I made this because I wanted to try a more \"authentic\" recipe. I saw that several people mentioned that it's too spicy. If you use sweet Hungarian paprika, or some just labeled \"paprika\", it should be fine. I bought the hot stuff to try out and it's about as spicy as cayenne...The only alteration I would make is using more tomato paste and maybe just a little more sugar to balance out the peppery flavor. Since I missed the window to add tomato paste, I mixed in some ketchup and it worked surprisingly well."

"reviewBody": "This one really hits it out of the park. I've cooked practically all of chef John's recipes and this is no doubt one of my favorites. Be careful with the salt though as I used better than bouillon for my broth and it's rather salty so I would hold off adding salt early and wait till it's all together. I followed the recipe almost exactly except I cut the cayenne and the black pepper in half because I'm a wimp, and I like my goulash like a thick stew so I added one tablespoon of flour to the one cup of broth. And lol to those complaining about cooking times. especially the one who said she's going to find a recipe that is more tender and cooks longer. Why don't you just cook it longer? Point being, depending on the size of your beef chunks, the amount of marbling, the heat of your stove, cooking time will vary and it is up to you to keep an eye on it. Cook it longer if it's still tough, cut it in small pieces if you are short on time, and keep an eye on it and don't let it cook so long that it falls apart. And to the reviewer who said that the 'vegetables' fell apart, I guess the onions, that's what happens in low and slow stews like this. They are supposed to disintegrate and become part of the gravy.That's why you don't add the vegetables that you want to eat until the last 30 minutes or so."

"reviewBody": "WAY too much onion and caraway for us. Would likely scale back to one onion and 1/2-1 tsp caraway. I did appreciate the complex flavor, but even after 2 hrs, the beef was still not tender and the onions had boiled away to nearly nothing. Had I keep simmering trying to tenderize the beef, the rest of it would have scorched. On the advice of others, I used beef broth instead of chicken and omitted the cayenne due to kids. I think next time I'd also increase the broth by 1 cup to give a little more time to tenderize, and add a bit more tomato paste and balsamic. I also did this stovetop this time, but may try it in my instant pot or slow cooker next go-round. Still, a good base to work from, and it was tasty even though we didn't quite get there."

"reviewBody": "Overall, it's a good recipe but not a wow recipe for me. Tip: If you find it difficult to cut fresh chuck roast, put in the freezer for 10 minutes or so and it'll be easier to portion. I followed the recipe with slight exceptions: I used a bit more garlic than it calls for, and I added about a half of a green bell pepper which I cooked with the onions. As the caraway and marjoram flavors were outside my usual tastes, the novelty was good but I don't find either to offer a wonderful flavor. I appreciate a bit of kick, so I likely should have increased the cayenne and/or left the sour cream off ("

I was worried not following the steps would change it, but it didn't. Only thing I changed was I added a little easy blend the last half hour to make it a bit thicker, as I serve it over spaztle."
