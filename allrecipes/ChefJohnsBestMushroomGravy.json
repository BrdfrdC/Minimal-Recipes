It took a little longer than 20 minutes (about 25 min) for the initial liquid in the mushrooms to evaporate. I added this gravy to a plate of schnitzel and mashed potatoes, and it made for a hearty winter meal!"

Added the pepper and thyme right before I added the broth and also 2 cloves of pressed garlic. (We love garlic in everything). This cooks down a lot so when we had leftovers I made another 1/2 batch. This time I added a little more thyme and a tbls of marsala. Absolutely delicious! Next time I will make a whole batch and maybe freeze any leftover. Made this with Chef John's mashed potatoes and the meat ball inspired meat loaf!"

I used button mushrooms, which is all I had on hand. But I think a using a couple of different types would have been even better. I served it over mashed potatoes, alongside grilled chicken. I'll definitely make this again."

"reviewBody": "OK, I made the same mistake as many first time I made it. It is too salty. However, I'm sure I know why. I used a boxed Beef Broth. As I was adding it, I tasted it (just the broth) and it was already WAY too salty. Chef John surely used homemade stock. \n\nIf you are using storebought stock, go for low sodium or omit the other salt. You can always add some back at the end if needed. Remember, the salt will concentrate as you reduce the gravy to thicken. Wait until final constancy to gauge if you need to add salt.\n\nNot his fault I went cheap and easy. \n\nOther than that, it tasted great. Cooking the flour gets you a nice smooth glossy gravy that looks like it was thickened with corn starch. Plus, no raw flour taste. \n\nI make first, then spoon over hamburger steaks, rice, mashed potatoes, as a topping for baked potatoes. Anywhere you can think."

"reviewBody": "Just a note about the mushrooms... the Button Mushroom and the Cremini Mushroom are both Agaricus bisporus. The White Button is the young (yes, grown in the dark) mushroom. The Cremini is the older (usuall wild) mushroom and is also know as the Baby Bella. Yep, the mature Agaricus bisporus is indeed the Portabella. There is a different, but familiar flavor to each kind. So Cremini Mushrooms do not taste exactly like Button Mushrooms, but very similar. Worth the cost? Meh, depends on the dish. So anyway, this is a basic mushroom gravy and is pretty good, although, I made it with chicken stock so it wasn't overwhelmed with the beer flavor. Thumbs up!"

I stirred it so not to burn it. But chickened out and added the cup of stock after about 4 maybe 5 minutes. It all seemed to work fine. Not sure if it affected it or not. I loved the gravy."

I used a low sodium beef stock. For those complaining it is too salty, just reduce the salt to your liking. The only thing that was time consuming was how long it took to thicken - yes, longer than most gravies, but this really pulls out the mushroom, thyme and pepper flavours! This would also make a lovely peppercorn gravy! Delish! I’ll definitely make this again! *Note - if you’re in a hurry and must speed up thickening, use 1tbs of corn starch with a bit of cold water. Mix, and pour into the gravy. Thickens in no time and does not change the flavour!"

I used this in place of canned soup in a recipe for baked pork chops (these were really thick). After baking, I then removed the juices and again thickened it somewhat and poured it over the chops. Husband loved it! He walked up to the pot and kept pouring extra on his and then ensured that any leftover was saved for himself. This recipe is perfect! I can't wait to try this again when our morel mushrooms are ready to pick again."

I always use sprouted grain flour or unbleached whole wheat to stay away from bleached flour. My son does not eat the mushrooms so I scoop around them to give him mushroomless gravy. Why should mom and dad have to suffer for a little one that does not eat mushrooms? It's so good and so comforting!"

And then a couple of years ago I made the move from Windows to Mac, and Android to iPhone. I’ve never been happier because my devices are 100% problem free!!! Never an issue anymore. So what do I do when searching for recipes? I Google Baked Beans by Chef John, Chocolate Almond Cake by Chef John. And that’s how I got this recipe which I’ve not had a chance to try yet. I was looking for beef mushroom gravy and I read beef isn’t all you’ve got up your sleeve — as though you’d READ MY MIND! I can’t wait! Thank you Chef John because I know it’all be outstanding!"
