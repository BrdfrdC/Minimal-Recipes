And we used a mix of Fresh Oregano, Chives and Carrot tops ( our parsley bolted) but the fresh Oregano just hit it right for the smell and taste. Chef John is a god in the kitchen and a great listen for a relaxing cooking voice."

I did find I did not need the additional oil in the beginning to render the bacon and just took a longer time cooking down the bacon slowly. I have made this twice in the past week and each time time added some produce that needed to be used up, on one instance some red kale the other a couple of tomatoes, and a few small cloves of garlic. In each instance found them to be a pleasing addition. I think the second batch was superior and would continue to add tomato &amp; garlic going forward. A very solid and enjoyable recipe!????"

"reviewBody": "Delicious. The black lentils really do make a difference. I've made this twice now, once with green Puy French lentils and once with black beluga. There is a textural difference between the two. The black belugas have more a round shape than most other types and this seems to give it a pearl look and texture. They do tend to hold their structure while they melt in your mouth. Both were creamy and flavorful. I made mine in a pressure cooker to save time. The first time I augmented the broth to 6 cups just to make sure there was enough liquid and the end result was a bit more thin than in the picture but still creamy and delicious. The second time I used 5 cups of broth, cooked 20 minutes in the pressure cooker and it was exactly as it should be: a thick and creamy soup. The cumin and spices are just perfect. It freezes well too. Thanks for the recipe."

I was given two pounds of crappie filets so while looking through stew, soup, and chowder recipes, I saw and watched his black lentil soup video. I wonder what Chef John would say about using this, his lentil soup recipe, as a base. Since he's not here to try my creation, I (as always) am relying on the opinion of my family. I love my version and so do they. I had small whole green lentils and they stood up to simmering for 45 minutes. Also, I did add half of a chopped jalapeño pepper and 1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper to the onion, carrot, and celery. Another ingredient that appealed to me from a Bermuda fish chowder, 3 tablespoons of tomato paste, I stirred into the chicken broth. The small crappie filets (after sprinkling them with Old Bay seasoning) were added during the final 10 minutes of simmering. What do you think Chef?"
