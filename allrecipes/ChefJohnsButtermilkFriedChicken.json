"reviewBody": "I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and soaked them for 6 hours. I then cut them into 1/2\" thick pieces and returned them to the buttermilk spice mix before flouring them. Initially I tried air frying one breast but the flour stuck quite badly to the rack. The next three were fried in a pan with about 3/8\" of canola oil. My family loved these, even the air fried ones. We will be having the pan fried ones from now on. They are better than any we have eaten out!! Thanks Chef John. As my husband says - \"You can never go wrong using a Chef John recipe!\"."

"reviewBody": "I made a few small tweaks to this, and it’s my new goto fried chicken recipe. My only changes are replacing a quarter of the flour with cornstarch and another quarter with baking powder; and doubling the cayenne pepper but subbing with Aleppo pepper because that’s what I have on hand. I also find that if I pour a little of the buttermilk marinade into the flour mixture and stir it up to make little lentil sized clumps, the crunch factor is through the roof. Really far better than anything I’ve gotten out… maybe ever? Thank you Chef John!"

Lol order in the South how unhealthy people are how they will eat fried chicken about every 3 or 4 days if they can."

Then poured over chicken in a zip lock bag in the refrigerator for only 4 hours.

Also at 350 I feel the cook time is was off. 25 minutes to fry chicken is a bit much. At that temp it should take 14-15 minutes total to avoid burning. I cooked this a little slower and checked internal temps just to be safe. But the breading really left something to be desired."

I’m not sure if those were the culprits but there wasn’t much flavor. The chicken tasted plenty salty but flavors weren’t absorbed. I’ll consider trying this again using flour as Chef John has written but I’m not sure that will help the spice flavors. The spices are those with substantial flavor so I expected to find those flavors within the meat but that wasn’t the case."

I also had a candy/deep fry thermometer to make sure I had the right temp of oil at 350 degrees F.

Excellent results, having only made fried chicken once before I found it a bit hard to maintain the oil temp but all turned out ok. When it got close to the time it should be done I pulled out a piece and used my instant read thermometer. Chef John, I know you were born in Clifton Springs. I was born in Geneva and spent many summers at Raquette Lake in the ADK. Have made several of your recipes, my son Rob suggested I check your recipes out, glad I did."

And this one too will be added to our ‘go to’ recipe list. I almost always make modifications to new recipes that I try out, but not with Chef John! He just nails every recipe down to a tee. This fried chicken was amazingly delicious, crunchy and perfectly seasoned. Thanks again!"

I didn’t have enough oil for Dutch oven or deep fryer so I fried in pan - same overall cooking time as recipe. I also only marinated for 3 or 4 hours - didn’t have enough time to go full 6 hours or overnight - but the chicken was still very moist with wonderful flavor. I will definitely make this again! Thanks for sharing Chef John - I never go wrong with any of your recipes!"

After coating your chicken in the flower mixture, let it rest for a few minutes before you fry it. This will help keep your crust on nice and tight to the chicken."

The only change I have to make, and this has NOTHING to do with the recipe itself. I used my cast iron skillet and it browned a little too much. So, the next time I make this I'll be cutting back on the actual time it's in the oil. I did put it in the oven at 350 while I cooked everything else. So yes, my chicken was done to the correct temperature. THAT IS THE ONLY CHANGE I'M MAKING! \n\nI have a Culinary Degree and I've got to admit, this chicken is better than mine. So this is now the only way I'll be making fried chicken!"

Every once in awhile my husband and grown children request this...for old time sake! I never had any measurements (just threw it together) so it's nice to have this in written form so I can pass it on to my family. Occasionally I would soak the chicken in salted water instead and when ready to fry I would then dip it in the buttermilk, etc. This is really a wonderful way to fry chicken and always brings compliments!!!!"

I decided to make half of them this recipe and half of them Chef Johns Nashville Hot chicken (check over there for that review). Flavor wise, they turned out great! Super crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. However, I used the same temperature (I used a deep fryer so it maintains the correct temperature) and they came out super brown looking. They didn't taste burnt but they didn't look great. But they tasted great! So, if you're going for presentation and trying to impress someone, I would maybe go for a lower temperature for a longer time. My husband and I were the only ones to eat them, so they were good enough for us. I love Chef John and would love to cook with him someday, it's on my bucket list!"

Be very careful using this method, do not leave the pan of frying chicken unattended as oil can spatter out of the pan and cause fire if not monitored. Very tasty will make again"

I kept my buttermilk marinate then dipped in flour and again in buttermilk then flour for 2 dips and coatings before frying it. Coating was delicious and chicken inside soft moist delicious. I used thighs so frying was not enough to cook them through. After frying I baked them for 20 minutes more with some oil in pan. Did not need any sauce. Plain was delicious. Ate them with a veg mix of carrots peas and corn buttered with salt and pepper. Next day I made potato salad for another meal."

I gave it 4 stars because as per a reviewers suggestion, I doubled the spices to go in the seasoned flour (except the salt) and it really needs that. It would be quite bland without it. Also I didn't have any buttermilk so made it with whole milk and vinegar and I just shallow fried it in a large pan which took about 16 minutes (used drumsticks). Edit: I fried some the next day but this time left the chicken dredged in flour for over an hour. The result was the crispy outside was falling off the chicken when it left to cool after frying. I won't be doing that again."

"reviewBody": "Sweet Baby Jesus these were amazing! Anyone who enjoyed this should consider using Chef John's recipe for chicken fried steak, since the batter is different and IMO, only SLIGHTLY better than this one - mostly due to the fact that the baking soda used in the other one makes the breading a little more fluffy. Still, the flavor on these was amazing, and I didn't have the time to marinade in the buttermilk (only about 40 minutes). I really winged it since I had a lot more chicken than is listed in recipe. Also I had a couple of chicken breasts that I cut to be more or less the same size as the tenderloins. My suggestions/modifications: I could have used half the flour called for. I also cut back a little on the cayenne since my picky kids donna lika the spicy! :D\n\nAlso, I would pull the chicken out earlier than I did and that is suggested in recipe. Some of my pieces were extremely juicy, but most were just a BIT dry. Of course I used a blend of peanut and canola since I didn't have enough peanut, and put about 2-3 inches deep oil in a large, deep skillet (I don't own a dutch oven). Worked great and not very messy at all as I was expecting (grease was not everywhere). \n\nAs always from CJ, an amazing recipe. Any recipes on here from him that aren't delicious? Crazy."
