I used fresh ginger, and instead of pineapple green sultanas and preserved citrus peel, and peanuts instead of pecans as these where what was at hand. I didn't ice the cake although would have made a nut butter and icing sugar option. The baking took almost twice as long. This has happened before. I think must be to do with the oven. Quite yum, had a good flat shape, and regular texture through out."

In fact the husband told me where he’s had the best carrot cake and then proceeded to say that my cake was better than that one is. Of coarse I thought he was just being nice but he said that he was serious. So yes this recipe is fabulous. By the way, it was very moist and the frosting was sinfully delicious!"

Too wet but had better cake flavoring after doubling spices . and, it sank cuz I put in a whole can of pineapple. So, on number three, I got it right. Here we go: Double the spices, add half of a grated nutmeg and some cloves (ground) and use fresh ginger. Stay exactly to 8 ounces of drained pineapple and no more than two and a quarter cup of carrots. Keep other measures EXACT. It was perfection."

Maybe I did it wrong, but next time I'll lower the oven temperature."

First time using coconut oil, so I assumed 'unrefined' for this recipe (to lend some flavor). Seems to have been the right choice, everyone who tried the cake said it was fantastic. My family prefers things not super sweet, so I only used 2 cups conf sugar in the frosting, which was perfect for us. Thank you for this wonderful recipe... my 92 year old grandmother loves carrot cake and it makes me happy to bake one from scratch for her."

I was surprised how wonderfully this turned out. truly award winning. It did require that I double the frosting recipe, but then again I did get a whole extra cake round that was not accounted for in the original recipe. My cake turned out SO beautifully, and disappeared way too fast to even get a proper photo of ONE slice."

"reviewBody": "I have a new favorite carrot cake recipe! I make carrot cake for my husband's birthday every year, but I decided to try a new recipe. I've made a few of Chef John's recipes and they've all turned out great, so I trust his judgement that this is a good one too. I didn't really alter much, just used pecans instead of walnuts and 3/4 coconut oil and 1/4 vegetable. Oh, and I added a sprinkle of nutmeg too. Made in two 8in cake pans for a double-layer cake and cooked it for 45 mins. Great texture and flavor, love the addition of the crushed pineapple. Nicely done, Chef John."

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe as a birthday cake and it was delicious! I added extra cinnamon and nutmeg to the cake batter because I enjoy those flavors and only used 1/2 cup of walnuts because I'm not a huge nut fan, but the crunch and nuttiness lent to a great taste profile. I also cut the sugar from 2 cups to 1 and 3/4 in the batter and for the frosting went from 3 cups confectionary sugar to 2 cups. Chef Jon you did it again! My fiance loves your easy, but tasty recipes. If you ever do a live demo, let us know! ;D"

"reviewBody": "I don't like the original recipe because it has too much sugar and oil. 2 cups of white sugar is too much. Remember that the carrot and pineapple are already sweet so I reduced the white sugar from 2 cups to 1 cup (so much better). The oil I used was 1/2 cup of coconut oil (melted). I didn't use butter only coconut oil and it's perfect. This would be a healthier version if you need to watch your sugar intake."

Instead of pineapple I used 8oz of chopped fresh strawberries. And toasted almonds instead of pecans. No butter in the icing either. And decorated with sliced strawberries. DELICIOUS!"
