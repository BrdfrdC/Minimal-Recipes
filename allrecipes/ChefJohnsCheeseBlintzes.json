We served with fresh fruit and sour cream. My sister is visiting and we did it as a team, both with the swirling, flipping and stacking of the blintz batter and then one of us scooping the filling while the other wrapped the blintzes up. A fun time together! They tasted outstanding!! The lemon zest was perfection. Will definately be making again."

Overall amazing taste 10/10 would recommend to anyone and everyone"

I have always been intimidated by crepes but the batter was a perfect consistency and the crepes came out great with minimal effort. I’m going to try to make savory crepes with this batter recipe soon. This time I made a simple strawberry sauce to go with these because I needed to use them up (cooked down and partially blended strawberries, sugar and a splash of lime juice)."

My only addition to this recipe was to add a bit more sugar to the blintz batter and some more sweetener to the filling. Growing up, we dipped our blintzes in sour cream (hence the need for more sugar in the recipe) and the combination was delicious. Strawberry jam, softened, was also good with the blintzes. Thank you, John, for maintaining your perfect record. On to the next. No pressure!"

For Mother's Day, I received a beautiful crepe pan that I am pretty sure was a hint that everybody wanted more. In fact, I now make all kinds of crepes and blintzes and am no longer afraid!

But, that was more because I was using a 12\" pan. They were too big to handle. I was also having trouble after I made the crepe packages, trying to flip them for browning. I was using a spatula at first and had much better success using tongs. \nFor presentation, I made a bed of strawberry preserves with a cut up bacon along one edge. I also had a strip of bacon on the plate. It added to the savory aspect.\nI made these for breakfast/brunch for my wife for Mother's Day (we're parents of cats, btw). She loved it."

I followed recipe pretty close, adding a bit more vanilla and a bit more salt. Despite that I found them to be pretty plain. Just tasted ricotta cheese. We piled sliced strawberries on them and whipped cream which helped. I might do something to sweeten the filling next time, or maybe they are meant to be bland?"

I had just enough filling (after using way too much in the first two) It took awhile to make, but now that I’ve got them down pat, should go quicker next time. There are a lot of steps, but after you get the hang of it, it’s pretty easy. Made strawberry sauce on the side."

"reviewBody": "The recipe reminded me of the blintzes I had as a kid. However, I found the heat to be too high, and for satisfactory results, I reduced the heat to medium while cooking the crepes. There is also 2 blintzes worth of extra filling left over (I'm sure I can find some way to make that disappear). I made it gluten free by substituting 2/3 c rice flour, 1/4 c corn starch, 1 tsp xantham gum, and the remainder of the cup I filled with tapioca starch. The crepes held up wonderfully, and we're flexible enough to easily roll."

I also spread my filling in a square one inch from sides folded in the top bottom then rolled this helped by not having a large amount of filling in one area as crepes are very delicate this made it much easier to work with I love this recipe ...... I also timed 1 minute on each side. I learned today in the past I was turning them way too soon that's way they were too loose hard to work with."

I will definitely make again.\nIt took me about an hour to prepare and bake but I found it very easy to make. I measured the ingredients with a scale and they turned out very yummy. I put 3 tablespoons of filling in each of my 7\" crepes. It made 12 blitz.\nThe coulis was VERY easy: One can of drained unpeeled apricots in they own juice in a blender until smooth. Pour over blitz. Voila!"

I bought a cheap can of raspberry pie filling, heated it up in a sauce pan, then topped it! \n\nI also used lemon flavoring rather than zest, and I probably used more than the recipe called for (a little over 1/2 tsp). \n\nI ended up using more than 1/4 cup of batter as well. I found that they were too thin to flip easily. I'll be making these again."

I used marscapone cheese in place of cream cheese, as Chef John uses in his Food Wishes video. But I think next time I'll use cream cheese. The filling was just a little bland, and I think the cream cheese would have added a nice tangyness. I topped these with Chef John's fresh strawberry sauce. A winner for the whole family!"

"reviewBody": "I only made the crepes part of the recipe. This is an excellent batter for crepes. I was always using the Aunt Jemima pancake batter recipe thinking the real kind was too hard and easy to screw up. So since it's Valentines I thought I'd make them from scratch. These held together with no problem removing them from the pan and turning over to cook the other side. One problem I had with Aunt Jemima's was they fell apart. Well all I can say is thank you Chef John for sharing and sorry Aunt Jemima... NEVER again. These really are very simple and I didn't have a blender on hand so using a whisk worked perfectly. I made sure I scramble the eggs really well before adding the rest of the liquids and salt, then once those were very well blended then I added the flour (King Authur's All Purpose), rested for 30 and they were exactly what I was hoping for...and so much more. Used butter, make sure it browns in the pan before adding the batter which is what gives it the pretty brown coloring. Good luck and don't be afraid like I was. Next time I'll make the actual Blintz recipe and know those will be wonderful too."

"reviewBody": "**UPDATE:\nMakes A LOT of filling. I now double the batter and am able to fill all. I use apx 1 small ice cream scoop each and fold like a lumpia (or burrito )\n\n\nThese are absolutely FANTASTIC! My family is brutally honest when it comes to new recipes. Have made this 4 times in last 2 weeks. Each time Friends and Family fight over who gets the last one. \n\nI always try a recipe exactly as written the first time, this gives me a good idea of what I need to change to suit our families tastes. This recipe has yet to have any alterations. It is perfect as written and SO easy! I use my food processor for the batter and hand mix the filling (softened cream cheese makes for easy blending). You can make all components the night before for easy assembly in the AM.. I use Chef Johns Strawberry sauce recipe and top with fresh blackberries and rasberries. \n\nThis will be made on a regular basis. I highly recommend trying it, you will be thrilled you did.\n\nTips: use just under a quarter cup of batter. Spray pan with pam every 2 - 3 \"cakes\" to prevent sticking. \n- as soon as you poor in batter, swirl pan to evenly distribute batter. \nAs soon as top no longer looks wet ( just dry enough to flip, maybe 30 sec or so) flip over. 10 sec and they are done. Really that quick. \n\nTo fill I use 1 small ice cream scoop and spread in a line slightly (2 in long) roll like a borrito folding sides in."

And I feel the filling could've been a little sweeter. Perhaps it would've been better if I had made a sauce like the photo shows. I'll definitely try it again with some enhancements. It's definitely worth a 2nd try."

"reviewBody": "Fantastic summer brunch. I made the blintzes the night before (put them in a greased baking dish, covered with plastic wrap, in the fridge overnight) then finished them the next morning. I also had to modify the filling to use what I had on hand: I used 2 cups cottage cheese instead of ricotta and cottage cheese. I mixed the filling in the food processor. I served them topped with raspberry sauce and fresh blackberries. Next time, I’m doubling the crepe recipe—I had extra filling, and you can always find ways to eat extra crepes! Oh: I got 12 crepes from the single batch of batter, but tore the first one until I got my pan temp right. I ate that one plain. Delicious!"

They came out great, and I expect that they will be even better when I make them with all the correct ingredients. My husband topped them with peaches and I used chocolate syrup and whipped cream. Being new to crepes, I had a bit of a learning curve, but by the time I got to the last one, they were coming out very nicely. I have saved this to my recipe box and will definitely make it again."
