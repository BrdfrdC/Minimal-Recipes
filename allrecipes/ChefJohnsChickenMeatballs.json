"reviewBody": "This was a very divisive dish in our household. I found the texture and flavor to be superior to most meatballs I have had. On the other hand, the husband was less enthused once he found out they were chicken. Definitely be sure to let them chill until they are actually cold to form and they will hold up better. I would add more chili flakes next time but that is personal preference. Just make sure to tell your picky eater that it is just Spaghetti and Meatballs. Thanks, Chef John!"
