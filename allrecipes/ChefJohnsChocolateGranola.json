It could probably be cut back a hair more, but I didn't want to incite a riot in my house. I share this recipe with whomever I know would enjoy it. I do leave out the pepper, sorry, Chef John. :-) I also use coconut oil. I can't count how many times I have made this recipe, and I always make a double batch. Thank you for the recipe."
