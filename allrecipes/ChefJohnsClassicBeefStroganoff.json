"reviewBody": "Usually Chef John uses the highest quality ingredients, but this is like a stew with sour cream. I use thin strips of eye of round steak or sirloin steak or NY Strip steak cooked only to rare in butter in small batches, drain and retain the meat juices to add back to gravy. Put a strainer over a large measuring cup to catch meat juice. Then cook mushrooms, garlic and onion in butter, add flour and add meat juices and broth as needed to make gravy. Sometimes a spoon of horseradish too. Add back meat and gently warm. Remove from heat and blend in sour cream. To me, the trick is to cook your meat only to rare or medium rare to have it tender and juicy."

"reviewBody": "Love this recipe. I have made Stroganoff in the past with sour cream and this is my favorite. I totally prefer the creme fraiche. I read the reviews of some poeple saying they didn't like it. I wonder if they didn't cook it right or are just simply stupid? I mean come on.. The deep rich beef flavor along with savory mushrooms on top of a buttered egg noodle.. What is not to like? I made this last weekend and the only problem was that there just wasn't enough of it. So, right now, I am making a double batch of it(kind of expensive with 4 lbs of grass fed chuck roast at $50, owwy). Easily one of my favorite recipes. I will probably make this the rest of my life."

"reviewBody": "I made the recipe per specification. I can only state the taste was mediocre. Problem 1 is my view, this is a lower quality main course comparable to lower level spaghetti alla carbonara (coal miner's spaghetti). Problem 2 is the quality of the meat, the chuck roast, which negatively impacted taste. Triple chuck meat would be excellent for hamburgers, spaghetti meat sauce and Mexican albondigas soup but not stroganoff. If I were inspired to make this recipe again, which I doubt, I would try ribeye roast or ribeye steak. Problem 3: Why place chives in the recipe when its' onion flavor already existed with chopped onions. Problem 4. Why wine? If to tenderize the meat, there would be no need with a higher quality meat source such as ribeye. if the purpose of the wine were flavor, no need if using a higher quality meat source. Problem 5: The add-in of creme fraiche made for a concoction which had the appearance of glop. While my opinion is in the minority, I consider myself a good amateur chef and could not advocate this recipe."

This recipe came out very watery with not much flavor. I should have listened to the one reviewer who said that they did not add more beef broth at the end. I'll be going back to the family recipe."

Kinda winging it, with the amounts. I skipped the salt since the Cambells has enough salt for 10 people. There was so much water in the beef it took much longer to boil off and thicken up. It never really browned the beef, more like boiled it. Put it over thick spaghetti vice egg noodles. So, it's all gone in one sitting, no wonder why I never get out of the kitchen. LOL"

I found Chef John this time last year and his mushroom gravy made the holiday season great.\nToday, Sunday inspiration, I came across Chef John again. \nKey: Get the Chuck (pot) roast beef. This beef cut when braised comes out soft and delicious. I am a big slow cooked pot roast guy. Against my instinct to avoid over cooking I finally realized it is best to cook pot roast low and long to make it fall-apart soft.\n\nI did not have time to make the Crème Fraîche and my local market did not have it. Instead I used mascarpone to avoid sour cream curdling. It worked. \nNext time I will plan ahead and make the super simple Crème Fraîche with heavy cream and cultured buttermilk.\n\nThe picture shown is post-family-gobbling not much left...\n\nExcellent work Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "First I made a mushroom broth by roasting crimini, shitake and baby bell mushrooms in the oven with olive oil, onion and smashed garlic. I then added this mixture to my Dutch oven with 2 quarts chicken bone broth, bay leaf and fresh thyme and simmered for 30 minutes. I strained and reserved the broth and mushrooms and browned the chuck in batches before frying .5 lbs of bacon. I removed most of the grease and sweated shallots and garlic before adding tomato paste to brown. I then added 2 tbsp of flour and cooked for 2 minutes. I deglazed with 1 cup of white wine before adding 3 cups of mushroom broth. I reduced for 10 minutes before adding the mushrooms and chuck back into the pot and simmered for 1.5 hours. Finished off with homemade crême fraiche chives. So bomb"

Once it is all added together, I let it simmer about two hours rather than one. The meat turns out very tender and tasty. I have experimented with both chuck roast and ribeye steaks and the chuck roast has a little better flavor and comes out a little more tender. I serve over egg noodles and it is a definite hit! Thank you for sharing, Chef John! You are very talented!!"

Crème Fraîche seals the deal - but it's good to read other reviews that scale back on meat and other \"luxuries\" that say it's still delicious. I guess they are the David Hasslehoff of their beef stroganoff!"

"reviewBody": "I made a huge mistake and diced the mushroom, it really needs to be sliced. Also mind made SO much sauce. I ended up not putting the cover on while it simmered, hoping to reduce it down. I think that was due to the mushrooms not soaking up the sauce because they were diced. This made close to 7-8 servings for us. The beef was still chewy, IMO it could use longer than an hour simmering."

I adapted this easily for the pressure cooker and it was done in 20 min. The white wine definitely adds a great layer of flavor. Don't skip this step. I used a nice chardonnay. I browned my 1 inch cubed chuck roast in a cast iron skillet then transferred to the pressure cooker. I sauteed crimini and baby bella mushrooms with the onion and a little shallot and after sauteed I added garlic. I used about 14 oz of mushrooms but it's personal preference. Transferred all to the pot. Skipped the flour and proceeded with instructions. I did add a tsp of dijon mustard a few sprigs of fresh thyme and 2 dashes of worcestershire. Set the pressure cooker for 20 min and thickened with a little corn starch and water which is much better for thickening than flour. The Crème fraîche is a must. I purchased mine from my local market. Will add this to my winter rotation for sure."

Definitely worth the time to put forth. Easy recipe just had to simmer my roast a little longer than I expected, but oh so tender and worth every minute it took to create this fabulous dish."

I removed the mushroom/garlic mixture (replaced onions with onion powder), used a roux of ¼ c flour, ¼ c butter, cooked for about 4 minutes, and added the white wine and half of the beef broth until it thickened slightly, around 1-2 minutes. Followed the recipe the rest of the way but increased the creme fraiche slightly. The base BEFORE adding the creme franchise is wonderful for a stew. Beautifully thickened, awesome flavor, simply scrumptious!"
