I like things spicy so I added an extra serrano but other than that I just followed along with Chef John's directions. As the Chef says, the mashing and dicing of the aromatics really brought out the flavors and made this Guac really pop! I will be making this again."

A sprinkle of msg and/or a couple drops of soy or \"seasoning\" sauce (as you'll find it labeled at many asian grocers) can really elevate the flavor. But for the basic recipe, really just the lack of garlic is my only issue."

This is my new go to guac recipe. I should have known too, I've loved everything I've ever made by Chef John!"

Makes an excellent guacamole that is bursting with flavor. Preferred this healthy version that doesn't use dairy products such as sour cream. First time, it's helpful to watch his video to master tips and techniques, and, as usual, get a few laughs. Another wining recipe by Chef John!!"

It's always a go-to party dip, but this, with the changes I made, was above and beyond."

I suggest watching the video. I have made plenty of these recipes over the years (as I'm sure many of you have as well) but never have I achieved results like this."
