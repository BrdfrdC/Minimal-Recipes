"reviewBody": "These biscuits were absolutely perfect . An added benefit-because you use browned butter, they’re ever so much easier to make. The only change to the recipe I made was to cut the sugar that goes on the berries in half because I used local strawberries in season which are already wonderfully sweet. From now on, this is my go to recipe for strawberry shortcake. Tomorrow I try it with strawberries and peaches-the seasonal overlap doesn’t last for more than few days so it’s full speed ahead!"

The first two times it was great, though I added an extra teaspoon of sugar the second time as it was just a bit too breast tasting the first time and not quite desserty enough. The third time I was in a hurry and forgot to read the notes at the bottom. I added the right amount of flour but forgot that if you use regular flour instead of the fancier self-rising flour, you have to add baking powder. So I ended up basically with shortbread slabs instead of shortcake. It still tasted good, though. /eye roll/"

That said, these still came out amazing. I've always had the traditional sponge cake style shortcake and the biscuit style of this recipe is a kazillion times better! I love how it holds the sweet syrup from the strawberries (to which I added a tbsp of balsamic vinegar, as suggest by chef John, amazing!), and the added texture was divine. I will always make my strawberry shortcake this way from now on."

Maybe my self rising flour was too old, but these didnt rise enough for my liking. Shortbread is a drier biscuit normally, but when this didn't rise it became extra dense. Sucked all the moisture from the ice cream I layer between the bread and the strawberry juice. Truthfully, I prefer the taste and consistency of the Bisquick shortbread."

Time 2 I made plenty of adjustments for my oven (which clearly runs too hot) and the biscuits came out perfectly. Yay!\nSpecifically, I raised the rack to the highest position, used parchement paper over an air bake pan (and allowed the biscuits to cool on the pan) and only baked for the minimum time (15min.). They probably would have handled 16 minutes, but after last time, I wasn't taking any chances. Woohooo!"

I would have liked more color on the biscuit, but any longer in the oven would have burned the bottoms. Overall it was a treat, and I'm happy that everyone loved them. - Tiffani"
