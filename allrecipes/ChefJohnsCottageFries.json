I didn't have the recommended seasonings so just threw in some spices I like, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. When I took them out at 30 minutes they looked done, but I've been burned before by potatoes that LOOK done but are still undercooked inside, so put them back in the oven against my better judgement. About ten minutes later I could smell that they were burning - half of them were almost black, and the rest only slightly softer than a brick. Had some with my meal anyway but tossed most of them in the compost. Definitely going to try again, but for only 30 minutes, and maybe a lower temperature."

Unless the slices are cut perfectly evenly, some will be cooked OK, others overly crispy (bordering on burnt). We didn't do the step with the rack -- there were too many slices to even contemplate that, and they were done, done, done by the time that step would have come into play."

The only thing I did differently was to use a crinkle cut blade and I think that might have taken these over the edge for me (maybe the air can circulate under them more? I don't know) but they were fantastic and I'll definitely make them again! Oh, I made a sour cream dip to go with them; essentially dried onion/garlic/salt/herbs and the 2 of us at the whole pan :)"

Still, I credit you with giving me the idea to keep it simple, and to be patient to let them brown up (while you check on them to be sure to flip them in time). Thank you, anyway, Chef John!"

Season with olive oil &amp; seasonings. Bake according to recipe... When the potatoes are close to done, place each slice on a rack in your baking sheet, and bake another 5-10 minutes, until you can hear the scratch from the back of a fork while \"scratching\" them. Total time cooked @45 minutes, turning them over every 15 minutes. Eat with ketchup. Serve as a side dish with steak, pork chops, chicken, burgers etc."

Also, I used a cookie sheet without parchment paper and would do the same again. Timing was right on and they were VERY good and got thumbs up from everyone. Thank you, Chef John for helping my never ending search for new (to me) recipes that are above average!"

"reviewBody": "I made these using one large russet potato, sliced 3/8” thick. I seasoned as indicated but I had to skip the herbes de provence, as I didn’t have any. I used a baking sheet lined with non-stick foil. Even though I was leery about the oven time and temp, I proceeded as directed. I only flipped my potatoes once and really don’t see the need to do it more than that. After baking these for 45 minutes, they were nicely browned on both sides. Well I was right about the time and temp. My potatoes were crispy all right, and Hubs liked them that way, but I felt they had completely dried out and didn’t have any creamy center. I can’t imagine what they would have been like if I had baked them for the full hour as instructed in the recipe. If I were to make these again, I would lower the temperature to 400 and bake for about 30 minutes. So 5 stars from Hubs and 3 stars from me = 4 stars."

I found flipping them every 15 minutes to be kind of a chore, but they do make a prettier presentation than other oven fries so they're certainly worth it for that. Note: I used a lot more herbes de provence because I don't get enough opportunities to use that blend. Thanks for sharing!"

I didn't use the parchment paper and just put it directly on the baking sheet and this turned out fine, albeit messier. I have tried two of Chef John's recipes thus far and intend to go down the list with them as they've both been five stars."

A tad spicy for me, but that's easily resolved by lessening or changing spices. I must say I've never heard of the name of these, but they are good. Definitely slice a tad thick or you will end up with almost like potato chips if you aren't careful. Thanks for the recipe!"

I didn't have the herbs suggested. I did 1/2 tsp. salt, and a 1/4 tsp. of pepper, cayenne pepper, Italian seasoning, onion powder, and garlic powder. I pretty much followed the seasoning suggestions of Christina. I might just cut back the amount of black and cayenne pepper I used next time. Mine did take the full hour and I cut them about 1/4\". I will more likely make these again. They would go great with some fried fish."

"reviewBody": "Because I was grilling a steak, and because I was feeling somewhat lethargic, I just made these on the grill. I mixed the herbs and pepper with the olive oil for approximately an hour hoping to infuse a little more flavor into the oil before adding in the slices of potato, whether that made any difference - who knows. Also, to give myself a head start, I nuked the potato in the microwave for a few minutes to partially cook it before slicing it. I simply tossed the slices in the olive oil mixture before putting it on a well oiled grill. It made a great side dish with the marinated steak. Good call if I may say so myself."

I baked mine for just shy of 45 min and they turned out good but I think i will leave them in for just a tad longer next time bc I like them really crispy however if you like a more tender fry 45 min seemed about right. 30 min for me was not brown enough but that could be personal taste. these have a hint if spice to them from the cayenne but its subtle however, if you are at all sensitive to spice I would just omit this and they will still be delish. I did use the optiional step shown on the video and place my fries on a rack for the last 10-15 min. liked the added crispness but as CJ said, not a necessary step. This one will me in my regular rotation."
