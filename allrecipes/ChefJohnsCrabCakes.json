"reviewBody": "I followed this recipe with the exception of using Ritz crackers instead of Saltines. I also don't measure everything (like the mustard and Worcestershire sauce) but simply \"eyeball\" the quantity. I used fresh Dungeness crab, which has the best and sweetest meat in my opinion. While the recipe indicates 4 crab cakes for a pound of crab I found five or six would still provide a healthy sized crab cake. I fried the crab cakes in clarified butter. As Chef John said, these are basically just crab. I did find that chilling the crab cakes prior to frying helped to maintain their shape and keep them together. I served these with Chef John's Tarragon Aioli. Delicious and highly recommended!"

I substituted the half a teaspoon of Bichon mustard for a quarter of a teaspoon of hot sauce and a quarter of a teaspoon of yellow mustard. I also put the patties in my freezer for half an hour instead of chilling them for the full hour. We also like heat so I added approximately a quarter of a teaspoon to a half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper. The flavor profile of these is on point. I may add a few extra crackers just because they were a little flakier than I care for. My husband is looking forward to Future crab cake meals!!!! Make them you won't be disappointed!"

In this case, completely missed the breadcrumbs in the recipe and I was out. So I just used cracker crumbs. We ended up picking 4 pounds of crab meat, thus quadrupling the recipe. This recipe is simple and so wonderful! Huge hit and enjoyed the time with my husband cooking in the kitchen. Definitely saving this recipe for future guests."

I highly recommend watching Chef John's videos before making any of his recipes. He always explains processes and gives helpful little tips you don't get by just reading the steps. I made 4 cakes, as the recipe instructed, however I think next time I'll make maybe 6 smaller cakes to get them a little crispier. DEFINITELY keeping this recipe!!!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe was great!! Crab cakes are my wife's all-time favorite, and she loved these! She said they honestly were better than most restaurant crab cakes she's ever had. Loved the fact that they were meaty and light on extra fillers.\n\nThis was my first time ever making crab cakes. The recipe was very simple to follow, and the results were exactly as expected. I made very minor tweaks to suit our tastes. First, I used a half &amp; half mix of fresh lump crab and claw meat (I prefer the rich sweetness of the claws). In addition, I slightly increased the moist binding ingredients (mayo, Dijon, worstershire), added a few chopped green onions with the tops and doubled the Old Bay spice. I fried cakes in 1Â½ Tbs olive oil instead of butter. Finally, I added sauce from an AR Mini Crab Cakes recipe on the side (although my wife preferred Chef John's cakes all on their own). Next time, I may try panko crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs. I'm looking forward to making this recipe often!"

I also added extra old bay seasoning (about a teaspoon total). I made a basic remoulade sauce to serve with them and I donâ€™t think they would be as good without any sauce. We donâ€™t have fresh crab meat where I live but I bought Boss handpicked crab meat that worked just fine. I would make again but prob make them smaller next time."

One of the four fell apart a little but they were all delicious. I did use canned crab meat and soaked it in ice water for 10 minutes prior to use. Will definitely make these again. Easy recipe to impress people with."

I used 18 Townhouse buttery cookies to soak up the liquid and added a little more Worchester sauce and mustard. \n\nIt broke apart in the pan, I need to work on it, but the flavor was perfect.....yummy"

I would put the ring on the parchment square, sprinkle crumbs in it, add crab cake mix, press down and add crab cakes to top. When you flip it into the pan, you have more control."
