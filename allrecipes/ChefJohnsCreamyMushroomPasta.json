Some people said it was watery, which wasn't the case for me because you do have to cook it according to the directions, step by step. My issue was with the tarragon and thyme...... I'm not a fan of tarragon, but because so many people said they liked it in this recipe, I decided to only put half of what should have gone into it, and the flavor was overwhelming even with only half..... it would have been so much better without both the thyme and the tarragon..... I felt like that almost ruined it."

I added chicken which I cut up and stir-fried in butter, s&amp;p and italian seasoning. The only other change I made was to thicken the sauce with 2Tbsp cornstarch after the addition of the stock. Then I substituted milk for the cream. Just what I wanted tonight! Thank you Chef John!"

We were gifted a lovely morel and my daughter wanted Pasta with Morel Cream Sauce. We used this recipe, with just a few modifications and ended up with the most fantastic Bowties with Morel Cream Sauce. We used butter instead of olive oil, white wine instead of sherry, and of course our delectable morel instead of white and shiitake. Out of this world!! Thank you for another adaptable home run recipe."

I, on the other hand, didn't like the herb combination and especially not the cheese. Had I not included the herbs or cheese, it would have been a delicious dish (I liked the method for cooking the mushrooms). Another disappointment was the clean-up. The cheese made clean-up a chore. The next time I want a mushroom sauce, I'll make the first half of the recipe and not include the herbs and cheese. Sorry, Chef, but I love your other recipes!"

Added about 3 oz or cream cheese (cubed very small) heated, melted into sauce and proceeded with rest of recipe.\n\n I tossed my home made fettuccini with some butter &amp; parmesan and 1/4 C chopped parsley. Then sauced over with added sprinkle of parsley garnish. This was just great and disappeared immediately. Next time I might do a bit more than one lb. of mushrooms. This is a keeper"

Also, I only had dried herbs and half and half cream. Even with that it was very good. I did double the garlic (always do) and perked it up with some wild mushroom and sage olive oil I had on hand. Next time I will try and make it with the shitakes and all fresh ingredients . Don't skimp on the cheese! I could also see incorporating some grilled chicken breast if you increased the amount of sauce. Chef John delivers consistently impressive and reliable recipes. He's worth following!"

I used the same amt of mushrooms, but decreased the cream to 5 oz, upped the sherry to 3 oz, used No-chicken broth, used dried herbs as follows: 2 tsp dried chives, 2 tsp dried tarragon, 1/4 tsp dried thyme and added 2 heaping Tbsp of whipped cream cheese. I also added 2 Tbsp butter to the pasta before adding the mushroom sauce. I also added 3/4 cup frozen peas (thawed/warmed in the microwave before adding). It came out amazing! Thank you for a wonderful basic mushroom-alfredo sauce which I could manipulate and make my own. I called mine Fettucine De La Nona!"

I can't agree with the reviewers who say the dish is bland. I thought that the flavors were subtle, sure, but the mushrooms lent a beautiful depth to the sauce. You can adjust the amount of the seasoning and a bit more salt can do wonders.\n\nChanges: I used a full pound of white mushrooms and cooked the sauce on low for an additional ten minutes beyond the time stated in the recipe in order to thicken it up. Used a Lustau amontillado sherry, which is darker than the fino variety."

I must admit, my mushrooms were watery too, as mentioned in another's comments, and I did cook the mushrooms until they were Brown and I could smell their nutty aroma. So I drained off the liquid before continuing on with the recipe. Even with doing that, it was still not as thick as I like, so I added just a hint of corn starch, and that thicken it up perfectly. Thank you for sharing, it's a keeper!"

If you don’t have ingredients called for / go to store or start over and submit your own recipe!!!!\n\nUse fresh herbs as called for. Use Sherry, not cooking Sherry / it’s not the same. \nFind Shitake mushrooms/ they are available in most larger grocery stores / they add a distinct and flavorful addition, coupled with the simple button mushrooms it’s the perfect combo. \nThe flavor is incredible combined with all of the other ingredients."
