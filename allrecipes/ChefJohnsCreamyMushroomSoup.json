"reviewBody": "I haven't blended the mushroom soup yet, but I wanted to say that this soup is delicious. I could eat it exactly as is without finishing. I used white beach, oyster and white mushrooms and substituted half of the chicken broth with water and left out the additional one cup of water. I also minced the garlic and added it with the mushrooms instead of removing it. Tomorrow, when we are ready to serve it for dinner, I'll reheat the soup and continue with the recipe. I think, to keep it a little less fatty, I'll use 3/4c cream and 3/4c milk. Since milk is much thinner, probably less is needed. I love this recipe and I love Allrecipes.com! Thank you Chef John! It's the next day and I finished the recipe. It turned out great. I reheated it and then used a Vitamix blender to get it completely smooth and then added 3/4c of heavy cream. It's perfectly creamy and delicious. I decided against the extra milk because that would have watered it down more than necessary. Can't wait to make this again."

And way too much unnecessary work-I’ve used much simpler mushroom soup recipes in the past that still have lots of flavor. The immersion blender didn’t produce a smooth soup; a food processor would have been better. The 4 cups of chicken stock were very, very salty-my fault, as I should have been careful to use low sodium broth."

I've made a few of Chef John's creations, on a repeat basis, and I'm adding this one to the repertoire 😊 Several people in my life have dietary and stomach issues, so I'm on the lookout for things that are easy on the stomach, but flavorful and delicious. This recipe fits the bill! I used Baby Bellas, so the bisque came out a little darker in color, but it was just the right consistency, creamy, and decadent, just like Chef John promised. You need to devote at least 1 1/2-2 hours for the entire creation of the soup, in order to let the mushrooms saute and then caramelize (which I did for 20 min.), and then to blend the soup and bring everything together, with the cream, at the end. It is well worth the effort!"

Didn't have a recipe, and Chef John only let me down once before (clotted cream), so I followed his recipe. Tweaks: Used homemade chicken bone broth instead of chicken broth; used Harlan's full-fat raw goat milk instead of cream, and added 3/4 to 1 Cup of sour cream (at the end). It was scrummy, to say the least. My hubby had to leave for a business trip the next day, and he loved it so much he said he wanted to put it in a \"camel-back\" and drink it through a straw as he traveled. Chef John, you help a 43-year marriage stay good--thank you!"

"reviewBody": "Worked for me. Didn't have chicken broth, substituted with chicken stock cubes and water. May have over done the chicken stock slightly. Taking the time to do it was worth it, though I think the time taken for simmering the soup before blending the mushrooms can be reduced to 1/2 hr, of course depending on heat. Might also be something to do with the fact that I chopped the mushrooms up instead of just slicing them up. Chopping them up made sense to me as blending later on resulted in the same result imo. The flavour absorbs into the soup more readily (as attested by the browning of the broth)."

The following are the changes I made: Sauteed in vegan butter one red onion, 6 cloves of garlic, fresh thyme and parsley along with the mushrooms and added pepper. After adding vegetable stock and water i added two diced yellow potatoes and two diced carrots and simered for an hour. After blending in Vitamix, I added 1 cup of almond milk. Topped with more fresh ground pepper. Superb! Chef John, your version is great and my vegan version is amazing! 5 Stars"

The only problem with this is, although plant like mushrooms are not plants and do not make their own nutrients from the sun. What they do is release enzymes that break down other organic matter and feed off of this."

"reviewBody": "The soup is fantastic. It is our favorite mushroom soup. The one thing I would comment/change is that the time to cook the moisture out of the mushrooms is DRASTICALLY under reported. It takes a while to cook out the moisture at low heat and that is a very integral part of the process otherwise the soup doesn't taste as good."

Instead of 1c of water, I used 1/2 cup of water and a 1/2 cup of sauvignon blanc wine. My immersion blender made quick work at the end but I intentionally left a few slices intact."

I added extra butter because I thought there wasn't enough liquid and the mushrooms were gonna burn. Bad idea, there was WAY too much after a few mins. So when the mushrooms were soft, I strained some liquid out and made a roux with the flour instead.\n2. I didn't realize I didn't have onions until after the mushrooms were already cooking. So I finished the soup minus the onions and the pureeing, picked up some onions the next day and sautéed them separately and then pureed the soup all together with everything cold.\n\nI kept maybe 2 cups of mushrooms whole and added them in after the rest was pureed and it was wonderful. Will definitely be making this over and over again!"

The mushrooms take close to 30 minutes to cook down and he mentions it takes a long time in the video. It’s worth the effort. We paired it with French dip sandwiches on soft but crusty hoagies. It was a great combination! Thanks Chef John!!!"

"reviewBody": "I used pre-sliced mushrooms to speed up the prep before cooking. Also I didn't have fresh thyme so I used dried--about 1 tablespoon. As other reviewers have said, it takes much longer than 15 minutes to evaporate all the liquid from the mushrooms (even on high heat). I'd say it took closer to 30 minutes, if not longer.\n\nI thought this soup was just okay; I was hoping for more flavor. It smelled fantastic when I was sauteeing the mushrooms and onions but I think adding 4 cups of chicken stock (plus 1 cup water) and simmering for a whole hour detracted from the taste. If I made this recipe again I'd definitely omit the cup of water. The mushroom mixture doesn't need that much liquid and I feel like it just makes things less flavorful."

I just pick the leaves off and toss it in. I also add about 2T of Gorgonzola cheese at the end. The first time I tried to add gorgonzola I added WAY too much and it was very overpowering. 2-3T is just about right. Makes you wonder what it is if you don’t know but can’t quite put your finger on it..an immersion blender makes it a piece of cake. The part that takes the longest is chopping the mushrooms and onion. Mushroom soup is my very favorite. I make this about once a month. So thankful for this fantastic recipe! I’m making it right now and it occurred to me I never reviewed it."

I have served this yummy soup to many guests and everyone raves."
