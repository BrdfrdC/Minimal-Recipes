"reviewBody": "I want to marry Chef John, love his recipes! Do not skip the chipotle chili powder, I was afraid but got over it and I’m glad that I was brave. The chipotle adds an extra dimension of flavor that if you didn’t know what it was you could not put your finger on. It also adds an ever so slight heat on your palate that’s so undetectable that you think you may think that you’ve imagined it. Nice and surprising sensation. \nI followed another reviewer and added two tbls of coffee instead of water to chocolate, it was delicious and brought out the flavor of the chocolate. Word of warning is that if you do this be sure to add a tbls or 2 of sugar to the chocolate, I added 2 and it was perfect."

My family loves it, and recently, I served for a small gathering of 5 friends, and they were absolutely in awe!! It goes down real smooth; not too rich, and just so heavenly. \nI would say it's easy for seasoned bakers, but not so easy for beginner bakers. My one tip, when whipping the cream, use an electric beater. I did see a few reviews saying whipping the cream took forever to reach right consistency. With electric beater, takes about 3 minutes - fast and easy. I used Guittard extra dark chocolate chips 68% cacao; and cayenne pepper powder. Thank you, Chef John, love the tip on the chile pepper (secret ingredient) and LOVE this recipe. Will make it time and time, again!"

I did make it again and whipped up 3/4 cup whipping cream instead of what was called for. It made the dessert just a tad bit lighter and we liked it even better. Only thing I found was that, like others, I wouldn't say this would serve 4 people - they would be very small servings. I got 3 decent size servings from it."

I added the pepper but only had cayenne and I added strong coffee to the chocolate instead of water. It made for a hint of coffee that did not overpower the chocolate. This recipe is a winner!"

My family was worried, at first, that they wouldn't have enough dessert, but the mousse is so rich, everyone was very satisfied with the amount. We topped ours with whipping cream with a couple of tablespoons of powdered sugar mixed in. We will definitely have this again."

Also, added a couple of teaspoons of powdered sugar to stabilize the whipped cream and to balance the bitterness of the chocolate. Very happy with the results. Another great recipe from Chef John!"

The mousse held up well to me piping it into individual dessert cups. My fiancé found it to not be sweet enough so maybe next time I'll add sugar to my heavy cream before whipping it. I on the other hand thought it was just right. I used Lindt 70% cocoa, smooth dark chocolate."

"reviewBody": "Outstanding, simply outstanding! This recipe is the reason that Chef John is the first person I've added to my \"chefs I follow\". I've made it 4 times now in less than 3 weeks. I'm not a dessert person, but I like mousse, trifles, pudding etc. I received a couple good quality chocolate bars (Lindt) for xmas. The first time I made this I used the dark chocolate one. I did use less chili because I'm sensitive to hot spice, but it didn't bother me. It was killer good. The second time I used the milk chocolate bar because it was all I had. Equally good in a different way... softer, fluffier, more subtle. I used the full amount of chili powder. 2 more times with the dark chocolate. Every time is excellent. I'm now going to look for good quality sugar free chocolate so I can experiment with a diabetic friendly version for my husband. This recipe rivals chocolate mousse that I have eaten in any high quality restaurant. Thank you Chef John!"
