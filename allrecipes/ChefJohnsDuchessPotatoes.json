"reviewBody": "Impressive presentation and great flavor. And only a little more work than regular mashed potatoes. Best of all, these can be prepped hours ahead of time, refrigerated, and baked just before serving. This makes the recipe perfect for a dinner party. Use a big star tip on your pastry bag if you have one. I had only a medium size tip and thought the piping would go much faster if it were bigger."
