"reviewBody": "Perfect. Just like Julia’s. Just needed to keep in mind that I’m not flipping it at any time. Just like a crêpe, I went from every edge and pushed to the center and tilted the pan and had the runny egg fill in the gaps until I had completed an entire circle. That leaves curdled eggs in the middle - so you use your spatula to press it all down flat and fill in any holes. Then you turn the heat down to low and wait. It’s done when it’s still a little shiny but not raw. I added a very thin slice of baby Swiss cheese and then started the folding. I waited about 20 seconds in between each fold. Tilting the pan away from me. Once it was completely folded I turned off the heat and let it sit for 20 seconds while I grabbed the plate and the toast. This allowed the cheese to melt. I topped it with fresh ground pepper."

I can do the tilted pan and handle strike technique but don't see any advantage in the least as it's harder than the tilt, slide and flip technique until you achieve what Chef John has rolled by hand, a little bit of a egg life hack LOL Chef John, and there's never enough butter!"

"reviewBody": "This is a French Omelette without the French...more an American Pragmatism Omelette than the French variant. The two taste near the same but they differ considerably in appearance. No water in the French version as that just adds steam and fluff. No spreading either. When the eggs firm to the point they trace the pan jar the pan to cover the bottom, take it off the heat and fold the handle side in an oval fashion. Thrust the omelette to the far edge of the pan using the curve of the pan to add the final shape ( an oval ) to the omelette. Flip it onto a plate. It will look French and taste French. The American version will taste French ( which is where its really at ) but look American."

I dialed it down to low (2-3 on a scale of up to 9) and while it took longer got much better results. I can see how technique is important and I will continue to fine tune mine. I must add not to add any salt if you are using salted butter; even a pinch with salted butter turned out almost too salty for us. Thank you for the video demonstration, it was very helpful."

One thing I will say is if you don’t have a gas stove top have one burner set to medium high and turn another on low when you pour the eggs into the buttered pan that way you don’t over cook but you’re also not waiting for another burner to heat up. I filled my omelette with barbecued sausage and smoked paprika on top. Delicious!"

"reviewBody": "Diet time trying this recipe and it is very tasty. I used garlic salt instead of regular salt and white pepper at the end. I think I stirred, litter and rolled correctly but I did have problems rolling it into a cylinder at the end and it ended up cracking on the second roll lol. It didn’t hurt the taste any and since it was for me I didn’t care. I’ll def keep making omelets this way because I didn’t burn one side of it. Lol. I also added cracked black pepper cheese to the inside and paprika ontop when it was done because i didn’t have cayenne pepper. Thank you for the technique and recipe."

I actually found that medium high heat on my stove was too much heat and the omelette cooked too quickly, next time I will be try cooking on medium heat only. I also added some parsley to my omelette to give it a bit more flavour, it turned out wonderfully!"

Although she liked it, my wife said she never wants it again... \"to much butter\". We like the over-cooked, dry, typical American style omelet stuffed with cheese and other goodies, eh! Thanks very much for sharing this style."

I couldn't resist: I filled it with Chef John’s amazing \"Proper Pesto\". Wonderful. I only used two eggs, which makes it a little trickier (thinner, depending on the size of the pan, and prone to tearing) but it still rolled beautifully."

I made this exactly as written the first time and the second time I added salt, pepper and shredded swiss cheese right before I folded it together. Both were amazing! I also agree with another comment about how yes, there is a lot of butter. Do not omit it or try to cut back on it, the butter and the slow cooking is what makes these eggs literally melt in your mouth."

No, do not cut back on it to make it \"healthier.\" If you want healthy, eat a head of lettuce. This is a completely decadent meal that you'd make to treat yourself or your family once in awhile, not to be eaten every morning. Watch the video, follow Chef John's technique and you can't go wrong. It was my first time making this just now and it turned out looking exactly like the one in the video. It was beautiful, fluffy, custardy and delicious."
