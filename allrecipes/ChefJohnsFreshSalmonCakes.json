Pulled all the ingredients together the night before and let it set overnight. Made the patties in the morning and placed them back into the fridge, separated by wax paper, until dinner time. Cooked per the directions and they were fantastic. Did not fall apart during cooking (didn't need the additional egg) - only turned them once during the cooking process. Honestly, I found them tasty enough to not need any additional sauces. Served with a creamy risotto and steamed broccoli. Have no leftovers and requests for more dinners to be the same."

I have also used Nature's Path Heritage and Mesa Sunrise cerial ground in place of the Panko for a bit healthier optioin. I have used both leftover or fresh salmon and packaged/canned salmon, or a mix of the two. For a topping, I blend plain Greek yogurt with some dill, garlic powder, lemon juice and salt to taste. Always so good!"

I DO recommend keeping them in the recipe) and I made a remoulade sauce to go over top of them. Topped with a sprinkle of chopped scallions. Ate it for dinner one night, and finished off the rest the next day. My boyfriend had never had salmon Pattie’s before and he LOVED these!!"

Although the mayo held the patties together just fine, we were not wild about its flavor nor its texture - seemed to almost curdle while cooking - so next time I will omit and use an egg instead. I did refrigerate the mixture for 1-1/2 hours which I’m sure helped bind the patties. Thank you for sharing your recipe."

I substituted Italian bread crumbs for panko bread crumbs, because we have a LOT of Italian bread crumbs. The second substitution was to replace a portion (roughly 1/4 - 1/3) of the fresh salmon with smoked salmon (not lox), which I thought added a fantastic extra dimension to the taste profile."

I did not have celery and am sure it would be amazing to include. I used a combo of crushed crotons and the end piece of bread made into crumbs with my food processor. I used leftover salmon (cooked rare) from a previous meal in my salmon cakes. Using “fresh” salmon was so much nicer than using the canned version. I’m looking forward to trying this recipe again, soon. My DH gobbled up these salmon cakes and shared that he loved them! Win, win!"

My husband loves cold leftovers on salads so I always buy a lot. I had ten ounces this week and decided to take his leftovers and make these cakes. Worked beautifully. I can see making just one or two with leftovers in the future and the size of the cakes doesn't really matter. Cooking the onions, red bell pepper and celery then the capers makes all the difference in flavor. Very, very good."

"reviewBody": "There were incredible. Definitely a bit of a splurge meal, but the quality of the salmon was definitely evident in the cakes and the flavor wasn't lost. The only changes that I made was using regular bread crumbs and a light olive oil rather than EVOO. I appreciate how forgiving Chef John's recipes are: My minced mixture got a bit caramelized, and I had a heck of a time trying to remove the skin from the salmon (I think I need better knives), but they still ended up looking and tasting great. I did make with Chef John's excellent remoulade sauce, and I chopped up the remainder of the onion, red pepper, and celery to make a pretty side salad."
