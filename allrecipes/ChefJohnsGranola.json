When I want a chunky snacking granola I nearly double the wet ingredients (I also use honey, depending on whats in the pantry.) I only toss/turn it once in the oven, then leave in the oven 20 mins (open and off) then break apart. Great for snacking."

I changed out vegetable oil for coconut oil. You can put almost anything in this. I’ve used fake syrup and real syrup. Both tasty. I make two batches every week. \n\nThank you, Chef John for sharing this recipe. You could be a life saver!!\n\nUPDATE: since my original posting in October, I have made 2 batches every single week. This is hands down the best granola recipe."

I make double so it lasts longer and I eat it with yogurt and berries. instead of maple syrup, I put water to make it a little healthier. if you still want the sweetness from the syrup, half of each is also good enough. the recipe is a much healthier alternative compared to the granola you buy in stores. I also add sunflower seeds and cranberries because my brother is allergic to all nuts. I love this recipe and so does my family."

I also use gluten free oatmeal and give as gifts to my gluten intolerant friends."

"reviewBody": "Me and Chef John have a difference of opinion on what the finished product should be. I guess he was making a loose granola that could only be used as a topping. While I was looking for a granola that would set into big pieces that could be grabbed as a snack to go. When I realized this granola was not setting in the oven I started topping with honey and then light corn syrup when the honey ran out. I added enough to get the effect but I will go back to my old recipe. Also, I always bake with the dried fruit mixed in, I actually like it better. The fruit plumps and sticks to the oat mixture when you bake it in."
