"reviewBody": "This recipe was a triumph in our home. I never imagined we could make restaurant-quality calzones but they are and are not as fussy as I had imagined. The crust achieved is excellent and it is completely customizable with fillings. I made one following the recipe as written with the exception of sopressata to diced ham since that is what we had on hand. The combination of flavors was delicious but I would probably put a little less ricotta for my taste. We experimented with a mushroom and pepperoni situation for the other calzone and it was tasty. The husband announced he would like to have this weekly. Thanks, Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "Excellent! Subbed pepperoni for prosciutto (used what I had on hand). Baked until golden, not brown, so I could easily reheat in the air fryer the next day without the dough getting too crunchy. The cheese and egg wash on the exterior are a great touch, and the filling just really works well without being overwhelming. It was my first time ever making calzones and they turned out perfect!"

It might just be my oven, so I will give it another try at a lower temperature and longer time. The recipe seemed like and good one, and tasty, despite being burnt on the outside and under-done on the inside."

With the chef's instructions, I nailed it. Big hit! The second try (photo shown) I kinda winged it with what I had around. I have learned so many techniques from Chef John. Thank you sir!"

"reviewBody": "This is delicious and better than any restaurant version I have eaten them. They are going in my family cookbook as \"the best version and I will omit another version\". I am at a point where I am keeping the best of the best. I used the egg wash and cornmeal and I would keep that instruction. I baked them and they turned out lovely with a nice light brown crust. I substituted ham for the prosciutto. I used a dough recipe by Galloping Gourmet that is one of my favorites. I served sauce on the side and felt it was necessary. I would not recommend adding sauce prior to cooking as it will be too mushy. This is easy to change out the meats and cheeses to whatever you desire. It is a winner in my recipe book."

However, it needed a little bit of something else, something to bring all ingredients together, because I felt that the ingredients weren't united. The guests I was cooking for found it to be delicious but admitted that the Calzone was very spicy, which I disagree with because I added a spicy sauce haha. Overall, it was a decent dish although It could be improved."
