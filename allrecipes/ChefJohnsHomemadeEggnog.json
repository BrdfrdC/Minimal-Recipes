We served our chilled eggnog in lovely glasses, with a generous scoop of the most wonderful vanilla ice cream added. I refer to our recipe as \"A cardiologist's nightmare,\" but it surely is good once every year or two... Happy Holidays!"

"reviewBody": "This is the greatest Chef John recipe ever-- and I have tried many of them. The custard base tastes like God's nectar. This review is only for the \"custard base\" as the egg whites were a pain to whisk up everytime and didn't really add a \"positive\" to the drink so I don't use them. Without the egg whites part, my eggnog is not frothy, but it is delicious! Save the egg whites for an egg white omelet instead to eat for breakfast to make up for this awesome, but unhealthy drink. Yes, you can probably add more nutmeg to make it shine through a little more than it does, but you can add to your own taste. To confirm- the \"custard base\" is amazing. Easy to double the recipe for the custard base (and I do each time)."

Fairly simple, rich, delicious, and a far nicer texture than the store bought stuff (ymmv, ofc). Splashed up with a generous measure of good whiskey, and some fresh nutmeg it is divine."

I really appreciate that Chef John uses both parts on the egg in the recipe too. Adding the meringue to the eggnog makes it so light and wonderful, that there's just not enough good things I can say about this recipe! Thank you so much Chef John for making an eggnog recipe that makes a non-eggnog-lover (such as myself) enjoy eggnog again!"
