The reason I made this was because I was already at the grocery store when my daughter called reminding me of her Christmas party. I quickly looked a recipe up and chose this one. Almost all of it came back home. It just isn't that good. Sara Elder's review explains how I felt about this recipe much better than I can."

I had a little extra spinach so I added a little sour cream to compensate. It is so light and not oily. The only thing I would do differently next time is add a little more hot sauce next time. Thanks, Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "This was delicious. The only time I had this was probably 20 years ago at Applebees. As I recall, theirs was very greasy, like Chef John said most recipes are. \n\nI had such a craving for this, so I sought out a recipe for NYE. Out of necessity, I had to alter the recipe a bit, but not much. My son ate all the Gruyere when I wasn't looking, so I had to use Gouda instead. I'm not a cheese monger, so I'd probably not notice the difference anyway. The artichokes I had on hand, were jarred and marinated. I didn't want the herbs and oil from that, so I drained, and rinsed with hot water. A little seasoning was left behind, but it tasted great.\n\nI didn't like the way he struggled mixing it up. I questioned why he didn't soften the cream cheese first. I microwaved mine so it was soft, but not runny. That's so much easier.\n\nI served it with stale thin sliced baguette left over from NYE. It was awesome."

"reviewBody": "The recipe is good, but is definitely too thick if you want to use tortilla chips, as they will break. If you add reduced fat sour cream near the end of mixing, until it gets to a manageable stirring consistency, then it won't be as thick and it still will not be greasy. Many types of white cheese can be substituted for the ones listed; I used a mozzarella cheese stick that I cut into little chunks for the mozzarella and topped my ramekins with provolone slices as they fit beautifully. I also used reduced fat cream cheese and did not notice any adverse effect on texture or flavor."

Being cooped up with COVID, you kinda have to use what ya got. It was fab! Use what you have! Some melty stuff on top, perhaps sour cream instead of cream cheese? And PLEASE, be creative!"

Set to high it was ready in about 45 minutes, I made sure to stir about halfway through, and wait to add mozzarella until the last 15 minutes. Just remember to heat down to warm or off once heated thoroughly as it will dry out even with the lid on."

WOW, it was now a 5 star recipe with all the flavors more intense. Adjust the amount of 1/2 and 1/2 to your preference."

The Gruyere cheese is a bit pricey but SO worth it! I made this for my husband over the weekend and decided to try a bite. I'm on a calorie restriction to lose weight (28 lbs so far!) and with that one bite I realized I wasn't following the plan the rest of the afternoon. My husband and I ate 3/4 of the pan that day. It was amazing on tortilla chips, carrots, celery, and right off a spoon! I will make this again and again and again. Of coarse I knew it would be great, Chef John NEVER makes anything bad!!!"

"reviewBody": "Great combination of cheeses. I softened the cream cheese and dice the gruyere because I could only find a block at the store. After mixing all the ingredients together, I decided I wanted more cheese than veggies. I added an extra 4 oz of parmesan and gruyere. Hated to do it, but I also needed the sour cream for fluffiness. I sprinkled mozzarella lightly over the top after having mixed half in with everything else. I don't like the stringiness off mozzarella once it has all baked together, so I did this to avoid pulling it all off the top on the first dip. Overall the flavor was delicious!"

I didn’t have hot sauce (maybe the lack of liquid?), so I subbed a dry hot pepper-type seasoning. and noticed it was hard to stir together. Just seemed it was lacking something. But no fear! I will try \nagain ;-) and maybe add a spoonful of cream before baking."

I also added half of one red bell pepper diced, just for some more color. It's also nice to experiment with spice. Sometimes hot sauce, sometimes cayenne pepper, jalapeños, red pepper flakes, you name it! And I doubled he spinach! Most of my friends/family like a thick, hearty dip! Make it as is and then have fun!"

We had to use spoons to glop it onto toasted baguette slices. Spinach artichoke dip recipes are so plentiful, we'll use a different one in the future. Sorry, Chef John: we love so many others of your recipes."

I doubled the cream cheese and shredded cheeses that were mixed in, and it came out perfect! I think the extra cream cheese helped make it a light and fluffy dip, not too heavy! I used whole artichoke hearts (canned) and pulsed them in the food processor as I don't like large chunks of artichoke. Delicious!"
