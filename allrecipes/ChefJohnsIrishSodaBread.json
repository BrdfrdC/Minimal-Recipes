I had to dust frequently with flour just to get it off the kneading surface and my hands. So I probably added an extra 1/4 cup of flour. That is why it has a 3 star rating. On the upside, I loved the flavor and especially the orange zest that sets it apart from other soda breads. The texture was a bit crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I might make this again...and maybe decreased the buttermilk."

This time I didn't have any wheat flour so used all all purpose and didn't have golden raisins so used regular. It was a hearty bread, crusty on the outside, soft on the inside. I took Chef John's advice and bought some Irish butter. Not sure I could tell any difference but it was very good on the bread. \n\nI never had Irish Soda Bread before but I don't believe that the orange zest is traditional. It was so good though! I plan to eat this for breakfast. There's no sugar in it so it's healthy , right?"

"reviewBody": "I frequently make traditional Irish soda bread for a daughter who got hooked on it in Ireland. This bread is very unlike traditional Irish soda bread. However it is a delightful tasting bread...perfect for breakfast or brunch. It tastes more like a moister scone! I made it with all the listed ingredients except substituted steel cut oats for the rolled oats (steel cut oats are the secret ingredient for true Irish soda bread). Can't say I really noticed them in this bread. Also used 1/4 cup Craisens because that is what I had. Baked the loaves for the time stated but did so in a metal roaster pan with parchment in the bottom. Took off the lid to brown the last 10 minutes. They were baked perfectly. I bake my artisan bread in the roaster pan to keep them moist....works very well!"

I'm not sure how it compares to traditional Irish Soda Bread, but I will definitely make it again. It reminded me of a Simnel Cake that my mother used to bake for church during lent (midway through). Adding some almond paste in the middle would not only add to this similarity, but would also be delicious."

It's especially tasty toasted, with butter and honey--great for breakfast! I used all All-Purpose flour, 1 cup raisins and 1/2 cup Golden Raisins, and made my own \"buttermilk\"- added 1/4 cup lemon juice to half-and-half. Loved the orange zest--very subtle. I didn't particularly like the wetness of the dough (hard to clean-up), but the final product was well worth the work--tasty and pretty, with a moist crumb."

I cooked it another half hour ... a total of one hour 15 minutes. Still very moist inside. I've had no other problems with my oven. I've never had Irish Soda Bread so I don't know how to compare it, but it's very good."

But I did make one change--inadvertently: I left out the butter. I totally panicked when I realized what I'd done because I was afraid the bread would not have a good texture without the butter. But it was still delicious (and lower in fat!) Next time I'll add the butter and see how much difference it makes."

Also I switched to whole milk instead of buttermilk. Baked at 400° for 40 minutes and an instant read thermometer read above 200°. I also used half a cup of raisins and half a cup of Craisins instead of golden raisins and currants because that is what I had on hand. The bread comes out a bit sweeter that way."

I don't know what soda bread is supposed to taste like so I have nothing to compare this bread to. I didn't have currents or enough raisins, so I used the raisins I had (1/4 c) and chopped up some dried apricots (1/2 c). Easy-to-make recipe for a biscuit-like bread that is not too sweet."

I love oats, so added an extra 1/4 cup. I subtracted a 1/4 cup flour to keep the dry measures the same. I only used whole wheat flour, not all-purpose for part. This created a lovely brown bread. I used fennel seeds in place of the orange zest, and I highly recommend this. Finally, I realized at the last moment that I didn't have parchment paper, so I greased my cast iron skillet and made one large loaf. My husband and I already ate half with dinner!"

That said, this recipe came out marvelously! Took a lot of work because the dough is so wet and sticky, getting it to set a little so I could handle it was a test of my patience. I didn't have buttermilk so I made my own as per Chef John's blog. But the work paid off because this is a great breakfast bread or perfect with afternoon tea/coffee. Warning; if you're late out of bed you'll likely find it already gone!"

This is my first time making bread and may I just say how simple it is to make! I got so excited seeing it rise in the oven... And boy, when it came out of the oven and I tried a slice (after letting it cool, of course), the flavor is unparalleled. My family and friends loved it...and with a bit of butter and jam...too delicious!! All I can say is that I won't be buying Irish soda bread from Whole Foods anymore...I'll be making my own!!! Please hurry and make this bread now! Your family and friends (as well as your own taste buds) will thank you later!"
