I adjusted the proportions of the other ingredients accordingly but they came out a little too salty and peppery. That's on me and not the basic recipe. I will definitely make this again but will watch the salt and red pepper next time. I also used a box grater on the onions so just added them raw to the mix. I'm a freak for smoked paprika, so yes, that was added as well. With the volume of meat I used, a large Kitchen Aid mix made short work of the blending process. Good eats."

Double the garlic, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, and cheese (I used Pecorino Romano, because that's what I had on hand). Bake for 25 minutes for 350, then broil for five minutes or so until browned. For the sauce, I combined a cup of sriracha ketchup, 1/4 cup water, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 3 tbsp apple cider vinegar, 1.5 tbsp Worcestershire, 1 large minced shallot, 2 cloves minced garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir and simmer for 10 minutes or so, until slightly thickened. I might make this into a meatloaf next!"

Because I did this, I used only 1/2 the red pepper flakes and they have the perfect heat for us. I only had Italian bread crumbs so I used those. So flavorful, moist, and tender. I cooked to 165-170 degrees internal temp(instant read thermometer). Took about 15 minutes in my oven. Mine were about 1 1/2\" diameter raw. This made 68 meatballs. Once done, I promptly ate 3 right off the pan! Yum. I couldn't eat just one!"

I will be very busy tomorrow, so I am making my mix tonight, place in a plastic bag into the fridge and tomorrows prep time will be a breeze. My dogs never refuse the scraps and once even the raccoons got a meal. Don't hesitate and make it, and add whatever you like to make it yours. I do extra garlic sometimes.

I mostly made them by the recipe (I scaled up to 75 servings with 5 pounds of meat). But, instead of the ground pork, I used 2 pounds of pork sweet/mild sausage instead. I also accidentally added a half small can of tomato paste. I fried it with the onions after they were almost done cooking down. I was seriously trying to stick to the recipe but I put the tomato paste in from habit, LOL. That turned out great though. I also made them small as that is our preference. 20 minutes total bake time. 140 meatballs for the freezer. Yeah me :)"

These things straight up melt in your mouth. I have had a terrible day, everything has gone wrong, I cried in the bank. these meatballs though... they made me forget for a bit. honest. you guys gotta try it, and for real just follow the recipe you don't need to make any tweaks! A part of me was like 'maybe I should brown them in a pan first and then bake' but omg I'm so glad I did not do that. just throw them in the oven and forget about them for 18-20ish min and you're GOLDEN. (if you're like me and terrible at timing things, right before I rolled up the meatballs I started heating up sauce and some water for noodles. then I put the meatballs in. after meatballs go in, wait for water to boil, and then add pasta. only keep sauce on low heat! When the meatballs were done everything was ready about the same time so it was all hot! this may sound like common sense for some, but some people are just learning how to cook like I am!!!)"

I just feel it makes for a tastier, more flavorful meatball. Try it… I’m a fan!"

I wasn't quite sure about the red pepper flakes, but its gives a surprising kick and the perfect amount of heat. I cut the recipe in half and only used ground beef. I paired the meatballs with homemade spaghetti noodles and sauce (bought myself a pasta maker attachment for my kitchen aid mixer, since I don't bake) and have been having fun finding great pasta recipes. This is my new go to meatball recipe. Love Chef John's prime rib recipe, too...just an FYI"

I even raised the temp after the first 20 minutes check-in to 465 degrees to get some browning on the meatballs. Dem balls are gonna simmer in sauce for the next hour so I wasn’t too worried about them drying out. They turned out just fine. For the comment that said that it was too salty I figure they used maybe an Italian pork sausage as their mince or table salt. I used New York Style sausage as my pork mince. You can taste the extra seasoning from using a prepared sausage in this meatball."

I read other reviews and, since it sounded like they came out a little soggy for some people, I increased the bread crumbs a bit and did them in an air fryer to take advantage of the grate and let the grease drip down, that also allowed me to adjust the time and temp between batches. I’ll definitely use this recipe again."

My son rated them at an 8 but said they'd have been a 10 if I'd made my own sauce. I make a mean sauce! 😁 Very happy I found this recipe.

"reviewBody": "Five star flavor wise but a few things LOTS of liquid. I would definitely reduce egg from two to one, omit the broth in the breadcrumbs or add another 1/4 cup or so of breadcrumbs dry. I had to take them out of the oven drain the liquid off and put them back in for a few more minutes. Despite the liquid the consistency was good Decent browning considering it wasn’t pan fried, pan frying is way more time consuming &amp; messy so loved that this is an oven backed recipe Mine didn’t hold their shape so if that’s important to you I suggest chilling for longer or rolling smaller. It is also possible I mixed a little to much and the meat I bought (meatloaf mix) was very soft so I’m sure that contributed Still the taste was delicious! The recipe was unclear about the garlic—I added it to the onion at the end of cooking, but not sure if they were indicating to add it raw"

I think soaking the breadcrumbs in the milk and sautéing the onions before mixing are the game-changers, as most of the recipe ingredients themselves are similar or the same to most of the others I’ve seen. Btw I bake the meatballs on an elevated roasting sheet before putting in my Sunday gravy, and the results are excellent."
