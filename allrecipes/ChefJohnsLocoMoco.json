"reviewBody": "I made this recipe, with a few modifications, and served with a side of Hawaiian Mac Salad. It's going into our regular recipe rotation. I added Worcestershire sauce (1 teaspoon), seasoned salt (1/4 teaspoon), freshly ground black pepper and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder to the burger and mixed it in thoroughly before forming the patties. I cut the broth/stock back to 3/4 cup. Using 1-1/2 cups makes way too much gravy and it will be wasted. I also minced up some yellow onion and a couple of button mushrooms and sauteed those in the butter after I cooked the burgers. The eggs were cooked sunny side up and I omitted the sesame oil altogether as it just wasn't necessary. As the recipe is written, I give it 3.5 stars, with my tweaks, it's 5 stars."

I thought the beef-to-rice-to-gravy ratio was off with the one patty, I'll use two four ounce patties next time, and two eggs per serving. but it was very good, really enjoyed all the flavors. I like thick gravy, so i added two more teaspoons of cornstarch to make the gravy thicker."

Three things; I made/had 2c cooked Jasmine rice and fried up 3 hamburger pattys. Still enough sauce for a 4th burger! Plenty of rice! Second - beef stock, depending on what you use, can be salty so use low sodium soy and omit any salt elsewhere in the recipe. I didn’t this time but agree - a tad salty so will adjust a bit next time. Finally, yes, while I didn’t, carmalized onions…!! Oh I should have! Next time I will! Taste and texture add to this! As always Chef John - I love your twists and spins on recipes for people like me to try new food combinations! Thank you!"

I used meatballs (the nasty pre-made pre-cooked you find in a bag in the supermarket that I had standing in the freezer for way too long). I used regular white onion and added red peppers, just because I had them. I used Truvia (just 1/4 of a package or else it would be too sweet), I think you could forgo the sugar at all. Then garlic because they were going bad and why not! cilantro because everything with cilantro tastes better, I used a chicken broth I make once a week, then I didn't use butter to cook but did use it at the end to get the brown butter nutty flavour, but not the burnt taste. I would never fry an egg in butter either, I love the crispy edges that, in my case, olive oil gives it. I think this is an easy great brunch recipe. Dont forget the tabasco o Sriracha!!! Everybody liked it at the table. Recommended."

This gravy has changed my view on loco moco, My husband doesn't care for loco moco and used to wonder why I always order it, now he requests mine regularly. From now on I'll be comparing loco moco gravy to this. Granted I made a few adjustments that I think truly elevated the flavor. I use 1/2 lean ground beef &amp; 1/2 ground pork. I also caramelize sweet onions and mix them into into the meat before searing. The onions that make it into the gravy mixture really add some glorious flavor. I love this recipe as a base for the gravy and make it at least 2x month. Thanks for the inspo Chef John! I'll never have to hunt for good loco moco again."

This Hawaii girl has NEVER had Loco Moco without lots of carmelized onions layered over the ground beef/fish/spam. The gravy was too salty without the addition of sweet carmelized onions to offset the saltiness. I think you took a simple dish and made it way mo complex than it has to be. Come on over and I will make you real Loco Moco ;)"
