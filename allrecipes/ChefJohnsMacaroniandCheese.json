After tasting the white sauce, I added more Dijon and Worcestershire sauce, before adding the cheese. I found it to be drier than I like, even though I cut back on the elbows, and it just didn't have much of a taste. I usually like Chef John recipes, but I didn't care for this one."

"reviewBody": "This mac and cheese recipe combines a great texture from the crust and a very creamy interior. It was relatively quick and easy to make. The flavor was good but I needed to add more salt to taste as I hadn't seasoned my pasta water enough. I would probably cut back on the nutmeg and add a little more heat. I should have left it in the oven a little longer or hit it with the broiler in the end to darken the topping a little. This recipe provides a great base to add lots of different flavors or additions. Thanks Chef John!"

Updated review: I have used this recipe for over 10 years now and its the most requested by my kids, their friends and family. So easy to make and just so darn good. They had me write out a recipe card for their family cook books and yes I gave the credit to Chef John.*****STILL AMAZING AFTER ALL THESE YEARS*****"

"reviewBody": "2016 - Oh so delicious! I think it's pretty hard to mess up homemade mac and cheese, but this definitely was a notch above the usual. I watched the video and he puts the cheese layer under the panko, but the recipe says to put it on top. I will definitely follow the video instructions every time. I'm not sure how the bread crumbs would have crisped if they were under cheese. I followed the recipe exactly and it feeds a TON of people. I would say it easily makes 12-15 servings if used as a side dish. The seasonings were perfect, just enough heat from the cayenne and the rest blends beautifully. I thought it was plenty cheesy with the full box of pasta. Also in the video he suggests using some Gouda cheese with it, will try that next time. Definitely a keeper! 4/11/22 update - I still use this several times a year. If it's a main dish, I've added ham and broccoli mixed in with the pasta and sauce."

Giving 5 stars already as the cheese sauce was delicious. One tip, if you are doubling, use a huge opt to make mixing easier. Takes longer than it says to setup as you have to find things, at least in my case it was ready to go to over in about an hour."

I had these cheeses on hand and used them all to make 4 cups:. cheddar, Colby, parmesan, and Kraft slices. The combo is amazing. My husband doesn't like a crispy topping on his Mac and Cheese, so had to leave it out. I was reading from other reviewers that's the best part! Thanks to you Chef John, I now have a bonifide go to Mac and Cheese stupendous recipe. You're the best."

I think a fine, aged cheddar freshly shredded helps. The nutmeg was great! I didn't have milk, so I subbed half heavy cream and half almond milk. Added a small bag of frozen broccoli at the last two minutes of boiling pasta, and added a large can (drained) of chicken breast while mixing it all together. Next time, I'll up the broccoli and chicken."
