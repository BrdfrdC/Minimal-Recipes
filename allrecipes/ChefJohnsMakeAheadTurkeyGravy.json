Getting a Thanksgiving feast on the table is a lot of work and the gravy has always been the last component after getting the turkey out of the oven. I used two turkey wings and four turkey necks. The only other thing I did differently was to use two 32 ounce cartons of store bought turkey stock and two cups of water, instead of ten cups of water. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. When it was done, I ended up with 7 cups of delicious, silky smooth gravy. I have no doubt that this gravy is so much better than the gravy I would be scrambling to make after my turkey comes out of the oven! Thanks Chef John!"

Explains things so easily and so unassuming that I was completely confident in my ability to make it. It is hands down the best turkey gravy I have ever made or had. I did in two stages, roasted everything &amp; cooked the stock one day, strained and put stock in fridge to get as much fat (from the top) as possible the next day. Perfection! Even my hubby, who isn't a huge turkey gravy fan, said it was dang good. ??? Try it, you'll love it. Use the left over veggies and leg meat for a pot pie."

I make this stock in advance, adding a bay leaf, more garlic clove and thyme sprigs to the recipe. I will use 4C unsalted chicken broth and 6C water and a splash of white wine. I put the neck in the pot as well. Then the stock is perfect. I can use some of it to baste the turkey. I often will make the gravy while the turkey rests, mixing some of this into the drippings. I also using some of this for my dressing/stuffing. So that‚Äôs my way. Chef John is a go-to guy when I‚Äôm looking for ideas and this was a great tip and trick with the added modifications."

"reviewBody": "I've been trying to find a reliable, tasty turkey gravy recipe for years. This one was my last attempt. Success! Velvety smooth and delicious. I am rating this 5 starts even though I made some adjustments. And I think Chef John's video was very helpful. NOTE: there *seems* to be a discrepancy between the ingredients proportions in the video versus what's listed in the printable recipe. In the video he says to use 2 parts onion to 1 part carrot and 1 part celery. The printed recipe says to use 1 large onion, 2 carrots, 2 celery ribs. Large is an objective term. I chose to use the video proportions. I'm wondering if this possible difference is why some people said their gravy was not very tasty. Also, I used 3 wings and 1 drumstick (for extra meat that I give my dog). I also decided to cook it in turkey broth rather than water and I added salt in this stage rather than waiting until the end. This guaranteed a very intense flavor and a lot of turkey fat, essential to a flavorful gravy. This will now be my go-to gravy for turkey forever. Thanks, Chef John!"

Sure, it was time consuming, but not labor-intensive‚Äîit‚Äôs the kind of recipe where you perform a couple of steps, wrap a few gifts; perform a couple of steps, watch a little football...that kind of thing. The result was a silky, smooth, mildly flavored gravy that I can doctor up if needed on the day of the meal. Oh, BTW, my main course will be chicken, so I followed the recipe but used 10 chicken wings instead of turkey. I also used 4 cups of chicken broth and 6 cups of water. I ended up with exactly 6 cups of gravy, as predicted. Looking forward to serving this on Christmas Day!"

"reviewBody": "I rated this a 4 not a 5 simply because the amount of fat shown in the video from 2 turkey wings was misleading. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly except my store had no fresh thyme so I substituted fresh sage. I kept cooking and cooking my stock but barely any fat would bubble up! I wondered what was wrong. Thought maybe the sage somehow reacted with the fat and broke it down-I could have accidentally discovered the next diet craze, haha. Anyway I decided to refrigerate overnight so I would have some fat to skim off, thus defeating the main purpose of the recipe. I still had just a thin layer of fat, more like 2 tsp than 2 tbsp. I had made an herb butter to rub on my turkey and that recipe said to set aside the excess (the stuff that was NOT in contact with the turkey, just to be clear &amp; avoid giving people salmonella) for your gravy. I made the roux as directed by CJ, added the herb butter w flour for more roux, added the stock-it was probably pretty concentrated because I‚Äôd cooked it longer due to my no-fat problem-and thinned it a bit with potato water from the mashed potatoes. Then seasoned as directed. So I still was able to make the gravy before taking turkey out of oven, just not the day before like I wanted. It was very good, everyone complimented it, a beautiful dark color, no Kitchen Bouquet needed! and very herby from the herb butter. Regular butter would serve as well.But if you want to use all turkey fat, listen to other reviewers &amp; cook more wings!"

"reviewBody": "Made this for Thanksgiving dinner. Making it ahead of time is genius!! I would suggest a couple of changes. I saw other reviewers talking about the amount of water vs. the amount of turkey meat. I used 4 cups chicken broth and 4 cups water. I also increased the turkey wings to 4. It still needed more flavor. Next time I will use all broth and will probably add some turkey legs or thighs. Overall this was fantastic and a real time and stress savor for Thanksgiving day. I added the drippings from the turkey that day and it was fantastic. This will be my gravy from now on. I gave it four stars as written but with the adjustments it's definitely a 5 star."

"reviewBody": "Everything worked great. But after cooking the stock for three hours I had only 8 cups instead of 10. So I had to make more stock. Lucky for me I have an Instant Pot. The flavor of this stick is great and I used the reserved turkey fat for the roux. Then I combined the original stock and the Instant Pot stock to make the gravy. Since I used giblets for the IP gravy I chopped and added to it. Came out awesome and I had enough for dinner for 5 and two more dinners. I froze the rest about a cup and a half. Loved doing this ahead of time. Roasting the wings gives it such flavor and I added some pan juices. Too. Next time I will add more water while cooking."

Granted I was never especially good at making gravy from pan drippings and this year the turkey was being made on the grill so I would not even have pan drippings. I followed the recipe. It took longer than expected but was very simple and the reward (the incredible tasting gravy) was worth it. I used the 10 cups of water and in the end only had 5 cups of gravy. Not nearly as much left as expected. Would have liked more leftover."

Of course, it took some time the evening I made it. It had to roast and then simmer for 3 hours. But the flavor was very good, somewhat subtle rather than WOW. I let some of the water evaporate while simmering to intensify the flavor. Will do this again next year. Thanks Chef John!"

Threw the giblets in too since I'd started bry-brining the turkey already. I made the stock the day before Thanksgiving, and refrigerated it so I could prepare the gravy fresh while the turkey roasted. It worked wonderfully! I still only used 6 cups of broth for the gravy (froze the remaining stock), but found I needed 2 tbsp. more each of butter/flour to get it to the right consistency. Best gravy I've made over the years, and way less stressful."

"reviewBody": "Great make-a-head gravy. I use chicken legs because that‚Äôs what I had in the freezer, about 10 of them. I doubled the recipe so I had to use 20 cups of water five of which were chicken stock or broth and two of which were white wine simply because I needed to use up the bottle of wine. Everything else was the same. I cooked the chicken legs for about two hours on 425. I‚Äôve been simmered the broth for a good three hours maybe 3 1/2 hours. The consistency is smooth. The flavor is there. Not too overpowering not bland. I added a teeny bit of salt at the end along with pepper and a splash of poultry seasoning. This is a great recipe that anyone can alter to their taste buds and preferences. I think as long as you get the base right which is cooking the chicken in the oven for an appropriate amount of time for there to be a bit of ‚Äú char‚Äú at the bottom of the pan then you‚Äôll be fine with the rest. During the three hours that the broth is simmering you should taste it to make sure it tastes good. That is the point where you should also add a bit more seasoning to your liking."

I make the gravy according to Chef John's recipe except, instead of adding 10 cups of water, which I feel is too much, I add 8 cups of Swanson (Swanson is best) turkey broth or chicken broth. That would be 2 of the 32 ounce boxes of broth. I also use 4 wings instead of 2, and add an extra 2 Tablespoons of flour to the roux. You want it to be quite thick because you will add the whole thing to your pan drippings later.\nOnce made, I taste it and, if I want more turkey flavor, I add a heaping teaspoon of the Better Than Bouillon turkey base. Mix it in and taste it again. I keep adding a teaspoon at a time until I like the flavor. On Thanksgiving, I take the turkey out of the roaster, pour all the drippings in a gravy separator (Oxo makes a great separator), throw out all the grease, then I add the drippings (minus the grease) back into the roasting pan. Then I take the make-ahead gravy and dump it into all those delicious drippings and mix it in as I heat it up. Make sure you get all the delicious stuff that has stuck to the pan mixed in. Believe me, your guests will be raving over your delicious gravy!! My husband calls my gravy \"the nectar of the Gods\""

I found that carmelizing the vegetables during the roasting process produces a richer flavor and color to the gravy. I add cooked chopped giblets to the gravy. This is the gravy I serve with the bird for the big meal. After guests are gone and the kitchen is mine again, I make traditional gravy from the roasted bird drippings. This way there's less panic and plenty of gravy for leftovers and pot pies."

An hour or so later, I added the vegetables and roasted it for another hour and a half or longer until it was a lovely golden color. I did keep an eye on it. Then I followed the directions as written, though I didn't have fresh thyme. Simmered it a long time until the meat was falling off the bones, then I strained it and let it cool. Put it in fridge overnight, skimmed off the fat, heated it up, strained it thru cheesecloth, and continued with the recipe. It was very good. The meat from the bones was a hit with the dogs and the gravy was a hit at the table. Will do this again."
