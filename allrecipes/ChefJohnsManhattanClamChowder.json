"reviewBody": "I love Manhattan Chowder and this was the best! However, I did one part a little differently. I microwaved the bacon. I used a microwave bacon cooker. 4 pieces, about 7 minutes on 40% power, a combination that took me years of trial and error to get. Thus, the bacon wasn't \"browned\" but it still worked! While the bacon was cooking, I put the diced onion and garlic in the soup pan. When the bacon was done, I poured the grease onto the diced onion and garlic in the soup pan and cooked accordingly. And when I added the tomato paste, there wasn't any \"browned bits\" for the paste to stick to. But it still turned out wonderful! It was so good I ate three bowls the first time. The way I did it, the bacon grease mixed in with the soup and made it really good! Didn't need to skim."

It's delicious and now I must say, this is the best Manhattan Clam Chowder I've ever tasted. Rich, creamy and full of flavor. My only changes were butter instead of beacon and all clams were minced. I checked out other recipes, but after reading the ingredients, this was the winner. And it truly is."

I have added this recipe to our regular menu and will make this to eat year round. I did not use the bacon but substituted with the butter. It was easy to make and I had some leftover and put it in the freezer. Hard to believe, but it tasted even better after it had been frozen , almost if the flavors had time to meld. I thought the potatoes would have gotten mushy after being frozen,but they didn't. 5 stars all the way! Thank you Chef John!"
