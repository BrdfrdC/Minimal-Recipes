The only thing I did was to add more liquid as the cooking ended. Next time I will simply add it in the beginning because it really did need it but I will make this many times over again. It was just plain pefect."

I vary it a little from time to time, I like adding pork to it and maybe some \"ghost peppers\" and vary the pasta. I really think it tastes best when refrigerated overnight and given the chance to thicken up......careful with the garlic, the flatulence is a killer :)."

"reviewBody": "This is a very good, hearty soup, even with all my changes, which I made based on product availability and our particular preferences. I substituted a cup of diced ham for the pancetta, a handful of chopped baby spinach for the swiss chard, a 19 oz. can of kidney beans for the cranberry beans, 2 cups of packaged chopped cole slaw mix for the chopped cabbage, and freshly grated parmesan cheese for the cheese called for. I taste tested throughout the cooking process and added seasonings as needed. Unfortunately, my canned tomatoes were bitter and acidic so I had to add about 2 teaspoons of sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda about the end of the cook time to get rid of that taste. Oh, and I also cut back on the water and chicken broth by about one cup each because I prefer a thicker base. In spite of everything, it was pretty darned good, making enough soup for about 6 adult size servings. I did spend a lot of time hovering and stirring because it does thicken as it cooks. Served it with homemade dinner rolls, cole slaw, and fresh sliced pears. This soup is another All Recipes keeper."

"reviewBody": "Thanks again to John for his awesome recipes and superlative teaching style. Since the rona started, he has become my hero and mentor. This was my first try and it was fantastic! I have no idea what proportions I used other than I added in a good bit more than the recipe here. I don't actually know what chard is but I threw in kale, which I swore I'd never eat, and it still came out awesome. I mean, I tried to screw this up--I used a ton of red cabbage and thought I'd ruined it but it all came together in the end. I did have to add more salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning than I'm used to in order to get the flavor right, but still acceptable given the immense batch that I produced. It's gotta be like 5 gallons and I don't think I have room in the fridge, though I read somewhere that it will freeze well. I'm gonna have to drink some beers to free up some space. He was spot on about getting the taste right before adding the pasta. This is seriously good. I'm going back for like my third bowl now."

When I read the recipe the second time I thought the cooking time was not long enough for dried cranberry beans and that was when I figured out I purchased the beans in the wrong form. I soaked the cranberry beans overnight and precooked them the next day. The soup turned out very good and the beans were not crunchy. I used pancetta and the grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. It was well worth the extra cost. We drizzled the top with olive but did not think it added any extra flavor to the soup. I will not drizzle it with olive oil again. Thank you Chef John for another great recipe."

The crushed red pepper seems to heat up the mixture as it sits. You might want to use a bit less of the peppers, if you're sensitive to hot-spicy dishes. I doubled the batch to have for a few days. The family enjoyed it, saying it smelled like spaghetti or pizza!"

If you don’t mind the heat, leave the same amount of red pepper flakes, otherwise reduce it just a bit. I can’t wait to make it again!"

I did make a few edits: I hate garbanzo beans and I couldn’t find cranberry beans so I substituted with 2 15 oz. cans of Navy beans. I’m not a fan of pancetta but I love bacon so I used bacon. I added no salt, because the bacon brings enough salt for my taste, and I cut the crushed red pepper in half. I also didn’t add the 4 cups of water, because I like my soups to be more like stews. I served with toasted ciabatta bread and my family devoured it!!! Chef John, you are my go-to guy! When I look up recipes I search “Chef John” and just scroll through your creations. Haven’t had a bad recipe yet!!!"
