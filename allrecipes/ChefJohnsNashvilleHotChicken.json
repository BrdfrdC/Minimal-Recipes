I don't like deep fat frying so when I got to the last step I substituted panko bread crumbs mixed with oil for the second flour dredge and then put them on a rack on a baking sheet and put them on an upper oven rack and cooked at 400 degrees using the convection roast setting so the broiler element would cycle on as well as the bottom element. They were done in about 25 minutes and lightly browned on top, but no browning on the bottom. Next time I will use the broiler setting briefly and flip them over to brown both sides."

I did modify the recipe by doubling the hot sauce in the marinade as well as the cayenne pepper to the sauce. I also added some of the marinade to the flour to make flour chunks stick to the chicken. I loved how crunchy and tasty it was. I will leave this recipe in my book. \nNote: I did use Nashville Hot Chicken seasoning in the flour. Even after all the modifications in an attempt to make it hot, the chicken was still mild. Will probably up my cayenne pepper or add habanero in the future."

I decided to make half of them this recipe and half of them Chef Johns buttermilk fried chicken (check over there for that review). I really liked this recipe and made no changes to it. I tasted the sauce alone, and it tasted wayyyy too hot. However, once on the chicken, it had the perfect amount of spice. Still, you have to like hot chicken. If you don't even like hot food, I'm not sure why you're reading a hot chicken recipe in the first place. Anyways, the recipe was great. I tried it without putting the sauce on it and you can taste the hot sauce that you marinaded it in, it was good that way too. Next time I'm going to try doing this recipe with chicken tenders, to change things up a bit. I would 10/10 recommend this recipe if you're craving something hot. We have a hot chicken restaurant down the street and it's even better than their Nashville hot chicken. Great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Fantastic! I made it with boneless/ skinless thighs. Instead of frying the chicken, I browned it in a hot pan in a little canola oil for about 5 minutes per side, then baked it at 350 for 20 minutes. I coated the pieces in the sauce and baked for another 5 minutes. I served the chicken on bakery rolls with sliced pickles. No other condiments we needed... the combination of the chicken and pickles was absolutely delicious!"

My sauce tasted amazing... unfortunately the spices never bound to it and it separated badly. Also like many have said, wait until the very end to make the sauce and don’t let it stand for long. The next time i make this, i am going to use my deep fryer, because it I found it difficult to maintain the correct oil temp in a cast iron. It also made a huge mess. All that said, it was the cook, not the food that was wrong here... it was delicious."

My wife, however, only likes it in small doses so she sprinkled it over hers. We were both SO impressed. My daughter, who doesn't like spicy stuff, had the breaded chicken by itself and could not believe I had actually made it as it was restaurant quality. I can't wait to bring the chicken strips, with a cautionary warning, to the next event we attend!"

"reviewBody": "I used a deep fryer for 10 thighs so cooked in four batches. By the time the last pieces were done the sauce had separated as others mentioned even though I'd made it just before starting to fry. So if cooking will take a long time, prep the sauce ingredients in the pan and heat only after the last batch is fried. Sauce cooks fast. Otherwise was juicy-n-crispy but will probably up the spices next time."

The first time I made a “mistake” and added the dry seasoning to the flour, the second time I followed the recipe exactly and we did not like it as much, so now, my mistake is how we make it.\n\nI follow the recipe except I add 2 TBSP of Harissa to my flour mixture (we really like it hot), and everything else is the same. Harissa is an African spice and I buy the dry powder version. We make this recipe around every 3 weeks as my family cannot go any longer without it.\n\nThis recipe is absolutely a standby for us and we will eat it with salad or my son likes it with rice.\n\nI do not work for this spice shop but this is where I buy the Harissa. It is also great on meats and on potatoes.\n\nhttps://www.savoryspiceshop.com/blends/harissa.html"

As other reviewers have mentioned, I learned after my first time, do not make the sauce too early other wise the spices, butter and lard will separate instead of staying together. It seems to be fickle about how long it can be heated for."

The outside of the chicken stayed nice and crunchy, while the inside was tender and juicy. The sauce had a nice kick. I have never had \"real\" hot chicken from Nashville, but fast food giant Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) has been offering it on their menu for a while now, in your choice of either bone-in drumsticks, breasts, and thighs, or Extra-Crispy boneless chicken tenders. However, now that I know I can do it at home, I may go to KFC less often. Thanks"

"reviewBody": "First let me say that while I am from the South, my folks are both transplanted Yankees and know nothing about frying chicken. So I lived in Nashville for a few years and learned a trick or two from some friends' mommas.\nFolks, this is the real deal.\nSecondly, I hate frying...pan frying, deep frying, you name it, I hate to do it. More specifically, I hate the clean up. This is so worth it.\nThirdly and most importantly, this is not an every day dinner. This is not a once a month dinner. This is a treat and yes, LARD is important.\nSo, with all that said, I made this with boneless, skin on breasts and thighs cut into some kind of large strips. It was delectable!\nFor me the heat was spot-on. Sometimes it can be too hot. It was a bit too much for those in my family who are not fans of spice (oh well, more for me, right?), so I do recommend starting with 1 tablespoon of cayenne, as another reviewer said. Thanks, Chef John!"

The chicken was perfectly cooked and the coating was crispy and delicious! I used some leaf lard that I rendered a couple of years ago and had in my freezer, and it found a perfect place in the glaze on this chicken. \n\nI love that Chef John shows you technique, it makes things easier to visualize and allows you to work things properly. I loved this hot chicken and I will make it as an indulgence here and there! It made for great leftovers the next day, too."

I would use 1 tbls of cayenne instead of 2,but that's just my preference. I also served the sauce on the side since it was so spicy.\nThermometer is a must to make sure meat is done. \nAll in all,a great fried chicken recipe."

It was fantastic -- all of us agreed. It was hot but not the kind of hot where you are gulping milk in order to stop crying. It was hot enough for my guys; I wouldn't have wanted it any hotter but I could eat it, too. The techniques here produced juicy and flavorful results. Would definitely make again."

"reviewBody": "I'm a fried chicken snob, and this recipe came very close to the fiery version I've eaten down South. To turn up the heat, I added a teeny bit of habanero chili powder and that did the trick.\n\nAs a seasoned chicken fryer, I also added my not-so-secret ingredient to the flour mixture to make the chicken extra crispy: about a half cup of Matzo meal. Really!\n\nFinally, I have a trusted Lodge cast iron skillet that never lets me down on frying projects. The tricky thing is getting the oil temp just right and keeping it hot. If the oil's not hot enough, it makes for greasy chicken. If it's too hot, the coating burns before the chicken's fully cooked. \n\nAll that sounds like a huge hassle, but it's so incredibly delish, you'll be glad you made the effort!"
