"reviewBody": "Turned out AWESOME. The potatoes were crunchy outside, and very fluffy inside. I used similar spices for all of the steps. For the sauce though, I had pre-made a garlic infused oil so I used that as my base for starting it and instead of a mortar/pestle (couldn't find mine), I used a spice grinder which I wouldn't recommend. Just make more and use a food processor. I didn't measure out ingredients for the sauce, just kinda sprinkle this sprinkle that, etc and it was good. I'm wondering if for future usage, I can parboil potatoes, freeze them, then take them out and fry on demand? Just a thought I had. I had a full 6qt pot of diced potatoes parboiling and my dad was saying I should have made more. By using the cooling tray to cool the potatoes after parboiling, then putting a paper towel on the tray for after frying, they didn't get soggy at all. I tried to put them in a huge bowl (biggest one I have is 13qt) while still warm to let the seasonings stick and toss them easily. Highly Recommend everyone try this method with any spices you like for your next potato endeavor. Thank you Chef John!"

Unfortunately, the grocery store I went to did not carry smoked paprika, but I looked it up online and paprika + cumin is a good substitute. I also didn't want to buy yet another vinegar, so I used some red wine vinegar that I already had and it worked just fine. The sauce takes some tweaking to get it to your own liking, but once it is right, it is DELICIOUS! I usually follow recipes to a T, but I do not think it is fair to rate a recipe differently when the person making the dish takes it upon themselves to change things! I had Yukon Gold potatoes on hand that I wanted to use up and they were delicious, but I found that I had to cook them in the oil a lot longer than the suggested 5-6 minutes to get them nice and golden brown."

Make the dipping sauce first (even a day ahead) and let it sit to marry flavors.\n2. You can cook the potatoes ahead of time. Just make sure they are dry when you put in oil.\n3. Taste the fried potatoes as you add the seasoning after frying. I did not use all of the seasoning mixture to avoid over-saltiness.\n\nThis recipe is authentic and the sauce tastes just like I had in Barcelona and all over Catalonia. No stars for healthiness, but 5 starts for taste. YUM!"

"reviewBody": "So I doubled this recipe, so maybe it was a bit off. But it was WAY too salty. I would not put a tablespoon of salt. Maybe it is a misprint? I could see a teaspoon, but definitely not a tablespoon. Luckily it goes in at the end so I was able to shake a bit off. Would have been good without the extreme salt."

I've learned to also do steps 3 and 4 first, then step 1 and 2, then step 5. In my opinion it makes more sense to do steps 1 and 2 while the potatoes go through their 45 min cool down. Overall though, it's delicious, and I plan on making this for some time to come!!"

I have to admit that I did find this recipe a bit time consuming, but it was totally worth it...this is a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)"

"reviewBody": "Fantastic! Marvelous! Delicious! As soon as I saw this recipe, I knew my boyfriend would go absolutely crazy for them, so I made them for our Valentine's dinner. I made the sauce and the spice mix the night before, which worked out wonderfully on the busy day. I followed this to the letter, and I wouldn't change a thing about them- the flavor combination is out of this world, the spice level is just about perfect, the crispy, crunchy exterior is the perfect housing for the tender potato within. The sauce is just lovely, and would be wonderful on many things. I debated on buying yet another vinegar, but am so happy I did not try to substitute anything else for the sherry vinegar- it is worth it to buy yourself a bottle if you don't keep it on hand. My boyfriend thinks me a kitchen super star- we devoured these with gusto! Thanks Chef John!"

It took quite a bit longer than 5 minutes to get them to brown, but well worth the wait. The sauce was good, but not terribly necessary as they were very good with just the seasonings."
