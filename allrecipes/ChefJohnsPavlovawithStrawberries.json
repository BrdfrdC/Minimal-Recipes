I wiped my mixing bowl before I started with white vinegar, just to be safe. I put my eggs in a warm water bath for 10 min before starting to bring them up to room temp. I used a stand mixer, slowly increasing the speed. I used baking sugar, which is finer than granulated, and added it in a SLOW steady stream after mixing with cornstarch. Instead of berries I topped with fresh cut pineapple, mandarin oranges, chopped pecans and a tablespoon of shredded unsweetened coconut."

There is a discrepancy between the listed ingredients and those on the video. The list has three egg whites and the video shows four. I think this is responsible for the many comments about them being too sweet. If you use four eggs, they are perfectly sweet, if you use only three they are overly sweet."

It was easier to make than I thought it would be, and a perfect summer dessert. Will definitely make this again."

Make sure you watch the video as getting the right consistency to have the crusty outside and soft meringue inside is critical to the success of this dessert. Passionfruit pulp makes a great topping to provide a little tartness to the sweetness of the Pav, but is difficult to find where I reside in the States. It is completely unnecessary to break the top of the Pav as per the video. What were you thinking Chef John? :)."

"reviewBody": "This is a good recipe, although I suggest taking the egg whites further than ribbon stage. They need soft peaks before adding the sugar mix. Also, adding the sugar very slowly in a constant stream while mixing on high will make for a much lighter pavlova and will keep it from cracking so much. I also ran my sugar and cornstarch through a blender to create a fiber powder. I made one exactly as stated, then one with the changes I mentioned above and it was almost twice as big as the first and had only one crack. This is a very sweet pavlova but I topped it with slightly sweetened whipped cream and a raspberry sauce that cut the sweetness and really brightened the dessert. The raspberry sauce is a small container of berries puréed then pushed through a mesh, 1 tablespoon sugar and boiled down for about five minutes, then cooled."

"reviewBody": "I've never tried pavlova before and really enjoyed making this recipe. I thought it was a little on the too sweet for our tastes, but we did truly enjoy it and would make it again in the future. I did not draw the circle as other recipes have you do. I had no problems shaping it. The whipped topping is so light and refreshing, you will never go back to store bought again--very easy to make."

"reviewBody": "Very simple, easy to follow recipe. Though as other reviews have stated, it's quite sweet so the next time I make it, I likely won't sweeten the whipped cream as there's enough sugar in the meringue itself and the sweet berries on top. But this is a great dessert to have in your arsenal!"

On a separate occasion, I made them into mini pavlovas (yielded a dozen 3” rounds and baked for 40 minutes)... be sure to leave at least an inch between each round so they don’t puff up into each other. I also drizzled melted chocolate over the fruit."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe! Thought Chef John's video was helpful. However, building the meringue with a mixer is a lot easier. My meringue did not brown, so when I constructed the dessert I lighrly dusted the whole thing with a bit of dark chocolate for contrast. Also, when I hulled the berries I set them on paper towels for a while to make sure they wouldn't weep any juice on the finished dish. This is a beautiful dessert. My new go to summer recipe. Move over lemon meringue pie!"

It was delicious! Better than dairy whipped cream in my opinion. The coconut flavor combined with the meringue and fruit made this dessert so yummy and refreshing."

Be sure to wait a full hour for this to cool - I got anxious and rushed this part; I think my Pavlova would have been a tad taller had I waited the full cooling time. The cream also ended up melting some and so berries weren't stable... Also, if you watch the video, beating the whites by hand is noble but unless you want to spend about 45 minutes doing it, use a mixer!!!!"

"reviewBody": "Yet another amazing recipe by Chef John! \nInstead of making one large Pavlova, I used an ice cream scoop and made individual little rounds. The recipe yielded about 18 by using the scoop. After I scooped them onto the parchment lined baking sheets, I turned the scoop over and made a little well for the berries to sit in.\nI also sliced my strawberries because they were HUGE and leaving them whole wasn't an option.\nOther than that I made as is. Delicious and perfect for summer time. My kids were surprised and excited to discover the marshmallow texture inside. I highly recommend this recipe, so simple and pretty. Would be great for a luncheon or entertaining."

The video was extremely helpful with getting the consistency of the egg white mixture just right. I topped it with the whipped cream in this recipe and sliced strawberries (so as to get a small, hassle-free piece of strawberry in every bite :) ). Made this for 2 people, and we demolished all but 1/6 of it."

Instead of dotting the top with berries, I macerated some strawberries &amp; raspberries in sugar, and then reduced the juice down to a syrup, and grated a little lime zest into it. Once syrup cooled, I poured it over pavlova &amp; whipped cream."
