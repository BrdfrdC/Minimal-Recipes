Adding \"cold\" ingredients to the warm/hot potatoes apparently causes a negative reaction with the starch in the potatoes. I never questioned, nor attempted to prove this incorrect, because doing so simply makes for better results."

Had the hubby help… lots of potatoes to mash… and it tasted absolutely delicious as is, but per our Thanksgiving Day tradition, I added garlic, bacon, sharp cheddar, and a little sour cream. Excellent as is or as a base for any style of seasonal seasoning ?? Mm mm Good!!!! Thanks Chef John!!!!"

"reviewBody": "Fantastic recipe &amp; the video is almost a must watch for this one- he goes over the technique &amp; THAT is what makes the difference! This is perfect for your simple, traditional mashed potatoes, but the method makes these the BEST creamy, fluffy &amp; flavorful treat. As far as prep/method- I didn’t have a “masher” of any sort. A rolling pin could have worked, didn’t want to use a mixer in fear of over mixing, but I don’t mind “chunky” mashed potatoes, so I went w/ a basic fork &amp; whisk- if you’ve cooked the potatoes properly, they should break down fairly easy; little effort. The only thing I did to stray from the recipe was add an additional potato, and about 1tsp. of garlic powder. I also got sidetracked while I had the boiled but drained potatoes sitting back in the pot before mashing.... turning the heat back on to high just while mashing made an excellent “save” &amp; allowed the consistency to stay soft &amp; rebound quite impressively! This is definitely the way to go when it comes to making a classic that will WOW, room for error &amp; all! Adding a garnish of arranged green onion never hurts for presentation, either!"

"reviewBody": "Sooo good! I can't do dairy so I used earth balance DF \"butter\" and unsweetened oat milk (if you need a milk substitute I highly recommend going with oat--the flavor is super mild and does not impact a recipes flavor like a lot of soy and nut milks do). I used this recipe to make mashed potato &amp; gravy \"bomb\" sliders. I lightly coated discs of potatoes (with a sm. frozen cube of gravy in the center), with white cake flour, then dipped in a flax egg, and then in panko bread crumbs. They maintained their integrity perfectly when fried at 350 F for 2 min. Thanks for another great recipe Chef John!"

Follow Chef John's video and you will be good to go. I ended up with slightly thinner mashed potatoes than I wanted. My wife said they were great and the taste was awesome, but next time I'll remember to add the milk slowly rather than all at once, so I get the consistency I want. Thanks, Chef John."

I was not only amazed at how fluffy these were (had to use a fork since I didn't have a masher but they came out great otherwise!) but also amazed that when I reheated them, they retained their fluffiness! That has never been the case in the past when I made mashed potatoes so it's something that boggled my mind haha. I will never try another method again aside from investing in a quality masher. Thanks for your many phenomenal recipe additions to the app Chef John! I seek them out and check them first when I see Chef John has added a recipe for something I'm searching for."
