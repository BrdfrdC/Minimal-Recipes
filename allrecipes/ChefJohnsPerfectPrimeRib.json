FOR THE 1 STAR REVIEW BELOW... this person claimed to follow directions completely but DID NOT. They just heated oven to 500 , put roast in and shut oven off immediatly. They missed the most important part of cooking at 500 for 5 min per lb. Guys, if you cannot follow directions, do not then come back and claim it was bad. Maybe take time to re-read? If you follow the 5 min per lb at 500, then NEVER OPEN OVEN DOOR for an additional 2 hours after you shut off the oven, you will have amazing prime rib. NEVER OPEN THAT OVEN DOOR PERIOD. If you do, you ruin a very costly piece of meat."

My guests were amazed and it was delicious. One guest wanted it more on the medium well so I placed it in a pan and covered it with au jus (made from a mix) to the way he wanted it. This method works well for reheating leftovers. Highly recommend this and use a thermometer probe and watch the temperature. Do not be tempted to turn the oven back on!!"

When we flipped the breaker back on, the oven didn't come on. The fuse had blow because of the heat build up in the control panel. $360 later......... Our prime rib was delicious though!"

"reviewBody": "Just made the largest prime rib I have ever done with this method.. 13.83 pounds. Results were once again, spectacular! I chopped a pod of garlic and mixed it in with 1 cup (2 sticks) of butter to coat the meat. I took out the roast to get to room temp around 7pm the night before and put it in the oven at 1pm. 500 for right at an hour gave 4 min 20 sec per pound, then didn't open the oven for 2 hours 20 min (20 min was more because didn't quite have everything else ready). Have a newer range so had to unplug it otherwise the fan would have come on. I thought about setting the oven at 350 so I would know when the oven temp was 350 ( and maybe keep the temp there for 20 min or so) but didn't and just let it ride. Had I done that, the roast would have been a little less rare which would have been ok too, but I personally like it more rare. It also would have been able to take another few minutes at 500, but I certainly didn't want to ruin the roast by leaving it that hot too long. I didn't use a meat thermometer, as mine melted during the process.. lol"

It was by far better looking and much more flavorful than any of our favorite restaurants serve, and that's saying a lot! First of all, the \"mathematical method\" is just genius and it really works. My roast was done to perfection with a nice, crispy crust along the outer edge. When you bite into it, you get the cruncy flavor, followed by the tender, juicy meat inside and it's just awesome! I followed up with Chef John's au just recipe and it was great as well. I'll be using this recipe forever - it's the gold standard!!"

Interior doneness was perfect medium/rare and tender. I used a choice cut standing rib roast. I cut off the bones so I could add seasoning then tied it back together. If you are using a choice cut, I recommend that you look for one that has the nicest marbling. For the best crust, store the seasoned roast on a rack in your fridge for a few days (mine stayed for 10 days). Always use a meat thermometer as my roast reached my ideal internal temperature before the 2 hour mark. Thanks Chef John."

"reviewBody": "I made a 9.99 pound roast . I let it rest for 5 hours out of the refrigerator. I softened 2 sticks of butter,2 teaspoon Herbs de Provence,2 TBSP fresh ground pepper and mixed that well. Coated roast and sprinkled generous amount of sea salt on roast. I used a covered cookie sheet with a flat wire rack. My calculated time was 53 minutes. I baked it for 53 minutes at 500 degrees. Shut oven off for 1/2 hour . Put oven back on for 1 hour at 275degrees . Shut oven off again for 1/2 hour. Never opening oven door. It came out spectacular for our liking. The end pieces were medium and the center was medium rare. My husband said he likes it more rare. Next time I will reduce initial cooking time to 49-50 minutes. I think I will also spray coating with olive oil to reduce initial smoking from high heat. Otherwise it was delicious and easy! A crowd pleaser for 6 healthy appetites with plenty of leftovers! I made a 4 pound last Christmas and it was perfect following my same calculations then turning oven off for 1/2 hour ,turn oven on 275 for 1 hour then off again for 1/2,then taking the roast out. Of never opening the oven door . Great recipe! Will make again soon. Our local shop rite had the meat on sale ( prime angus $6.47/pound)"

"reviewBody": "This is a horrible recipe for a number of reasons. It ruined what would have been a wonderful XMAS family get together. I followed the recipe religiously, and the result was an overcooked, dry piece of $125 meat that everyone ate in silence ignoring the obvious elephant in the room. There were several major problems: (1) As recommended, I used a stand-alone oven thermometer to set and hold the temperature at 500 degF for 39 minutes (for a 7lb 13 oz prime rib). At this temperature, and this duration the oven generated so much smoke that I was afraid the house smoke alarms would go off. I ended up putting a fan in the kitchen to blow out the smoke. (2) After 39 minutes I turned off the oven, and kept the oven door closed for two hours. (3) Because of the instructions called for \"leave the oven closed for 2 hours\", I was unable to monitor how much cooking was occurring during this interim. Since different ovens cool down at different rates, I had no way of knowing (without opening the oven door and using a thermometer) to see how much cooking was occurring during this two hour period. (4) After 2 hours, with no assessment of how things were going, I opened the oven door to a disaster. Overcooked, dry meat, and not happy friends and family sitting down to a once-a-year family get together. I will never use this recipe again. Lessons learned: (1) Sear the meat at high temperature at the start (2) Reduce the temperature and cook the remainder of the meat at lower temperature (3) Most importantly: MONITOR THE COOKING USING A TEMPERATURE GAGE BY OPENING THE OVEN AND CHECKING CONTINUOULSY DURING THE COOKING CYCLE! Any recipe which calls for leaving the meat unattended (and un-measured for two hours without having the ability to open the oven door and taking a temperature measurement should be immediately discarded)"

"reviewBody": "I followed the recipe to the T. Roast was at room temperature. But after 2 hrs of shutting the oven, the roast came out too cooked. It was medium cooked as opposed to medium rare. I think this recipe reply depends on the oven u have, whether your oven holds heat and how quickly it cools down. I would recommend cooking using a thermometer to properly roast the rib."

Instead I turned the oven as low as posslble (170 ish) and my 7.4 pound roast cooked in less then 2 hours. I also used a digital thermostat with an alarming probe. I shut the oven off when it reached 125 degrees. I also cleaned my oven ahead of time. It was amazing!!!!"

I did the 5 minutes per pound at 500, then let it sit in the oven off for 2 hours. The meat temp started to slow, so I kicked the oven back on to 300 until it preheated, then turned it off. Let it rest 40 minutes. For the last 20 minutes I preheated again to 400, then let it rest until it reached 140. Took the prime rib out, removed the bone, let it sit for 10 minutes, and sliced. It was perfect."

We followed the instructions precisely, including flipping the breaker switch to the oven since our model automatically cools after it’s turned off. It was perfect! We did not have smoke during the roasting stage because the roasting pan we selected fit to the size of the roast. We are thinking a larger roasting pan would’ve caused the drippings to spread along the bottom of the pan and burn. Our confidence has been raised, and we are now looking forward to inviting others over to serve prime rib! Thank you for sharing your detailed recipe!"

I missed the step where it needed 6hours+ to come to room temp. ended up sitting about 4 hours and then I *had to cook it even though the center was 50 degrees. Took it out after the 2 hours oven off and it was at 125. The only hard part was I still needed an additional hour of oven time to cook the rest of my sides so it had to sit and rest more. I cleaned my oven first to cut down on smoke and I think that helped. Would definitely do this method again."

"reviewBody": "I've been doing this exact method of \"no peek\" for 25 years. To count how many times, its probably 60 times to date. It works, though the first time you do it, you will be nervous. My dear, late friend tried it her first time and must have called me a half dozen times for reassurance, each time, having had a little more to drink, LOL I've even done this for my husband's work, where it was our gift to staff to fix 2 whole, 7 rib roasts &amp; all the fixings, roasting them in electric roaster pans, which will only work if you insulate the lids really well. Trust this method! If it doesn't work, though you are certain you followed the method to a \"T\", I would suggest you need to confirm your oven temperature. Also, MANY ovens, especially older ones, don't go up to 500°, so that would require refiguring your times. When I still had teenagers in the house, I would duct tape the oven door, reminding them that YOU CANNOT OPEN THE OVEN DOOR!"
