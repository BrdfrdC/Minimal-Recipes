Yep, so easy even with your eyes half open. :-) I didn`t add the cayenne or cheese on top but right out of the oven warm, they are so good with butter and jelly. I have a glass oven door, so I kept watching the progress. At first I didn`t think were going to rise, but rise they did. Some not so much as the others. I just hope they are as good at room temp as they were warm out of the oven!"

I was also trying Chef John's method for Prime Rib (which was also a huge success!), and I hadn't thought of a work around to get to the drippings. The Popovers came out beautifully! I made absolutely no changes to the recipe, other than I needed to take them out about 1 minute early. They were big, airy, tasty, beautifully browned and crispy on the outside ... I see them coming soon to a breakfast table near me! I will DEFINITELY make these again!"

For the first batch I followed directions exactly after leaving the ingredients at room temperature for about one hour and the popovers were delicious. The second batch the ingredients were out for about 30 minutes and the oven and popover pan were both a little warm still from the first batch and the resulting popovers rose even higher and tasted even better! My conclusion: a no-fail recipe that is so quick, easy and delicious that we will be making them often. Thank you Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "I love popovers and make them often, with varying results,but have never made this recipe before. These popped beautifully, into fluffy balloons, actually mine looked better than the picture above! Next time I will cook a little less 24-25 mins, as they browned quickly and I like the softer pudding middle texture. I have found that if you decrease the salt, your popovers will not pop, do not not over mix, and always use room temp. ingredients( I never have that time so pop the eggs into warm water before cracking and nuke the milk for a minute on very low). I used a muffin tin for these and you never would believe that they were not out of a pop over tin, so big and puffy. Most recipes call for a pre-heated tin, so I am amazed that these worked so well."

"reviewBody": "I'm not quite sure how to rate this one. I'm sure something went wrong on my end. I have never made popovers before, and these did not rise much above the muffin tin, and then collapsed after I took them out. They tasted okay, kinda bland, but still good with the beef stew gravy. The inside was very eggy, reminded us of an omelette. There were very little air bubbles, quite dense.\n\nI wonder if it's the altitude here (over 6000 ft), but I don't know what I'd have to change to fix that.\n\nI will try this again, and play around to see if I can figure it out. They definitely tasted good! I doubled everything and there were no leftovers."

I also used flour specifically for bread baking. They came out FANTASTIC; daughter said better than the ones served at The Zodiac Room in Neiman Marcus. Now that's a high compliment!"

The only complaint is that if you want more you have to wait for the oven to cool!! LOL...they take a few minutes to throw together and before you know it you're eating the most delicious, lightest home made popovers ever! Thank you. :)"

They were delicious with beef stew also from Allrecipes....(Slow cooker Beef Stew IV to which I omitted the Onion Soup Mix - due to it having MSG...WTH?? lol...added additional spices, celery and some Kitchen bouquet). Again...these pop overs are easy and delicious! \n\nThank you Chef John...btw, going to try your Buttermilk Biscuits for Sunday breakfast 2mrw with some Southern Blues playin in the background. ... oh yes. Wohoo!"

I left out the cayenne pepper and cheese, but that was my personal preference. Chef John, you did it again with a great video and recipe! Thanks! You are the best! Keep those recipes and videos coming!"

I love popovers, but I have difficulty getting them to pop, and these were perfect. A side-note though- I used a 6 tin popover pan, not a muffin pan, and the batter did not fill all the tins. The first time I made these, the batter filled 5 tins, and the second time, it filled 4."

"reviewBody": "This is a great method and I have used a recipe like this for years. My Yorkshire Mum and Aunties would not agreed but it does work. Using this recipe, as written, mine did not POP as much as much as they usually do and I attribute that to a couple of things. First, I usually use either Wondra flour or cake flour - also non fat milk - Cold oven and bake at 425. The lighter the ingredients the high they will rise. My bake time is usually about 25 minutes. They were crispy and very tasty, just not as tall as I would have expected. BTW - this made 9 popovers with a little batter to spare."
