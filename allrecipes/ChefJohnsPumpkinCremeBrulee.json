I have made this for Thanksgiving before, but now we have a wheat allergy in the family and can't have pie or trifle or Pumpkin Gooey Butter Cake (we like to change things up sometimes...). Yes, the texture is a little different from regular creme brûlée, but this is a perfect mixture of smooth and spice with that wonderful brûlée crust. This will be our new \"pumpkin pie\" -- thank you , Chef John!"

I even had to turn up the heat to 350 and bake it for another 30 minutes because it was still liquid. After the extended baking it turned out fine.\n\nI didn't bother with the burnt sugar on top because I don't have blow torch and don't need the extra sugar. It was good without it. Next time I will definitely double the recipe to make more."

"reviewBody": "I think every time I make a Chef John recipe, I feel it's the best thing I ever made! My only issue was that apparently my ramekins are too large, as it barely filled seven. (I made two batches to have 14; I could have easily poured them both into the original seven.) The taste was delicious. Of course the texture is not that of normal crème brûlée, but the comparative ease of preparation was a gift as I prepared 15 dishes myself over 3 days for Thanksgiving this year. This was gluten-free for my niece without making her feel left out, and my father-in-law loved it - ate two and took another home for later!"

SO easy!\n\n* Blow-torching food is always in style. And fun.\n\n* Delicious! Nice balance of flavors, sweetness, creaminess.\n\n* Great presentation, in a larger dish (I used a clay cazuela) or in ramekins.\n\nNote: The custard is light and delicate. If you prefer a firmer custard, add one additional egg yolk."

I'm gonna give it another shot soon, but I'll use a bit less heavy cream than recommended.\nBut nevertheless the taste was excellent and everybody loved it!\nUpdate: I found out that my selfmade pumpkin puree was not perfect - had too much moisture in it. This time the puree turned out perfect (let i drain for quite some time) and so did the „brulee“."

It made a wonderful Thanksgiving dessert ... just right after an extravagant dinner. I made it exactly as described. My 6 ounce ramekins were shallower and larger in area than pictured, so I could have baked them a bit less ... 25 to 30 minutes. Note too, that it takes a while to flame these. It took some time to do 12."

As Chef John says right off the bat, this does NOT have the same texture as a creme brulee, so no one should be disappointed or lower their rating because of this, but it does have its own wonderful, creamy texture and a flavor that is amazing. Thanks Chef John - another winner!!"
