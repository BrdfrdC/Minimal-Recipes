I recommend this recipe!!! Will be making many more times in the future"

We didn't make the glaze, ran out of time but they didn't seem to need it anyway. Thank You for a great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Delicious!!! I was not expecting them to be this good. I made them with King arthurs gluten free flour, earths balance margarine and organic sugar. My gluten loving husband said they were the best snickerdoodles he ever had - which is saying a lot since his mother bakes all the time. I haven't baked in ages so it was a nice surprise. Kids had fun baking too."

"reviewBody": "In all my years of baking, I have never made snickerdoodles but when I saw this recipe, I decided to try it. I followed the recipe exactly (who can argue with Chef John's recipes) and they turned out just about the best sugar-type cookies I have ever made. My husband is very fond of spicy desserts and this really made his day. They were soft the day they were made and a little crunchy the following days. No matter what, they were very good and I am sure to make them again. Very easy to make."

My husband, who does not normally eat snickerdoodles, was drawn in by the smells filling my kitchen.\nUnfortunately, it looks like I will have to share my snickerdoodles. LOL"

I was expecting the recipe to have some pumpkin puree in it. It is instead just your average snickerdoodle cookie, with some extra spices thrown in. Don't get me wrong, it tastes great, as nearly everything from Chef John does!"
