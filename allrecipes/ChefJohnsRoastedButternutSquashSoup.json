I thought it was okay until I added the apple cider vinegar. The vinegar made it. I did add a cut up apple to the roasting but otherwise followed the recipe. My mom likes a bit of brandy instead of the vinegar"

Maybe cumin or something with a little bite to add some complexity to the flavor, the apple cider vinegar’s not doing it for me. \n\nI also think it would have been more cohesive with a vegetable stock instead of chicken broth, chicken flavor is overwhelming the delicacy of the butternut squash."

My problem is that the vegetables tend to burn being in a 400 degree oven for an hour. Anyone else have this issue? Could be my roasting pan. It’s calphalon, but maybe the dark bottom has a tendency to burn things more?"

Roasted squash at 400 degrees for 50 minutes, flipped and added 2 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp brown sugar to each halve and roasted for another 20 minutes and then scooped out and into stew pot. The extra flavor was enjoyed by all. Wife asked me to make more so she cooked freeze it. Fantastic soup"

I sautee the onion and garlic while I roast JUST the butternut squash in the oven. When I throw everything in the stock pot, I throw in a sweet potato as well. I double the maple syrup, and do lemon instead of vinegar. Lemon lends acidity without being super apparent like vinegar. Yum!"

Half way through the roasting, I added half a red pepper with the vegetables. I forgot to brown the butter since I didn't have fresh sage. I had used dry thyme on the roasting veggies. I made a broth from the bottom of the roasting pan after removing the veggies. I didn't bother to strain the soup. I omitted the creme fraiche since I didn't have any, but I don't think it needed it either. My husband thought it was a great soup too, and that is saying a lot for someone who is picky about soups."

So I just added the cut squash to the onions, carrots and garlic and roasted as directed. I also had homemade chicken stock that I used. I will definitely make this recipe again. My guests asked me for the recipe also, which I was happy to share."

My husband and I love squash soup and I am always searching for creative and tasty new ways to prepare it. This surprised because it was so simple yet created such a wonderful blend of flavors. I didn't roast the vegetables, because I was using thanksgiving leftover squash. I simply sautéed the onions and carrots until they just started to brown then added the squash and crushed garlic, the remaining ingredients! I can't wait to make this in a cold winter day when I have the time to roast the vegetables as called for. Thank you Chef John for another great recipe!"

My husband, who hates squash, absolutely loved it and said it was one of his favorite soups I’ve ever made! Next time I think o will cut up the squash into chunks before roasting because it was too hot to scoop it out, and I think getting more carmelization on the squash would make it even better! This recipe is definitely a keeper."

"reviewBody": "I've made this twice and both times it has turned out so wonderfully. It definitely has a gorgeous autumnal sweet flavour with a bit of heat from the cayenne and tang from the vinegar. I would suggest going for a larger more middle-aged butternut for this recipe rather than a young, early season butternut. The second time I made this the butternut was slightly underripe and it was quite difficult to scoop the flesh away from the skin without the whole squash breaking apart. Otherwise I would say you can make it exactly as written without any issues. \n\nI didn't have creme fraiche so I subbed in some full-fat sour cream and it was delish. Happy souping!"

But 2 tablespoons is a lot to add all at once. I would suggest adding a teaspoon at a time to taste. I probably ended up using closer to one tablespoon. Two would have killed it. I would definitely make this again and again."

"reviewBody": "After reading a bunch of reviews I decide to make it my own and followed the vegetable ratios generally and the spices mostly.\nI added a few celery sticks that had seen better days and didn't measure the carrots. Just chopped up 3 medium sized ones. I had a couple sweet potatoes in the fridge peeled and in need of something to be done with them so they got chopped and added to the pan!\nI've decide that next time (and there will be!) I will peel the squash prior to roasting as my hands don't work well and I found it harder to scrape the squash out of the skin than to peel it raw.\nI went out and bought some maple syrup to give this a true chance and was a little on the fence about the cider vinegar.\nAfter straining the soup, which I left on the thick side I decided to sample the leftovers in the strainer with cider and added it 1/8th of a teaspoon at a time to the bowl.\nWithout the cider vinegar, I thought it was a little on sweet side and wasn't too sure of how I felt about a whole pot of it. After the cider added I thought that while I liked it some better it was missing something.\nI added salt &amp; pepper and it still was a little shy of great. I went back to the recipe and realized that I hadn't added any cayenne pepper. I sprinkled some on, mixed it in and finished off the bowl of soup. The cayenne pulled it all together and I can't wait for the creme fraiche to be ready and try it again!\nThis is a recipe that I would serve to friends and will be making fairly regularly this"

One of the ingredients for success was the nutty sage brown butter— I threw in the buttered sage leaves in the soup (as in the video)! I did as suggested and put the soup through a sieve..... also blended it in a blender— same consistency, and the blender was easier . I did not add the cider vinegar— just made it last night, so will have some today—may try it with the vinegar.... will see which one selection I like best!\nAbsolutely scrumptious! Used ingredients as measured— came out to 12 cups of soup."

Changes of necessity this time were dried sage instead if fresh, and for the first time in forever I didn't have fresh garlic! I used 1/2 tsp of garlic powder added to the broth stage. Also added just 1 tsp if the Apple cider vinegar per other posts. I didn't have a strainer course enough but the texture was still smooth. Also the squash needed more roasting than the onions would tolerate so had to separate them early. will definitely make this again. Thank you again, Chef John."

I made A LOT of this soup and canned it- it is delicious! Pureed everything in my vitamix, so it is super smooth. It is great to pair with some homemade rolls or bread for a warm winter meal. I have never added the creme fraiche, and think it is perfectly fine without it. Would just make it more elegant- because it is still superb without the extra creme. Will be making it next fall if our squash does well again. I'm looking forward to it!"

The directions didn't say whether to keep the sage leaves or remove so I pureed them into the batch. More chicken stock required (1L) and fresh ground pepper. Voila another butchered recipe that turned out tasting excellent. And yes, I'll do it again. Cheesy baking powder biscuits made this recipe a must-do-again for our current, chilly Cariboo weather."

I don't have that kind of patience, and scooping hot roasted squash out of the skin is about as fun as it sounds."
