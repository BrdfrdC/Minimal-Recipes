I now buy a slab of fresh salmon for $20-$24 dollars and cut into 6 or eight generous pieces and do baked potatoes or fries in the air fryer. I cook all the salmon pieces at once and the leftovers are great cold but by the third leftovers dinner we want something different and these salmon cakes are great!!"

Hubby &amp; I both enjoyed the very flavorful result. It didn't even need tartar sauce. My only complaint is that despite refrigerating several hours, I found the mixture rather juicy when trying to make the patties, however I may not have squeezed enough juice out of the salmon before making the mixture."

I also made his Aioli sauce ! It took an hour lol since I never made it , my mom and fiancé devoured it . My mom said it was wonderful and would easily pay 25$ for the dinner in a restaurant . She's very proud of me :) and I'm proud of myself as well! Thank you chef John ! Another dinner accomplished ! He makes everything so easy to do and if there's a video to watch it makes it even easier !"

I also didn't have any capers on hand; I didn't have anything to substitute for the capers, but I threw in a dash of onion powder to add a little more flavor.

Like other reviewers, I added some chopped onion (about 1/4-1/2 cup) and a sprinkle of old bay; I also added a touch of dried dill, dried parsley, and garlic powder. Used a breadcrumb/panko blend, and served the cakes with Home-made tartar sauce. Will definitely repeat - might make smaller parties, too."

I only had 30 minutes to let them sit in the fridge and thought they certainly would be too wet and would fall apart. But they cooked up great in some butter and avocado oil. Ended up staying together and tasted great. Next time I’ll substitute Old Bay for some of the cayenne and salt. We sprinkled some on top this time. Next time I will find a recipe for a sauce."

I added a cup of minced onion, a cup of finely chopped celery, a tablespoon of dill weed. I only put in 1/4 tea of cayenne and did not use capers.

I'm not someone who uses a whole lot of salt while cooking, so the combination of the salt in the recipe, the capers, and the salmon itself made the dish incredibly salty.\nIf I did it again - which I might - I'd cut all of the salty ingredients in half.\nThat said, the patties held together very well, and the texture was great! Crispy outside, tender inside, like seafood cakes should be."

I've been making salmon patties for years and never have them fall part like that. I think it may be because of the lime juice. The patties were a little wetter than the other recipes, but as typical of a CJ recipe, they tasted great. Next time I'll try without the lime juice and just add it on after cooking. Thanks for posting."

I made the one without the eggs and they broke apart on me, then I saw this other copy of the recipe and noticed it was added. You might want to erase the other as they don't quite turn out as good. Other than that, my husband and I are big fans. Thanks"
