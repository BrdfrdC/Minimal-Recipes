I ended up adding a dash or two of gravy master to give it a boost of flavor and it made it slightly edible. Then comes the potatoes. Yuck! The recipe calls for salt and pepper but doesn’t say where to add it- to the potatoes or to the meat mixture. I did to both! I also added onions to the meat mixture. If I were to ever make this again, I’d be kicked out of my house!"

Hey, I love food but I'm lazy. I used most of his ingredients. It is so tasty using Smoked meat. After I smoked the roasts for 4 hours I put them in a pan with cut up onions and green peppers with some broth and foil the pan and take off once they hit 203 IT. I made it 3 weeks ago and am making it again right now. It is that good."

I should've figured out the the potatoes would be DRY without adding any milk like normal mashed potatoes, but I trusted the recipe. Wrong. My advice: I'd look for a different recipe, because even a LOT of tweaking didn't help this one out much."

First I made 4cups of instant mashed potatoes and added the sour cream and about 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. Second, I used water instead of the broth. Third, I used two regular cans of mixed vegetables drained instead of the frozen. I put the meat mixture in a 9 x 13 pan and spread the potatoes evenly over the top. I sprinkled the rest of the cheese on the top and baked at 375 degrees for about 20 minutes. Awesome!"

"reviewBody": "A decent starting point for a quick Cottage Pie. But, ketchup is far too strong and sweet. Highly recommend tomato sauce instead. If you only have ketchup, cut the amount in half. We added approximately 1 tbsp of diced onion to the beef for more flavor. (A little garlic is an option.) To reduce the amount of fat, we poured off the beef drippings and stirred in a bit of vegetable bouillon with the flour and beef to make a \"gravy\"."

"reviewBody": "This was pretty good, but I did make a few changes: first, I sautéd an onion and a few cloves of garlic before adding the ground beef (I actually used vegetarian beef crumbles). The 3 Tbsp of ketchup was *way* too much &amp; made it too sweet. I balanced out the sweetness by adding Worcestershire sauce &amp; vinegar as well as salt &amp; pepper to taste. Next time I’ll either skip the ketchup altogether or use only 1 Tbsp. I will definitely add the Worcestershire &amp; vinegar again and maybe some fresh herbs like rosemary and/or thyme. I added a little bit extra broth &amp; may add a splash of red wine next time. Great base recipe, but definitely taste as you go along &amp; adjust the flavors according to your taste. The mashed potatoes, by the way, were fantastic!!!!"

Sprinkled cheddar cheese on top of meat mixture. Used 1 container Bob Evans mashed potatoes prepared. Baked 20 minutes and then topped with cheddar cheese for 5 minutes or less\nWill double this recipe from now on to last longer. It’s a delicious winter dish."

"reviewBody": "This is a good, easy, comfort food recipe. I was doing a trial run before I made it in larger quantities for a crowd, and I'm glad I did, because the ingredient list called for salt and pepper, but nowhere in the recipe were instructions when to add them. I added them to the vegetable mixture, and I also added a couple teaspoons salt to the water when cooking the potatoes, which is what I usually do when boiling potatoes. The seasoning seemed about right that way. The potatoes were good with the sour cream and cheese, but I thought there should have been more, maybe 2 pounds instead of 1.25 pounds of potatoes. I could not completely cover the veggies. I used a 32 oz. bag of frozen mixed vegetables, and that worked well, although my personal preference would have been just peas and carrots and no green beans. I cooked this in a 9.5x13.5 casserole dish, and that was the right size for this."

I also substituted sour cream with light sour cream and added 2 tablespoons of almond milk to the potatoes. Substituted ketchup with an organic sugar free ketchup and think next time I'll add more. Lastly I used 50% cheese substitute with regular cheese so that it wasn't so much dairy and more variety. Great recipe! I think I found my parent's favorite dish to cook for them."
