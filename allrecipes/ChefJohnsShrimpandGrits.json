I’ve made it several times, I’m going to switch out the cheddar cheese for smoked Gouda. The reason is because I went to a really nice restaurant and that was a side dish and it was to die for.?. I love any kind of grits or polenta but this smoked Gouda grits was exceptional?."

I’m not a huge fan of jalapeño so I simply doubled the Cajun seasoning and still got the right amount of heat and flavor. To tell you the truth, the bacon made this dish, so don’t skimp and use a good quality bacon. I like my grits cheesy, so I’ll probably double the amount time. The sauce/gravy looks like it will be watery at first, but relax. It will thicken nicely and be a delicious sauce for this brunch or supper dish!"

I think it was true to the basic recipe and added some touches that we appreciate at our place."

Subbed in some red chili powder on the shrimp and Tony Chachere’s creole seasoning. Only had sliced pepper jack l, so sliced it into squares and tossed in. Gives the grits a kick now and then. Next time will add a bit more heavy cream and an ounce or two of white wine."

I was concerned about the blandness of the cheese grits, but after putting the sauce on top that was made with the shrimp, it makes perfect sense. Good call by the chef. Watch out for flying hot grits while stirring when they cook."

It makes the grits saltier, but I prefer Parmesan over cheddar in my grits. Otherwise, I made the shrimp part exactly as given. Just enough spice . Not overpowering. Absolutely delicious!"

Added cheese and okra to the grits. It was beyond amazing. I’m going to make it again but I don’t see what the cream would do for this other than make a richer, fattier sauce. Without the cream the sauce was thin but I guess the cheese and okra in the grits made up for it. When the shrimp and the grits combined the taste was perfect and rich."

I also added mushrooms, which I sauteed with the onion and garlic a bit before adding it to the sauce (could that have thinned it too much?). Took veggies out of pan, sauteed shrimp for a minute and then added sauce/veggies back in to finish cooking. Also, remember to make the grits with broth, not water - forgot this time, and definitely not as flavorful. Still good, though!"
