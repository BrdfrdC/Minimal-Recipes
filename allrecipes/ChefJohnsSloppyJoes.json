There is too little surface area to evaporate all the liquid before you cook the rest in to a textureless mush. I made this mistake and and had to scoop out the solids and hard-boil the sauce down before putting the meat and veg back in the pot. The only harm was dirtying a spider and bowl. Next time I will add just enough water to stew the meat but still be reduced enough by the time everything is cooked."

Somewhere between 2 1/2 and 3 cups water total keeps the timing similar."

"reviewBody": "Another great Chef John recipe! I had to make changes based on what I had on hand, but the basic recipe is what made my dinner delicious. I used 1 lb ground beef and 8 oz chopped button mushrooms (cut the added water by at least 1/3 cup). I only had about 1/2 red pepper, so supplemented with 2 chopped pickled cherry peppers and a bunch of chopped pickled banana peppers. I also added a good \"splog\" of tomato paste and anchovy paste after the meat, onion, and mushroom cooked for a minute or so before the set next steps. I prefer tangy over sweet so halved the brown sugar and replaced 1/3 cup of water with some of the pickled pepper juice. We loved it and will definitely make it again soon."

I swap in canned tomato juice (like V8) instead of water. its a ton of extra flavor when it reduces. Reduced sodium is fine if that's a concern.\n\n2. I use 4-5 miniature sweet peppers instead of one bell pepper. flavor is similar but not quite as strong.\n\nIt's delicious and my daughter requests it all the time. Warning: I am not allowed to buy the canned Sloppy Joe mix anymore."

How they can describe this as \"almost dry\" is beyond me. The flavor was great, though, so I'll use this recipe again, but I'll start out with a half cup to three-fourths cup of water and see how that goes."

"reviewBody": "Really good. Takes a long time compared to making sloppy joes from a can, but tastes better.\n\nI used spicy mustard and about 2 tablespoons of it. Instead of ketchup, I used around two cups of BBQ sauce (KC Masterpiece). Also, did not use the green pepper.\n\nMake sure to use lean ground beef, I used 85/15 and there was too much fat/liquid in the pan after I broke up/browned the ground beef. Had to remove it before I added the water and spices/sauce.\n\nTurned out very good. Try to microwave buns for 20-30 seconds before plating and serve like an open face sandwhich."

Strain off excess fat but not all. In a separate pan cook onions and garlic. Combine garlic/onions once fat is drained. Then add red pepper cook for one minute. Add remaining ingredients except salt/pepper/cayenne. Add only one cup of water. After bringing to a boil of Medium heat, reduce and simmer. After 10mins add 1tsp or less of salt, add pepper. After another 10mins taste. Add salt and or\nPepper to taste, also add cayenne. Taste once more when almost cooked and add salt/pepper/cayenne to taste. Turn off heat and then lightly toast butter buns for better flavor. I use mini Ciabatta for mine."

The sweet and hot kick really made the sloppy Joe. I also loved that it wasn't \"sloppy\" like Mamwich. Like others said about letting it simmer. I was certain it would be to watery but after 45 minutes it was nice and thick. Patience guys, good things come to those who wait! Thanks chef John, I'll definitely be making more of your recipes."

I used red instead of green pepper just because of personal preference. It is sweet, but I like it that way, so you can start with 1 Tbls. brown sugar and adjust to taste. Also, after reading all the reviews, you MUST let it cook down for 30-60 minutes on medium heat and it will be the perfect texture. My family and I loved it!
