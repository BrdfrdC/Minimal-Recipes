However, by the time the sauce was done, so were the curds. One tip I would add is to add 1/8- 1/4 tsp of baking soda to the onions to help them caramelize much faster. In any case, my kitchen smells like ranch. Time to eat!"

Sauce wasn't as thick as i had hoped, I will try to figure that out next time i make this because the flavor was amazing!!! Served over Egg noodles, will try rice next time too. Ok made this again and this time I still floured the chops browned them but added more onions, added ground thyme and subbed sour cream for the buttermilk and the gravy was thicker and amazing over basmatic rice!!!

I didn't have buttermilk and didn't want to use the milk + vinegar trick, so I substituted cream mexicana (basically sour cream but with a bit more tang.) Probably made it thicker, but it wasn't too thick. Delicious."

The gravy and rice were superb!\nI cook most nights and love trying new recipes, or rethinking traditional classics. You can never go wrong with any Chef John recipe, and this one does not disappoint!"

Also, we had better results with thicker (i.e.., 1\") chops...thinner chops cook very quickly."

You DON'T want to over cook pork, they'll get dry. So make sure the last step the temperature is on low for 10 mins. Served a mashed potatoes and asparagus. Pretty good"

I'm a one-person household and what I love about Chef John's recipes is that usually I can divide them in half and for me that is more than enough for a couple of meals. I browned the chops longer than five minutes per side because I wanted them really browned. This dish turned out beautifully served with rice and a green side salad. Perfection."

I served it with Chef John's mashed potatoes; a perfect combination and a perfect meal! \nThis is definitely going to become a regular addition!"

I used one yellow onion and one red onion. \n\nI did cook the onions over a low heat for probably 20 minutes... They were beautiful and delicious. Sadly, I should have used at least 4 large onions instead of two. There just wasn't enough for the sauce, in my opinion. The sauce was okay. I didn't think it was fantastic or anything, and I REALLY wanted to love this recipe. \n\nI won't ever make this recipe ever again. At least not for pork chops. I might make it for chicken at some point. I've got other pork chop recipes that are so much better than this one. I wish I hadn't of wasted my pork chops on this recipe."
