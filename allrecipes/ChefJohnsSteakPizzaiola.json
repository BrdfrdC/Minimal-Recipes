I have only made this and his concassee, but has given me the confidence to try other recipes. I HIGHLY recommend this and his other videos. Cheers! Mike"

I think it was the video that said hot and sweet peppers, so I used jalapeno and bell other than that everything was the same. Will make again because it was pretty easy. Thank you Chef!"

Serve on sliced sourdough hoagie rolls. Used 400 degree oven for 12 minutes for perfect browning of rolls. Put mozzarella slices on rolls after taking out of oven. Did everything else exactly! Served Arugula tossed with lemon juice, good olive oil, salt &amp; pepper and shaved Pecorino Romano cheese. Fabulous birthday dinner! Thanks Chef John for an extremely memorable meal! Will absolutely make again!"

I added a few jarred whole pepperoncini peppers and a splash of the juice from the bottle for a little extra kick. He loved the dish very much. If I am making for myself, I do exactly as you do in the video. Your recipes rock, thank you"

I served it over garlic toast. Since there were only two of us, we had leftovers for a second meal a couple of nights later and it reheated well. Also, we topped it with shredded Parmesan cheese instead of mozzarella. Delicious both times!"

The cooking time is all in the cutting of the vegetables other than that this is a great one pan dish that will wow your eating companion with your cooking flair. Poor your date a glass of wine and impress him/her with your cooking flair. A really simple dish, I followed the recipe fully with the only alternative being I like spice so I added more hot peppers than perhaps others would."

Think you could substitute most any meat for the beef fillet."

I find that San Marzano canned tomatoes are about as close as you can get to fresh tomatoes if the fresh ones are unavailable. The only thing that I wish I had done differently was to have watched the video first, as I would have avoided making a few missteps along the way. It is really helpful. Thanks for the great recipe!!!!"
