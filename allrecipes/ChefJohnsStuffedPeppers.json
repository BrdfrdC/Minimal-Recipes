I use 3 LARGE peppers (red, yellow orange) -- I'm not a green pepper fan -- and de-seed and slice them in half for 6 large halves. Stuff those to the max and any stuffing left over is jammed in between the pepper halves and cooked right along side the stuffed peppers! Absolutely delicious! Chef John is the MAN! His recipes are the bomb!"

I pretty much stuck to the instructions but i cooked the pepper halves in boiling water for 3 minutes before i stuffed them since we like our peppers more tender. They were still crisp tender after cooking in the oven. I used a spicy tomato basil sauce for the base and a can of rotel tomatoes to add more spice to to the meat mixture. The sauce and the meat mixture were very flavorful but not overly spicy. I omitted the cheese since we do not eat cheese."

"reviewBody": "I loved this recipe! The video doesn't jibe with the written instructions, so I combined elements from each. Chef John stands his peppers on end, but I found it easier to slice them in half, and bake them on their sides. The filling makes more than enough for the four peppers called for, so I'll use five or six the next time ( and there WILL be a next time!), and I used John's suggestion to add some of the marinara to the filling. Since I'm not a fan of \"heat\", I'll probably eliminate the red pepper flakes in the sauce, but will leave the cayenne pepper in the filling. I'm so excited to find a stuffed pepper recipe I really enjoy!"

Very easy to follow instructions and the time it took to cook the rice - 20 min. - and brown the ground meat, etc, they were ready to pop into the oven. I changed up things a bit. I cooked the meat mixture together with the cooked rice before stuffing it into the peppers. Next time, I will follow Chef John's instructions exactly because I believe, it saves time getting it in the oven!"

Following the direction this sauce would only go under the stuffed peppers, but it's so good I mixed it right in to the filing. You should too! I also cooked all the meat in a skillet before mixing the filing so that I could shorten my oven cook time. My suggestion is to bake a total of 1 hour. The first 30 minutes, just the bell pepper cups and a half cup of water, to stream them. Then another 30 once they're stuffed."

I’ve made these several times now and they always turn out great! The last time l made them l decided to repurpose the left overs . A day or so later I chopped up the stuffed peppers l had left and put them in burrito shells with a little cheese. Rolled them up and baked them covered just long enough to heat up with a little verde sauce and cheese on top! New favorite burritos!!"

The written recipe uses halves of peppers and puts canned tomatoes in the stuffing. I'm curious about this version because in other recipes I have found that blanching the peppers is really worth it. I hate blanching things but it makes the pepper skins tender."

It was surprising how large, and filling each half portion was."

So all in all, it was pretty much the recipe as written. And it was truly delicious. The sauce is incredible. I had two beautiful big green peppers from my CSA and adjusted the recipe for 4. There are only 2 of us, so I froze 2 to have later. I think a veggie version, with corn, beans, celery, mushrooms would be very good, too."

"reviewBody": "These were easy and delicious! I deconstructed it though to suit my lazy husband. I chopped the green peppers and cooked with the oil and onion, but did not put half of this mixture aside. I followed the rest of the recipe but obviously didn’t stuff the peppers, then mixed all the ingredients together and baked in a casserole dish. My husband is such a boiled potato that he refuses to use a knife and fork to cut up a green pepper, so this is perfect for him. Once I lovingly grilled a beautiful striploin steak for him and he threw a fit. Why? Because it wasn’t cut into small edible pieces. His mouth is so big that I thought the whole steak would fit in his mouth in one bite and I said so, so he banished me to the attic for a month, locking me in and shoving some Velveeta Cheese under the door occasionally. There’s an old sink up there with a rusty spigot that sputters water so I did not die of dehydration. When he let me out, I promised to try harder. Tonight after this dinner of Chef John’s Stuffed Peppers, he declared me the best wifey in the land and let me watch sports with him, ON THE COUCH!!, (not the floor by his feet where he usually lets me sit if I have been good). When I asked who the athletes were wearing the blue and white outfits, he screamed “They’re uniforms!” and sent me packing up to the old attic again. It’s actually kinda nice up here. Nice and unhusbandy. When I was still downstairs I had the foresight to make an emergency food kit and stashed it up here so this time I have lots of good food. Big bonus is I don’t have to look at his boiled potato face with his parsnip nose."

"reviewBody": "The flavor was delicious with the addition of sausage but I knew from experience the recipe called for too much rice. I cut the rice in half and still had to pack filling into 8 huge bell pepper halves to use it all. I didn't have marinara sauce to I substituted a can of stewed tomatoes. Also my sausage was very spicy so I omitted the cayenne and red pepper flakes. I will make this again with my changes. Thanks Chef John Update: I made these last night for my daughter and son and grandchildren ( and they were delicious!) and was wondering why the sauce had to be cooked first when dish bakes for over an hour. In your video you don't precook sauce so next time I'll try it by just pouring sauce ingredients into baking dish and will update. Update: Yeah, I tried this again and IMO there is no need to cook the sauce before pouring over the peppers."

I take it a step further by making my own marinara with San Marzano tomatoes, and I make enough that I don't need to add the diced tomatoes (since the San Marzanos are whole peeled, I still have some small chunks). And instead of adding the beef broth, I simply add a package of Savory Choice beef broth concentrate and the balsamic right to the Marinara. For those who say they always have extra \"stuffing\", just mix that meat/rice mixture right in with the marinara on the bottom - bonus yumminess! Super easy recipe and wonderful flavors Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "It was okay. Don’t get me wrong- the peppers tasted good enough to eat, but I only gave 3 stars because of one: the time it took to prepare and cook (2 hours &amp; some change if you’re not quick in the kitchen like myself), and the second reason for my rating: the peppers came out quite spicy. I used red, yellow, &amp; orange bell peppers rather than green because I don’t care for green bell peppers, however I now see why this recipe calls for green ones. Green peppers would go much better with the spicy flavors in this recipe, but it still tastes great with other color peppers. I actually love spice, but these were a little much for me. I know the recipe calls for chili flakes, cayenne, &amp; spicy Italian sausage, but it didn’t call for an amount of each that I would think would cause them to be as spicy as they came out. There’s no warning letting you know the spice level and I think there definitely should be. If you’re not a fan of spice I would suggest either not using one of the spicy ingredients or swapping the spicy Italian sausage for mild and decreasing the amount of chili flakes &amp; cayenne the recipe calls for. Just my advice!"

I poured a third of the marinara mix onto the bottom of the pan and the remaining 2/3's over the top of the recipe before going into the oven. I also baked at 350 rather than the higher temp suggested, then turned up to 370 after removing lid for the last 15 minutes. Cook time was 50 minutes or so, but I prepared 1/2 recipe and like the peppers a bit more firm. Will definitely make again, but will decrease rice amount by 25% and increase meat by 25% (give or take)."

I may just switch to a tomato basil sauce. I'm also going to bake a rosemary bread to go along with it next time &amp; serve Asparagus roasted in a yummy lemon butter sauce on the side. Bon Appetit!"
