I added some Aleppo pepper for a tiny touch of heat and paprika (just for color as the masala didn't add much). I marinated it for roughly 3 hours and it didn't need more. We ate leftovers cut up in a simple salad (red leaf lettuce, homemade croutons, blue cheese) and it was delicious."

"reviewBody": "Really enjoyed this. The only thing missing was the reddish coloring I was expecting but still Delish. Couple modifications. I cut up a whole chicken. Changed our mind about dinner And marinaded for 48 hrs. Afraid yogurt sauce might make chicken mushy but all good! Also added olive oil which just seemed right. Increased all ingredients to compensate for 5lbs. \nGrilling bird w skin and bone can be a bit tricky. Especially when used to boneless skinless. Need to cook thru with out overcooking skin. Go med and occasionally cover lid but keep close eye. Also found useful to lower heat and keep bird on 2nd level to ensure internal cook temp without burning. Served w grilled zucchini and yellow saffron rice. Of course nan too\nEnjoy!\nPS really good following days cold or heated up in tortilla wrap with melted moz cheese lettuce and pesto which I learned on this site ! Almost enjoyed more !\nPS regular markets didn't have tandoori powder but Google world or Indian markets which should have"

This was good if you don't want to use too many ingredients/make your own masala blend, and if you don't want spiciness. The flavour is mild and not particularly complex, but still good. I marinated for probably 6 hours, and baked chicken quarters in the oven. Sprinkled chopped cilantro on top."

Bought the Tandoori masala powder from Amazon (I keep a wish list until I get enough for free shipping which helps). We did discover that plain yogurt in a marinade is just fine and we need not turn up our noses or our palates. So it was a good learning experience. Now if we can just find a really interesting use for the Tandoori Masala."

Pour over a cut-up skinless chicken, cover and place in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. Remove from marinade, bake 45 minutes uncovered at 325°, turning and basting every 15 minutes. If I cook this in my terra cotta CLAY roaster I bake it at 350 for 1 hour no basting.
