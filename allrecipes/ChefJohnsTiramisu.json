We doubled the recipe, made the mascarpone cheese, and it was created in my “STANGL” bowl &amp; it made 8 nice size servings. I also used my Bullet and powdered semi-sweet morsels for extra sweetness instead of cocoa powder. It was delicious! Thanks Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "Thank you! This recipe is so easy! I have friends who cannot tolerate alcohol at all, even if cooked out, so I omitted the marsala. Yikers... They did not know the difference, of course, but I did. \nSo I have a question; After the egg mixture is finished and ready to build the tiramisu with, can I add marsala, afterward? Will it curdle my cream mixure? I had some left over, and I would like to use it, but not as it is at the moment. Help! \n\nUPDATE:\n\nWell, I ended up making a second cream for the tiramisu, doubled the marsala in it and then slowly incorporated that cream to the first one that had marsala omitted. It came out wonderfully smooth! Thank you!"

Oh, and I also use white Port Wine instead of the Marsala (I'm portuguese, Port is more convenient for me, Marsala is difficult to find here in Portugal).\nBest regards,\nRosa"
