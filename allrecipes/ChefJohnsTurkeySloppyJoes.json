"reviewBody": "This has been in our regular rotation for a couple of years now, and the whole family enjoys it. I do have a couple of issues with the recipe, though. First, it calls for 1 1/4 lbs of ground turkey, which is challenging since it's usually sold in 1-lb packages. So I usually have to do some mental math to make the ratios come out right. My other issue is that final step of cooking it in water for another 20-30 minutes, because the meat gets fully cooked WAY before that point. I usually go for a much shorter cooking time."

A wonderful recipe I am sure we will make again and again."

Family went nuts for it. I served it over warm cornbread. I'll be making this again for sure. No doubt the longer simmer time would really add depth of flavor, but it was so easy this way I might just use this method again next time."

I made the recipe exactly as written and it was overpoweringly sweet. I managed to save it by adding a bunch of tomato paste and tomato sauce to my liking. I would recommend replacing at least half of the ketchup that's called for in this recipe to be replaced with tomato paste and/or tomato sauce."

"reviewBody": "This sloppy joe recipe is yummy and everyone that I have served it to, enjoyed it too, and requested the recipe. The only changes I made were: I chopped and sauted some of the little (red, orange, yellow) sweet peppers with the onions, and I added some garlic to the mixture also. I cut the suggested cayenne pepper amount in half, and I did not add additional black pepper. The toasted buns, and green onions and cheese were delicious suggestions and added to the scrumptiousness of the sandwich. A friend of mine requested (yellow) mustard for her sandwich, so that was put on the table as an additional option. Everyone like this tangy offering also, and followed suit. It added another dimension of flavor. Thanks Chef John!"

Why so skimpy on the Worcestershire? I added a little more. Turnec out kind of sweet but I liked it. A less sweet ketchup may help tamper the Sweet. Next time I'll use better and leaner ground turkey, too. Good recipe!"

I left out the green onions for the kids portion and sprinkled them on mine. I would suggest using close to the full 1 cups of water to get the sauce very thick. \n\nIt doesn't matter if you use brand name ketchup and you can definitely add some zing by adding mustard or a touch or BBQ sauce to the mix as well, but this is perfect as is."

I had to omit the green onions but will make sure I have them on hand for next time. I substituted gouda for the cheddar. I didn't have cocoa powder but did have unsweetened bakers chocolate so I used that. I also just used plain white bread. Only thing I would change on purpose is I will fully brown the turkey before adding other ingredients. I prefer a firmer bite. Don't be afraid to try it!"
