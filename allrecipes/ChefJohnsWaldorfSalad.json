"reviewBody": "This salad is delicious! I have never tried Waldorf salad before and this one has me wishing I’d have made this recipe years ago! I used pink honey crisp apples, green grapes, and subbed out pecans for walnuts. Everything comes together very well, lots of different textures. The celery root is a nice touch, it has a uniquely satisfying texture with a very very very faint taste of celery. Thanks for the recipe!"

I made creme fraiche from Chef John’s directions, which made a delicious dressing, even if I add raisins or use celery stalks, this dressing is a must!!!"

I only wished that I had chopped everything smaller because I used it to stuff a hollowed out papaya. I was trying to emulate a dish that I had on Qantas Airline in 1980 on my way to Australia. My husband said it was a 10 so I gave it 5 stars."

"reviewBody": "Good! I had pecans instead of walnuts and regular celery (used a ton of that). Yes, it made more dressing than needed in this one salad. \nPlated bit of cole slaw greens under the waldorf blend, added romaine around the edges, and sliced rotisserie chicken on top. Yum!! Family loved it although they were critical at first."

"reviewBody": "This is an absolutely delicious salad. I used Envy apples for the time of year and i was outstanding! The celery root is important for texture though it doesn't add much actual flavor. Be careful to not use all the dressing. You can even cut that recipe in half as I tossed about 2/3 of it. It's delicious but you definitely don't want to ruin this salad with too much dressing. The fruits stand alone. I will make this again."
