But I always make some tweaks, so here they are:\nSince I only have deep dish pie pans, I added a bit more fruit (1 cup), 4x the lemon juice (I like some tang with my sweet), a little less white sugar, double the cinnamon &amp; added a 1/8 tsp nutmeg, plus a tsp each of vanilla &amp; almond extract. Hoo boy... This is a winner!!"
