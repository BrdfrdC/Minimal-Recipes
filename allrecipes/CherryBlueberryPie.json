I think if it was doubled it might fill a 9in deep dish pie crust correctly, although doubling it may be what is required just to fill the normal 9in pie crust correctly. Thanks for sharing. It is great to have a filling that is perfect...not too runny and not too thick."

Still, if you're considering this, give it a go. METHOD: Aside from using my own pie crust, I followed the directions as written. I used Comstock cherry pie filling and a half good quality frozen blueberries and half fresh blueberries. WOULD I MAKE IT AGAIN? Yes, but will increase the amount of pie-filling as my taste buds begged for more punch. I will also use Morello Cherries in a jar from Trader Joe's. Perhaps with those minor changes, I'd give it a \"5\"."

To prevent the edges from burning I put foil around the edges for the full time I cook the pie. Also, do not put egg whites on the edges or the foil will stick to the crust and will completely pull off the edges when you remove the foil. It is perfect by 40 mins with no burning of edges. If you still find that your edges and pie are burning after using the foil turn your oven down to 400 degrees. I've used this recipe for years and always get fabulous reviews! Even cherry pie haters LOVE this pie and always ask for the recipe."

"reviewBody": "This recipe rocks!! I don't usually comment on recipes when I haven't cooked them, at least once, according to the directions. But after reading the recipe and the reviews, I knew this was a winner and would work with my new 'goal'. I've made myself a pledge to only purchase absolute necessities until I empty my pantry and freezer -- before I start putting up and preserving new things. Even though I had to finagle things, it came out soooo good!\nI used the pie filling and 3.5 cups of blueberries as well as a can of well drained, tart cherries. I added a splash of lemon and sugar/stevia blend. I pre-baked the bottom crust at 425 for 12 min. then let it cool. I only had about 2/3 of a top crust as I had previously invaded my stash. So I used cookie cutters to cut out rabbit and egg shapes to decorate my Easter dessert. I topped them with colored sugar. Since my pie was deep dish I got most of the filling in but I goofed and forgot to add the cornstarch . . .oh well. I froze the leftover filling to add to coffee cake.\nI shielded the crust and baked it at 425 for 10 minutes and then cut it down to 350 for the rest of the time.\nWas it a little runny? Yep- my fault. It was still delicious!\nNow, one question. Hopefully no one is using strips of foil to shield their crust? It's a lot easier to cut a foil circle 1 in. larger than the pan, fold it into quarters and cut out the center. You end up with a hoop shape that you just drop on and tuck under.\nTHANK YOU April!!"

"reviewBody": "I'm not a big fan of cherry pie, so I was hesitant to try this but it was very tasty and came out beautifully! However, I did not follow the recipe 100%. First off, I used fresh blueberries (if you have access to fresh blueberries, use them instead!) - also, I baked at 425 for 15 minutes, then 350 for the rest (35-45 minutes). Do NOT bake the pie at the high temperature for the entire time. Make sure to cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil to avoid burning (remove during last 10-15 minutes of baking), and place a cookie sheet under the pie for spillage (I used a normal 9\" pie dish and only a few droplets overflowed). The pie came out beautifully and was a total hit!"

"reviewBody": "There is a reason you don't see anything less than 5 stars on all the reviews -- this pie ROCKS! I'm not a huge fan of just blueberry pie or cherry pie, but together, this really was delicious. And I say \"was\" because the pie didn't make it through the morning. And it was just my daughter and me eating it!\n\nI followed everything as originally described with just a couple of embelishments, as others suggested. First, I chilled fresh blueberries in the freezer for about an hour. This supposedly holds in the blueberry flavor more so than fresh, mushy blueberries. I also made it 2 cups instead of 1 1/2. Second, I used the cherry pie filling as described, but I added about 3/4 cub of fresh, chilled, pitted cherries to the mix. I had them, why not use them? Third, I used the pre-made rolled pie crusts. That was for me very easy and doable. Lastly, I did let the pie cool for exactly two hours, but I think a little less time is fine; it was barely lukewarm by then.\n\nAll-in-all, a great, EASY recipe. I'll be making this again for sure. And I loved the fresh cherries. That had a deeper, less tart flavor than the canned cherries."

In fact, besides my apple pie this is the best pie I've made to date. Thank you for sharing this recipe."
