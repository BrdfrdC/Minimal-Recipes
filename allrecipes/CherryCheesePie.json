If you don't add the gelatin then what is going to get this filling to firm up besides the cream cheese being refrigerated while cooling?"

I do use the lowfat cream cheese, and the fat free sweetened condensed milk to make it a little lower in calories, and it does not sacrifice anything of the taste. Some reviewers mentioned that their pie was \"soupy\". I have never had that problem. Be sure to use \"Sweetened Condensed Milk\" NOT evaporated milk. There is a big difference. When I take this anywhere, the dish is always emptied."

"reviewBody": "Setting Issue***KNOX GELATIN...will correct problem. I've done this for years. Into your 1/3 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice, mix in 2 tsp. of Knox (unflavored) Gelatin. Note**Strain your juice or break the pulp. Let stand 1 minute before incorporating into cheese/milk mixture. No need to reduce lemon juice (if you think to much liquid) nor add more cream cheese. For me--adding more cheese cuts into the other flavors. If you reduce your lemon juice to half...use maybe 1/2 - 1 tsp of Knox. Either way let stand 1 minute before use. It will thicken (swell) but don't worry--use it. I prefer sweetened strawberries or frozen cherries mixed with sugar. I don't use cherry filling anymore. Never really cared for it but when I did use it, I believed it aided in filling not setting like I would have liked. I also think that 'cherry goo' is too heavy (weight) &amp; wet for a cream pie. For this reason I thought it made for a poor 'potluck' pie because after cutting it started looking unappetizing later. Mine was never 'runny' or 'soupy' but I always thought it could be bit firmer without sacrificing taste &amp; texture. The recipe is good. Always has been but Knox WILL give a firm, CREAMY, clean slice of pie. TRUST me. As long as you don't use too much, it will not be 'gelatinous' in texture but creamy. Yes, I know it's pretty with the topping covering pie but try spooning over individual slices instead. This will prevent a 'sagging' pie. Firmer, better looking...tasty. Now it's a potluck pie."

When I first started making the pie it would sometimes be SOUPY, so here is the SOLUTION that has always worked well for me to make it set. USE 1 1/2 BRICKS OF CREAM CHEESE! It taste wonderful, and sets beautifully. We won't be sorry if you follow my advise. Also, with 1 1/2 bricks of cream cheese it's just so yummy!"

However, out of my kids and siblings, and parents and family, the only person who really loved it was my dad. Everyone else said it was way too rich, including me. I don't think i'd make it again unfortunately, I think it's worth it to make the usual baked cheesecake even if it's more work. Thanks for sharing the recipe anyway.;).../update/ the next day, more family came over and tasted it. They thought it was one of the best, saying it was so \"light tasting\"!

"reviewBody": "Great recipe to make on hot days when you don't want to use the oven. Best to beat the cream cheese and condensed milk for a few minutes (3-5 minutes) to ensure creaminess. Also beat 3-5 minutes after adding lemon and vanilla. Top with favorite fruit topping or serve plain."

"reviewBody": "Delicious! Perfect for summer bbqs! I followed the recipe ingredients exactly, but \"toasted\" the graham cracker crust slightly in the oven (5 minutes or so @ 350ish) to give the crust a little more stiffness so it doesn't soften as easily when the filling is added and sits overnight. I also have no issues with it chilling for only 3 hours. The texture is supposed to be creamy and smooth... not firm. The pie may fall apart when cutting it, but that's to be expected from a pie like this. I highly recommend topping it with fresh sliced strawberries... that's our favorite and looks gorgeous too!"

"reviewBody": "I'm giving it a 4 star because it is easy and after 36 hours, it did have a nice, firm, creamy, consistency... a bit too much lemon flavoring for me, the batter was still very loose and puddding-like, even after 18 hours of refrigeration...good thing I had made this 2 days before it was eaten. This is the exact same recipe as a few others on this site..(cherry cheese pie, for one), and I had read a review for one of them that suggested decreasing the lemon and increasing the cream cheese. If I ever make this recipe again, that's what I'll do..4 oz more cream cheese, and use only 1/4 cup of lemon juice."

I use one can of cherry pie filling for two pies and it is plenty. Leave about an inch wide strip around the outer edge of pie uncoverd with the cherries and it makes a very pretty presentation."
