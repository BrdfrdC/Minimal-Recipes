I also add toasted, sliced almonds to the graham cracker crust before adding the CoolWhip/cream cheese mixture. I usually use a can of cherries to which I have added almond extract. Quick, easy and light. A family favorite."

We each got two pounds of fresh cherries last week and I had her make two of these pies. Of course, we always sample. One bite and we exchanged a look that said, \"Decadent nirvana!\" You should have seen her face when I handed her the second pie to take home for dessert. This is a winner and so easy! And she's making two more and wowing her family with her new-found \"cooking\" skills. I only made one tiny change. Our cherries were monster sour so I added some sweetener to those. And remembered just in time, to check for seeds and stems! Thank you for this elegant recipe!"

I had saved this recipe a long time ago so after reading the good reviews, I decided to try it and I'm so glad I did! Delicious and easy and my company loved it. I made it exactly as the recipe reads. I used 12 individual tarts in place of the 9-inch pie and used cherry topping. Very pretty and very scrumptious! Next time I may cut back Cool Whip to 10 to 12 oz. not 16 as it does overpower cream cheese. May try confectionary sugar, as suggested in other review, in place of regular sugar. Will make again.....even in January!"

The best part is you can always have the ingredients on hand. If you don't have two hours to cool it completely, an hour (or even a week lol) in the freeze works too."

I ended up having about 1 cup of cheese filling that didn't fit into the pan, but it was so tasty that I have no doubt we'll eat it! The lightness of this pie with the crunchiness of a homemade crust was the perfect dessert! I will definitely make again and with different pie fillings."

For low carbers, just make a Atkins nut crust and use Splenda instead of sugar and a sugar free or light cherry pie filling. For people watching their sugars/weight, it's just as good using reduced fat cream cheese, light or \"free\" whipped topping and light cherry pie filling. I've had it many ways and it's really good every single time."

However, as written, it seems to lack a bit of flavour to me. I am not sure that the cherries on top really even had much flavour. I think the basic recipe is good though, and I will make my own version of it one of these days using fresh whole ingredients (real whipping cream, fresh fruit, etc). The basic idea of this recipe is good ~ very refreshing."

I also added about a tsp of vanilla and almond extract to the cherries before putting them on the pie. I highly recommend the almond extract, it adds a wonderful flavor and an extra layer of flavor. I also used the French Vanilla whipped topping. Delicious, thanks for a wonderful recipe!"

"reviewBody": "The best I've tried of its type. True, it's not exactly what you could call a cheesecake, so \"Cheese Pie\" is appropriate. This recipe sets up much more predictably than the one made with sweetened, condensed milk and lemon juice. The texture is light and creamy when served cold - tends to get a little loose as it comes closer to room temperature. As a consequence, it may be frozen, and when allowed to thaw for a few minutes, can be cut and served that way. To give the cheese layer a little more interest, I added about 1/4 tsp lemon extract, plus a dash each of maple and almond extracts. These complemented the cherries perfectly. A+ for a simple recipe that tastes luscious and takes only minutes to throw together."
