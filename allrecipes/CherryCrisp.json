My husband has a birthday today and I wanted to make some thing for him. I scrounged around in my dad‘s kitchen and could not locate the ingredients necessary for a birthday cake. Therefore I made him, a cherry crisp! I dearly love this recipe."

I reduced the nutmeg to 1/8 tsp based on other reviews and also reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. The toasted pecans on top really made it so I'm glad I used them. I also used cold butter cut into the topping instead of melted margarine. This made a nice crispy topping. Very easy and very yummy!"

Made extra topping after reading other reviews but only used proportions in the recipe-it was enough for this size pan. Used half melted/half cubed butter in food processor-couple of pulses. Guess I’ll have to make it again to use the leftover topping! It’s a keeper-easy and delicious. I like that it doesn’t make a ton, so sneaky Pete, AKA my husband , won’t keep picking at it for days."

I wanted to use fresh sweet cherries instead of canned pie filling, and I wanted to cut some of the fat, so here's what I did, and it worked perfectly. 1) Pit and halve fresh sweet cherries until you have 3 cups. 2) Add 1 1/2 T cornstarch, 1/2 t vanilla extract, 1/4 t almond extract, and 1/4 cup sugar to the cherries and stir. 3) Follow the rest of the recipe as written, except drizzle 1/4 cup melted butter over the crisp part instead of 1/2 cup."

I only had half a can of cherry pie filling so I cut up and tossed in a handful of fresh strawberries, topped that with sprinkling of white chocolate chips and I only had almonds on hand instead of pecans. Oh yeah I reduced the nutmeg and cinnamon to 1/2 tsp each."

I added a bit of organic sugar &amp; cooked them until the sauce was thickened. I used all organic ingredients &amp; cut the sugar by 1/3. \nI used walnuts &amp; added twice as many. I also increased the cinnamon &amp; nutmeg. \nFabulous!"

Mixed those with 2 cans of cherry pie filling. Subbed almonds for pecans because I had them on hand. Doubled the topping and used cold butter instead of melted. Everyone who tried it in the tasting room gave it 2 thumbs up so will be making a lot of it in the future for a party! Adding ice cream or whipped cream helps to balance it out in a good way!"

I loved my addition and substitution! One thing I would change for future use would be to decrease the amount of margarine (I used butter) called for as it made it a bit too wet for the topping. It’s pretty heavily spiced tasting even though it didn’t seem to use much spice. That might have been due to my quality of cinammon I used."

Served with ice cream the night I made it, it was the perfect size for me husband and me, with a little leftover for a midnight snack! Next time, I may toast the topping (similar to what I do with bread crumbs to give them a little extra crunch), but the recipe really is fantastic as-is!"

One with just the cherries and one with the cherries and some frozen blueberries that I had mixed up with a bit of sugar. I added a little of the blueberry mixture to the canned cherries just for a slight change of flavor (hubby loves bluberries). Both were wonderful. Took the original one to my card playing group and have members clamoring for the recipe. Thanks for this one. Will be making it again."
