"reviewBody": "I had a surplus of t hese cherry peppers in the yard and never grew them before and found this recipe. Had 40 people over the house for a Sunday brunch and at the last minute (night before) we decided to use a few dozen cherry peppers and marinated them overnight. \n\nA few changes I made: 1st I added some herbs to the oil and I always use a TOP QUALITY EVOO (that's key as the oil becomes more of a sauce/flavor). I added marjoram, basil, thyme, etc. \n\nThen the next morning I took them out of the jars and placed them into casserole pan and broiled them until the cheese and tops got slightly charred.. The first guest asked me \"what are these\" I told him \"Italian Cherry Poppers...like jalapeno popper but different pepper and stuffing\" \n10 minutes later about 30 peppers were all gone! We didn't think anyone would eat them! But they are MUCH BETTER broiled 10 minutes ... i'm not a fan of straight out of the jar as much"

So I skipped the soaking part, placed them on a cookie sheet, drizzled them with the olive oil and sprinkled them with basil and thyme and broiled them just till cheese is melted and skin starts to brown!

No salt or olive oil or very little. You can dash a bit of Italian dressing on each if you would like. Can be served warm, at room temp or cold. ENJOY!!!"

I would suggest purchasing at least 18 medium sized peppers and have about 2 1/2 cups of oil for this recipe or use less Prosciutto and Provolone. I used regular olive oil instead of extra virgin olive oil because I prefer the milder taste. When refrigerating, the oil may get cloudy but comes back to normal at room temperature."

Much cheaper to make them yourself than to purchase the premaid poppers at the store (in the jarred pepper isle). They go for $6 for 6 peppers. Delicios...so glad to see a recipe out there for these popper!!!"
