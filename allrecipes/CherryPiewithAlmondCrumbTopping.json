I followed the recipe except for using frozen cherries instead of fresh. It did not occur to me until I was cutting it that I should have increased the cornstarch because of the moisture in the frozen cherries. Therefore, our pieces were not beautiful but they were delicious! I will make this again and again. Thank you, Chef John!"

First it was a crisp contest so I omited the crust. Due to no crust I baked it for 55 min, or until the topping was golden. I added a tablespoon of dark cocoa powder to the filling, and used 1.5 teaspoons almond extract in the filling. Then I sprinkled 1 big tablespoon of mini chocolate chips on it right out of the oven. The judge said that while she prefers tart crisps without anything but cherry flavor mine was just that good to get 1st anyway. 2nd, and 3rd were both tart and were delicious. This recipe has the perfect amounts of flour, oats, almonds, and butter and if you are new to crisps or pies you should watch the video."

"reviewBody": "This was perfect exactly as written. Taste your cherries and add more/less depending on their sweetness or preference. The almond topping was key....delicious. Don't 'pack' it on the pie though, as it will turn into a 'harder' crust than desired. This recipe lets the cherries be showcased without a lot of cinnamon or almond flavoring etc. upstaging them."

I followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed with the crumb topping. \nIt was more salty and less sweet than I would have liked. If I were to make this again, I would decrease some of the salt in the topping and add more sugar to both the pie filling and the topping as well. I'd also give a more precise measurement for the lemon juice and only use 1 tbsp."

"reviewBody": "This is a very easy and delicious recipe to make. Perfect during the summer when ripe cherries are on sale! The almond crumble is crunchy and is the perfect complement to the soft cherries. I learned a tip from a French baker: if you want to add less sugar to a recipe you can reduce it by 30g without drastically changing the flavor. That's what I did and it was the perfect amount of sweetness since my cherries were already naturally sweet."

I also added 1/4t of Garam Masala (an Indian spice mixture of coriander seed, black pepper, cumin, cardamom and cinnamon) to the filling for some added spice. Yummy with ice cream or milk!"
