It's super easy and I use gluten free pretzels which are surprisingly good (i eat every thing but i make it GF for family members) I also use fresh strawberries and blue berries on top instead of the pie filling. Oh and I also make it in cupcake form so much less mess when eating especially if you're making it for an event!"

The only change I will make in the future is use ginger snap cookies instead of the pretzels as the crust since it was for a Christmas Dinner Party. Again there was some leftover and my guest took home the desert since it was so good."

"reviewBody": "I am the author of this recipe. FYI, I usually use a little more than one can of pie filling, so I suggest buying two cans. My husband likes it with blueberries and I like strawberries, so often I make half with blueberries and half with strawberries. Also, make sure the crust is cooled completely, otherwise the filling will kind of \"melt\". There weren't any recipes anything like this on the site when I first submitted it, I see a couple now. Funny thing is, I submitted it in 2008 (yes, 2008!) and it JUST got published now in January 2015. So technically, mine was first, lol ;) Hope you enjoy!"
