"reviewBody": "I always have an over abundance of cherry tomatoes every year. I've made this twice lately and silly me, didn't read the reviews the first time. At that time I added two more tablespoons of red wine vinegar because I agree it was too oily. \nThis second time I made it I changed it up. Instead of olives (my husband doesn't care for them) I added chunks of red onion. I also used fresh oregano (2 large sprigs, no stem), chunks of red bell peppers (another over abundance!) and small broccoli florets. The broccoli was THE perfect veg to soak up all that extra dressing this makes! I also added more pine nuts than called for because I really liked how they tasted in this. \nNext time I plan to add leftover quinoa or orzo instead of pine nuts since they are so darn costly."

I have a love/hate relationship with this website. Love the recipes....not so much the newly revised website.\nEnough complaining - here are my changes:\n*I used salted sunflower seeds instead of pine nuts - cheaper and easier - no toasting necessary. May go with unsalted next time as there is plenty of salt in the olives. I did not add additonal salt either, and used Herbes de Provence.\n*I also added cooked bow tie pasta to create a more filing meal. Will consider adding chicken at some point as well. Will likely add cucumber and/or parboiled asparagus.\n*Used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar just because I prefer the taste and used just a small amount of olive oil.\nThat was pretty much all of the changes so far - really love this recipe and will make again and again."

Since I only prepared this recipe for 2, I used a lot less ingredients than called however I think next time I would add a little extra oregano to boost the flavor. I could not get regular black olives so I used what was available. In this case, it was the nicoise variety that I used and honestly this was so good! It reminded me of tapenade. My husband did not eat the olives so I ended up getting a piece of french bread and dipping it in the sauce and pouring the olives over the bread...YUM! Will make this again even if it is only for myself!!!"

"reviewBody": "This is just unusual enough that I thought we'd love it, my husband liked it, but I can't say I did. I re-named it \"olive salsa\" after tasing it :-) Hard to think of this as a salad. I did mix the dressing well and reduce the amount of it which helped (great advice). Really really salty (all those olives!) and the pine nuts were pretty much lost. I get pine nuts at Sam's club in a big bag for a great price, so I didn't mind that very much, but if you are paying full price at the grocery store I wouldn't waste them in this recipe - instead toast them and serve them separately or sprinkled on top right before serving so you will get the great full pignoli flavor. Tought this was a good way to use the many cherry tomatoes I'm harvesting now (winter season in Florida is in full swing) but I'll keep looking for a healthier way to use them."

I left out the sugar - don't like \"sweet\" in salads - and I used fresh oregano because I have it in my garden. I took the easy way out with toasting the pine nuts by doing it in the microwave on a paper plate. It was refreshing to have an unboring tomato salad for something a little different."

I did reduce the amount of oil to 1/4 cup as others recommended and even without the green onions this salad is very good after only a couple of hours of marinating. I then added 2 cloves of minced garlic, about 1/3 cup of crumbled feta cheese and a talespoon of minced fresh basil, as some other reviewers said they had. OMG! I'll definitely be making this often. Thank you Keren! Can hardly wait for dinner."

"reviewBody": "Yes, it's salty but you can't stop eating it! I didn't have cherry tomatoes so used about six regular ones that I diced, which may have accounted for the salad becoming very wet. I also used Newman's Own Lite Balsamic vinegar instead of the oil, etc., and just a tablespoon or so will do so don't start pouring it on. This would be great with chopped lettuce as a chop-chop salad or with a nice piece of crusty bread. I made the bleu cheese burger recipe and served this as a side dish. If I would have thought ahead and drained it a bit more I would have used it as the condiment for the burgers. Will definitely make again (boyfriend loved it!)."
