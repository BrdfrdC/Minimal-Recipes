I followed some of the advice here (used half the salt, chilled the dough for about ten minutes in the fridge, and upped the cooking time to about 14 minutes). I used Ghiradelli milk chocolate chips because I prefer them over the bittersweet chocolate and I left out the nuts. I also used old fashioned organic oats. They were not \"quick oats\" but they were all I had on hand and they worked out just fine (maybe that's why my cookies needed more time?). All in all a good recipe and I'll definitely make them again."

Even after chilling the dough for 6 hours, the \"cookies\" turned into puddles once in the oven. I suspect one of the causes may be the recipe's call for baking soda rather than baking powder and perhaps insufficient flour."

I used a 2 tablespoon cookie scooper and I let them sit on the cooking sheet for 5 minutes, then transferred them to a cooling rack.

MAKE THEM INTO BARS! Put the entire batch into a parchment-lined baking pan or sheet (depending how thick or thin you want them) and smooth them out (spray your hands or instrument with PAM because the batter is sticky!), bake at the same temperature for about 30 minutes, and voila, delicious oatmeal chocolate chip bars! They’re a LOT better than trying to just make the cookies, which spread into a weird pancake."

I had to form cookie \"meatballs\", trying to get the ingredients to stick together and even then, they were crumbling before even going into the oven- what could I be doing wrong???

But amazingly, they were awesome! We rolled them into 1.5 inch balls and put them in the fridge for a bit. They baked perfectly, though we ended up adding 2 minutes based on results. We also put in half as much salt (on purpose :-), added a touch of cinnamon (maybe 1.8 teaspoon), and put a pinch of kosher salt on top before baking. So we'd highly recommend these either with all the butter or the low-fat version, which is what we're going to use from now on."
