I kept the ingredients the same except to add 1/2 cup of dry roasted peanuts. I added all the dry ingredients to my stand mixer and mixed. Then I added all of the wet ingredients and mixed just until combined. I baked at 350 for about 32 minutes and they came out with the chewy brownie-like texture that I prefer. They were a hit, so I consider this a keeper!"

"reviewBody": "This came out really great, on the chewy part as well. This is considering I accidently left out 1/4 cup of the white sugar. Still incredibly sweet and delicious, made some whipped cream for it as well. Ended up taking it out at 20 minutes instead of 30, the top had browned considerably, it did spring back like the recipe described, and the butter knife came out clean. Let it cool for about 1 hour 10 minutes, mostly because I forgot about it. Discovered it was cooked perfectly fine, bottom browned, no undercooked bits. I also sprinkled some dark chocolate bits on the top before I put it in. I'll be honest and say they aren't as dense as the classic chocolate brownies, or as chewy. But they're still definitely a brownie, worth a try as all the ingredients are very easy to come across. \nInstead of just greasing the bottom, I greased it and then put some parchment paper down into it, then greased the paper as well, just so it absolutely wouldn't stick, and so it'd come out of the pan. I used a 9 by 9 square metal baking pan for this."

"reviewBody": "Here are the changes I made that resulted in PERFECT brownies:\n3/4 c pb\n5 T butter\n1/3 c granulated sugar\n1/2 c packed brown sugar plus 1/3 c \"loosely\" packed\n1 egg plus 1 yolk both at room temp \n1/2 t vanilla\n3/4 c flour\n1/2 t baking powder\npinch salt\nI also added a cup of peanut butter chips.\nI mixed everything by hand to avoid over mixing. I greased an 8 x 8 pan and then lined it with parchment paper.\nI baked them at 350 for 25 minutes but went 2 minutes longer. Watch closely. They firm up as they cool.\nThese were delicious! I'm extremely fussy with my brownies and while I've changed the amounts from the original the bones of the original are there and it's a great base recipe.\n No topping is needed but for this first time I melted a cup of pb and chocolate chips.\nNext time I'm leaving them bare. They are so good. I may try them with chocolate chips vs peanut butter chips just for fun."

Make the recipe, folks, stop with all your tweaks and substitutions! The recipe is perfect as it is!"

Sometimes, however, for some reason they just don't bake through and I'm forced to over-bake them in order to get the inside fully cooked. Not sure why this happens sometimes. It could be my mistake, but for the most part, I love this recipe."

"reviewBody": "I made this with 1 C of peanut butter and it turned out well. It's not chewy in the slightest, it's quite light/airy/cakey for a brownie recipe. Still tastes good. Good way to use up peanut butter. \n\n--- EDIT --- It is now the day after I made this recipe, and it has now become chewy with a dense brownie-like texture. I take back what I said in my original review. So my tip is: WAIT 24 hours to eat this because it magically changes and becomes better overnight."

After stirring everything together, I used an electric handheld mixer for about 20 seconds to make sure the ingredients were well incorporated. The batter was creamy &amp; spread easily into the 9x13 glass dish. I baked for 30 minutes &amp; the center was still very jiggly. I laid aluminum foil over dish to prevent over- browning &amp; had to bake for 10-15 more minutes (just keep checking for a non- jiggly center- then they're done) I waited 15 minutes for them to cool some &amp; then frosted with a simple chocolate frosting: 1/2 stick melted butter, 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 cup sifted confectioners sugar, 1/8- 1/4 cup milk, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract (mix with electric hand mixer until smooth). \nThey were chewy and absolutely delicious. Huge hit with my dinner party!"
