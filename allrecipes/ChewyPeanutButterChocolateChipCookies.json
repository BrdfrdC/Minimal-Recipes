Properly chewy and flat like you get in the shops. I did add eggs to the second half and they came out cake like. So maybe add half or less of eggs for the best result? My no-eggs batch fell apart a tiny bit. That might be due to under cooking or the lack of eggs. Either way, the flavour was fabulous."

"reviewBody": "I was looking for a lower Peanut Butter ratio recipe as I had a bag of mixed chips. I never have corn syrup so I used brown rice syrup and that seemed fine. I also cut 1/2 cup flour and added 1/3 c cocoa powder and 1/3 c ground flax seed. Due to the PB content, I gave them the slightest fork smash. I did find them a little more baked so lowered temp and time a smidge as I prefer softer. Added a slice of bread to bin with crispier cookies because I won't waste cookies! I will probably add more vanilla and salt next time."

"reviewBody": "These cookies are kind of light and puffy, not extremely chewy but I also wouldn't call them dry like some reviewers. They went over very well with company. The peanut butter (I used Peanut Butter and Co.'s Smooth Operator) is pretty subtle and I understand why some opted to increase the amount, but you can still taste it with the 1/2 cup. I used Trader Joe's semisweet chocolate bars, and only one cup, as two seemed unnecessary to me (though if you're huge on chocolate, go for it). I also think it is wise to slightly grease the baking sheets, as the cookies did stick just a bit."

I taste tested the first couple of batches and then tossed the dough. It was a total waste of time, energy, and groceries. They were so bad that after years of using this site, I had to write my first review to warn off any fellow peanut butter cookie fans. This is not the way."

They had a perfect crunch on the outside and wonderful softness on the inside. 12 minutes was the perfect baking time in my oven. My husband thought the ratio of chocolate to peanut butter was perfect. I will keep this recipe in the rotation."

"reviewBody": "I was worried I had over baked my cookies due to the deep golden color, but they are chewy just as the title promised! I really love recipes that you can make and bake right away and I imagine the inclusion of corn syrup is what brings the chewiness to this recipe! I ended up using my 1\" cookie scoop instead of a quarter cup and cut the baking time to 10 minutes, but if I made them again I would try only 8 minutes to add a bit more of that ooey gooey quality. I cut the recipe in half and it required two cookie sheets. I added flaky salt to the tops of the second sheet of cookies before baking and I think that helps bring out the peanut butter salty-sweet flavor more so would recommend that as well!"

Next time, milk choc chips and maybe some p.b. chips to enhance the flavor. 1/4 cup measure makes a Goliath cookie! For the second batch, I measured with a heaping soup spoon of dough. Yield 19 normal cookies. 1/4 c. Measure yielded 8 giant cookies. Baked big ones 13 min., smaller ones 8 min. They are good but for my taste, I'd definitely make the changes above. Thanks."

The cookies turned out amazing and they disappeared in no time! For reference, I made them into smaller dollops (about 1 tbsp) and baked for 9 min. So chewy!"

"reviewBody": "I was a worried these might be too cake-like and soft, as I do not usually like cake-y cookies, but peanut butter cookies are also hit or miss for me in general. I did the quarter cup peanut butter addition and quarter cup less flour, but I also added about a quarter cup of PB2 (powdered peanut butter) to the flour mixture and then refrigerated the dough balls overnight because it was hot and I didn't want to turn the oven on. I did not flatten them before baking and they made very pretty crinkle topped cookies with a texture more reminiscent of the inside of a peanut butter cup than cake. I like big flavors and the extra peanut butter really worked well. Next time I might use mini chips to see if I can get better distribution. Suggested pairing: dry stout (like Guiness) or 2% milk."

I generally make this recipe almost exactly as written, the only changes being sometimes I use crunchy PB instead of smooth, and sometimes I use about 1 1/3 cup semisweet and 2/3c Reese Peanut butter baking chips. SO GOOD."

I've made them several times since then, and they're my mother's absolute favorite cookie now. My one note though is that I find I yield better results with 2 3/4 cups of flour, or to just keep adding it until the dough only sticks to itself. The one time I made it with 2 1/2 the dough flattened in the oven too much and never fully baked through. Overall really good albeit incredibly unhealthy."

Also I generally always use half butter and half shortening in recipes, especially cookies. A lesson my cousin taught me many moons ago and always makes a nice cookie."
