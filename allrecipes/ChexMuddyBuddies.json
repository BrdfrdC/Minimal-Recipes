Add more butter to thin it out a bit. better coverage."

Also keeps the mix less messy with the chocolate. If you don't have a large ziploc bag on hand, a couple clean plastic grocery bags work too, just make sure to double them up and tie well! If the mix looks to chocolatey after the first toss in the sugar, add more and repeat the process."

Will definitely be a making again! I had no problems using the microwave method- ran microwave in 30 second intervals and attempted to stir after each time until melted."

I also used a big bowl and spoon when I stirred in the powdered sugar and it didn't clump. However, who doesn't celebrate those lucky clumps when eating it, am I right?!! Easy and delicious! Only thing I would do next is maybe add a small amount of sea salt to make it pop, since I used unsalted butter."

"reviewBody": "Contrary to the negative review, if you stir the chocolate/peanut butter mixture for about 30 seconds in between each 30 second microwaving, you will have NO problems with clumps. I also found that gently stirring in the powdered sugar makes it easier to get all of the pieces coated. Good luck!"

I like to add more chocolate though, and honestly, sometimes you need to add some more powdered sugar. I prefer putting the sugar and chocolate-coated cereal into a Tupperware container instead of a bag and then just tossing it around in there to get it coated. This recipe is fool-proof. Anybody can make this! It's so good it barely lasts a day at my house."

"reviewBody": "I made this for th first time about a few weeks ago and it turned out okay. I didn't use the microwave method though. Instead I just used a pan to melt the butter, chocolate and peanut butter. As long as you have it on medium heat and you watch it carefully as you stir it all together it works way better than the microwave method. You won't have to worry about any clumps of chocolate or peanut butter. The only thing I changed was that I used 2 boxes of Chex cereal and used 9 cups, but used the extra cereal to mix in once I had coated the chocolate ones with powdered sugar. It helps off set the sweetness of the powdered ones. I guess that's just my preference since I found it to be a lil bit too sweet for my likely. Having it mixed together you get a handful of plain cereal along with the muddy ones and it works out perfectly."

"reviewBody": "As written, this recipe wasn't coated enough. Not enough peanut butter, too much cereal. I tried this using 6 cups cereal &amp; the original half cup pb, and this worked out much better. Not sure if this was a typo or what. Also make sure your chocolate mixture is melted thoroughly! You want it runny. I had to keep reheating my chocolate bc it wasn't melting. I used Nestle Toll House semi sweet morsels. May try milk choc morsels next time maybe by a diff brand. This made a lot even using 6 C of cereal. May try using some butterscotch chips next time."

"reviewBody": "This is one of my family's favorite holiday treats! A few tips: 1. Measure out your Chex cereal in level cups. If you mound the cereal when measuring, you will have much more than 9 cups and will not have enough chocolate mixture to completely cover every piece. 2. Use the full amount of peanut butter and butter. You need the oils in them to get the chocolate mixture to the right consistency for coating the cereal. 3. Stir, stir, stir, stir your chocolate mixture longer than you think you need to after the first minute of microwaving. The absorbed heat from a glass or ceramic bowl will often completely melt the chocolate chips to a smooth consistency without needing to microwave it again. Overheating in the microwave can cause the chocolate mixture to become chunky or even burnt. 4. Remember to add the vanilla! 5. Simply add 1/4 cup more powdered sugar if 1 1/2 cups is not enough. Enjoy!"

"reviewBody": "I've made puppy chow (or muddy buddies) many times. By far, this is the worst recipe I've ever used. Let me explain why.\n\nI do not recommend the \"microwave method\". The chocolate comes out more chunky, where it needs to be smoother for better coverage. The best way to melt your peanut butter/chocolate mixture is to use a double boiler. If you don't have one, you can make one by filling a medium sized saucepan about halfway with water and placing a small saucepan into it with your pb/choc/butter. Turn the heat on low and stir continuously. The chocolate turns out perfect every time but be sure not to get water in your chocolate... it's very hard to fix although it can be done (yes, I've done this one time.. oops!).\n\nSecondly, because I used the \"microwave method\" there was NOT enough chocolate mixture to coat the cereal completely (I definitely have chocolate standards). I made up more, finishing my bag of chocolate chips, still not satisfied. I cannot recall if I used this exact recipe with a home made double boiler... I will definitely try again but never use the microwave again. \n\nI always make more chocolate mixture than the recipe calls for, it's worth it. I always say find a recipe and eyeball it.\n\nEven with an excess amount of powdered sugar (I don't measure this either, I dump about a half a bag into a doubled up paper bag and shake it like a Polaroid picture. If it's not fully coated, I add more. Also, I move them around by hand so I don't get \"clumps\" of cereal.) I"

My aunt use to make these for me when I was at her house; she would use a brown bag to mix everything together, but I don't use that method. I'll just put the mixture and chex into a large bow, and using a spatula mix it. It may be slightly more ark work, but this way you don't have to go and find a brown bag lol. The recipe itself is very reliable. After making this recipe for like a million times, you can just estimate how much of each you need for each ingredient. My friends think that it tastes better when you fully coat the muddy buddies so that you dont see the insides of the Chex. I hope you find the same results that I got cause once you make it, you won't stop!"
