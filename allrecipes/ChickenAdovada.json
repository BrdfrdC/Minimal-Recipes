"reviewBody": "This is a new favorite. So delicious and authentic tasting. I did tweak it a little bit based on what we had at home. I used ancho and guajillo chiles. I used 4T tamarind paste and 4 drops of monkfruit extract instead of the vinegar, orange juice and dates. (It makes a similar flavor combo.) And I added more onions, and also mushrooms. Then we chopped up the chicken and used it in burritos with the sauce and veggies. It was amazing! Better than at most restaurants."
