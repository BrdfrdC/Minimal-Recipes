These ingredients do make a lot, but I think it would serve 8 better than 10. I paired it with macaroni salad, and toasted Italian bread! Yummy! I will make this again."

Used sliced almonds as I didn't have walnuts, and threw in sliced orange pepper and a half a red apple coarsely chopped. Threw the bacon and the chicken still warm into the salad and ate it immediately. Will definitely be saving this recipe for future use."
