"reviewBody": "This came out really good. I added some italian seasoning and pepper to help boost the flavor. The instant rice I bought came in 1 cup bags, and the final result was still slightly saucy without being runny; so I would recommend not doing 1.5 cups. You do have to mash up the tomatoes in to smaller chunks while it's cooking so they're not too big. The only other thing I did differently was use red pepper flakes instead of cayenne powder, but I think they are the same thing just in different forms. You can buy brown instant rice to make the recipe slightly healthier but it's not a particularly unhealthy recipe anyways!"

"reviewBody": "This turned out really good! And came together fairly quickly. Easily doable as a weeknight dish. I used 1.5 tsp salt, which to me was the perfect amount. I used barley in place of rice as it is better for your heart and blood sugar. Next time I will double the basil and cayenne, and add 1 tsp oregano also. I broke up the tomatoes with my wooden spatula as everything was cooking, so next time I may just buy sliced stewed tomatoes instead of whole to save myself that step. Will be making again!"

"reviewBody": "What an easy and delicious recipe! 5 stars for simplicity alone! I actually used some leftover brown rice in place of the insta-rice to make it even easier (just threw the already-cooked brown rice in at the end to heat up, and let it sit for 5 minutes like the recipe says). I liked the flavor too--pretty straightforward, but good. I could see adding a bit of wine to deglaze the pan after cooking the chicken, onion, and garlic for a touch more flavor if you felt so inclined (I will do this next time--and there will be a next time for this recipe!!). I might add some oregano too. Also, I simply salted to taste for this recipe, and I think we used approx 1 tsp. 2 tsps would have been too salty for our tastes--so I would definitely watch the salt. Served this topped with some freshly grated Parmesan and a side of roasted broccoli. Perfect easy dinner! Thank you so much for the recipe!"
