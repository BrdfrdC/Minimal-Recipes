"reviewBody": "This chicken cheese ball gets rave reviews from all my family! I make it every Thanksgiving and New Year's and it is a huge hit!\n\nThe only thing I do differently is to double the amount of chicken, and to add some cheddar cheese-- a handful or two mixed in to the ball and another handful to roll it in, along with the pecans. The cheddar gives a nicer flavor and color to it. I noticed some reviewers thought the ranch mix was too salty, but I've never had any complaints and I always put the whole packet in.\n\nThis recipe is definitely a keeper!"

THEN I made it at the beach for a crowd of hungry guests. They watched me make it and very few people ate it because I used chicken from a pouch. I am pretty sure if they had not seen me make it, they would have liked it as much as me. I also think it is better if it has a few hours to sit and let the flavors mesh. I will make it again, especially because it is SO EASY! You can use low-fat cream cheese without changing the taste too much."

I added about 2 Tab. cooked, chopped bacon and one finely chopped green onion. I used only 2 Tab. of ranch dressing mix (I use the canister, and it says 3 Tab. = a 1 ounce pkg). I rolled the ball in minced celery, as suggested in another review. It worked beautifully, and it had a funky, fresh spring-green hue."

There's none left so that's saying something since I served this with several other \"favorite &amp; pre-tested\" appetizer recipes found on this site. Will make again! Thanks Laura!"

"reviewBody": "I took this to a dinner party, and it was a total flop. I think I was the only one who had more than one taste; I had to have two or three crackers of the stuff just trying to figure out why it was rated so highly. I was very disappointed, because this recipe had so many rave reviews. It was salty, and the ranch taste was overpowering. In fact, no one could tell that there was chicken in it. It was simple to make, and the ingredients are easy to keep on hand, so I guess it might be a good recipe to have for emergencies."

It was different, and flavorful, and went well with some Harvest Grain crackers I picked up at the last minute. I will definately make this recipe again and again! You can't beat it for speed and ease and the results are WONDERFUL!"
