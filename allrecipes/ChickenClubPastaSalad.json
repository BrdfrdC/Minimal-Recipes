I used All recipes Absolutely Fabulous Greek House Dressing instead of bottled, which I always keep on hand. I didn't have muenster cheese so used a combination of hard cheeses I had in the fridge. I didn't have any celery, green pepper or avocado, so I used orange pepper, red onion and some leftover spinach. This recipe would go great with whatever you have in your fridge. I was thinking that artichoke hearts and cucumber might work well too. I'm definitely keeping this recipe in my regular rotation. It's that good! Thanks, Lane J!"

Surprise! 3 days later, we were fighting over the last tiny bowl and he reminded me to get the ingredients to make more when I went to the store the next day. I think that I will double the dressing because it got a little dry after the first day but otherwise, awesome as is!"

The only thing I didn't add was the avocado, only because it did get ripe in time, but it would probably have been great as well. I added a bit more bacon because, let's face it, how can you go wrong with more bacon? This is great for a party, for dinner, for a snack. It is really addictive. It goes into my keeper file."

"reviewBody": "Nice flavorful pasta salad that could even serve as a main meal! Great change from vinaigrette dressing pasta salads, which my Gluten Free pastas tend to absorb too much resulting in a dry salad. Since my bell pepper and avocado went bad, and I didn’t have any celery, I used cucumbers (chopped) and fresh broccoli (cut into florets, lightly steamed). I cooked the bacon in a separate pan. Reserved 1.5 tbsp bacon grease to cook 2 chicken breasts (cubed; seasoned with salt and pepper, garlic, onion, paprika, and parsley) on saute mode in my instant pot. Added 3 cups chicken broth + 12 oz Gluten Free Penne, manual for 4 minutes, but pasta wasn’t done so cooked for additional 2 minutes. Used cubed, Cabot brand LF/GF, cheddar cheese. Delicious salad that gets better the longer it sits! Next time I’ll make just a little extra dressing to add in. Thanks for the recipe!"

The dressing is 2 basic ingredients that come together in under a minute. The store bought rotisserie chicken can be bought up to 3 days ahead, cleaned, cubed and ready to toss into the salad. The veggies take a little bit of time to prepare but those too can be cleaned and cut days ahead when stored properly. I think our guests will be surprised and love this recipe!"

Unless I’m making it for a group I’ll halve the recipe next time. Thanks for a lovely entree salad recipe!"

I made my traditional pasta salad but used the italian dressing/mayo dressing from this recipe and it was AWESOME. Perfect update for my tired salad (tri-color bow tie pasta, mushrooms, bell pepper, cherry tomatoes, artichoke hearts, red onions, hearts of palm, celery). The little bit of mayo gave more substance to the traditional italian dressing without turning it into a mayo based salad. I served it at a couples wedding shower and doubled my receipe. Needless to say, it didn't last long at all! Guess now I have to try the recipe it was written for!"

The second time I doubled everything but the “sauce” and bacon, omitted the celery and used sweet peppers in place of the green peppers. Again it was delicious. I mixed the pasta, chicken, peppers and cheese with the sauce hours before I planned to serve it, then added the avocado, bacon and tomatoes just before serving. (The key for me was waiting until the pasta was absolutely stone cold to add the sauce. Yes, I realize warm pasta will absorb the sauce and take on the flavor, but then it would have needed even more sauce and I was trying to watch calories in an already heavy , but delicious dish!). I will be making this again, especially for picnics, cookouts and neighborhood block parties!"
