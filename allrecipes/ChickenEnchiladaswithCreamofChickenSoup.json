I did make some additions because we like our food spicy. I added a can of medium enchilada sauce to the cream of chicken/sour cream mixture. Then, I used hot green chilies and added 1 tsp of cumin to the onion mixture. I used Monterey jack cheese to top it all off. I baked the casserole covered in foil for 30 minutes, then uncovered for 10 more to brown the cheese. It was excellent and I will definitely make again!"

"reviewBody": "This was a hit and no leftovers!\n\nI had just the right amount of leftover rotisserie chicken and so glad I made this recipe.\n\nI did add some extra cumin and some smoked paprika. My husband doesn't like too much heat so I used just one canned whole Hatch Chili, which gave the perfect zing.\n\nI did as someone suggested, and heated the tortillas in the oven wrapped in foil for a a few minutes which made them more pliable. I didn't want too much extra tortilla -to-meat-ratio, so I cut off about 1 1/2\" off one side of the tortilla. That is the side that I folded in first to hold the meat in. It was easier to roll up this way, too.\n\nI added some jarred Penzey's Taco seasoning (it is like a thick sauce) to taste in the sour cream and soup mixture for extra flavor. I served the enchiladas with Salsa Verde (i.e. green salsa) on the side.\n\nI will definitely make this again!"

This is what I did to add to the existing recipe. I doubled the soup/sour cream sauce mixture (using 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can of green enchilada sauce, both 10 oz). I also used a 2 cup cheese bag of shredded cheddar. I used 16oz pack of seasoned shredded chicken (this cut down on a ton of time). I also seasoned with about 1 tbsp cumin. I added an additional 1 cup of the soup mixture in the chicken to give it more moisture when laying into the tortillas. Served it with my Spanish rice and refried black beans topped with cojita (white crumbly Spanish cheese) or similar type cheese on top. Yummy!"

"reviewBody": "My family liked this dish, I had four cups of left over chicken that I wanted to use up so I added an additional can of soup ......... Cream of Cheddar. Since the volume was larger, I decided to layer this dish especially since all the tortillas I had were corn and wouldn't be getting soggy. It was more like a Mexican Lasagna. I doubled the chili powder, added a tablespoon of cumin and Mexican oregano. I also added a small can of sliced olives, a handful of chopped dried scallions and one chopped tomato ( I soaked up most of the runny juice with paper towels, and spread them over the top of the casserole with the shredded cheese). This casserole made enough for four hungry people (adults) to finish or enough for 6-8 sides if your serving other dishes or desserts. I did serve this with sour creme, salsa and guacamole. Four adults eat every morsel! \nI do notice on All Recipes that a lot of people complain about blandness of some of the recipes, you have to remember that these are all BASE recipes and that every recipe is open for you to make \"your own to suit\". I myself have been know to take a 3 star and \"make it my own\" until I consider it a 5 star! Try it, you'll be much happier with All Recipes in the future!"

"reviewBody": "I've lived in the SW US most of my life, and rarely if ever have I ever had any kind of enchiladas from a Mexican restaurant made with flour tortillas. When I decided to try to make my own, I was surprised that most of these enchilada recipes use flour tortillas - and, I've made a few of these recipes, AND, without fail every time I have used flour, they are always soggy! The filling makes the bottoms wet and sticky, and for leftovers, forget it! So, I decided to make my variation using this recipe as a filling (VERY good!), but using CORN tortillas, like the restaurants do. Dipped each tortilla in red enchilada sauce well, filled with this recipe's filling, rolled and put in lightly sprayed glass 9X13, then topped off all of them with rest of the soup/sour cream mix per this recipe; further, poured thick dribble of red enchilada sauce over entire pan of food, topped with healthy dose of shredded cheese- trying to be as short as I can here. Turned out WONDERFUL!!! I did add fresh roasted green chili from New Mexico to the filling - just my preference. I'd HIGHLY recommend trying the corn tortillas by dipping them well in the sauce, fill, etc. Sorry so long."

I mixed the soup and sour cream before realizing it needed some finishing touches. Because I had already mixed the entire amount I ended up adding 2 whole jars of green salsa to the mix to make it flavorful and give it a little kick. I then sautéed the onions in a little extra butter and added the chicken UNCOOKED. I cooked the chicken and seasoned to taste with garlic powder, hot chili powder, cumin, cayenne, and then added the can of green chilies. I then mixed a bit of cheese into the chicken mix before rolling, coating in the sauce mix, adding a layer of cheese, and then baking. I did NOT need to add any of the sauce to the filling since I cooked it together the chicken stated very moist. It would have been way too wet with sauce inside. Spray the bottom of the baking dish with cooking spray, do not put sauce in the bottom unless it is a very tiny bit. It takes nothing for them to become very soggy on the bottom."
