I had exactly what this called for, I made it thinking it wouldn’t exactly be what my husband was thinking of—no red sauce. He flipped out over how good it was. It had all stuff I like so I knew I would like it. It’s a keeper."

"reviewBody": "Delicious but this only yielded 3 for me and I see that-someone else said the same thing recently. I guess if you stuff them less you could get 6 but they'd be sad and empty. I precooked the chicken using some taco spices. I did make two changes to the original recipe: first, I used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom, as per previous review suggestions. And then I used almond milk instead of regular milk - doesn't make a difference to the taste of the sauce at all. Overall they're very very good, but I wonder what they would taste like using corn tortillas instead - the flour tortillas get a bit mushy and just taste a bit floury. So for that I give it 4*! Everything else is top notch."

You can add all sorts of different stuff to the sauce to change it up, like salsa, extra veggies, etc. It definitely has become a family favorite and I love that even if I don't have every ingredient on hand, it's still doable. For example, I just made this a few mins ago, but didn't have any sour cream so I added a little rue w/ some broth, milk, butter, and flour to thicken it up and it gave it that nice creamy texture. Definitely worth making!"

I used green enchilada sauce to wet the tortillas instead. I added chili powder, fresh garlic, pepper and cayenne pepper to the sauce to add a zing to the chicken. Rotisserie chicken works well for simplification and speediness of the recipe. Add a simple green salad with a balsamic dressing as a side. It accompanies the dish quite well."

I recommend spooning some of the sauce on the bottom of the pan to keep the bottoms of the tortillas from getting hard. I used half flour and half corn tortillas, either works. I added some chicken bullion and hot sauce to the filling, but other than that, I followed the recipe. Thanks for sharing it!"

Couple of mods I made: used evaporated milk vice regular milk, no cream of mushroom soup instead added alittle more evaporated milk and jalapeños vice green chiles and regular onion. Agree with other person that corn holds up better than flour tortillas. Flour tortillas get gummy but with this recipe, it is not too noticeable because of the cream sauce on top. Definitely will do this one again! Next time I will try with corn tortillas. yummy recipe!"

It's pretty good as-is, but if you're used to your \"Mexican\" food having a little kick to it, you will need to add some chili powder and Cayenne pepper. I tasted it right after I had mixed all the ingredients together, and it just tasted way too \"casserole\" for me. I added a big dash of chili power and a smaller dash of Cayenne, and it was perfect. My whole family liked it! I only got 4 big enchiladas out of this recipe, not 6, but my kids only ate half of one."

I also used one cream of chicken can instead of the second cream of mushroom when I doubled it. The only thing I thought was that the sauce seemed a little thick, so next time I will add more milk to give a creamy, runnier consistency, but that is just my personal preference. I also made one with Ezekiel tortilla for my husband (who is trying to minimize carbs) and he said it was great! Have added it to my regular main dishes."

I made it the first time exactly as written (okay I lied a bit, ran out of garlic powder so minced a clove and sauted it with the green onions), and it was so so so good. I’ve made it three times since then, and the only change I regularly make is I add about a tablespoon of packaged fajita seasoning when cooking the chicken, but without it it’s still good! If you make it you absolutely don’t need to make changes at all, but it’s also so versatile you could add extra spices or veggies or make it more spicy, etc. Love it!"

I might double the batch next time. Also put a small amount of the sauce on the bottom of your pain before adding your rolled enchiladas. otherwise the flour tortillas will harden on the bottom. I put a 7 oz can of green chiles and they still had little to no spice. If you like spicy you'll have to add your own favorites to kick it up a notch!"

When I started making this I was feeling proud that I was preparing a new well reviewed meal for my family, even the “sauce” seemed to be creamy and a delicious starting point...however when it came down to the filling there was not enough to properly fill the tortillas. The sauce was super salty and tasted very canned and you might as well eat cream of mushroom straight from the can that’s your thing or dip a warm tortilla in a can of cream of mushroom and eat it that way. I cook prep-heavy meals almost every day and am big into cooking. This was terrible and I will not be making it again."
