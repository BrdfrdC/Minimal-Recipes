When I decided to make this dish I made a shopping list. Got to the store, forgot my list, forgot the cream cheese. Sent my daughter to the store, forgot to tell her to get 2, hence the substitution. I will make this again but next time I will use Monterey Jack instead of cheddar (personal preference), HOT salsa because I like spicy. Thank you for this recipe."

I also used 2 large chicken breasts that were cooked on the grill. I filled a 9X13 baking dish as well as a large square baking dish (which I will freeze). Next time I will 1/2 the recipe. I was going to do 1/2 cream cheese and 1/2 sour cream, but I forgot. It was still good with all cream cheese. I also used whole grain rotini noodles.

"reviewBody": "Quite good and makes a ton. I made the recipe as written. For those that like it spicier use a hot salsa or add hot sauce. I do think I will try a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of chicken stock (as others suggested) next time just to thin out the consistency. The only reason I made it a 4 star was it screams for acid. A bit of lime juice at the end may help. I topped with sour cream and fresh tomatoes when serving."

"reviewBody": "This is what I changed... I used 3lbs of chicken breast, used penne instead of ziti, omitted taco seasoning, corn and black beans and took other reviewers suggestions and used 8oz sour cream and 8oz cream cheese. I used olive oil to sauté my peppers and onion (I used two green peppers since my onions are really large) and sautéed them with 1tbsp of minced garlic (since I sautéed onions and peppers separately I ended up using 2tbsp of minced garlic). I also cooked my chicken breast differently as I needed a to make a stock so I was able to shred it as some reviewers had suggested they wished they had done. Also using the chicken in a stock helped keep it moist and full of flavor (my stock is seasoned so the chicken absorbed the seasonings). After I sautéed the veggies I added them to the stock to soften more and cook with the chicken. Because my chicken was seasoned from the stock I omitted the taco seasoning and my family is not too big on black beans and corn just seemed out of place. I also added 1 cup of my stock to the pasta as I was mixing everything together as some reviewers said that after baking it was dry. This made two 9 x 13 pans and was so delicious. Will definitely be making this again as it was a huge hit with my husband and brother and my 1 year old girls loved it."

The only substitutions I made were because I listened to other reviewers. I cut the cream cheese in half, and substituted it with sour cream. MY daughters don’t like to see Bell peppers, or onions, so I substituted it with the powders, and I didn’t use chicken broth. I substituted that with one 10.5 oz. can of cream of chicken. Definitely a family favorite!!!"

The taste did not justify the number of pots, pans, bowls, spatulas and spoons used. Microwaved the next day it tasted pastry. I give it 3 stars based upon potential. My taster, on the other hand, absolutely loved it. She gives it 5 stars and also suggests less cream cheese. She is concerned about the high caliber tie and carbohydrate content and suggests that once a year is sufficient. If it was healthier she would eat it more frequently. As it is she wants me to freeze the remainder in small portions."

I did half cream cheese half sour cream like others. and also added a cup of chicken broth once in the dish. I didn't cook my noodles before hand. I like the texture more firm. noodles cooked prior to baking seem too mushy for me. used ridge ziti. over all it was a great dish and we will be making again but with less pepper . oh and I think I will try fajita seasoning next time."

Another good point of the recipe is the quantity of the food made, left-overs for days :) I'm also thinking of adding a twist of lime to sauce to zest it up."

I think covering with foil would help with that and leave uncovered after topping with the cheese. Great Mexican Casserole with great flavor.
