I got the chicken and cut it up into bite size peices and put it in a bag with about 5 table spoons of Cajon seasoning shoot it up and let it sit for about 35 mins and then followed this recipe on how to cook the chicken, pasta, etc.. and man. It was so Good. My sister who refuses to eat any pasta anywhere because she hates it. Tried some of mine and fell in love. \n\nHighly recommend. 5/5 stars"

I discovered this recipe back in 2014, and I still use it to this day because it is so creamy and rich in flavor. This is better than any restaurant recipe I have ever had, and I love that it has fresh tomatoes in it! I follow this recipe to a T, and it always comes out amazing!!! THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE WITH US! 7 years later I am still using this recipe, and I will NEVER try another one!"

I added some broccoli to the pasta water for a quick minute then pasta &amp; broccoli went directly into the sauce. The trace of pasta water that transferred helped to loosen the sauce while keeping it creamy. The sauce coated everything wonderfully. Finish with some crushed red pepper and enjoy!"

Salt addicts, feel free to add up to another 1/2 teaspoon if you find it lacking at the end, for a total of 1 teaspoon. If not for this, I believe to be error, this has a nice consistency and flavor. I hope that inexperienced cooks don’t take this highly rated recipe as face value."

I did the steps a little different than stated, I made everything in the same pan without taking the chicken out. I cooked the chicken with the garlic, onions, and mushrooms because I wanted those flavors to be incorporated into the chicken. Cooking it all in the same pot also made clean up a bit easier. All in all, the ingredients work very well together. I will be adding it to our rotation."

I’ve sometimes had to replace cheeses or milk, sometimes I don’t have mushrooms on hand or I feel like improvising and adding some heat. Regardless, it’s always fantastic and never disappoints. Also reheats well so although the quantity is for 6-8 portions we have a lot of leftovers for the next day in our family of 4 and nobody is complaining."

I added bell peppers and some broccoli so I didn't have to feel quite so bad about the amount of fat, and it added a lot of color and texture. \n\nI had read reviews about there being too much liquid in the sauce so I only used 2 cups of milk and halved the sour cream. I also added more parmesan because I like the more bitter flavor. If I were to make it again, double the salt, and lessen the Italian seasoning (I used a very strong seasoning from France that ended up overshadowing the cheesy flavor a little)."

I took the juice from the chicken and placed it in a pot and made the alfredo sauce without sauteeing the veggies - just skip that step and do the flour and butter and salt step. Then since my hubby likes mushrooms and onions; I poured the sauce over and mixed in the chicken with the sauteed mushrooms and onions. For me, I took the remainder of the sauce and added steamed broccoli and tomatoes to it with the other half of the chicken. 1 recipe 2 dishes lasted 3 days. That's a winner!!"

"reviewBody": "I was excited to try this recipe - with an overall rating of over 4 stars, with over 1,000 reviews I thought it must be fantastic. My teenage-son, who eats everything and has never met an alfredo sauce he doesn't like, barely touched it. \nI personally think it has potential - but there are changes I'd make for next time.\n1. I don't understand the use of Colby/jack cheese in it - it made the sauce yellowish instead of white and the flavor just isn't what you'd expect. \n2. the quantity of cheese is way too much - makes this more of a cheese sauce rather than alfredo. Next time, I'd use about half the amount asked for.\n3. I was ok with tomatoes, but suggest tossing them in at the end, and make sure you use roma - I didn't have roma, only had garden tomatoes. They broke down in the sauce. I was ok with this from a flavor perspective, but they ended up becoming part of the sauce rather than pieces of tomatoes. Also, taken together with the yellow cheese, gave the sauce overall an orange flavor. \n4. The quantity - this makes a ridiculous amount of sauce. Seriously - there were 6 of us, two being teenage boys, and we have enough leftovers for 2-3 more meals. Next time, I will half this recipe."

The sauce is the most important and fantastic thing about this recipe. You can do whatever you like with the chicken but the sauce is what your paying attention to for sure. I leave out the Tomatoes and the mushrooms and make broccoli to add in as your eating. You have to watch what kind of cheeses you use. I'm a big fan of the pre-mixed Italian blends they seem to melt very easily and add a unique flavor blend to the sauce. My whole family loves this recipe. Highly recommended!"

We eat gluten free so I use gluten free pasta and thicken the sauce with cornstarch instead of flour (just mix with one of the cups of milk when it's still cold and stir it in). I also just use 4 cups of milk, no cream, I just don't think it's necessary. I have made it with chicken but it is also very good using shrimp instead or a combination. I also use Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. It still ends up fabulously rich. The amount of salt is a bit much for me. 2 teaspoons is perfect."
