I did topped the salad with some crushed Doritos because we like a little crunch in our salads and I had a some Wishbone Chipotle Ranch dressing that I also added. It was wonderful!"

By adding the rice it made the salad more fulfilling. I also sprinkled shredded cheese on top. This is a salad I will make again and recommend."

"reviewBody": "Awesome, and as others have indicated, a great salad to jump off on to create your own blend! I stirred the beans, corn and salsa right into the skillet with the chicken, and threw the onions into that mixture too. Added some grated marble cheese to the skillet as well which made the mixture all gooey and yummy! Grabbed some tortilla chips I had, crumbled them on top of the greens &amp; tomatoes before layering on the chicken mixture. Added ranch dressing like others. Deeeeelishhhh!"

"reviewBody": "WOW! So much flavor. Both my husband and I couldn't get over how good this was. Only thing I changed was I rubbed chicken breasts with taco seasoning (I didn't have fajita seasoning) wrapped in foil and baked at 375 for 30 min (thin cut chicken breasts). I didn't add any seasoning to the bean/corn/salsa mixture. Served with a little cheddar cheese and a little ranch dressing. So good. Can't wait for the leftovers for lunch. If you plan for left overs do not put the bean/corn mixture on until you are ready to serve again."

We tossed in cherry tomatoes (helps contain the tomatoes for those tomato haters), and instead of adding salsa, we put it on the side, in addition to a choice of chipotle-mango-yogurt dressing (on the side of course). We also skipped the onions this time, and had feta as an option for the grown-ups to toss in. That cheese made me so happy. Yum. Everyone loved this salad, which is such a joy."

My second try I mixed sour cream and salsa together as the dressing, but it was still missing something. I also think my choice of greens was unfortunate for this recipe. I used a mixed green blend with a lot of peppery arugula, and I think it overpowered everything else. I would add cheese and some crumbled tortilla chips. I might try this again with some milder greens and without the canned mexicorn."
