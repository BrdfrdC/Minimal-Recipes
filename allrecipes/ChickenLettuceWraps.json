I had some leftover cooked chicken breasts that I cubed for the meat, so I made the sauce and added the chicken afterwards. I didn't have any red peppers but I did have a can of water chestnuts so I used them instead. I didn't have any peanut butter so we skipped that sauce for the end. The sauce can be made spicier with extra red pepper sauce or sprinkling red pepper flakes on it as I did. My husband devoured them. I will definitely make them again."

Sometimes we just serve this on top of chopped romaine. We like shredded carrot and chopped peanuts with ours. Also we use Sriracha sauce if we don't have have Tabasco or other hot sauces."

I ground my own chicken because I buy chickens whole and break them down myself to save $$, plus I like to make my own chicken stock! :) I just remove the breasts from the bone, cut them into chunks and grind them in my food processor. For the peanut sauce I used creamy peanut butter because I have a 17 month old that wouldn't be able to chew peanuts. I also added about 2 T of rice vinegar to the sauce. I made some rice quinoa blend for a side although we used it in the wraps instead. I didn't think this was too salty at all, but I love salt! I would recommend this for sure."

I also added some extra hot sauce to the chicken because we like it spicy. The peanut sauce is delicious and the onion and cilantro really make the wraps pop. Even better the second day, if you have leftovers. Thanks or the great recipe!"

Then added soy sauce, rice vinegar, ground ginger, chili oil (so no need for Tabasco), and chunky peanut butter. Simmered on low, adding a bit of water as needed, then served over a bed of lettuce. A hit with the whole family."

Now that i have made it a few times, I have done it with ground chicken, leftover cut up chicken from a whole smoked chicken we cooked on out smoker, and also vegetarian because our neighbor is a vegetarian, and all variations were very good. Even the vegetarian way. We like this best with the ground chicken, and when making the peanut butter sauce, we use Adams all natural chunky PB, and add much more hot water than it calls for. I also add a little bit of sesame oil and sriracha sauce to give it a little kick. I don't use the recommended amount of soy sauce in it, either - I use way less(in the pb sauce and in the meat mixture both)because alot of people said it was too salty in the reviews. I will definitely continue to make this"
