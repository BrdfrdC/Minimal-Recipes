I also used 4 garlic cloves and a bunch of fresh grated garlic. For the tomato puree I used a 6oz can of tomato paste and then added some water. I was very happy with it. It was plenty of sauce and I probably had a lot more chicken. I didn't add the corn starch in the water. I just sprinkled some of the corn starch on the chicken as it was cooking and added water as needed. Our family loves the sauce and there was plenty. Served over rice. I used the same pan for both items. I just took the sauce out and put in a bowl while I cooked the chicken."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is very delicious, even better the following day! I made it last week, and I am making it again tonight. Thank you for a great recipe! For those who think the coriander is missing, it is not, as it is already in the garam masala. I followed the recipe to a 'T' and found the balance to be perfect! Okay, I did cut back on the cream and butter, I used coconut cream due to my dairy allergy, so I would recommend adding both according to your taste. I always make up my garam masala fresh using a recipe online. I used an immersion blender to smooth out and cream my sauce. I also whizzed in some of my cooked rice to get to the desired thickness of my sauce."

After stirring in half &amp; half (I actually used heavy whipping cream) and the yogurt, I ran the sauce through a blender for smoother texture and then returned to the stove to simmer for 10 minutes. I used ground cashews instead of cornstarch. I made this recipe before without the coriander and cashews. The flavor of this dish is definitely better with the coriander and cashews added. I serve this with basmati rice."

The sauce will be naturally thick."

I did not need to use the cornstarch thickener, due to this. I did add more spices during the simmering phase, and it was a mistake. The taste was chalky. I suppose you must heat the spices with the oil/butter first, because when I added extra later, it changed the texture. Next time, I will stick to the recipe, or make my changes to spices during the saute stage! Thank you!"

This is definitely the closest flavor to a restaurant quality I've ever made. I hate when people rate recipes they've changed, but I couldn't resist after reading reviews - full disclosure I did add a bit of ground coriander and went heavy on the spices... but it came out perfect! I also was prepared to thicken up the sauce with ground cashews, but turned out I didn't need to, it thickened up on its own! And as another review suggested, I ran the sauce through my food processor at the end to smooth out the remaining onions, I prefer smoother sauces. This is a new household favorite!"

I also added some unsalted peanuts and served it over curried rice. Overall, the spicing was superb but I think something sweet is missing to offset the tomato sauce and yogurt flavor. Maybe a teaspoon of sugar a dab of honey."

I then chopped an onion and sautéed until translucent in leftover juice from chicken and 1-2 tbsp dairy free butter, added a rough approximation of 3tbsp of garlic and 3tbsp ginger, 1 tsp coriander, 1 tsp garam masala, 1 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper and 1 bay leaf and let that cook for approx 1 minute. Then added 1 cup puréed tomato, 1 cup coconut milk, 1/4 cup coconut milk yogurt and let that simmer for 2-3 minutes before adding chicken back in.

Excellent! \nNext time, however, I might get more creative with the chicken and grill it our try a marinade for more flavor."

Use fresh ginger and garlic (about 5 cloves of garlic, and about 1 inch of ginger, peeled and minced). If you have a food processor, that will dice up the cashews enough to sub out the corn starch. This is truly restaurant grade Chicken Makhani once you get the mix right."
