"reviewBody": "This was excellent on its own, but was perhaps just a little dry. To make this again, I would increase the sauce by 50% and add in some with the chicken mixture. Also, the recipe doesn't say how to prepare the chicken for stuffing. I shredded it using a paddle blade in my KitchenAid mixer. That worked excellent. Also, I cut way back on the salt, using only a third of what was called for. This was the perfect amount. I followed the measurements on the herbs, but I felt the oregano was about double of what it should have been. Next time I will reduce by half. I did add a can of spinach (I would have preferred fresh) to my sauce, which I think was a real nice addition. Overall, a great sauce and a great recipe."

I also forgot the egg, but everything baked up ok.\nOn the plus side, I used one reviewer's tip to slice the tube, stuff, and lay seam down. Thank you, that worked great!

Its not the Greatest thing i have eaten but it is definitely a great dish that we loved. I did have to give it 4 stars because of instructions not being very descriptive but its overall quality with everyones sense of \"eh wing it\" with ingredient amounts on certain things went extremely well.

The biggest change I'd make is the amount of salt in the sauce. It was way too salty for me and even my husband thought it was salty and he typically adds salt to every dish. I'd either use unsalted butter or cut the salt in half or even less. I'd also use a little less of each of the herbs. The basil in particular I thought was a little strong. I'd make it again but with modifications."

As a hint - my grandmother taught me to cut the manicotti noodles in half lengthwise after boiling, lay the filling down the middle, then overlap, lay in dish with seam side down. Or, stuff uncooked, add extra sauce and cooking time and it will equal out. Both methods work, I like to stuff uncooked, 1/2's the time for the process no matter what you are stuffing inside! Definitely gonna be a family favorite. Added my own spices, spinach and loved this with salad and garlic bread, good guest meal!! Thank you Jeff!!!"

"reviewBody": "This is an awesome recipe! A bit high on the calorie count, but if you're looking for that occasional splurge....this is it. I made the recipe as called for with the addition of spinach and some finely chopped sauteed red onion to my ricotta stuffing. I added chopped sauteed mushrooms and garlic to the sauce. I also made additional sauce as some reviewers suggested...drowned my stuffed manicotti in it....oh..I also slow boiled my chicken in a bit of garlic and 1 1/2 cup chicken broth for shredding (about 30 minutes)...that made it easier to stuff the manicotti. Bon Apetite...you will enjoy this one. Thanks for a great recipe Jeff!!"

I added a sprinkling of Italian Cheese to the chicken and ricotta mixture before stuffing the shells just because he loves it and it turned out spectacular. Garlic bread would have been perfect but since we were out we cut hawaiian rolls in half, buttered, sprinkled with garlic powder, the italian cheese from the bag, and topped with a sprinkling of italian spice and put it in the oven under broil for 4-5 minutes... went perfect together!!"

This was a simple recipe to make, I was surprised how easy the sauce was to make. I stuffed the shells the night before, made the sauce Christmas morning, and baked as directed. I not a big fan of Alfredo, but my kids are, and they loved it. Only changes I made was to add garlic to the butter (at my son's request) when I prepared the sauce, and I used dried herbs instead of fresh. The manicotti were not dry, and very flavorful. I don't think I will ever buy the jar stuff again."

We did not marinate the chicken and instead cooked it with some oil, vinegar, garlic and a package of frozen spinach. We too left out the egg. The spinach added a nice color and flavor. Next time I think we will use milk instead of heavy cream because it was a bit greasy with the cream and the cheese. We added some cornstarch to thicken it, because it will not thicken on its own. Also, we did not cook it longer than 20 minutes in the oven--45 minutes would burn the cheese."

I did do some things differently. I didn't make my alfredo sauce or my marinade for one. I used classico creamy alfredo sauce and jack daniels garlic herb and chicken marinade. I cut the ricotta cheese in half no one in my house is a big fan of it. Instead of using just mozzarella cheese i used a 6 cheese blend packet of cheese. i also took out the grated parmesean cheese and I grilled my chicken. thanks for sharing...

This alfredo sauce was rated very good so I chose to use this recipe. It was very simple to make and was more than enough for a 1 pound box of pasta. I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup of half and half....worked perfect. My guests were diving in for seconds and complimented the dinner over and over. I'm planning on making chicken and shrimp alfredo for Christmas Eve dinner. Yummy...can't hardly wait. Thanks Jeff for a fantatic Alfredo sauce."

I think you can look at the ingredients in a recipe and know if it's going to be too rich,bland,spicy,. It all appealed to me. After reading the comments I knew that even though it didn't say to pour the marinate off the chicken thats what I did. I didn't add any extra oil to cook the chicken. Some said this was dry, so I left the egg out and added a little less chicken. If there is anything I want rich tasting, it would be alfredo sauce. Not hard to make and my family LOVED THIS DISH. Do double the sauce it is so good you will want your manicotti drowning in it. A real keeper...Thanks for sharing........."

It left the filling a bit stiff; if you do what I did with the leftover meat, then maybe add some milk to make it easier to fill the manicottis. And double the Alfredo sauce, as others have said a single recipe isn't enought for the manicotties. Finally, I did a double batch of the manicottis, and served the second batch with \"Best Marinara Sauce Yet\". Both were a hit all around."

Everything was just too cheesy! We only liked the alfredo sauce, especially since I made it a rose by adding a homemade marinara. For the amount of cost and the work to make this, I wouldn't recommend it. It was not a hit."
