I had chicken filets sliced thin and my mushrooms were sliced, so that was easy, I did put a little bread crumbs in with the flour, and I did add a tad of cornstarch dissolved in 1/4 C of water, and I did add just a dash of half and half to make it creamy. Next time I might use a little more wine because those two things probably cut into the taste of the wine. This is a keeper recipe, and easy easy."

I was not rushed for time, and that's a good thing, because this recipe will consume 2-3 hours of your afternoon. The mess it creates in the kitchen, I don't even want to think about. In the end, you get chicken cutlets that taste like they were marinated in wine. I'll continue to shell out the $50 for a chicken marsala dinner for two at my favorite restaurant."

"reviewBody": "So, I was looking for a good recipe for Chicken Marsala and as my go to site I came to AllRecipes for just that. Before I cook anything as I’m sure some of you do as well, I like to read the reviews to see what the end results are for any tips. I found that a few people used cornstarch to thicken the sauce and also used seasoned bread crumbs in the flour to coat the chicken which I found both recommendations to work out amazingly well!! I added extra Marsala to strengthen the flavor and doubled all the other sauce ingredients so I had some leftover. With all that being said, this recipe is now my new go to!!🤤🤤 I’ve only ever had Chicken Marsala 1 other time and it was at this restaurant me and my girlfriend went to. I was not to impressed with the meal which completely turned me off of even wanting to try it again. However, I was in Walmart doing some food shopping the other day getting some cooking wines and decided maybe I should try cooking the dish myself. Well, turns out I actually like it!! Hope y’all found my post helpful.😁 Have a blessed day!"

If you were having it over pasta or more than 2 people double the sauce. After reading numerous reviews I added Italian seasoning to the flour mixture and fresh garlic to the pan before adding the chicken back in. I also used a lot more mushrooms! I had to sub chicken broth for marsala and dry vermouth for sherry. I'm sure marsala makes it much tastier. I did watch some of the video which helped since I missed some things reading the recipe. Such as pounding chicken and taking the chicken out of pan before adding mushrooms and the liquid. This is a keeper!"

Those who said that the chicken was tough must have cooked it too long and/or not pounded it first. I served it with asparagus and Angel Hair pasta and my family absolutely loved it! Will definitely make this again. (Edited to add that I doubled the recipe for our family of 7)"

"reviewBody": "Not sure how they came up with this recipe, but it's incorrect in many many ways. There are many many many better recipes available online, this made as is (I tried it last night) was a greasy, disgusting mess. 1. Way too much fat. Twice as much as needed, and needs to be drained, see 2. 2. Do NOT leave the fat in the pan, drain it off. 3. Deglaze the pan with with alcohol (way too much, see 4). 4. Using alcohol as the only liquid is a huge mistake. Don't use sherry in Marsala, use Marsala, but add chicken stock, and a bit of half and half at the end. 5. Add some herbs, thyme?"

I made enough for two meals, and my DOH told me not to serve it again. I will dump the sauce and repurpose the chicken. Too much butter and oil. Would have been better using chicken broth instead of oil."

I'm sure whole milk would also be perfectly fine with additional corn starch. just remember to combine the starch and milk before you add to the pan.. whip it real good."
