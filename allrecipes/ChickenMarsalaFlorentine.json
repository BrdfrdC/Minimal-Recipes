The marsala taste after simmering for 10 minutes was a little strong for me and there wasn't enough sauce so I added 3 cups chicken base and a little corn starch to thicken it up. Wonderful!! The party I made it for thought I was a professional chef. Love it!!"

Have used regular white mushrooms instead of portobellos, made without sun dried tomatoes, and without spinach at times, just depending on what I have on hand. Also have added a bit of half and half to pan at end of cooking, which results in an even richer, more decadent sauce. Simple, yet absolutely delicious. Looks and tastes like a sophisticated meal you would order at a high end restaurant. This one’s a keeper."

Left the marsala wine and butter the same.\n\nFound the tomatoes became sweeter the longer you cook them, went about 20 minutes for that and reduction of the mushrooms, so to keep the meal from drying out in the pan I added just about 1/2 cup chicken broth. Also added the chicken back as soon as the spinach reduced by half.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic meal and a new addition to my go-to list for any occasion."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is very good. I served it over spaghetti. I also reduced the recipe for 2 people and prepared the recipe as is with a slight change in the procedure of adding wine. With those modifications mentioned here is how I prepared this recipe: First, with a pairing knife, I sliced horizontally slice each breast to make 4 pieces. I thinned out each piece with the kitchen hammer just a bit as the pre slicing gets half the hammering job done. Second, I proceeded to make the recipe as if for 2 people, so I kept the proportions for a 2 people recipe. Third, after frying the breasts, I added half the amount of wine (4 TBSP) and proceeded to scrape the bits from the pan and let the wine evaporate a bit. Then, added the mushrooms and tomatoes. In this step, I added 1/4 cup of butter (4 TBSP) and as soon as it started melting, I added the remaining amount of wine. I also added the chicken juices and proceeded to put the chicken on top and covered for barely 3 minutes. Last, I added the spinach and covered again until the vapor wilted the spinach a bit, without letting it get dull in color while the juices thickened a bit. With those \"changes\" which mainly are techniques applied to the basic recipe, I made it. Honestly, this was delicious and still yielded leftovers. I could imagine this over a classic risotto Parmesan, and it would just be great too!"

"reviewBody": "I made a quadruple batch of this for a large crowd. I used boneless chicken tenders to make portioning easier. I also used julienned sundried tomatoes in oil with spices, which added flavor, and more mushrooms and spinach proportionally. I used about 20% less marsala wine proportionally also, and it still had the marsala flavor. I made it about 3 hours before everyone came, and it held beautifully. The chicken stayed moist and all the flavors really melded together well. I froze some leftovers and it was just as good when defrosted. This is a keeper for me."

Sauce lessened during cooking. Will double sauce recipe next time. Maybe add some chicken broth and flour roux mixture to thicken. Put chicken in sauce at end to reheat chicken and mix flavor. Added Parmesan cheese as topper."

I love sun dried tomatoes, but I will decrease the amount to 1/4-1/2 cup next time as sun dried tomatoes have such a strong, tangy flavor and it overwhelmed this dish. I also added minced garlic and more spinach. Otherwise enjoyed this dish."

The only problem was my guests went home in distress because they couldn't stop eating it! I dislike it when people write reviews on a recipe and then mention they changed the recipe a bit. Well, I'm going to be one of those people. I only made two slight changes that I don't think made a big difference in the final results. I added 6 THIN slices of proscuitto (cut up) when sauteing the mushrooms, and I thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch and water. Definitely restaurant quality. P.S. I used sweet Marsala, not dry."

'Dry' (Communion Style) Masala wine is more pleasing then replacing it with dry Vermouth. The 'dry' fortified Masala imparts just the right amount of sweetness IMHO."
