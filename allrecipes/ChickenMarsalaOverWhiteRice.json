If you cook a chicken cutlet on medium-high heat for 8 minutes a side, it will be shoe leather. Even 5 minutes is too much. I'd suggest 4 mins each side. Second, you can't \"scrape up the brown bits\" after adding more butter! Deglazing requires liquid. The time to \"scrape up the brown bits\" is after adding the Marsala and stock. Third; in order to thicken the sauce, it should be simmered UNCOVERED (unless you want to wait an couple of hours for dinner.)"

"reviewBody": "I've never had Chicken Marsala before so I didn't know what to expect. I wanted a savory chicken recipe instead of a spicy one, as so many chicken recipes are. This was very tasty and fit the bill. I made the flour mixture in a ziplock bag and shook the cutlets around in it. I then refrigerated the bag for awhile to let the flour stick better. It isn't quite as messy either. I used canned mushrooms because I had them. The recipe makes very little sauce, especially once it's reduced and thickened a bit. I'll double it next time. I'll make it again to perfect it."

I added extra mushrooms to the recipe because of my love for them. I'm not a big fan of white rice on it's own but it really added some extra substance to this dish. I did cook the dish without the Marsala wine, and I thought it turned out fine. I noticed that some people in their reviews said that they preferred it without the taste of the wine anyway, so I figured it would be fine to omit from the recipe. I liked the way the sauce tasted and I definitely plan on making this again."

Any other wine won't do it justice, sure it'll taste fine but I suggest using Marsala wine first to see the difference."

I sauteed sliced onions before the mushrooms and garlic. I seasoned the chicken before dredging in flour. I also added a couple of sprigs of fresh thyme. I served it over mashed potatoes to soak up the sauce. Add a green veggie and your plate looks like it's from a restaurant. This is definitely a keeper!"

I concur with another review that if you're using the amount of chicken recommended (I cut the breasts in half horizontally to create the thin cutlets), use half the amount of flour. Keep the seasonings the same. Also, the sauce does not get very thick without some help. I used about 1-2 tbsps Wondra flour mixed with chicken stock then mixed into the sauce base to thicken to your liking. Otherwise, it was quite good!"

"reviewBody": "This is a great recipe with good instructions. \n\nI cut the chicken into cubes because it's easier to manage and portion. The flour coating is very light and cutting the chicken allows it to better absorb the flavors. I used 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper and salt per recipe and made a double portion for my family of 4. I thought it was perfect, but was told that it needed more salt and less pepper.\n\nI cook on a gas stove and kept the flame on high to more quickly thicken the sauce. It has a nice savory flavor."

"reviewBody": "Overall a very tasty dish! However a couple of things to note: First of all you certainly do not need 1 cup of flour to dredge the chicken. I used about 1/2 of that. Also, at the time you add the cooked breasts to the mushroom, broth &amp; wine, you will need to thicken it a bit. I did not and had to take out the chicken and make a roux to thicken up the gravy. If you can figure out how to coat the chicken with more flour, perhaps it would have worked."

The little bit of lemon really compliments the flavors in the chicken if you ask me :-) But to each his own!"
