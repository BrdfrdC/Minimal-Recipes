Baked them for 33 mins. so they were slightly browned and cooked. Unfortunately, they tasted good, but were very dry. Next time I will bake them for less time and less hot pepper. A little too spicy for me. I also used ground chicken breast. Perhaps just ground chicen would be less dry."

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe as written with minor substitutions that should not effect the outcome of the recipe. I used gluten free bread crumbs (celiac) and dried basil instead of fresh (because I didn't want to walk out to my garden in the rain). I also doubled the recipe for my meatball loving family. For the fresh mozzarella, I used the \"cherry sized\" balls, cut in half.If I were to make these again I would use the full cheese ball. The meat portion was tasty and moist. The boys of the family liked the red pepper while my daughter hated it yet still ate 4 meatballs. Personally, I thought it could have used less and felt it was a bit overpowering."

"reviewBody": "UPDATE: I didn't use fresh basil this time, and only used half of what's in the recipe (of course) and I didn't have any cream cheese. I used cottage cheese :) They turned out moist and delicious. These are definitely a keeper!! A year ago: I would definitely make these again, but I would adjust them. There was too much basil in it for me."

I added in a Tablespoon of coconut flour to bind them. I cooked in the oven for twenty minutes and then another twenty or so in a pot of bubbling sauce. The taste was fantastic and a great alternative to beef/pork! Thank you"
