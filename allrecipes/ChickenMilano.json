Breasts come out dry and tasteless Deglaze pan with only 2 tablespoons of chicken broth not a 1/4 cup, and reduce to half. Basil adds very little to this dish other than color"

The only changes I made were: I added some sliced mushrooms because I needed to use them up, I mixed in one tablespoon of flour as a thickener and used only one third cup of heavy cream because that was all I had left and it was just for the two of us. Thank you so much for a delicious recipe."

"reviewBody": "Excellent recipe. I used some of cookiqueen's recommendations modified a bit.\n-Chicken in milk with 1 TBSP white vinegar for a couple hours.\n-Cut into strips and dredged in 1/2 cup flour, 1 TBSP smoke paprika, salt and pepper. Fry in 2 TBSP grape seed oil and 2 TBSP butter then set aside and keep warm. By removing the chicken until plating, it remains crispy and keeps the flavors of the smoked paprika.\n-Saute garlic for a minute, add sundried tomatoes (1/2 minute) then deglaze pan with 1 cup chicken broth.\n-Add 3/4 cups Chablis (or another white wine). Cover (lid ajar to allow reduction) and simmer for 20 minutes.\n-Turn heat off to avoid curdling cream. Add 1 1/2 cup cream (I used half and half). Add 2 TBSP cornstarch mixed with 1+ TBSP water. Turn heat back on to just a simmer, uncovered, for about 10 minutes while stirring to thicken.\n-Add basil right before serving.\nI tossed the fettuccine with 2 ladles of sauce. Plated the fettuccine, laid strips of chicken on top then added more sauce.\nThanks to those that commented with great suggestions. Really helped make a very good recipe even better. Wish I had made more chicken as everyone wanted more."

Sauted them in a cast iron skillet with olive oil and garlic, set aside and cooked the chicken in that pan. When chicken was done I didn't remove it as the recipe called for, I left it in and added the broth then sauce. (maybe thats why it didnt quite thicken up but i felt it was easier, faster, and made for less dishes)"

I will say that my son doesn’t like tomatoes, so I had to think up a way to disguise them. I got the blender out and puréed the tomatoes with the 3/4 cup of broth and told him it was a red pepper sauce. He complimented how great the dish was....(our secret on the tomatoes). The amount of the sauce was perfect for the amount of the pasta. Sorry, we had almost finished our meal before I realized I didn’t get a pic. I will be making this dish again and again and again."

I replaced heavy cream with coconut milk and butter with olive oil, but otherwise followed the directions as is. It came out really creamy and savory, with a bursts of sweetness from the tomato. After having a little, I decided to up the acidity and added some kalamata olives. This really kicked it up for me, especially with some of the olive juice added to the sauce, and I plan on making again in the future when I have some sun dried tomatoes I need to use up."

The chicken was very tender, the sauce was not too heavy and overall it was very tasty. I will definitely make it again but I think it may need a little something extra next time. The rave reviews are warranted unless it has been so modified it’s not the same recipe. But adding a little white wine or red pepper flakes may be all it needs. I highly recommend following it as written at least the first time you make it."
