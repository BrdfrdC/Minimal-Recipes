Also, both of us dislike soggy chips. So, I put the meat, chiles, and cheese in an oiled pie plate and baked it off. Then, topped with lettuce, tomatoes, etc. I served with the chips on the side. We both enjoyed it and I will make it again!"

The steam from the veggies and the butter will soften the chicken up and will provide ease when shredding. You can then put it into the oven for however long u want and chicken will not dry up since its coated w/ its own sauce."

"reviewBody": "I was hoping to write a glowing review of this, but I made this pretty much as written, and it was just \"pretty good\". Of course, there are a lot of variables when making nachos, so with some tweaking, this could be indeed \"killer\". The chips are a big factor - I couldn't find a 12-ounce bag exactly, so I used a 13-oz bag of 100% white corn \"restaurant style\" chips. I think fewer chips would be better, say 10-oz. And I realized that unsalted chips would also taste better, since this dish was pretty salty. I used exactly 1 tsp. of cayenne, and let the chicken marinate for a little over 15 minutes. The resulting dish wasn't very spicy, to my taste, so I think a lot more cayenne would be better, and/or more marinating time. I baked the dish for 15 minutes, but next time I'll go for the full 20. And I didn't add the recommended toppings, which I regretted - they'd really round out the dish. This was a good start though - my first nachos recipe ever."

Next time I'm thinking of baking them longer so the chips are crispier."

I also heated the chips in the oven for 5 minutes before placing toppings. Instead of using already shredded mexican cheese I used some jarred cheese sauce and added additional fresh shredded monterey jack and cheddar cheese. My family devoured this! We had never made nachos at home. We liked the fact that they didn't come out soggy. Will definitely make again using ground turkey, sausage and beef."

Get some corn tortillas and cut them into triangles. Then fry them in oil, salt and voila! Really crispy chips. THEN - my second tweek; I added Sazon Goya seasoning and some fajita seasoning as well as an onion to the chicken as I cooked it. I cooked the heck out of the chicken and chopped it very fine. Pop it in the oven, pull it out, plop some sour cream and salsa on it and WOW! Superb! Thanks again!"

"reviewBody": "YUM! Can't say enough good things about this. I just used the chicken, cheese, and chips, with no extras and it was PERFECT! I have actually made this three times in the past month since I got the recipe. Only modification was adding a tbsp of butter and some teriyaki sauce to the chicken while stir-frying to give it additional flavor. DELICIOUS!"

I think it must need much more cheese or less chips or something because ours turned out entirely too dry. We had to smother it in sour cream and salsa even to get it down, but it had a nice flavor."

We used corn chips and spicy salsa from our favorite mexican restaurant, then topped our servings with chopped cilantro, sour cream, green onions and diced tomato!! We only made one layer. If you keep everything separate, you can easily make 'fresh' nachos again the next day!"

If you like it hot you will need to add more cayenne than the recipe calls for. I did put the chicken in my food processor after browning to chop it and give it the right consistancy for eating nachos. The salsa and sour cream topping gave it the finishing touch it needed."

I added some garlic powder, minced garlic, chili powder, and cumin to the mixture too. I will probably use this method of preparing chicken for our other Mexican dishes. The flavor combination was just great. We even ate the (few) leftovers the next day, even though the chips were soggy from being in the fridge. This one's a keeper. Thanks Michelle!"
