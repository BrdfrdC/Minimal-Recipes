I used one whole Videlia onion, about 2 cups celery, and a cup of frozen peas. To really cut time as it was all I had on hand, I used pre-cooked fajita chicken strips which I chopped into small bite-size pieces. At the end I used a 12 oz package of egg noodles - which did drink a lot of the broth - but the family loves their pasta and I wanted it to go farther. I used all the other spices as listed. It took me 15 minutes to throw it together and I let it simmer for 2 hours then added pasta. Hubby is STILL raving about how it's the best soup he's ever had and what an amazing chef I am LOL!"

A whole chicken makes just the right amount for the recipe. As for the bay leaf, turns out it's optional. I forgot the bay leaf but soup tasted delicious anyway. My suggestion would be to prepare all the chopped ingredients the day or night before you want to cook. Otherwise the chopping will add another 30 minites to prep time."

The only change I made was I used Wyler's Chicken powder because I did not have the chicken bouillons. I will use chicken broth or Wyler's chicken powder in this recipe the next time I make it because in prior recipes the chicken bouillons made the taste too salty and the Wyler's was perfect . Other than using Wyler's I added more celery and carrots and cooked for about an hour . I used medium egg noodles which was added at the end for the last 10 minutes of cooking time."

It’s worth it though. Trim off all the meat and set aside. Cook the rotisserie carcass in water salted with sea salt, fresh cracked peppercorns, a few bay leaves, a red onion, carrots, and a few garlic cloves. After simmering for several hours, strain everything off. Then proceeded to make the recipe as suggested. It was very delicious."
