"reviewBody": "We followed the recipe almost to the T. I didn't have provolone, but the real mozzarella was bomb. I also didn't have basil, or Italian seasonings, so I used parsley, garlic powder and oregano. We ran out of panko, and used regular breadcrumbs. Those pieces were still good just not as good. Slicing the breasts in half was a bit tricky. I eventually got the knack. A good sharp knife is a must. The ones I messed up on just got breaded and fried (nuggets). I think letting them rest 15 is key. (I learned something new) My husband and I used teamwork to make it because we made 2 large and 1 small pan. (For a family birthday dinner+leftovers) Served it with fresh tossed salad and fettuccine. We will definitely make it again!"

The tip about leaving the breaded chicken to sit on the counter for 15 minutes before cooking was soooo helpful! I've never had more success in keeping breading on a piece of chicken before. We all agreed that this recipe is going into the rotation. It took a bit of prep time but boy-oh-boy it was so worth it! I made a total of 8 big pieces of chicken so we would have leftovers and they warmed up very nicely in our air fryer the next day for lunch. 100% recommend."

Skipped the salt &amp; pepper as a baseline for my 1st try; next time I don't think I'll skip them (or at least add some Kosher salt to the breading). Only added the basil for the last 5-7 minutes so it wouldn't burn. Didn't have any provolone, but used good quality mozzarella and nobody was the wiser (especially after liberally dusting with parmesan). 3 large breast halves, pounded out and cut in half. Plenty to serve 6 people with healthy appetites. It was a huge hit across the board, definitely adding this one to my rotation! This would also be good with red pepper flakes added, or maybe next time I can just try a spicy red sauce (I really like spicy stuff)."

It took 1 egg for every 2 breasts. I skipped the flour (not needed).

This is super simple, perfectly crispy, and a show stopper when cooking for a crowd. It’s also easy enough for a weeknight. I haven’t tried freezing the cutlets for later but it is on my list. Thanks for the great recipe."

"reviewBody": "We just got done eating this about 20 minutes ago, and it was FANTASTIC! I did have to make some alterations As I didn’t have a few of the actual listed ingredients. My subs were as follows: 1) I used a box of chicken flavored stuffing instead of Panko. I used our food ninja to make it into bread crumbs. (I was out of Panko.) 2) I didn’t have the Parmesan or the provalone cheeses but had a bag of “Italian cheese blend”. 3) I used a marinara sauce 4) I used “no yolk egg noodles. Overall, essentially the same types of ingredients, and it turned out so good that my boyfriend took one bite and his eyes were just BEAMING! He gave it a definite 2 thumbs up!!! Thank you for this recipe. I will definitely be adding it to our menu rotation! I we loved it!!!"

I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt, pepper, onion powder, dried basil and oregano; seasoned my flour with paprika, garlic. Used Rao’s brand sauce, and made a garlic bread from a fresh baguette. Delicious and my husband LOVED it."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe and I was able to make it GF/DF and it was delicious!! Used 2 slices of Violife “mature cheddar” chopped very fine (so it would melt) for the provolone. Miyokos liquid mozzarella and Violife block “parm” grated for the 3/4 cup of parm. In order to make it all hold together on top of the chicken bread breading, I put the liquid miyokos, finely chopped violife slices together in a bowl along with some dried basil, as I did not have fresh, mixed it all together and then spooned that on the breasts and sprinkled some Violife faux parm right before putting them in the oven. I also used GF bread crumbs. This is a keeper in our family."
