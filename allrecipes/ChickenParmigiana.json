The bread crumbs didn't totally stick when I shifted the chicken into the second pan, maybe I should have used egg, but it worked overall. Made a serving of Spaghetti noodles to round out the dinner. Will make again."

"reviewBody": "Used thinner chicken breasts to cut back the baking time a bit - 20 minutes breasts alone then another 20 with the sauce and cheese toppings. Or you can pound out bigger chicken breasts to make them all about the same thickness. (You may want to use a food thermometer to make sure the middle of the thickest chicken breast gets to 165 degrees.) Use lots of sauce under and on the chicken so that you have enough for your pasta as well. I also added Italian seasoning and a sprinkle of seasoned salt to the bread crumbs. Chicken came out tender and tasty!"

Seasoned panko crumbs and baked on a wire rack over a cookie sheet, about 23 minutes. Seasoned a jar of marinara and added 1/2 to a 9x13 dish. Laid the chicken on top then shredded mozzarella and fresh parmesan. Baked until bubbly, about 13 minutes. Warmed up remainder sauce to serve a few dollops on the plated chicken and vegetable spaghetti. Loved it!"

But it’s pretty good as is (which probably depends on the sauce you use since there are really no spices in the recipe) and I could throw it together, no problem."

I recommend the whole jar or equivalent to if your making homemade. The only adjustment I made was pre flouring the chicken 10 minutes before coating in the egg then I used seasoned Pablo instead of bread crumbs because that’s what we use in this house. It has a better crunch factor."

Also, chicken breast seem to come larger these days, so I had to increase the cooking time by about 25%. Otherwise, quick and easy, family loved it!"

I used 1 XL chicken thigh and cut it into 4 pieces, which cut the cooking time to 25ish mins (I left it in for 28 min which was a little too long). I also like more breading so I double battered them (which used up the entire egg perfectly). I put way too much sauce on though, I'll definitely cut that down next time. Definitely will make again though!"

I heated up the sauce on the stovetop before putting in the oven. I was short on time and wanted to be sure chicken was thoroughly cooked! Thank you for sharing your recipe. Made for an easy and delicious evening meal!"
