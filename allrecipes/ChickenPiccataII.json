I added lemon zest to the egg batter and capers at the end of cooking. I will make this again and again. Love the very lemony flavor. The chicken was so tender and I'm wondering if the lemon juice may have helped in that regard. Thank you for a great recipe it is added to our rotation."

I also double dipped the chicken in the flour mix as well (dipped in flour, dipped in egg, dipped in flour again). When the chicken was done cooking I put them in a oven set at 250 to keep them warm while I made the sauce and noodles to go with this meal. For the sauce I used 1/2 cup of chicken broth instead of using the powder. I also added half a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I put the chicken in the pan with the sauce right before serving so nothing was soggy by the time the food made it to the plate. Husband loved it! Will be making it again"

It's a minor gripe, but by the time I realized it, my hands were all covered in chicken juice, egg, and flour, and I already had two in the pan, so it was a little bit of a pain. to drop everything, wash my hands, get the flour, etc. while two chicken breasts were already overbrowning. Just a forewarning, make extra seasoned flour before you start."

Then deglaze the pan with 1/2 cup white wine (instead of water). Once the wine reduces a little, add the lemon juice and chicken base (make sure to use actual chicken base, not bouillon powder for the best flavor)\n\nFinally serve the chicken this over Capellini and steamed Asparagus, pouring the sauce over everything. \n\nWill definitely make again."

I would use double the fluids (water and lemon juice) because almost all liquid was gone and while it was good to eat on its own, I would have preferred more with the quinoa we ate on the side. Make it three times for 4 chicken breasts. You can add some white wine for the same.\n\nI further garnished with a little lemon zest and chopped cilantro."

Seriously even 15 minutes will make it more tender and juicy than you can imagine!"

The only change that I made was due to my gluten and dairy intolerance I used gluten free flour and dairy free butter. I also added a little more chicken bouillon and some salt and pepper. Paired it with fresh green beans with garlic and long grain wild rice for a perfect and quick dinner!"

I doubled the sauce and added 1 cup of white cooking wine. Cooked chicken, then put on pan to keep warm in oven. Added 1/3 of capers and 2 tsp of minced garlic to sauce. Put sauce in pan and added chicken. Sarved with pasta. Soo yummy!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe is a keeper. I however followed others suggestions such as doubling the flour, used one less chicken bouillon, and set them to rest for a bit in the fridge. I sliced two chicken breasts to make four thin slices and pretty much followed the procedure to a T. I used one chicken bouillon added the hot water and to give it a bit of extra taste added 1/2 cup of low sodium broth. To add a bit of color I sprinkled a bit of dry parsley before I put it to simmer. The chicken came out juicy and soft. Served it over thin spaghetti and it was perfect. I had only one lemon so I sprinkled a bit of lemon pepper I had to make up for the missing lemon juice. This was AMAZING will definitely make it again no doubts!"

"reviewBody": "So I made mine with turkey breast rather than chicken, I was kinda skeptical about how it would turn out because turkey can over cook so quickly. But it turned out to be the juiciest turkey I have ever eaten in my life. I think the breading helped seal in the moisture.\n\nThe sauce on the other hand I wasn't super crazy about, I cooked my sauce separately and waited until serving to pour over the meat just so it wouldn't get soggy. I followed some other reviews advice and added a bit of white wine, garlic, sugar, and cornstarch slurry, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really to my taste. I got too much of the wine flavour and not enough of the lemon.\n\nWill definitely be using the breading recipe again, but maybe with a different sauce next time."

I also made ziti noodles to go with it and boiled them in water with 2 boillion cubes to give them a chicken flavor. I used the left over grease to make a flour n milk gravy to put over the noodles. My mom loved it said thegravytasted like my great grandmas chicken gravy! :-) Great compliment!"

My only issue was, the chicken stuck to the pan and tore off the yummy coating. Anyone have a remedy for this? Im going to try to spray the pan next time before the butter. I made this with mashed potatoes and broiled asparagus. Next time I'm going to put over linguini. Absoloutely delicious!"

"reviewBody": "Just tried this recipe. I used olive oil and butter to brown the chicken. I used low sodium chicken broth instead of bouillon. I also floured the chicken, dipped in egg, then coated with the flour/paprika mixture. I browned the chicken, took it out, covered it, and made the sauce. I doubled the amount after seeing that the 1/2 cup of low sodium chicken broth was not much.(also added mushrooms)\n I used a little wine, and also thickened the sauce with cornstarch. I then returned the chicken to cook about 10 minutes. The chicken did not get soggy. It was very good. A lot of lemon flavor. My picky 25 year old son actually told me it was very good. And believe me, he doesn't dole out compliments easily."

We used chicken breasts and the parts with the coating were delicious, but most of the chicken missed out on the flavoring of the lemon juice, so we're thinking of making the chicken smaller next time so it absorbs more flavor. Overall, it was an okay dish, but it didn't have really strong flavors (which I've come to expect from recipes on this site). The flavors are more subtle in this one, but still good and yummy. I'll be adding this to our list of meals and most likely tweak it a bit in the future!"

I had to add a bit more flour mixture to make it work, so I would say 1/3 cup would have been better, and I did not flour thickly, but cutting and pounding probably added more surface area. I wish I had doubled the sauce but I was short on lemon, however I think it still turned out quite good, I just like sauce. I will, be making this recipe again soon and see if I can do a bit better with the breading not falling off in some places, as I am sure that was cooks error."
