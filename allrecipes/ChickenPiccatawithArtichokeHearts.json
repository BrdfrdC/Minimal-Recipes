My husband and I are split on this; he thought it was great (5 stars) I thought it was good but not that memorable (3 stars) so I settled in the middle at 4 stars for this review. We followed the recipe exactly except I cooked in my cast iron pan. While he was licking his plate, I was more meh. Served with mashed potatoes (that’s how the restaurant I tried this serves it) and sautéd green beans. Glad I tried! And for the record, my hubby is a fan!"

Followed the chicken searing time, but didnt get much of browning, so went a couple minutes longer. I only used 1/2 onion but increased to 3 garlic cloves. I used a Chenin Blanc white wine, squeezed fresh meyer lemon juice. Unfortunately, I forgot to reserve the artichoke liquid, but I dont think the flavor suffered. Overall I liked the recipe and will make this again when I'm in the mood for artichoke hearts."

I came across this recipe and since we love picatta and artichokes I figured this was a win and it sure was!! Family loved it and there was none left. Some things I did change however was, I doubled the amount of lemon juice, I used marinated artichoke they have more flavor and used the liqued from it. Also I saved the left over flour that was used to bread the chicken so that I can add some at the end to thicken up the sauce. I also added fresh parsley towards the end. The recipe is a keeper!"

I'm not sure I'll make it again, but I might try it with about half a can of artichokes and no artichoke juice, to give the other flavors a chance. I might try chicken breast tenders next time also, in the hope that the thinner cuts will absorb more flavor. The thick sauce was really nice, and I think this recipe has potential."

"reviewBody": "This came out pretty good. I used a full lemon and doubled the garlic powder and black pepper but otherwise followed the recipe. Also, I bought thinly sliced chicken so no meat beating required. I'm not completely sure about timings since my chicken browned much faster than 2 minutes per side and my onions started becoming brown instead of translucent so I dumped the wine in fairly soon after seeing that. The wine also evaporated much faster. I ended up eyeballing it. I'm pretty new to cooking so maybe I did something wrong, but it came out delicious despite that! Next time I might try without the butter. The flavor is good but I want to have it be a bit healthier."

Otherwise my sauce was as described in the recipe. I served it over linguine seasoned with ghee and minced garlic. The final step only took a few minutes as all I had to do was brown the chicken and add the sauce. Awesome!"

I made no intentional changes (I didn't have capers but used peppercorns in brine which is similar and my artichokes were in oil with seasonings but I rinsed that off). But even with those differences the flavor was wonderful. Will definitely make this again!! Thanks"

"reviewBody": "This dish would have been a five if it had called for baby artichokes. I used just one large Breast and cut it laterally for 2 servings, I don't know what their feeding chickens now but the chicken breasts are getting enormous! I cooked this for two and it was plenty. I did however make the sauce as printed and it was plenty for linguini too. I used the quarter cup of capers but not the brine they were soaked in, too salty and strong. I also did not add any artichoke liquid for the same reason. After I added my wine and reduced it, I added 2 TBS of fresh cream, brought it back up to a simmer and added my chicken and chokes and served it over linguini. \nWe go to Italy every year in April while the artichokes are in full season, but not the tourists. Every restaurant in Rome has a dozen ways to fix them plus a house special. With this dish they would use the baby chokes, sliced in half, choke removed and then saute it with the sauce till tender, a lot of Romans will just get a huge plate of the baby chokes and forget the rest."

For the sauce I did NOT add the juice of the capers(unless you want it to taste like very strong dill pickles), or the artichoke juice. I did add fresh thyme, oregano,basil, salt and pepper. It just needed more flavor and these did the trick. Added a few sun-dried tomatoes and just added more or less of the wine/lemon/chicken broth until I got the flavor I wanted."

I like my onions to be more roasted than translucent so I pan roasted half a large Vidalia. I also added pan seared baby Bella mushrooms. I used chicken thighs and kept them warm in the oven until serving time so the coating stayed nice and crispy. The richer flavor of the thighs was nicely paired with the lemon sauce."

Saute shallots, garlic, mushrooms melted butter with leftover flour and zest and juice of a lemon, with the capers after the wine reduction. DELICIOUS!
