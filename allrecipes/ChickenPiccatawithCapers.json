"reviewBody": "Really liked it. Had all the ingredients. Needed minor tweaking so I couldn't do 5 stars. Once I tasted the overwhelming lemon flavor, I tweaked it and ended up cooking the sauce down for about 6-7 minutes. Added shallots, extra garlic (lots), freshly ground pepper and about 1/4 cup chicken broth. Last couple minutes I remembered I had mushrooms so added a few. Only thing I will remember to do next time is to put the chicken back into the sauce for a minute to warm it back up. I also used brown rice flour instead of all purpose and really love how light of texture it gives to the chicken. Its undetectable but adds something."

The sauce was still too brothy so I stirred in cornstarch and water to make it more of a gravy. I also followed the suggestion of another reviewer and put the whole chicken breasts back in the sauce to finish cooking. The chicken was super tender and really absorbed the flavors of the sauce. I served it with buttered egg noodles. Will definitely make this again!!!!"

Since Iâ€™m trying to eat lower carb, I served it over spaghetti squash (as pictured) which ended up being a good idea."

Made a few tweaks though to perfect it... when coating the chicken I scrambled up to eggs to soak them in first then placed them moist chicken in a Ziploc bag with the flour, added 1/2 cup Parmesan, 2 tbsp of seasoned salt, and a cup of panko bread crumbs. Once the chicken was done and set aside, I let some mushrooms sautÃ© right before adding in the rest of the sauce ingredients. To the sauce I added 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream, a touch of the liquid from the caper jar, and a dash of corn starch to thicken it up a bit..... Turned out AMAZIINNGGGGg!!!

I cut the wine 1/4 cup, 1/8 cup lemon juice, 1 tablespoon capers, 1 tablespoon garlic. I added 1 teaspoon paprika and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon fresh ground pepper to the flour. \nTurned out incredibly well. Will make this over again.\nReminds me of my German experience."

I cut the lemon juice by half, used smaller chicken breasts and cut them in smaller pieces, I tripled the sauce and cooked the chicken in the sauce. Just before serving, I added corn starch to thicken the sauce. Of course I doubled the capers. : ) This recipe is better the next day as leftovers."

We love the taste of capers, it combines beautifully with the sauce and chicken. The chicken came out tender and moist. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans. Thank you Sandra1980!"

I used frozen chicken tenders (a cheat) and after defrosting tenderized them between two sheets of waxed paper with a mallet. \n\nI didn't have white wine and used white wine vinegar instead. The sauce was quite tart so I may cut the lemon next time."

With the size of supermarket breasts these days, I had to double the sauce ingredients just to have enough. I would have cut the breasts in half had I thought of it. They were enormous. It would have fed a minimum of six people with leftovers."

Haven't changed a thing, comes out perfect every time! However sometimes for faster cooking I will use chicken tenders vs chicken breasts."

The only thing I did differently was I cooked the sauce and chicken together instead of taking out the chicken and pouring the sauce later. I think it allowed the chicken to absorb more of the flavor. Anyway, give it a try because this is a winner!"

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe without dredging the chicken in flour (as I was looking to make a grain free dish). I sauteed seasoned chicken tenderloins in coconut oil.\nI served it over baked spaghetti squash with a little shredded parmesan on top. Both my husband and I found the sauce to be too lemony and/or tart. However, it was a good base. I will make it again, but next time I will probably cut the lemon in half, decrease the capers and add some butter (which perhaps I was missing because I didn't cook the chicken in butter).\nThanks for sharing this."
