"reviewBody": "Very tasty dish. I used homemade chicken stock instead of the granules. (guests were late so it was on stove much longer than the recipe called for) so the liquid reduced substantially. I kept adding chicken stock and the result was a very lemony sauce, and I added a bit of lemon zest as well. Goes terrifically with capers. \nLoved it. Will make this again."

I used Pinot Grigio and it was just too bitter and not a great flavor. Perhaps white wine works better or maybe adding more water and less wine. Otherwise was great"

I made half again the recipe because it's a little small for four people, and when I made it half as much again, it was about perfect for four. It could easily be doubled. For white wine, I used Pinot Grigio"

"reviewBody": "I made a mix of this recipe with the Quick Chicken Piccata recipe from this site. I pounded the chicken so it was very thin so cooking time was around 2 minutes per side. I didn't have lemon-pepper seasoning, so I put lemon zest into the flour with pepper and cayenne pepper. I used 1/3 cup of lemon juice, 1/4 cup of water, 3TBS cold, unsalted butter; and I added a bunch of parsley on top for serving. It is really a combination of both recipes. Everyone liked it; two asked for the recipe. Oh, I also added a c an of cut-up artichoke hearts."
