I boiled my chicken and vegetables in chicken broth with my seasonings already added and drained them into a large measuring cup to use for my rue. After a put the chicken and vegetables in the dish, I sprinkled a small layer of parmesan cheese before I added the liquid. I also took someone's tip and used egg white on the top and bottom of crust. It was my first attempt at a pot pie, but my family insists I make it again! ♥️"

I added approx 3 cups Frozen, Costco Veggies and onions to the veggie/chicken pot and kept the water in. I didn't have extra chicken broth, so I added a teaspoon of Better than Bouillon Beef Broth mix and about a cup of water, stirred till thick. Then, I added the chicken/veggie mix on the pre-baked bottom crust, and rolled out the top pie crust. I sprinkled a garlic seasoning on the crust. Baked as normal. NO ONE could tell the difference in texture or taste, and was much healthier. We all ate the leftovers for breakfast as it was SO good!"

I prepare that first by removing both. Placing them on tinfoil lined baking sheet with salt and roasting. The chicken skin can be a crispy treat for the chef or a nice bit of cracklin as garnish. The bones are also a tasty morsel for anyone Whos eagerly waiting. Ultimately your going to want to save the render chicken fat and substitute it for the butter in the rue. It literally tastes like Marie Calendar. Your welcome!"

"reviewBody": "I think this is a wonderful recipe that can be modified depending on what you have available. I had leftover rotisserie chicken that I used and I cut it into small pieces. Are used chicken bouillon so I took one of those big cubes that you use with 2 cups of water and I put it in 1 and 3/4 c water, then, after it dissolved, I added the milk to it. While I was sautéing onions, and celery, I added the flour to the boullion and milk mixture since it was cooled down some. Whisked that well, then added that to my celery and onions that I was sautéing in the butter. I cheated and used a ready-made piecrust. One of the key things to not have a soggy crust, is to add your ingredients into the pie crust right before you are going to put it in the preheated oven. Delicious. Rotisserie chicken added good flavor and wasn’t soaked chicken from boiling."

"reviewBody": "This is a great recipe! The sauce is a perfect consistency. I added more carrots, more peas, mushrooms and corn which balanced the meat to veggie ratio. It also makes everything thicker and the slices stand on their own a bit more. Otherwise it can get mushy and its hard to get a good slice that hold up. Husband commented that its all about the crust! We use Pillsbury crust. We did ours in a ceramic pie pan which probably makes a difference on how firm it cooks. The aluminum pans probably would make the crust more brown and hard. We will experiment more with this recipe for sure!"

Water (didn't have chicken stock on hand) Added canned potatoes, cubed Premade pie crust. Followed the first step with onions (+celery) butter, flour.. I combined everything in a big pan first, it was super thick and creamy, then poured into pie base, and topped with the second pie crust. Forked holes in top. I didn't consider the amount of salt in the ingredients so I did over salt (should not have added any additional) the leftovers will be good though.. This was so good, first time I ever made this on my own, and haven't had a pot pie since I was a kid. Your recipe gave me confidence that I could do it. Thanks! This to me is a true pot pie, I live in amish country and they consider the noodle dish to be a pot pie.. Definately will make more of your dishes!"

"reviewBody": "I followed the recipe halfway, I made the following optional changes and it came out flavorful, delicious and the crust was perfect and not soggy. -I did not boil the chicken and I did 1.5. pounds; I grilled it with garlic powder and any chicken seasoning ( or you can stove top it) then I chopped it up into bite size pieces and set it aside until later. -I added butter to a skillet with minced garlic then added the sliced carrots and celery. I let that cook and at the end I added frozen green peas and a small can of corn- drained. Once this cooked I added in the chopped up grilled chicken and tossed it around then set on a low setting to keep warm. - I used half and half instead of milk- it came out creamy and perfect texture. Once this mixture was all put togethor at the right consistency I added the following seasonings: cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, paprika and a little nutmeg. I eyeballed these seasonings and did taste test. I highly suggest adding additional seasoning then what the recipe calls for. -I did a egg white wash on the bottom crust before I added the filling to avoid soggy crust. Then when I added the top crust I did a final egg wash again. - I let it sit for a minimum 15 min before cutting into it so it held it's form well and it didn't fall apart."

I also suggest using rotisserie chicken as a time saver and adds phenomenal flavor! I sautéed my onion and celery together, then after you create the “sauce” add the frozen peas, carrots, and rotisserie till heated through. Once your mixture is completed add to the pie crust. Then to prevent the pie crust edges from over cooking, line the edges with tin foil and then uncover for the last 10 minutes of cooking."

"reviewBody": "I don't understand the complaints about this recipe. If you actually read the whole thing, it says in the beginning to add thyme, poultry seasoning, and mushrooms for more flavor which I did on my own anyway. Also, I deglazed the mushroom pan with white wine, added a bit of stock, and roasted the chicken first. Idk, a boiled chicken just doesn't sound flavorful to me although most of the other recipes also say to boil. I gave this a 4 because I feel they should have just added the thyme, poultry seasoning, and mushrooms from the get go to the recipe. But, maybe they just didn't want the recipe to seem like it had too many ingredients . Also, to me if I feel something seems lacking in a recipe, I just add it in. The world will not come to an end. Thank you for this great recipe. Salute!"

Pre-packaged pie crust saved time and work, brush with egg white to keep crust from being soggy. Yes, I added more seasonings, It's a good idea to taste as you cook."

Instead of boiling the chicken, carrots, peas and celery I sautéed them in a little olive oil until the chicken was done, then stirred in the flour, salt, pepper, plus dried tarragon, thyme, and a small bit of sage. After that cooked for two to three minutes, I added the broth and milk and simmered until thickened. The gravy was very tasty. I also brushed the interior crust with egg whites and used an egg wash on top. Thanks for the great ideas!"

"reviewBody": "I made this for Christmas, as my husband requested a homemade chicken pot pie. This was a terrific base, but I did make a number of additions and changes, as did most reviewers. Firstly, I made the filling in advance and kept overnight in fridge to meld all the flavors. I used cream instead of milk. I used chicken broth to boil the chicken and veggies, then saved that broth to use as the recipe later directed. I did not have celery seeds, but thought the original recipe lacked in seasoning, so I added a dash of Worcestershire sauce, a teaspoon of tarragon, a teaspoon of poultry seasoning, sprinkled in some dried parsley, fresh ground pepper and Himalayan Pink Salt. I made a homemade pie crust, a recipe I got on YT, using AP Flour, Canola Oil, salt and boiling water -- that's it! The crust was excellent. My family loved this dish for Christmas, perfect holiday comfort food during the cold, winter months."

"reviewBody": "As a BASE recipe, this is fine. However, there are definitely not enough seasonings in this recipe, so double (or triple) to taste and add whatever savory seasonings you'd add to a chicken soup (sage, poultry seasoning, whatever you have that would go well with a cream sauce). I made this as is out of curiosity and it was SO bland. We changed a few things about this recipe and we loved it! 1. I increased the butter/flour to 1/2 cup each so I didn't have that annoying bit of butter left over. Since you're going to have more roux, increase the chicken stock to 2 cups and the milk to 1 cup. 2. I did not boil the filling (chicken and veggies) in water. Why boil it in water, drain away some of the nutrients, and then add in chicken stock? I boiled it in enough chicken stock to cover, adding the seasonings while it cooked, removed after it was cooked through, strained it into a large measuring cup, and then used that cooking liquid as the chicken stock for the gravy. I did have a little more stock than I needed, but the leftovers would make a great base for ramen or a smaller serving of soup. 3. I cooked the roux a little longer, until it smelled nice and nutty. 4. MIX THE CHICKEN, VEGGIES, AND GRAVY BEFORE YOU PUT IT IN THE PAN. Just pouring the gravy over the veggies is going to leave dry spots and if you try to mix it up, you risk tearing the pie crust dough. just toss the filling in with the gravy, mix it all up, and scoop it out into the crust. 5. If you don't feel like making an actual pie, you can always cook the filling a little longer (temp check your chicken), do everything up to the gravy, throw some biscuits in the oven and make inside out chicken pot pie :)"

"reviewBody": "This was the best chicken pot pie I have ever made or tasted. Very easy to make and very flavorful. Since I always buy 2% milk, I adjusted the milk ingredient with 1/3 2% milk and 1/3 heavy cream. I used the Pillsbury crust in the box for my top crust and pinched with the pointer and middle finger knuckles for a beautiful pie crust finish."

"reviewBody": "Chicken was previously cooked. I used one package of mixed vegetables, some chopped onion, and a few brocolli flowerettes. No celery. I did not make a separate roux. I mixed flour with some of the hot liquid to temper it, added the milk and mixed until it was all blended. Then added it to the chicken mixture. I made my own pastry and put an egg wash on top. It was enough for more than a 9\" pie. I baked it more than 35 minutes at 400 in a glass pie plate."
