I added extra garlic - because I LOVE garlic, and doubled the peppers, because I had extra that I needed to use up before they went bad. I put in some fresh Thai Basil from my garden."

The second time I made it, I used about half of the cream cheese (roughly 4oz. instead of 8 oz.) and I liked it better this way because more of the parmesan cheese flavor came through. The sauce was still rich but not overly so. Definitely will continue to make this-so easy too!"

"reviewBody": "Delicious! I did make a few minor changes...I only used 1/2 cup butter total. 1/4 cup for the chicken/veggies and 1/4 cup to make the alfredo sauce. I used a whole 8oz. pkg, of sliced mushrooms (I used baby bella), 4oz. cream cheese and only used part of the other cup of heavy cream (just enough to thin the sauce out a bit). I guess you could just say that I halved the sauce. The sauce was so good that I was afraid to ruin it by adding the egg, so I omitted it, lol. It was still plenty for 1# of pasta. This had a really great flavor, and I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)"
