Perfection. Great recipe. Thanks!"

Used celery seed and a dash of celery salt for the celery and real mayo, no lite mayo on hand either. Still tasted good, I've never had any luck with chicken and tuna salads with getting the taste I am looking for, but as others have said, the mayo to chicken ratio must be the key! Thanks for the post."

Then I used half mayo and half miracle whip to give it a little more zest. I also added 1 1/2 tsps. of cranberry mustard from Hickory Farms. Instead of onion powder, I used about a 1/4 cup of real onion, and instead of pickles, I chopped up about 10 mild pepper rings (the kind that are already cut up in the jar). This added a different flavor that complimented the other flavors well. I kept the celery the same. I'm not one for measuring so my measurements are approximations, but it turned out great!"

I think I'll be using this for my recipe from now on and mixing in what I need to when I want to."

I didn't use celery, didn't have any, but the relish picked up the \"crunch\" factor. Will try adding other items as the reviews suggest. Thanks for the basics."

Also have used green grapes in place of raisins. My hubby does not like it with the raisins, grapes and nuts however. He has NO sense of adventure in his food! Sometimes I make two different batches of things.. his way, and mine! Oh how we do love to please our guys!"

Before adding the mayo, I tossed the \"shredded\" chicken with 2 TBS of Italian dressing. After adding the mayo I threw in a handful of toasted almond slivers and \"ta-dah\" the flavor could not be matched. I will make often and perhaps add some sliced grapes when I have some available. Thanks for the post."

I also used REAL Mayo, 2 finely chopped green onion, shredded the chicken,mixed together with spoon ,then I added Lawry's to taste. It's better if you let this set overnight in the fridge or at least 4 hours,so that it's not only cold,but well blended. Great for sandwiches,on trisket,or such crackers,or on celery. Could be used many ways."
