I added 1/4 cup of roasted pecans (five minutes at 350°). I used an organic peeled + chopped “pink lady” apple. I left out the celery, because I didn’t have any, + I added a handful of low sugar, dried cranberries. I mixed 2Tbsp.Chipotle aïoli with a 1/4 cup of Mayo + added 1/2 tsp. “Everything bagel” seasoning. \nI plan on taking it on a canoe trip, and wrapping this delicious chicken salad, in low carb wraps. So yummy and easy!! \nThank you!"

I picked up a few other ideas that seemed like excellent substitutions for my tastes so I omitted the onion, used Craisins instead of grapes, Gala apples and opted for glazed walnuts. Super easy and the taste was fabulous. I am definitely adding this recipe to my \"go to\" book. This would be a fabulous salad to take as a \"dish to pass\" - eaten just as is, on a bed of lettuce or on any type of sandwich roll."

However, I did substitute yogurt ranch dressing and cut back on the onion as others suggested. I also added a bag of cranberries &amp; honey glazed walnut mixture. Came out very good. Will definitely make this again, but will be sure to have all the ingredients!"

"reviewBody": "Delicious!! This tastes VERY similar to the chicken salad they make at Arby's, which is exactly what I was looking to duplicate - thanks! As other reviewers mentioned, I left out the Miracle Whip and I just doubled the mayo instead. Such a versatile recipe - leave out what you don't like or substitute with ingredients you do like. You can't go wrong with this one, it's a keeper!"

I think it's the extra sweetness of the yogurt and the balance of simple flavors that really sets this recipe apart from the dozens i have tried. I make the recipe as written and agree with other reviewers that you wouldn't need the Miracle Whip if you didn't have it."

Put in 1/2 of small red onion and it's not overwhelming. This was delicious. I also used 10 Tbsp of olive oil mayo instead of using 5 miracle whip and 5 mayo. Will definitely make this again."

OK I had to change it but the original recipe is a perfect standard to work from. The yogurt was a healthy, delicious option. Will make it again and with all the recipe ingredients."
