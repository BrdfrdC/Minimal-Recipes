This will be made again, this time for the 6 servings and maybe some cheese. That was last night, I forgot to submit. I made it AGAIN for the 2nd night in a row. I added some cubed cheddar cheese and a little onion powder to the dressing."

"reviewBody": "This was very tasty, and my husband and son gave it 2 thumbs up. Next time I make it, I think I’ll decrease the mayo to 1/2 cup instead of 3/4. The tomato in the recipe adds extra moisture so the overall consistency was a bit too juicy for my taste. Also, I think I’ll chill it for a bit longer, which may absorb some of the liquid. I used Vidalia onion instead of green, bacon bits instead of strips. I’ll use bacon strips next time to give it a bigger bacon punch, although this recipe would be tasty even without bacon. Great summer salad."

The only thing I found was it was a little thick, so added a bit more lemon juice to thin it out a bit. I also skipped the avocado as this is something I'm not that big a fan of.\n\nIf you want to make this a touch healthier, substitute Plain Greek Yogurt for the mayo. I just made a batch of the dressing with yogurt, juice of half a lemon and 1% milk to get the consistency right and it is superb! In a carton in my fridge for lunch salads and a veggie dip!\n\nThanks for a great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Of course I couldn't follow the recipe. Is that even allowed? No romaine in the house. I was really looking for a recipe that I could use up the chicken I had thawed for last night and not cooked. Since we were going for a bike ride, it had to be picnic-able, so I went for a chicken salad. I marinaded my chicken breasts for 45 minutes or so in lemon juice with a dash of Worcestershire, then grilled and diced them.I burned the bacon because I was trying to do too many things at once, but it didn't hurt anything. I did have parsley, green onions, and tomato, so I used them along with some red cabbage that clamored to be included. No mayo, so the dressing became a dash of brown mustard, a couple dollops of miracle whip, some Ken's Vidalia Onion dressing, and some Beets All Ranch dressing. Added some grated parmesan just because parmesan. At the picnic table we wrapped them in tortillas and devoured them. Thanks for the inspiration and guidance! My wife insisted that I add this to my favorites."

It was flavorful, moist, and we enjoyed it, but it lacked any boldness. I think we will make it again and will consider either cayenne added to the mayo or a few chopped jalapenos."

Great with Thanksgiving/Christmas dinner as you can add in the turkey/chicken scraps from the giblets.\n\nThe ingredients are very simple but they marry beautifully with each other. I always loved tomato with mayo as the acidity cuts through the fattiness."

I went by the recipe and thought it needed a little more seasoning and I added in some garlic and onion powders. I didn't have avocado but I know it would of been delicious in this. I let it sit about 45 min. before eating and it was nice a flavorful and I loved the bacon in it. I will be having the leftovers today for lunch. I think this would be delicious served in tortillas layered with lettuce, if you wanted something a little more filling. I do think next time I will also replace a little bit of the mayo with sour cream. Overall it was great! Thank you for the recipe!"

I made just a few small changes: I used 1 tsp. dried parsley and 1 tablespoon chopped green onion instead of 2 (I'm not a huge fan of strong onion flavor). I cooked my chicken in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes. I used 3 boneless breasts (trimmed and tenderized just a little with a meat mallet) and drizzled with olive oil, seasoned with salt &amp; pepper. it turns out firm but tender. I like chunks in my chicken salad."
