I used fresh basil leaves from my herb garden instead of the sage --it was a wonderful substitution. Also, I made half the sauce amount and it seemed adequate. I just wish thin slices of prosciutto were less delicate to handle and wouldn't keep breaking up as I work with it. Great for low carb watchers!"

We used large sage leaves from our erb garden. They were a little too pungent but probably because they were cooked within minutes of picking. We will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!"

I did use fresh basil leaves to get the look of the sage leaves. I dusted the tops with a small amount of Italian bread crumbs and put that side down first in the hot oil. The gravy topping is important so I made a corn starch/water mixture and put that in the drippings with enough chicken stock to make all the sauce I knew my family would want. Delicious!!"
