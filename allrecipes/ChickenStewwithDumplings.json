My dumplings always take a little longer to get done, and usually have to almost double the chicken broth to have enough liquid to continue the cooking of the dumplings. It still comes out like a stew consistency, and add a pinch more thyme and basil to account for the extra broth I add. Family and friends love this dish!"

I used 2 cups of sliced carrots and 3 cartons of chicken broth and I large onion and 3 celery stalks. Added minced garlic when frying the onion and celery. Used 4 chicken breasts ( feeding 4 people). Also added in some sage along with alI the spices listed. Found dumplings did float but were mushy. Not sure what the secret is to making dumplings as I followed the recipe. I would recommend making this."

"reviewBody": "Really like this warm and hearty stew. Made a couple simple changes for what I had in the house. Made the entire thing in my instant pot. Used my pressure cooker to cook about 1lb of chicken thighs with a splash of chicken broth and some Trader Joe’s 21 seasoning salute, removed from pot and shredded as recommended. Removed the residual liquid and added the butter, then in same pot, sautéed the celery, onion, and added fresh carrot at this stage. When soft added 2 cloves of garlic and sautéed briefly. Then pretty much followed the rest of the recipe as stated. For the mixed frozen veggies I used peas and corn. Instead of dill in the biscuit mix I added fresh chopped parsley. You may need to add more liquid than stated in the recipe depending on how thick you like things. I used. 32oz carton instead of 24. The biscuits seem to absorb quite a lot of fluid. Great dish!!"

Rather than cook dumplings, as I was concerned that I wouldn’t have enough time to cook long them long enough to not be doughy, I baked 3 cans store bought buttermilk biscuits and served the stew over biscuits."

"reviewBody": "This has become something I make on the regular now. \n\nI skip the frozen veggies -- usually because I forget, though I have remembered to add frozen peas towards the end and it's always nice. \n\nOtherwise, the recipe works really well as-is. I love the rotisserie chicken shortcut and the amount of seasoning is pretty well balanced. I'm not an experienced cook so the first time I made it didn't realize that to make the roux come together I needed to start adding the chicken broth/stock. \n\nI don't bother adding dill to the dumplings -- personal preference -- but beyond that, I strongly recommend following the instructions for making the dumplings as they're written. They come out perfect and fluffy every time. They even freeze well. When I've re-heated from a thawed batch (in a saucepan, I've never done it in the microwave) the dumplings remain lively and don't turn into doughy golf balls."

"reviewBody": "I followed the majority of this recipe. I had thawed out chicken and turkey and in the end, I decided to try the turkey instead; very tasty. This stew has a nice thick gravy, exactly what I like. The dumplings were mixed in the food processor as well but I cooked the stew in a pressure cooker. I'm not sure just how much time I saved or if it would have turned out any differently if I'd cooked it on the stove or in the slow cooker (what I usually would have used). As I used turkey, I also added some sage and poultry seasoning. I will definitely be making this again, maybe chicken next time."

I like my stew creamy so I used a full stick of butter, a half cup of flour, 3/4 cup whole milk, and 32oz chicken stock and it made a nice creamy sauce for the stew. I used golden potatoes, a bunch of fresh carrots and a bag of frozen corn. Dumplings I made exactly with just a bit less dill. Yum!!"

I took a few tips from the recipe and used the same spices and made the roux. I used carrots, celery, and onion. I made my own stock from a left over Turkey carcass. Even though I took many liberties, I gave five stars because the dumplings were perfect. This recipe had been saved."

I left out potatoes and used frozen bag of mixed veggies. I thicken it a bit with 2T cornstarch and 1/4 water. I kept adding spices until it tasted to our liking, more salt, celery salt, garlic powder and a little rosemary.It was an easy recipe for a fairly skilled cook. It's a comfort food for sure in this cold weather."

I held back on the amount of dill in the dumplings, thinking it would be overpowering, but it wasn't very noticeable. And, I liked the flavour of the roux, but it was rather thick after the dumplings were done, so I wonder if that initial roux could be skipped. I might use rotisserie chicken, but it is nice to cook the chicken in the stew, so I used cubed breasts this time."

"reviewBody": "I doubled the low sodium broth and veggies because there was so much chicken, which meant I had to double the butter and flour for the roux too. I was able to leave out the salt, basil and thyme because I simmered the chicken carcasses in the broth for 30 minutes first. That gave the broth more than enough salt and flavor. Added a bay leaf because I could. I never made dumplings before. My lesson learned is stick to the rounded T. not do the heaping T.! They were nice and airy inside. It's cold and snowing outside and this was a nice comfort food dinner. My family loved it. The only time consuming and messy part was pulling apart the rotisserie chickens. This dish was well worth it though. The recipe is going into my box of favorites."
