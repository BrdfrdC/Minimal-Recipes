"reviewBody": "Per other comments, I was wary about this dish being salty. Consequently, I used 1/3 cup soy sauce and 1/3 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce to make the marinade. I marinated the cubed chicken in a plastic bag, draining it well before cooking the meat. When I returned the vegetables to the cooked chicken in my wok, I used about 1/2 of the reserved sauce. Also, while reheating the veggies with the chicken, rather than add more of the marinade, I put in about 1/4 cup of orange juice. Hubby really liked this served with white rice. I will make it again, keeping in mind the need to use reduced-sodium soy sauce."

"reviewBody": "It was good and easy to make. I used precut chicken breasts. I didn't have any sesame oil so I used olive oil instead. \nTo make the sauce, I followed the directions but used powdered ginger instead of fresh. I did add 1 TBS hoisin sauce to give it more flavor.\nI used frozen stir fry vegetables that included Italian green beans, carrots, water chestnuts, corn, red peppers, and broccoli. I served it over Jasmine rice."

"reviewBody": "I make this 2-3 times a month now, and everyone loves it! Even my picky niece (she's 6) eats this and asks for more! \n\nAs far as the recommended ingredients, I use them all, and throw whatever else I have in the fridge: bok choy, extra broccoli, baby corn, fresh water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, and the occasional mushroom as well - yum. \n\nAlso, I almost always end up with WAY more than 6 servings. This one improves with age, by the way - I mean, it's always tastier the second day.\n\nOne thing I learned from experience: I tend to double the corn starch (I like a thicker sauce), fry the veggies first and let the moisture drain from them, then, I fry the meat and onions, to control the amount the sauce is diluted. When finished, I put the veggies back in, with the marinade, then add back veggie liquid to desired consistency."

Since I sometimes am delayed in starting dinner, I have decided that next time I make this recipe (and I'm positive I will) I will chop the vegetables and prepare the chicken earlier in the day and have them ready, and perhaps even make the sauce in advance as well. Doing so would make putting this recipe together unbelievably easy."
