"reviewBody": "I made this, just as written, last night for dinner. It was WONDERFUL!! There are just two of us so I split the ingredients in half and it was still too much. We each had one (large) stuffed Poblano and I'll see how the extra pepper halves and chicken mixture works after being baked another night. ONLY concern is the waste of Rotel and canned black beans when halving the recipe. BUT ...... the flavor is wonderful. Don't change ANYTHING until you try it as written. Next time I will use Hungarian paprika to add a bit more kick."
