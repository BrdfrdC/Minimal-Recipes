After reading several of the reviews, I opted to double the batch, using 3 lb of boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of chicken breast, and added 1 lb of extra small peeled and deveined shrimp. Used Limeade rather than lemonade. Tasted halfway through, and was a bit bland. So, I added lime juice, cumin and paprika to taste. Let the sauce cook away, and this made a tremendous flavored filling.\n\nServed with chopped red onion, guacamole, sour cream, mild cheddar, lettuce, and choice of sriacha and verde sauce.\n\nThis is now going into my keeper recipes and will get added into rotation of meals for me and my boys."

When I reheated the next day, I shredded the meat and then added a little chicken broth.to keep it moist as it reheated. Thanks s dish was a HUGE hit at my Taco bar party!"

I also swapped out the lemonade for 1/2 cup lemonade, 1/2 cup water. Next time, I'll increase the lemonade so the citrus flavor will come through a little stronger. Do what other reviewers have also said- let the \"sauce\" reduce to almost nothing. Wonderful!"

A lot of chopping and dicing, then waiting for the chicken to cook on the stove, then the assembly of the tacos -- I would not call this quick . But it does taste good once you assemble everything. One way to make it quick and easy for a weeknight dinner would be to chop and prepare the ingredients ahead of time and refrigerate them until needed. Then just assemble the tacos and reheat."

"reviewBody": "I would give this 5 stars, but I kind of altered this recipe more than normal so I will give it 4. I don't know how it would taste as is..but I think Worchestershire sauce is gross soooooo.....\nI used a about a teaspoon of Mccormick taco seasonsing instead...I mixed that, the lemonade (I used that Simply Lemonade) lime juice, the taco seasoning, garlic power, onion powder, olive oil and about a teaspoon of sugar. I marinated the chicken with this for about 30 minutes then put it all in pan and simmered down until it was cooked. \nOn a side note...I sauteed mushrooms with a little garlic salt, olive oil and a little whipped butter to serve with it and my boyfriend literally ate 3 tacos and all the mushrooms before I even sat down with mine. \nHope this helps and enjoy!"

Boy was I wrong, The The Worcester sauce made the chicken taste like beef which clashed with lemon and lime flavors. The meal had a dirty confusing taste that was barely palatable. I would have had a more balanced and enjoyable meal if I went to Taco Bell. The food was edible but not enjoyable. Next time i'll read more negative reviews before deciding on a meal."

Laying the tortillas on a hot(electric) burner for a few seconds will give them a nice charred effect. Be careful tho! Lift off with a metal spatula. Wanted to add Avocado but forgot to buy a ripe one!"

Cooked it on high for 4 hours, but of course not enough liquid evaporated in the crock pot. Had to simmer it on the stove for about 10 minutes to boil it off. Kids liked it a lot, though! I might try again with just the juices and no water. I also added 1T. chili powder for a little kick, and I might add more next time."

"reviewBody": "I heavily modified this recipe because I didn't like the artificial, acerbic flavors of the garlic and onion powder or the Worcestershire sauce. Instead I put the sliced chicken in a bath of lemon juice (2 lemons per whole chicken breast,) cumin (3tbs,) paprika (1tbs,) cilantro (2tbs,) and 2 cloves minced garlic. I'm not against adding a lime, but they are expensive and I don't really taste it over the lemon juice. Even better would be to use fresh cilantro but I don't often have it on-hand. Then the whole thing goes in the skillet for about 6 minutes. I really try hard not to overcook the chicken because everybody hates dry chicken tacos."
