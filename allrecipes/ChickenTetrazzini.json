While cooking pasta noodles I mixed the soup, condensed milk, mushrooms, salt, pepper, celery salt and 4 oz shredded cheddar cheese all together. After realizing I didn’t have an onion I used a tablespoon of onion powder, I also added a teaspoon of garlic powder, I also put a cup of frozen peas in it. After mixing everything up it was sort of dry looking so I added a second can of cream of chicken soup and it seemed much better. I baked it for 30 minutes took it out stirred it put 4 oz mozzarella cheese on top sprinkled some grated Parmesan on top of mozzarella then sprinkled a little paprika to add a little color baked it an additional 15 minutes. Everyone in the household liked it and told me to save the recipe to fix it again."

Also, to keep things healthy, I’ve used brown rice and ground turkey versus beef and white rice as a variation in the past. I also think it taste better with cheese. When I think of French onion, I think of French onion soup, and provolone cheese on top is a nice addition."

Oven time can be reduced a few minutes as the noodles were a little too soft even after cooking al dente. This was easy to throw together but even with the added seasonings it was lacking. Adding veggies would help give more flavor as well as a boost in nutrition."

"reviewBody": "This is an awesome, easy, and quick recipe. It is pretty much foolproof, even for noob like me. I used rotisserie chicken for the chicken and seasoned to taste. I think next time (and there will definitely be a next time!) I will cover the dish for the first 30 minutes or so because the cheese on top got hard and dried out baking that long . Still tasted great!\n\nFor all the people who complain about a dish being \"bland\" on this recipe and others, it is kind of an unwritten rule that you are to adjust the seasoning of the dish to your taste. Recipes are written bland because it is easier to fix a bland dish than one that is too salty or spicy. The recipe gives you a general guide to the proportions and you are to adjust it to your liking. Use your own tastebuds as a guide."

"reviewBody": "This dish got some great reviews from my teens! They declared that they like this better than regular spaghetti :) ....I tried this recipe as I was looking for a creative way to use a large amount of left-over spaghetti, and this worked excellently! Because the spaghetti was left-over, it was already covered in a light amount of marinara sauce; this turned out to blend with the other flavors very well. It did mean that I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken, as I thought it would blend better. I also used garlic salt (instead of celery salt), again to blend well with the marinara flavor. I added extra cheese, using a full 2 cups inside, as well as the one cup on top, and covered everything in bread crumbs so I didn't get the burnt-cheese look from everyone's pictures. I will definitely keep this recipe on hand, and would recommend it to anyone who has a large amount of left-over pasta to use. (I really don't think that the shape would matter.) ADDENDUM: Tonight I tried this recipe slightly differently: The author suggested that the recipe could be used very well with left-over holiday turkey, and I would like to say that it is excellent this way! I made the recipe pretty much as written, just substituting the turkey, except that I still do like to use 2 cups of cheese inside! A topping idea for everyone: Again because I had some left-over from holiday meals, I decided to sprinkle French's Crispy Fried Onion Rings on top. (A half-can covers spar"

Added a little poultry seasoning to the mixture and topped the casserole with some French fried onions for the last ten minutes just because my family likes them as a casserole topping. No leftovers ..I did good ! Thank you for this recipe. I will definitely make again soon."

"reviewBody": "Doubling the amount of pasta, I used 2 cans of cream of chicken. I threw in about 1/8 cup of dehydrated diced onions., 3 (12 oz) cans of chicken (Something left over from my \"Emergency\" supplies) , one can of Corn, one 12 oz package of Broccoli pepper and about 2 cups of cheese to mix with the dish. I cooked it for 30 minutes at 350. I pulled it out and topped it off with about 3 more cups of shredded cheese and baked it at 400 for about 15 minutes until the cheese got lightly browned. Most recipes are guides and starters for me, based on whatever is in the cabinet and freezer. If I don't have the ingredient, I usually just substitute or omit as it seems appropriate. One of these days I'll start using a measuring cup as well ;) This turned out well and will use it again :D"

I also sauteed my chicken, seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and seasoned salt before I added it in with the mixture ( i also seasoned my mixture with the same seasonings to prevent blandness). And I baked it on 300 instead of 350. Other then that I stuck to the recipe exactly and it turned out great."

Chicken tetrazzini typically has mushrooms in it and I was tempted to put in some sliced fresh button mushrooms but wanted to stick close to the recipe at least the first time through. I'm not sure what else would perk up the taste of this but it was needing something. I halved the recipe and baked in a 9x9\" pan for 30 minutes."

"reviewBody": "Liked this very much. Used two cans cream of chicken soup, and since I didn't have evaporated milk I used skim milk instead. Probably used more cheddar than the recipe called for, and topped it with bread crumbs as well. Initially I was afraid the spaghetti would get dried out, but was pleasantly surprised to serve an incredibly creamy, yummy and FILLING main dish. Talk about comfort food! This was very tasty and very creamy, but not sickening like an alfredo sauce. My husband and son liked it a lot as well. Good recipe, Mrs. Leonard!"
