I used 3 Tbsp butter to saute the mushrooms and garlic, and although I swear I bought sour cream I did not, so I had about 4 oz of that. I also added some Velveeta to make it a little cheesy. It came out a little dry, but I think that is because my oven runs hot and I didn't think to shorten the time because some reviews were concerned with the excess sauce. I will definitely make this again, though!"

A full thing of sour cream isn't necessary either. I'd change it to about 10 oz. I also used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of chicken to give it a little more flavor, but in all reality only 1 can of either would probably be enough. A little onion powder and black pepper would probably go a long way, as well."

"reviewBody": "Lemon! This is one of the things this needs. This is a staple recipe of my mother-in-law's, but she adds lemon. It's an Armenian thing. Anyway, use 1/2 the sour cream, 1 can of soup, 2/3 of the butter, and a WHOLE lot of parmesan cheese. This is not a low-cal dish. I put about 1/3 cup of parmesan cheese in the mix, 3 tablespoons of lemon juice (bottled is fine), sprinkle some garlic and onion powder and salt in it, stir it around, and TASTE IT! Then add more stuff as needed. Once you put it in the casserole dish, mix 1/3 c. parmesan cheese and 1/3 cup Italian bread crumbs, then sprinkle it on the top and pat it down firmly. Then sprinkle a little more lemon over the top. Just a little. My parents are elderly and their appetite isn't what it used to be, and this is MAJOR comfort food for them. They love it."

I was surprised that it was rather quite good, as I don't normally care for too many canned ingredients. I had reduced fat sour cream and only 1/2 the amount suggested and it worked perfect! I actually don't like too much sour cream in a casserole anyway, because it tends to mask the other flavors. For the butter I used half regular butter and half of a heart healthy spread. It was what I had in the house. This was creamy and delicious, no complaints! I did take it out of the oven in 25 minutes, as I used 1/2 the sour cream, and didn't want it to dry out. I will make again when I want a quick comforting dish, especially during the week."

"reviewBody": "As modified, we enjoyed this very much, but I think it might have been too soupy and pretty bland without the modifications. I used one can each of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup, only half the indicated amount of sour cream (8 oz instead of 16 oz) and 12 oz. of fettucini instead of 8 oz. Even so, it was borderline too soupy, but then I only used one pint jar of homecanned chicken breast (about 1-1/2 chicken breast) instead of four, for economy. Also, since I had no mushrooms, I used only a tablespoon of butter to grease the casserole dish. I added a scant teaspoon of onion powder and a half-teaspoon of marjoram, along with plenty of pepper and a few of shots of Tabasco. A topping of buttered bread crumbs gave this a nice variety of textures. The mushrooms would have made this dish even better. Another time, I might also try it with broccoli florets. This is a rich, creamy, satisfying and versatile dish, well worth trying, but also worth \"healthifying\" some by reducing the amount of fat from the butter and sour cream."

And since they really don't like mushrooms I only used 4 oz. total, but I felt so guilty for the lack of veggies that I steamed up some broccoli on the side. It tasted wonderful in the creamy sauce. And as what i believe to be true, everythings better with bacon. i fried some up, chopped it and sprinkled on right before baking. It added some really wonderful tender bites and crunchy ones. Will be making this for years to come."

While the chicken was cooking it had such a great aroma, but once I combined everything there wasn't much flavor. I omitted mushrooms since my boyfriend doesn't like them so instead of using regular cream of chicken condensed soup I used a can of cream of chicken and mushroom. I added lots more garlic and way more seasonings and herbs. I also used egg noodles instead of spaghetti. I was very disappointed. This was my first time ever tasting chicken tetrazzini and making it. I wasn't impressed. Sorry. I think next time I will try the other recipes listed that have sherry and other liquids in it for more flavor."

I seasoned the whole chicken breasts to my taste (salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder) and seared them on a large skillet until browned, but not cooked through. I removed the chicken and set it aside, and cut it into pieces. I deglazed the pan with a little juice from the mushrooms, and then added 2 TBSP butter and sauted the mushrooms. I then added the chicken pieces back to the skillet. While the pasta was draining, I used the hot pot in which I cooked the pasta to combine 1 can of mushroom soup, 1 can of chicken soup and 8 oz. of sour cream, then I added the pasta back to the pot. I combined this mixture into the chicken and mushrooms, and then put everything in my 2 qt. casserole dish (it almost didn't fit, and had to watch it so it did not boil over). I topped it with the cheese (maybe 1/4 cup) and served it with EZ Drop Biscuits from this site. It was delicious!!!"

I also added 1/4 cup sherry to the butter when cooking the mushrooms. This flavor masks the canned soup quality and lends more of a from scratch feel to the recipe. Before baking I added 1 1/2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs to the top. This creates more of a casserole quality to the dish which we liked. Would probably be very good without it as well. I also liked the suggestion of adding frozen peas. I will try that next time."

It is so creamy and delicious, your family and friends will think you stole the recipe from a famous Italian restaurant's vault. It's mind boggeling that such simple ingredients result in such a fantastic taste explosion. I used what I had on hand: 1) substituted shrimp for chicken; I had 24 ounces of cooked shrimp ... I cut the tails off and sauteed just like I would have the chicken, 2) I used fresh parmesan cheese, which I grated myself ... it lended a rustic appearance and much enhanced flavor, 3) diced some leftover roasted red peppers into pimento sized pieces, 4) only had one cup of low-fat sour cream, so I added 1 cup of mayo. With these imposed changes, I saved a trip to the store and still enjoyed the recipe to the max! Some high quality bread and butter topped off this all-star lunch. Wow."
