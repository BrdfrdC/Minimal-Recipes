I then boiled the spaghetti in the same water I cooked the chicken in. This gives the spaghetti some added flavor.\n\nAlso, i added crushed potato chips on one half of it, because my husband and kids like the crunch chips on top. \n\nReally good recipe!"

Saute 1 cup chopped onion, 1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms, and 2 cloves minced garlic in 1-2 T olive oil first, then added all that to the already thickened sauce. For the sauce, I used 1 1/2 cups chicken broth + 1 cup 2% milk + 1/2 cup half-and-half. Also used more sherry - maybe 5 Tablespoons.

"reviewBody": "This is a good \"comfort food\" recipe. I followed the directions with one exception - which was to use a container of fresh baby bella mushrooms instead of canned. Once the ingredients were combined it felt dry - a criticism some other reviewers had also. I made up an additional half batch of the broth/cream/flour/wine/butter mixture and then added it to the already combined ingredients. That gave the dish a much more pleasing consistency and is something I would continue to do. I divided this into 2 smaller pans and froze one for use at a later date. The finished produce is a little rich so serving it with a healthy green salad on the side cuts some of that. While that doesn't make it a 'healthy' meal, the large salad on the side allows you to have a smaller portion of the main dish to help you keep the fat and calorie count in control."

"reviewBody": "I've been looking for a tetrazzini recipe that is similar to one that a friend made for me years and years ago. Finally, I hit upon this one, and it's the keeper. It, in its written form, is definitely not health food, but is comfort food at its best. The only changes that I made were to add a small jar of diced pimientos and about 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. If I decide to put this on regular rotation, I will try to lighten it up. But making it as written (and I with my 2 small additions) results in a tasty, easy casserole that warms up a cool evening. My family and teenage daughter's friend all loved it."

I followed the recipe but added fresh mushrooms, bell pepper and onion. I marinated my chicken with some lemon juice before cooking. I used both breast and thigh meat. I also used Italian herbed breadcrumbs (as suggested by another reviewer) mixed with Parmesan cheese as a top layer. I got lots of compliments and will make this for my family in the future."

I heated up the cream with water, reserving 1/2 cup water to mix with the cornstarch. When the cream/water was bubbly, I added the cornstarch and stirred until thickened. And of course, used gluten free spaghetti. The only other change I made was adding 1/4 cup of parmesan to the sauce. Turned out great!"

"reviewBody": "There were some glaring pros and cons to this recipe, the first of which being that its a strong base recipe but also incredibly bland as is. Another pro is the flexibility of this recipe. Too rich and creamy for your tastebuds? Decrease the heavy cream and increase the chicken broth by the same amount. Tasted like flour? Cook that flour in the butter for several minutes longer, turning it over and over until it almost smells kinda nutty and keep whisking quick when you add first the broth and then the cream. Another con? Back to that flavor thing again, this really needs it so try generous dashes of basil, fresh or dry, along with smaller dashes of nutmeg, summer savory, parsley and tarragon. Additions of fresh sautéed garlic, onion and mushrooms are fabulous to make this recipe shine. Out of fresh? Don't be worried about using garlic or onion powder if that's all ya have. My guy dislikes the texture of onion but is fine with the taste. Sometimes we take the time to puree and sauté an onion, other times we shortcut with powdered spice. Sometimes I leave it in big chunks and tell him too bad, it's onion night! Add peas, asparagus or broccoli. After minding our family's tastebuds for over 30 years, I knew when reading the recipe that I'd never make it as is but would want to add lots of flavorful additions and took liberties to do so. We've really liked the different variations that have come about by using this recipe as the bones for a really great one!"

In the future I will find a way to use less heavy cream while keeping a good consistency. Changes I made: I used real mushrooms, used extra milk as another review suggested, I used a Pinot Grigio white whine, also, I pounded some chicken breasts to 1/2\" floured and fried to 50% done.. Lastly, I followed another review of using Kloski noodles and I liked that decision. It tasted amazing but my stomach didn't like how rich it was..."

This is a nice option for people who like to have a little heat with their food."

"reviewBody": "Made exactly as the recipe called for and it is really bland.Next time I'll brown boneless skinless tenders in olive oil and butter on each side then saute diced onions, sliced green onions and minced garlic in the pan drippings. I'll double the roux in a separate pot then add more milk instead of heavy cream. The sauce should be thinner and more plentiful when put into the oven so the al dente spaghetti can absorb the liquid while keeping the casserole moist and creamy. \nLove the sherry and next time I'll add more to taste and use white pepper instead of black. I cooked the spaghetti in water with chicken bouillon for more flavor. It's just something I do, but not necessary. I think next time I will also add finely shredded parmesan, instead of grated, to the sauce and then top the casserole with Mozzarella or Italian Blend cheese. Another tip, Always taste the dish before putting it in the oven and adjust seasonings as needed. This sauce needed more seasoning! Everything is already cooked and warm so once it starts bubbling in the oven, it's done - it doesn't need an hour to cook."
