Very tart and sweet. will be making it for family gathering over the summer. \n\nNote: I did use tortilla shells when unable to find wonton wrappers"

I also used soft taco shells instead of the wonton's as I was making this as the meal and wanted a larger wrap. I used General Tsao's stir fry sauce and added some cayenne to add some heat. Yum! Can't wait to eat leftovers tomorrow. I know I shouldn't rate 5 stars since I made changes but I think this is an awesome place to start and make changes to personal taste."

My wontons would flip over while baking making it hard to fill the 'tacos'. \n\nVery tasty and a good for something different in the dinner routine.

I sprayed the wontons with canola spray and baked as suggested on the back side of a muffin tin. Sounded like a great idea but they were way too hard and crunchy. I ended up throwing them away and just used warm flour tortillas and guess what? They ended up tasting pretty close to Applebee's Oriental Chicken roll-up! Yummy. I may try the fried version of the wontons next time. Thank you for the recipe!"

My husband even loved it and he doesn't like slaw.\n\nWe only used 2 teaspoons of the seasame oil and that was plenty, and added a hair more stir fry sauce. \n\nI really wanted to bake the wontons so I sprayed the back of a muffin tin with a coconut oil spray, layed out the wontons as \"tacos\" and then sprayed the shells one more time before baking them, that gave them the nice golden crispness without the frying (it might take a bit longer than the 4-5 min, just watch them).\n\nOtherwise you'll love this recipe. 3 tacos is equivalent to 272 calories. (small portions but a tasty \"treat\" if you still want to have a healthy small meal.)\n\nEnjoy!!"

"reviewBody": "I made this for dinner last night, though I ended up deviating from the recipe quite a bit. I used egg roll wraps because my local grocery store was out of wonton wraps. I fried them in a skillet with some olive oil to achieve that nice blistery crunch that isn't obtainable by baking. The recipe suggests frying them for 1 minute per side, but that just burns them to a crisp. I would say 20 seconds per side is plenty. Two tablespoons of sesame oil for the ground chicken was too much. That is all you will taste. I modified it to two teaspoons and it was perfect. I also added some ground ginger and white pepper for extra flavor. The cole slaw mixture as written is a mess! I'd say half the vinegar and take out the teriyaki completely. Our cole slaw was very soupy and honestly not really tangy at all because the teriyaki really overpowers everything else. This recipe was okay, but it needed some modifying to get there."
