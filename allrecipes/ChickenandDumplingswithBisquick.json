"reviewBody": "It is perfect for a mid winter dinner party. However, when you double the recipe, it says 2 cups of milk. In step three of the instructions, it only tells you to use one cup of milk. No where does it tell you what to do with the second cup of milk. To be conservative, I only added one cup. You need two cups as the dumplings soak up a lot of the stew. I also used cream of chicken with herbs as my soup(s)."
