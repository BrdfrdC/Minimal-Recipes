"reviewBody": "This is a great recipe that is easily changed for personal tastes. I was serving it with steak, so I knew that I couldn't leave it as a chicken salad (the wine drinkers would have had a fit determining what wine to drink with their meals), so I swapped the chicken for about two cups of macaroni. No one in the family is okay with raw onion and I don't like raw celery, so I fried the two of them in a little butter and lemon-infused olive oil till they were soft. Because I substituted the chicken, I doubled the hardboiled eggs (not much substance to the salad with just onion, celery and pasta). As the mayo/sour cream dressing was quite thick I loosened it up with some more of that lemon-infused olive oil. I also upped the coriander (cilantro) amount by about four times what was called for because the family really loves the flavour. The family rated what I came up with at a five, so I think the original recipe deserves a four for inspiring me."
