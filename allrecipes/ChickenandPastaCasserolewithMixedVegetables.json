Others suggested that this would benefit from additional soup or milk; I added 1/4 cup milk and found the dish to be plenty creamy and moist. The chicken ended up being a bit dry, and I would maybe use thighs next time, which will better endure the dual stove top/oven cooking. Finally, the frozen veggie combo (corn, peas, green beans, and carrots) just didn't do it for me for this particular dish. I would try using sauteed mushrooms and green beans. I would also add a little bit of cayenne pepper."

"reviewBody": "First, the recipe calls for “1 cup” pasta but I suspect it should read 1 pound, the typical measure of a box of pasta. We used 3 cubs (3/4 pound) but followed the rest of the ingredient list measurements as-is and flavors and consistency all came out nicely. Other reviewers mention adding cream/milk for creamier consistency and I agree if you want a bit of sauce on the plate, but we didn’t add anything and like the not-saucy noodle-chicken-crumb topping texture. The crumb topping is the clincher for this dish."

I made it the first time pretty much as is in a pinch when a friend was sick and needed a meal, just substituted frozen broccoli for the frozen mixed vegetables. I used rotini pasta because I couldn't find fusilli. I've made it for us a few times since and made some other adjustments. I used about a 1/2 cup of diced onion and 3 medium minced garlic cloves instead of the dried minced onion and sauteed it until opaque before adding the chicken, herbs, and seasonings to the pan to cook. I added 8 oz. sliced crimini mushrooms that I had sauteed separately with a small amount of butter and garlic powder with the remaining ingredients. I stirred in about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of chicken broth to the mixture before baking for extra moisture. I also halved the bread crumb mixture and found it was plenty for us."

I placed the chicken in just enough water to cover, sprinkled with garlic powder, salt and pepper and cooked until just done (approx 5 min) I removed chicken to cool (reserving broth)before cutting into bite size pieces. I combined the ingredients plus a cup of sour cream along with soups and used Italian seasoning instead of basil and parsley. I used broth as needed to make sure pasta mixture was good and moist. It was so good. We liked the crunchy topping too."

Also, cooked at 350 degrees versus 400 as I suspect this is the reason the recipe was ‘dry’ for some users. Lastly, I broiled on 350 degrees the last 2-5 mins to ensure the crust was brown enough. Will definitely make again."

"reviewBody": "Just popped this dish out of the oven! It smells heavenly! AND, I made it entirely GLUTEN FREE! Cut up 2 large chicken breasts, used 2 dry cups of GF penne rigate, 2 cans of Progresso GF cream of mushroom soup, used same spices for cooking chicken plus added some Mrs Dash’s Italian Medley seasoning. The Progresso soup has more liquid than a condensed soup. I added sour cream, a little shredded pepper jack &amp; sharp cheddar cheeses. Poured it into baking dish. Took GF multigrain bread &amp; ran it through food processor for crumbs, then mixed it with butter &amp; Parmesan/Romano cheese &amp; spread it on top. Baked 30 minutes @ 400. My husband loved it....it was delicious!! This is certain to become a favorite! Thank you for the recipe."

I think I will halve the bread crumbs next time as they were a little dry and took some pushing around the plate to moisten up. But this is GREAT! And it should freeze well for nights I get home and just do NOT want to cook. :) Thanks for a great recipe Jen - keep 'em comin'!!"

It still came out very thick and creamy.\n To be very honest though, I did not really like the taste of it, but my 3 year old devoured her entire plate and my husband could take it or leave it. he said it reminded him of hospital food. He still ate it though, lol!\n Giving it 3 stars because my picky toddler ate it without complaint."

Even using the recommendations of other reviews to add milk, it is still dry, especially if you reheat leftovers. To fix this, in addition to adding a cup of milk, only add half off the breadcrumbs. To add a little more flavor, you can also drizzle a about 1/4 cup ranch dressing to the breadcrumb topping."

"reviewBody": "I thought this recipe was very easy to follow and also easy to make changes where needed. And I did make a few changes. I substituted 1 1/2 cups of Penne for the fusilli pasta. I used 2 cans of Campbell's Heathy Request Cream of Mushroom soup instead of the 1 cream of chicken and 1 cream of mushroom soups. Instead of mixed vegetables, I used 1 cup of canned carrot slices drained, and 1 cup of canned cut green beans drained. I didn't have the dried minced onion so I used onion powder, about 1 tsp. And I didn't have the dried parsley so I omitted it. Neither myself or my husband like breadcrumb toppings on casseroles so I didn't do that part of the recipe. We both thought the casserole tasted great, and he even asked for a second helping! Next time I make this, I am thinking of adding shredded mild cheddar cheese to the top the last 10 minutes of baking. I definitely will be adding this recipe to my favorites! Thank you JENTOP!"

Frozen corn is ok, but green beans and carrots from frozen are nothing like the non-frozen item. I wonder if throwing in some chopped carrots and uncooked green beans would work. Maybe sub out the green beans for something else altogether."
