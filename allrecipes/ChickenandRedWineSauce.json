"reviewBody": "This is an amazing and easy entree to make. Yet, it comes out looking like a 5-star dish when you're done. I highly recommend it. \n\nI do have a suggestion on a different way of preparing the dish. The first few times I made it, I put the whole chicken breast in (2 or 3 at a time) and they came out beautifully. Nothing really NEEDED to be changed, but I wanted to try something different. So I cut the breast into 1 in x 1 in pieces with about 1/2 in thickness and put them all in a plastic bag. I then added all of the ingredients for the sauce/glaze into the bag and shook everything up until evenly coated. \n\nOnce this was done, I heated up some olive oil and added garlic as directed by the recipe. I then dumped the contents of the bag into the skillet on medium heat and covered for about 5 minutes; stirring occasionally until cooked. \n\nThe flavor wasn't as strong as it is in the original recipe, but it does cover each piece much more evenly and makes it much faster to cook. I think it's a good way to get the dish done quick if you have other items you're cooking at the same time."

You should remove the breasts when they get close to done and continue to reduce the sauce, then return them for a last heat-up."

I couldn't eat my rice that had the sauce from the chicken on it. And I rinsed all the remaining sauce off the leftover chicken in the hopes of salvaging it with some savory flavoring later.\nWhat I did like about this recipe is its simplicity. At least I've got a base to use for further experimentation - without sugar."

The delicious taste of the sauce and the novelty of the color it leaves on the chicken is part of the whole point, so more surface area is better!"

The chicken was moist and tender, the sauce was not too thin and not too thick and it tasted really, really good. \n\nI will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe with a slight adaptation in garlic and spice; I was out of garlic and paprika but I had a paprika, garlic, salt and pepper spice mix so I used that as an alternative. I basted the chicken every 5 minutes and it was ready in 20 minutes as the recipe called for. Served it over rice and poured some of the red wine over the rice and it was phenomenal. I don't generally like chicken breast but this recipe I will keep making. Thank you!"

After reading the other reviews, I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 a teaspoon of paprika, along with my cup of Cabernet wine. The other change I made, I used chicken thighs instead of breasts. I‚Äôm not sure what I did different than others but even tho I covered the skillet, after 10 minutes of simmering I had to add more wine and decided to add about 1/2 cup of chicken broth too. At the 20 minute mark, my chicken had a super thick glaze, so I removed it from the heat while I finished making mashed cauliflower (instead of carby mashed potatoes) and asparagus. I told my husband that he probably wasn‚Äôt going to like the chicken because he doesn‚Äôt care for sweet meals (and it was sweet!) but he loved it and actually had seconds."

When I made it I only put about 1T of sugar and that was enough to give added flavour. Served with a wild rice salad it was good, but not something I would rush to make again. If you are trying this recipe then I recommend to cut the sugar drastically and then play around with the flavours to suit your tastes."

"reviewBody": "Ugh. Red wine and brown sugar? With paprika? In spite of all the good reviews I had a feeling that this might be a nasty combination, and it was. And the recipe's cooking time for the chicken is far too long. I halved it, searing the chicken to a nice brown crust on both sides and then cooking for twelve minutes in the sauce, taking the lid off the pan for the last five. The chicken was nice and moist but the sauce was disgusting, and that was with reducing the sugar by 3/4. I reduced it down to a glaze and that made it tolerable, but I won't be making this one again. Perhaps the author of this recipe could let us know what kind of wine they used; that might help."

Set that aside and put back in after the wine was added. I added fresh ground pepper, and salted the thighs with a little kosher salt. Also used about 1/2 cup brown sugar sprinkled on both sides with the tablespoon of paprika. Added about 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to the wine to thicken the sauce. I also added about half a tablespoon of garlic salt. Decided not to drain the drippings as I thought it would give it more flavor. Awesome! Husband just LOVED it!"

"reviewBody": "Wow! I was a little skeptical and expected this to be a little bland since the recipe calls for so few ingredients, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It's definitely sweet, but I like sweet. I didn't have paprika, so I used 1 tsp of chili powder instead. I was ready to use cornstarch to thicken the sauce, but just as it was almost done cooking under the lid, the sauce thickened up slightly on its own. Luckily I didn't add any cornstarch in, because as the sauce cooled it thickened even more. My boyfriend said this was one of the best meals I've cooked. I served it with tator tots from the air fryer, and the sauce went well with those, too! The sauce would be perfect for chicken and waffles! Also, I cut up the extra chicken to throw onto a salad, which I'm sure will give the salad a little sweetness."

Another reviewer suggested saut√©ed veggies with it and I did the same with onions and bell peppers. I also didn‚Äôt cook the chicken breasts fully because it would have been really dry so I did 5 minutes each side then the simmering, it ended at 155 degrees Internal temperature and was very moist and juicy. (It is a-ok to eat chicken that‚Äôs not 165 degrees depending on how long you have been cooking the chicken). All in all, the ingredients for this recipe worked well! Just half the sugar!"

"reviewBody": "Good. Just good. Not Great, not an \"Out-of-Body Experience,\" not \"Best Chicken Ever,\" and not \"Life Changing\" in any way. I agree with many reviewing cooks that the flavors do not blend. You taste wine. Lots of wine. You taste the sugar. Lots of sugar. And then you taste garlic with a hint of chicken. I cooked the chicken in sauce for 15-20 minutes, removing the lid half-way to reduce the sauce a bit. It did reduce, but the chicken, as many others commented, dried. Anything above the sauce line in the pan lost moisture. Still, it was good. I would assume that the flavor would change slightly with the choice of wine variety. It was worth the try, but won't go on my favorite list."
