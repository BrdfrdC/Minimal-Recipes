To sum up my assessment, this was 'too much sugar for the puddin'... so to speak. The prep time/work/cleanup and ingredients amounted to too much compared to what the final product provided. Next time, we'll just go to Olive Garden."

If I was making it I would have just put it in at the end and let it be done. My husband is just starting to cook and is a stickler for following the recipe. He made me taste it and see if the bacon SHOULD be put in. It started a big debate. He ended up putting it back in but wasn't happy. It tasted wonderful. Mik"

I found it pretty easy to make honestly. I and my family loved it! Almost all got seconds. I honestly wouldn't change anything except the Italian seasoning. And that is only because I am not a fan of some of the spices in it. I would just add the spices I like. (thyme, oregano, and basil). I hope more people will try this great dish!!"
