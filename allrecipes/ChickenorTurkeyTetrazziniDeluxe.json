"reviewBody": "YUMMY! Great way to use turkey leftover from Thanksgiving or Christmas. Used whole wheat spiral noodles instead (healthier!). Substituted 1/2 cup red pepper &amp; 1/2 cup green pepper. Added 1 tbsp minced garlic when cooking down onions &amp; peppers, 1 tsp tumeric, 1 cup sour cream, skipped sherry. Also put drained noodles in lightly greased cake pan then folded mixture (sans cheese) into pan. Then folded cheese in before baking leaving a small layer of cheddar &amp; parmesan cheese atop. Watch closely when it gets to 20 minutes - probably don't need to cook more than 25 or 30 minutes. Pull it out when the edges are looking crispy."

Made it as written except I did add 1.5 teaspoons of chopped garlic, used frozen peas and carrots, and thin spaghetti broken in thirds (makes serving a lot easier). Added some fresh chopped basil and parsley. Used the recommended seasonings, which were right on. Watch the salt. You might not need it because of the sodium content in some of the other ingredients. Can always add the salt after taste testing the sauce. So good! Great meal in a dish. Served with green beans and fresh fruit."

The only change I make is to substitute 1/4 cup of water plus 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar for the sherry (because we don't drink, it's not something I keep on hand). This works really well! No vinegar taste, and the dish is wonderfully flavorful! -- Note to self: This substitution does not work so well in Ree Drummond's Best Tomato Soup Ever recipe on the food network's website. In combination with everything else in the recipe, the vinegar creates a flavor that seems a bit too acidic."

We had some pork loin leftover from Thanksgiving,, 2020 and it was delicious in this casserole. I did not have any frozen peas, so I just left it out and there was plenty of bulk to fill out the mixture. As it was, it nearly overflowed my 9x13 inch baking dish. The grated Parmesan cheese/paprika topping was a great combination of crunch and color. Five stars, for sure."

I also halved the recipe and used broth that I made with the leftover turkey carcass per Betty Crocker's directions. This will definitely be put into the dinner rotation."

"reviewBody": "This was a great recipe for leftover Turkey. I did alter the recipe quite a bit but only because i didn't have certain things on hand. I used one cup of white wine and 2 cups of broth. I didn't have any mushrooms so i used veggies on hand. 1/2 cup of frozen corn and 1/2 cup of frozen peas, diced celery and onions. I then thought the dish lacked color so i added some diced green onions and sweet red roasted peppers along with a little parsley. All of this was for color but in the end it really added to the dish. Lastly, i used 2 tsp of worcheschire sauce and added one beaten egg to final mixture to bind dish together. It seemed a bit loose and watery. I topped with parmesean and bread crumbs. I realize i made a lot of changes and perhaps i should post my own recipe but really this recipe was the inspiration and like most cooking we have to improvise or change things to meet our family's taste buds."

"reviewBody": "Husband loved it, I did too. I think the recipe would have been great as written, but I did make a few changes. First, I cut the recipe in half. I used dry sherry instead of cooking sherry because it is just plain better and instead of salt, I used Morton's Nature's Seasons Seasoning Blend (a seasoned salt which I think adds great flavor to many dishes instead of just regular salt). Then, only because I didn't have some ingredients called for on hand, I used the following substitutes: spaghetti instead of linguine, canned instead of fresh mushrooms (but I would always use fresh if I had them), red pepper instead of green, and a white cheddar with cranberries. I used slightly more turkey than called for, filling a 2 cup measuring glass to the top, Lastly I didn't measure the Parmesan cheese, but made sure that the top of the casserole was completely covered (so I'm guessing it was slightly more than what half of the recipe would have been since I used the same sized baking dish). I'm adding this one to my favorites! Also, Chardonnay, cheesy baking powder biscuits (or some other great bread), and a small side salad would be good accompaniments for this dish."

"reviewBody": "I've made this recipe twice now. Once with leftover Thanksgiving turkey and homemade turkey stock, and the second time with leftover chicken and store-bought chicken stock. With the turkey version I followed the recipe except to try bucatini noodles for the first time (which I loved). It turned out delicious, part of which I attribute to the homemade stock, which was very flavorful. The chicken version was also very good and got rave reviews from the family. I used linguine noodles as the recipe called for and made no other changes. I do feel that recipes like this benefit from homemade stock if you can do so ahead of time. All in all, this recipe is definitely a keeper!"

We liked it so much we shared some with our extended families and still had leftovers that we froze for another meal. And that was easy to do since this makes a huge amount, probably enough for 10-12 people! I didn't make any substitutions except for adding a few cloves of garlic and half a red pepper and half a green pepper instead of one while green and it was great! Definitely NOT lo-cal!!! I used Barilla pronto linguini that saved me 2 extra pans-- you gotta try all of their new pronto pastas!!! I also used my stainless steel pan to cook and transfer to the oven instead of transferring to a casserole dish. Thank you for the recipe -- I was so excited how good it tasted and turned out that I forgot to take a picture!! (Next time!)"

I only used fresh shaved parm on top. Used wine instead of sherry, added tons of fresh mushrooms and topped with seasoned bread crumbs. . Next time I'll add minced garlic and season the turkey prior to adding it to the veggies and pasta. Ill also used more bread crumbs. Total comfort food."

"reviewBody": "I made this with leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and it turned out awesome! A couple differences... I used 16oz of rotini noodles instead because I didn't have spaghetti, I only had one can of cream of mushroom soup so I added a little half and half to it, also I had some leftover herbs from Thanksgiving to use up (fresh sage and thyme) so I added those in. I also saw other tetrazzini recipes that called for panko breadcrumbs which sounded good so I sprinkled italian seasoned Panko crumbs on top of the parmesan at the end and dusted the paprika on top (mostly because I forgot to add it earlier). Don't add the extra salt. Parmesan is very salty so that should do the trick. Also, even low sodium cream of mushroom and low sodium broth will add to the saltiness. One watch out if you are using noodles other than spaghetti - it's bulkier and you might need more than one casserole dish to fit it. All in all, this was super flavorful - helped to add a few herbs or italian seasoning to it!"

The only thing I omitted was the cooking Sherry. I don't drink and I don't like the taste of wine in my food. So I omitted it. It made up easy but the sauce had an odd taste...I think it was the Worcestershire sauce. I cook with mushroom soup all the time and we love it. But this didn't work for us. My kids didn't like the Parmesan on the top either. I think I would try this again and omit the cheese and the Worcestershire sauce. Also I agree with the other reviews in that this recipe makes A LOT. I would 1/2 the recipe at least until you know you like it."
