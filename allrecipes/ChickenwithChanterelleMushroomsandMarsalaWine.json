Also substituted half and half mix of sherry and port since I didn't have Marsala. It all worked perfectly complementing but not overwhelming the delicate flavor of the chanterrelles."

"reviewBody": "A friend of mine had brought up some chanterelles he had found while out in the woods on the coast. Having never cooked with them before, I immediately opened up my All Recipes app to see what I could find and this recipe was first on the list.\nI followed to recipe exactly except I used cubed chicken versus chicken breasts. I was concerned the chicken would get too dry, but simmering it in with the mushrooms and chicken broth prevented that. \nThe flavor was excellent! Not bland as other reviews had mentioned. I served it with fettuccine noodles and sauteed squash and zucchini, it was so delicious! My husband loved it and I will most definitely be making this again."

My hubby even said it;s a winner and he is a steak or fried chicken man, hard to get him to eat chicken! I think I'll try it with some Oregon pheasant....Thanks Kelly for a great way to enjoy Oregon wild chanterelle mushrooms!"

I omitted the salt because of that but did use the dried tarragonand of course the marsala. The sauce was so tasty I made mashed potatoes so I could have more of it. There was enough sauce for three breasts and potatoes too! A keeper!"
