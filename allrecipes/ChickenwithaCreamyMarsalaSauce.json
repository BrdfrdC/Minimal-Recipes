The cream gives it the dreamy, rich texture. 5 stars all the way for this household. I usually double the sauce ingredients so we have plenty left over to drizzle over rice."

Salted a little more to taste after finish. Wow! And I am picky. Don't water down. Use the stated ingredients. You can go to the gym later!!! YUM!!!"

"reviewBody": "I admit I started with the basics of this recipe but based on the previous reviews made a few changes. First, I was making this dish for two so some adjustments were due to that. My approach: Used 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I pounded them to about 1/4\" thickness. Before I dredged them in flour, I seasoned the flour with salt, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and paprika. I didn't measure but seasoned until the flour had a good flavor. I fried the chicken in 1T olive oil and 1T unsalted butter. As another reviewer did, I removed the chicken and then I added 1/2 medium diced onion, 2 cloves minced garlic to the remaining oil and butter - I added a 1tsp of olive oil. Cook onion and garlic for 2-3 minutes then added 5 oz sliced mushrooms. Cook for another 2-3 minutes and then added 2/3 cup of marsala and 2/3 cup chicken stock. Let it simmer for about 5 minutes then I added back the chicken and let it simmer another 10 minutes, then I slowly added 1/2 cup of cream with 1/2 tsp ground mustard. After a few minutes, taste the sauce - I added about 1/4 tsp salt and a 1T marsala. Let the sauce reduce by 1/3 or so. I served over whole wheat penne. This approach came out very well."

"reviewBody": "I made this tonight because we just wanted something different. I made a few changes based on what we had available in the house - Pino grigio rather than Marsala wine and crushed garlic in place of ground mustard. I added mushrooms and served with fettuccine and it was delicious, just the change of pace we were looking for. I think maybe those reviewers who said they used half and half and didn't love the sauce might want to try again with heavy cream. The wine and stock in the recipe are so light that you really won't be able to get a rich sauce consistency or flavor with half and half. Just a thought! Thank-you for the yummy dinner!"

Very rich, but so worth it."

I followed these directions to the T (with the only exception, I only had 1/2 and 1/2 on hand- no heavy cream). It didn't meet my expectations. It was ok, my family didn't complain, but didn't finish their plate either. I can't put my finger on what is missing, I will probably try other recipes and \"play\" with it, until I find that restuarant taste!"

I also subbed 1/2 and 1/2 for the cream, and dijon for the ground mustard, since that's what I had on hand. It was similar to chicken dishes with cream of mushroom soup, but probably much healthier/natural, and just as easy to make. Thank you!"
