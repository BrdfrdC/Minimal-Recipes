I'll know better next time."

We liked it both ways, but I added 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar and some fresh spinach to the cilantro version because the dressing didn't seem strong enough. I think the cilantro may have a stronger flavor than the parsley, and it needed more flavor in the dressing."

I suggest to others to do a survey of who in your family likes garbanzo beans before you fix this. Apparently the beans aren't as mainstream as I thought. If I make it again I will use a whole carton of grape or cherry tomatoes. I also like the balsamic suggestions. I will try that as well if I make again. This is NOT date night food. Major garlic breath with this one."

Super easy prep and clean-up and it keeps well in the fridge for a couple days. I upped the lemon and added a splash of balsamic vinegar, delicious!"

It's different from anything else and keeps well all day."

DON\"T use dried herbs in this recipie! Try adding crumbled feta cheese and sliced pitted Kalamata olives, if you like them. If not, regular black olives may be substituted. Prepare a couple of hours in advance for the flavors to marry. I also strongly prefer this served at room temperature. Yum!"

I followed a couple suggestions from other reviews. 1) I used grape tomatoes rather than a regular tomato. 2) I used a little more garlic because you can never go wrong with more garlic. 3) I made sure to add fresh leaf spinach...so good! I also decided to add cilantro to the salad. Turned out great!! My husband is asking me to make this again next week!"

I made a few changes: I used a basket of Cherry tomatoes, cut in half; I also added a couple splashes of Balsamic Vinegar; and since my family LOVES Cilantro (I know many don't), added about 1 T. of freshly chopped Cilantro. It was sooo good. Very refreshing out on the deck. Garbanzos (and other legumes) are so healthy and very good to help control blood sugar, as well as adding fiber to the diet. So a healthy choice!"

I brought them to a boil and let them sit for an hour vs. soaking over night, rinsed them, and simmered them for two hours. I used a pint of grape tomatoes each cut in half and a half cup of kalamato olives cut into fourths. I plan to make this several times a year and will cook the beans ahead of time and freeze them to save time."

"reviewBody": "This was pretty good, especially considering how quick it is to throw together, and I liked that it only made a small amount to try it. Chickpeas/garbanzo beans only come in 16oz cans, so I just used that and it was also low-sodium and worked fine. The only thing I left out was the pepper, because I don't care for it, and we ate it right after it was made. I tasted what was left the next day and I actually preferred it fresh anyhow. With all the garlic and parsley the smell and taste gets too strong, in my opinion, when it sits. So, it did work good for a salad in a pinch."
