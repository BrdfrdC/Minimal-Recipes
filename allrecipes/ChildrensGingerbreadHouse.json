So 5 stars for the recipe and 0 stars for the taste = 3 stars overall."

First batch to 'glue' the piece together was the perfect consistency with 2 egg whites and 5 cups of sugar (I added about 2 tablespoons of water to get it just right). The second batch to decorate the house was so incredibly thin that I added about 5 - 6 cups of sugar to get it right. \nThere is no way you can have 4 egg whites and remaining sugar to get it thick. \"Remaining sugar\" from what? 5 cups? The recipe needs re-writing perhaps."

"reviewBody": "I don't think I can say enough good things about this recipe. First, the gingerbread dough was really easy to work with. Like everyone else, I had to add more flour. Before adding the extra flour, my dough ball was just goo, almost like brownie batter. After adding an extra cup of flour, it still wouldn't hold in the shape of a ball. I ended up using 5 cups of flour instead of the 3 cups. After that, it was perfect! I chilled it, rolled it out on wax paper, chilled it, cut it, chilled it, flipped the wax paper cut-outs onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet, and then baked it. It didn't swell at all! Usually, when you bake gingerbread houses, you end up having to trim the cookies when they come out of the oven. I didn't have to do ANY trimming with this recipe at all! I also had more than I needed for the gingerbread house. I made all four sides, the roof, extra pieces for support, a few gingerbread cookies to eat, and I still ended up throwing away an orange-sized ball of dough that I didn't need.\n\n\nThe frosting really does hold together like glue. Like the dough, the frosting is the PERFECT recipe for a gingerbread house. For the frosting for the construction, I was only able to get 4 cups (not 5) of powdered sugar mixed into the two beaten egg whites. It was too thick to hold any more! It held strong. I think this is the first gingerbread house I ever made that didn't have pieces falling off and driving me nuts! This recipe is a keeper."

"reviewBody": "This gingerbread house turned out really well and it looks really cute! The dough after it hardens overnight is of a strong consistency so you're not afraid it won't hold up for the building process. Definitely would recommend you add 1 or 1 and 1/4 cups additional flour to the dough recipe before attempting to roll it out, or it'll be one sticky mess. And plenty of dough on the rolling board/roller is a must. Roll the dough to 1/4\" thick or slightly thinner. Make sure that the cut-out gingerbread house pieces are matching up with the cardboard cut-outs AFTER placing them on the baking sheet. I did this, &amp; mine didn't need to be trimmed at all after baking. And with the gingerbread dough left over, I was able to get 5 little gingerbread boys using my cookie cutter &amp; an extra end wall (spare in case one didn't hold). Now the powdered sugar called for (4 16 oz. bags) is a little too much- had 2 full cups of sifted powdered sugar left over &amp; if I'd tried adding all of it to my icing for the house decorating, it would have broken my mixer. The gingerbread is pretty good tasting, though it's main function is as a building material. This would be a great Christmas project for you to work on with your kids, especially putting all the candies on. Thanks for sharing this recipe, Ruth!"

"reviewBody": "It turned out pretty good, the last gingerbread house I made fell apart upon completion and tasted too wicked for me. But this recipe is pretty tasty. I did make a few changes, but it was mainly becsuse I ran out or didnt have ingredients. First, I 1 1/2 the recipe so I'd have some for cookies too. I only had a tablespoon of ginger instead of 1.5 for my adjustment. And I did not have a lemon to zest, but did have lemon juice, so I added just the adjusted amount. I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to make up for the missing ginger, and I did have to add a good amount of flour, as everyone else mentioned. I baked the house pieces for 20 minutes to stiffen them up but the cookies for only 10. Surprisingly though, the house is still quite soft after being out for several days and is starting to get eaten now that the cookies are gone. I did use a different frosting recipe (2 egg whites, 1/3 tsp. cream of tarter, and 3 cup powdered sugar), only because I've used it before with great results. The recipe as is I'd give 4 stars, but after my tweaks, I'll definitely make it again."

"reviewBody": "I didn't do lemon zest and I used my own recipe for the icing. \nI'd just like to say, I don't think it's fair to complain about a recipe when the instructions were clearly not followed if you needed to add anything extra. The dough was easy to work with since I allowed it to set in the fridge for an hour like the recipe says. I know it would have needed way more flour had I not done that. Sifting the flour after measuring it probably helped as well. \nI baked mine for 7 minutes, then trimmed the walls and roof back to the correct shape(I also cut out doors and windows half way through baking), and baked it for another 7 minutes. I assembled the house after about 45 minutes of setting and it was just fine(probably because I overcooked it but I was in a bit of a hurry so that was intentional). You can roll it out fairly thin (I wish I had rolled mine thinner) because it raises quite a bit and it's a very sturdy cookie. \nThis was an all day project so if you plan on doing this with young kids the house should be constructed and ready to decorate ahead of time. I made mine with my 7 year old from start to finish and we decorated it right after sticking it together because I didn't want her to have to wait. I admit that was risky."

"reviewBody": "I made this for a Kris Kringle present just before Christmas and it turned out great. \n\nI should say that I live in rented accomodation with a poorly stocked kitchen so while baking it had no weighing scales, no sieve, no electric whisk (no whisk of any kind actually - I used a fork), no rolling pin, no baking trays (used a silcone baking sheet), only one shelf in the oven, no wire rack to cool it on and no cake board. So I made an educated guess as to the amounts, smoothed it out by patting tinfoil over it, and improvised a cake board with a piece of thick cardboard and more tinfoil. I went out and bought an icing syringe, which for â‚¬2.50 did the job of decorating nicely.\n\nDespite the lack of normal kitchen implements this recipe still turned out great so I couldn't give it anything less than 5 stars :-)\n\nOh, like other reviewers I did use almost twice as much flour as the recipe called for so that is one little alteration. I've made the recipe again since using the specified amount of flour though, and it worked too. The spice came through stronger which was nice. And I found that if you have biscuit molds the dough holds the shape really well."

I used a different recipe for the frosting to avoid the raw eggs: 1 cup powdered sugar to 1 and 1/2 tablespoons milk, made as needed. I put it in a bag and cut the corner off to prevent it from drying out while I worked with it and so I could squeeze it out onto the pieces."

"reviewBody": "This was a very easy recipe (very basic ingredients) to put together and follow. I cut out the cardboard pieces using approx. the same dimensions (made the pitch of the roof more steep though) Once the dough was rolled out, just placed my 'templates' on the dough, traced and cut. I rolled all the dough out on separate parchment paper which made it easy to transfer to the baking sheet without 'skewing' the 'walls'. I cut out windows, before baking and added crushed candy cane which melted into our 'window glass'. I let the pieces harden overnight before starting assembly. Instead of using the icing recipe here, I used two tubs of ready-made chocolate icing and added 1 16 oz package of confectioners sugar which made a very stiff 'glue'. I assembled the walls as directed, then covered them in the icing, I 'lined' the walls to make it look like logs. I then added the roof. I used Hersheys Cookies n Creme bars to make 'shutters', Kit Kat for the front door, I halved Reeses Peanut Butter cups to make 'flower boxes, Snickers sliced in thin pieces for a 'rock' foundation, and Chocolate Frosted Mini Wheats for the roof 'shingles'. Super fun project! Great recipe, husband and kids loved the flavor of this recipe!"

The gingerbread tasted great, and the kids had so much fun decorating it. The only problem I had was that the butter was too soft when I added it, so the dough did not firm up enough to cut even after refrigeration. I solved this by rolling the dough on the cookie sheet and cutting just after I took it out of the oven. All dimensions were perfect and assembly was so easy. THANK YOU for this recipe!"

The recipe was followed to the letter and it worked out perfectly for us first timers. We did frame the houses, we made two, in the heat the construction and decoration just followed on as it all dried so quickly.

I made a batch and a half (which made two sheets), and I used Watkins' Lemon Extract instead of lemon zest (thumbs way up on taste!) The team &amp; I learned that fresh gingerbread is too crumbly - you DO need to wait more than one hour after baking to assemble:). But, my aim was also to have them cooperate and figure out a way to cut their own shapes without wasting much gingerbread - mission accomplished. And the other teams were very excited to eat our leftovers. Definitely will use this recipe over and over again."

Wanted to add that a large turkey pan liner bag is good for protecting the house overnight. Also, a battery operated tea light or mini light string can be put in if you leave a door or window big enough."

It will come out perfect for piping out of a bag and will dry hard as a rock. \n\n**I used honey in place of the molasses simply because I do not like molasses. \n\n**On advice of other reviews I also added a full 1 1/2 cups of flour. Gingerbread was exactly the perfect consistency for building. \n\n**For anyone who wants to use this for other projects, roll your dough to about the same height as a graham cracker. \n\n**Roll dough and score your shapes BEFORE you refridgerate. It is easier to work with while it is still room temp and you will only have to chill it for about 15-20 minutes."

It is very thick and only wants to stick to itself, not to the gingerbread house. After using A LOT of it, we were able to get the house together but that much icing really detracts from the house."

I'm so happy with how our first ever gingerbread house turned out that I'm submitting my pictures. I did not use any frame, I simply glued the cookies together as directed in this recipe, walls first, wait one hour til dry, then roof added, wait another hour or two, then decorate in two steps. I did make the cookies 3 days in advance, not because they needed to dry that long, just because I got busy and the house had to wait. It turned out great though! I plan to keep this icing recipe on hand for anytime I need an easy to use and very sturdy icing for decorating."

"reviewBody": "I have made this house two years in a row (for Valentine's Day instead of Xmas) and I think it's a great recipe. One year I needed to add flour, the other year I didn't, so just plan accordingly. The icing is amazing and holds the pieces together perfectly. I make tall houses and don't need a frame. I am worried about the raw eggs however and may try another recipe next year because my young children really want to eat it."

"reviewBody": "This could have been a 5 star. I agree with other's comments.. I had to add about 1 1/4 cup of flour for the dough to work properly. Once I had workable dough it was good from that point. I used another Royal Icing recipe (from this site)after reading others comments. I didn't want to chance that part. Cookie tasted great and my girls had a great time putting together our first gingerbread houses. (Had to make 2 so no fighting would happen) Will make again with adjustments to recipe. I know next time will be a 5 star!"
