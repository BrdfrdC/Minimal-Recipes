I brown the chunks in a skillet and then put everything into an Instapot. I cook it on low for 99 minutes. I use dried hatch chili flakes at a rate of 3/4 ounce per \"chili\". I simmer them a few minutes, puree in a blender, and strain out the chunks. I repeat this process a couple of times to extract as much flavor as possible. I also add about 3/4 cup of tomatillo sauce. Once done cooking, I let it sit in the Instapot for about 45 minutes to cool and then spoon the oil off the top. The pork is so tender and flavorful! You can mash the chunks with a fork or leave them whole."

Like others I also added fresh chopped garlic,mexican oregano,cumin and thyme to my taste.Instead of browning the meat with the onions I first sweated the onions,removed and browned the dredged meat on its own in more olive oil.I then added back the onions,garlic and other spices as well as S&amp;P at this step.Finally I added the chile puree and the full two cups of broth since I dredged my meat in a cup of flour (1/2 was'nt enough for my 5 pounds) and not the half.Brought all that to a slight boil and place the cast iron dutch oven with the lid on which is a must to use in my opinion! and placed in a 350 oven...so I did'nt have to babysit it while it stewed away ...... perfect dish with some fresh homemade tortillas,rice and sides of your choice."

"reviewBody": "Turned out great! I made a few changes like the previous reviewers. I didn't want to make quite a big batch so I used 3 lbs stew meat, sort of small chunks, 5 New Mexico dried chile pods, 3 Guajillo dried pods, 2 T chopped garlic, half an onion chopped and sautéed, 1 t oregano, 1/2 t cinnamon, 1/2 t cumin. I still used the entire 3 c water to steep the chiles in and used a blender to purée all of it, seeds and skin. Worked fine. No stems though! I deglazed the pan from the meat and onion with a bit of the beef broth first then added the chile sauce and beef and then added the rest of the broth until it covered the beef by a good inch. I think I ended up using about 3 c broth by the end of it. I salted and peppered at each step, but I couldn't tell you how much. I was pretty liberal though. I brought the covered pot to a boil, then placed it in a preheated 325 degree oven for an hour, stirred it, checked the meat for tenderness. My meat took two hours. The house smelled amazing! We ended up calling it \"'Julio Child's' Mexican Boeuf Bourgignon\""

The package of chilies I bought had 12, so I used them all- Just makes extra sauce, which is fine because I use my leftovers as base for an awesome pot of Chili. After browning the meat, I put all the ingredients in my crock pot on low. The meat was perfectly tender after 5 hours.Toward the end, the mix was tasting a bit bland, so I added about 1 tsp. of sea salt, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1 tbls Mrs. Dash southwest blend. I also stirred in a handful or two of semi-sweet chocolate chips (my family likes just a touch of that mole' flavor)"

I did change the recipe per my preference. First i used \"Smoked chilies\" that i smoke myself every year. Then i smoked it with an open dutch over for about 2 hours on my pellet smoker. I then finished it inside with a closed lid. Each person is going to like different consistency in thier chili colorado. For me it was too thin. So at the end i just made a roux and added it to the pot for the perfect consistency. My wife is very picky and doesn't like a lot of mexican food i like and she absolutely loved this so i will be making it again. Thanks for the recipe"

I followed the recipe exactly but found the flour made the sauce rather pasty and detracted from the flavor. I used just regular \"New Mexico dried chiles\", but think this needs the ones that specifically say \"hot\" and maybe some seasoning changes. Thank you for a good starting point on working with dried chiles!"

"reviewBody": "This was a great recipe. I moved from CA to WI 5 years ago, only to find out that the Mexican restaurants here don't have two things that I love..chili colorado and Sunday brunch. I wanted a bit more flavor, so I added 1 tsp of garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, salt, and chili powder. This is as good as the chili colorado in my favorite mexican restaurant in CA, but it's not quite as hot. If you like your chili colorado with a bit more heat, substitute some or all of the dried chilis with something with more kick. I did depart from the general preparation a little. after I sauteed the onions, I put them in the blender with the chili puree and pureed them in. The sauce did come out a little thinner than I wanted it, so I added 1/4 cup cold water with 2 tbsp corn starch and that made it the perfect consistency.\n\nTo those who have commented that it came out like beef stew..you either have a strange idea of stew is or you did it wrong."

This is where the EXTRA flare camer in... I roasted three small red bell peppers, 5 small roma tomatoes and one jalapeno... deseeded the peppers and blended everything together for the sauce. Poured over the beef and cooked on high for 4.5 hours. The beef was a melt in your mouth with shredded cheddar and sour cream for the finishing touches. Yummm!"

Butt to be exact. \r\n\r\nSecond, I browned the dredged pieces as I always do--on my two burner pancake griddle--they are well separated and truly brown, they do not release juices and steam. I do this for all stews. Works every time.\r\n\r\nThird, not having New Mexican chiles I sub'ed Guajillo chiles and some Anchos. Both hotter varieties but not crazy hot. I buy them from Penzeys and they were wonderful. A great heat that did not mask the depth of the pepper flavor.\r\n\r\nFourth, I love beans so I added pintos at the end. \r\n\r\nFifth, I added garlic but nothing else. I think oregano or cumin would ruin the straight up chile flavor. Note--I wrote chilE, not chili. There is a big difference there! And it is the essence of this recipe.\r\n\r\nLast, I saw a recipe like this one which added a TB of vinegar and a TB or two of sugar. I did this and it deepened all the flavors. \r\n\r\nThis dish is extremely good and not much work. Make it the night before."

Suggestions: - Use scissors to snip the tops off the chiles, then cut a seam lengthwise on the pepper. This makes it easy to open the pepper and pull out the seeds. - Use a stick blender to puree the chiles directly in the pot you re-hydrated them in. Much easier than transferring to a pitcher blender. One addition to try - 1 can tomato paste and 1-2 tsp sugar to chile puree after straining. Garlic powder, oregano, and cumin can be added to the seasoned flour as well."

The interesting thing is Chile Colorado is supposed to be meat with a red sauce, a traditional Hispanic dish. It isn't supposed to be made with beans thrown in it as a typical chili (not chile) would have so I am confused when people add beans to this dish. i come from a Hispanic family and they have all made it with the meat and red sauce. Anyhow, this recipe is perfect. I made it with pork roast instead, which I cut up. I also couldn't find any New Mexico chiles so used California chiles and added some New Mexico chile powder, about 1 tsp, to the sauce mixture. Since I used pork, I used chicken broth, 2 cups, to the pot. Served with rice, beans and tortillas. It was fabulous."

I would ask him, but he has gone back to Mexico, and my poor husband is not the cook of the family. If anyone can give me any advice, I'd really like to have some! Thanks!"

"reviewBody": "I did something wrong here. The directions said to DREDGE the meat in flour, which to me means to coat it on all sides. You simply cannot dredge 5 pounds of cubed roast in 1/2 cup of flour, so I used as much flour as it took to dredge all the meat. BIG BIG MISTAKE, don't do it. I ended up with, instead of sauce, a nasty red paste covering the meat. I will try it again soon, but this time I will only SPRINKLE a 1/2 cup of flour over the 5 pounds of cut up meat!!! It will be more like a seasoning than a dredging. I bet it will be terrific, because I LOVE chile colorado!"

"reviewBody": "My wife made this recipe this past weekend and it was good but I agree with some of the other reviewers that using the flour kills the flavor of the chilis. We are going to try it without using the flour on the meat but use a little to thicken the sauce if needed."

I added it to bean and cheese burritos! I added cumin, mexican oregano, garlic, thyme, chili powder and a bay leaf for the first hour of cooking. It reminded me of Tito's Tacos in Los Angeles and the meat they use. Very well done!"
