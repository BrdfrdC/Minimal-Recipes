After I put the egg mixture on top, I sprinkled garlic powder and red pepper flakes. The family went crazy! This was so so good. Thanks!"

I also used two 7 oz cans of diced green chiles. First I sprayed a casserole dish with Pam spray. I spooned in one can of green chiles. Sauteed half a diced onion with some garlic. Cooked the chorizo with the onion and garlic, and added 1 1/2 cups of cooked rice to the mixture. Spooned half the mixture onto the green chiles, spread pepper jack cheese on top. Spooned the other half onto the cheese. Spread more cheese onto that. Put the other can of green chiles into a blender with 4 eggs, 1/4 cup of flour and 1 cup of milk. Blended on low for a minute then poured on top of the chorizo mixture. Put rest of the cheese on top. Baked at 350 for 50 minutes. Made some homemade refried beans for a side. That was a good dinner. Plus leftovers for work."

Yesterday I used this recipe without the meat and I roasted my own Pasilla chilis (a bit more spicey). I layered with chilis, cut slices of monterey jack cheese, green chili salsa I made (tomatillos/can of green chilis/garlic blended in blender). I didn't put too much green salsa chili on each layer, I didn't want it to be too liquidy. My last layer was the green roasted pasilla chili, poured the egg/milk/flour mixture and topped with shredded (Mexican blend) cheese about 1 cup on top and more green salsa (about a cup). I made this for a Pot Luck and it was a huge hit. Everyone was full, because I came a bit late, but couldn't help themselves."

I roasted 20 lbs of FRESH whole anaheim chiles. I did not use the ground beef. The real relleno is made with \"cheese\". There are some recipes that SHOULD NOT be altered. This is one of them. Especially when several of your guests are Hispanic. Using evaporated milk seems to work better then dairy whole milk."

I served it for breakfast with toast and sliced tomatoes broiled w/ a little cheese on top. It was really good, but even BETTER later, reheated, between two slices of buttered toast as a sandwich. Maybe not traditional but one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've had! I sliced the leftovers into 'sandwich size' and froze to have quick breakkies!"

I wanted to be quick so I added 1 cup of salsa on top of the meat instead of onion. I used Chedder/Jack combo cheese. In addition to salt and pepper, I added 1 tsp. of sugar and 1/2 tsp. of cumin to the flour/egg mixture. I used diced green chiles and only used one 4 oz. can. I didn't want to use 2 in case I didn't like the recipe since I made so many changes. Well, it came out super tasty and I will make it again. There was a lot of juice from the salsa so I served with a slotted spoon."

I added 2 cloves of garlic, roasted 4 chillies, peeled and seeded them, split them down the center and laid them flat in the dish. I decreased the amount of milk to 1 cup and used Monterey Jack cheese instead of Cheddar. I think next time I will try corn meal mix instead of plain flour. It really was fantastic. I will use this over and over again."

"reviewBody": "Husband said in order for this to be a 5-star recipe, it needs \"crispiness.\" That's no fault of the recipe, though. Maybe if I'd broiled it after it was done baking, it would have been 5-stars for him! I rate it 5-stars, but with a few modifications. 1.) I baked this in a 13x9 inch pan and used 4 cans of whole chile peppers (opened them up flat) and one 12 ounce can of evaporated milk instead of plain milk; 2.) I dumped two small cans of tomato sauce over the top once it was done, then baked another five minutes to heat the sauce through; 3.) since I used a bigger pan, I used another 1/2 cup of cheese (as if I need an excuse to use more cheese!). Overall a great recipe! I will make this again!"

I cooked it at 375 for over an hour and it still would not. I finally took it out when the eggs were cooked, but the milk was a puddle in the center, scooped out the liquid and put some heated enchilada sauce on it to save it. I will try a bigger dish next time and less milk. It was very good, other than the liquid fiasco, which also made it look unappetizing. I also added hot sauce and hot spices to the meat and onions."

Roast them in your oven broiler till they blister, turning to get all sides even as possible. Remove and place in a brown grocery bag, with the top folded over for 5 or so minutes. Peel stem and seed. \n\nThe other tip is to combine your ground beef with an equal ammount of PORK CHIORIZO. Brown them together. Make sure you cook thoroghly. Drain grease and continue with original recipe.\n\nI also replace a small (1/3 portion) of the flour measure for the casserole \"glue\" with yellow corn meal, and add a few shakes of any mexican brand or tabaso type sauce to the batter.\n\nFight Night Favorite!"

"reviewBody": "Great recipe. Love that it's simple! After reading some of the reviews I decided to add a package of taco seasoning to the meat and onions but *yikes* I didn't have any. I decided to use the Taco Seasoning I from this website. I browned the meat, added the onion, then simmered for 20 min with 2 T of taco seasoning and half cup of water. I used FOUR cans of whole chiles (because one wasn't enough to make a full layer) and 3 cups of cheese. I used two cans for the first layer (sliced in half and spread out), then 1.5 cup cheese, meat mixture,1.5 cup cheese, 2 more cans of chiles, and egg mixture as directed. I'm so glad I added extra cheese. It was an attractive casserole and I think I'll bring it to my next potluck. My husband and I liked it a lot but I think I might add diced chiles to the meat mixture so make it hotter. Served with Spanish rice and Tapatio sauce &amp; sour cream on the side. I'll give it 5 stars when I can make it hotter."
