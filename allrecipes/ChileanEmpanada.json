I suggest making them a bit larger than a cup or cookie cutter will give you. Chilean husband says it reminds him of home."

The only thing I would do differently is use a bit less of the chopped black olives and add some chopped green chilis to the mix. There was more than enough mix to fill numerous empanadas. I make mine small, 5 inch circles and we had about 24 and enough mix left over for another ten at least. I served the remaining mix over a hot rice for a quick lunch."

Since other reviewers were saying the dough was too dry I only added 4 1/4 cups flour and used 2 sticks of butter instead of shortening and the dough was not dry at all and was very easy to work with. I put the dough in the fridge while I made the filling then took it out and rolled it."

An easier recipe for the dough is:\r\nfour sticks of butter melted\r\none cup of milk\r\nfour cups of flour\r\nmix, cover and refrigerate over night\r\nlet the dough sit at room temp for about 20 minutes and it is easy to roll, flaky and perfect\r\nbrush empanadas with a beaten egg lightly before baking"

I also read how bland the dough was so I added oregano, and Italian seasoning to the flour and brown sugar to my butter flavored shortening and milk mixture. Definitely gave a great flavor to the crust of my delicious empanadas. A lot of work but worth it. Got meat leftover so I'll make more tomorrow for work."

My filling was a bit different: bell pepper onion, ground turkey (instead of beef or pork) with the rest of the spices. The empanadas turned out excellent! It can be used as a great base for other meat empanadas! Thank you for sharing this recipe!"

I'm not a big olive person so those were left out the only other thing I might change next time is using maybe 1/2 cup of raisins. I felt like there was a lot but they were still great. Also, I would consider getting pork and cutting it myself for the meat mixture. Thanks for a great recipe though! :)"

It wasn't flaky or pastry-like enough, so I'd say the proportions of butter and flour would need to be altered. If you aren't used to eating real empanadas, then this dough will do just fine, but if you are cooking for Latinos, you should keep looking for a better recipe."
