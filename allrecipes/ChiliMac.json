To me, it isn't chili mac if you're using taco seasoning. But this is what I did and changed. \n\nUsed Chili Seasoning instead of Taco Seasoning \nAdded 1 can of the diced tomato \nUsed 1/4 cup of water. Reducing the 1/2 cup because of the extra can of diced tomatoes I added."

Teens &amp; toddlers included. I was surprised by how much they raved about it. Our only suggestion would be to use less macaroni and maybe add yet another (orange or roasted red) pepper.\n\nMy favorite thing about this recipe (besides making me a hero-chef) is how it is a hit without being salty. No added salt or salty ingredients, other than cheese....and you can reduce the amount of cheese if you really want to."

I did not add the water where there was so much more tomato than called for. Only had half the cheese but after mixing it up I put the cheese on top and only baked 20 min covered and it was delish. My advise is top with sour cream. I had some without it first and it was great but as leftovers put some on and the difference is crazy."

"reviewBody": "I essentially wanted to make a thicker chili with some mac and cheese in the mix. This was not that. This was glorified hamburger helper. I followed almost everything to a T. The only changes I made were the recommendations about cook time. Covered for 10 minutes, uncovered for 5. Other than that, as per the rest of the recipe it tastes absolutely nothing like chili. The taco seasoning throws everything off. It doesn't even taste like taco-y goodness. There wasn't enough sauce to cover everything right. Shredded cheese did nothing to help what so ever. I'm probably mostly disappointed by the fact that this wasn't what I thought or hoped it would be."

I think some of the confusion about “not enough sauce or makes a lot” comes from the 2 cups COOKED pasta—that’s 1 cup uncooked or 1/2 a package or less of pasta (I used half a box—8 oz). I wish I doubled the recipe because there is less than one serving leftover between my husband and I!"

The changes I made were to use corkscrew pasta, I used 1 and a half cans of the tomatoes, added a small can of diced green chile, seasoned with Lawrys seasoning salt (found it was too bland without it), and I used more cheese. Also, make sure to cook your pasta al dente or it might get mushy since you are also cooking it more in the oven. Since all of the ingredients are already cooked when you put everything together, I baked at 375 covered for 10 minutes, then uncovered for an additional 5. Served with sour cream. It was delicious and made amazing leftovers!"

"reviewBody": "Everyone loved this simple but tasty recipe ( adults, teens, &amp; tweens)! I used Jumbo Ridged Macaroni (which holds its shape when stirred into in hearty dishes), mild McCormick taco seasoning, mild Rotel tomatoes, and Mexican blend shredded cheese. The \"extras\" I added were a sprinkle of Fiesta Ranch dry mix, &amp; a can of store brand chili with beans. I added these just in case it wasn't flavorful enough as written, as I'd used an extra 1/2 pound of meat &amp; doubled the noodles to be sure there was enough for a sleepover guest. I think it would have been just as good the original way though, &amp; I feel it could also allow for substitutions/experiments when desired. We also ate crushed tortilla chips with it, yum! Fast n' easy! Thanks for the recipe. :-)"

"reviewBody": "Many years ago I had an aunt who made this and I fell in love with it. Then I joined the Navy and this was a regular item on the menu and was often served for mid rats while at sea. I was reminded of Chili Mac on a FB Navy Vets page and decided to make it. To my knowledge I have never made Chili Mac so this was my first try. I found it to be very easy and fast enough to make and I followed the recipe for the most part with the exception of adding about a tablespoon of chili powder to make the dish less bland. In addition I only cooked it for 15 minutes to brown which is more than enough since everything is already cooked. I will definitely make this one more frequently since it has leftovers worth eating again."

"reviewBody": "I had some leftover homemade turkey chili, and I was looking for an easy Chili Mac recipe with high ratings. This one seemed like exactly what I was looking for, and it was. I had about 3 cups of leftover chili, so I used it along with half the amounts of macaroni and cheese called for in the recipe. I followed step 2 exactly, spooning half of the mixture in the dish and topping with half the cheese, and then adding the rest of the mixture. I baked it for 30 minutes covered and then added the remaining cheese and baked 5 more minutes. For a smaller batch, I probably should have put it in a smaller pan, such as a loaf pan. However, it was fine as prepared. I would echo the comments of a couple of reviewers that it could have used a little more cheese. That's a personal preference, though. I imagine that it would even be delicious with your favorite canned chili if you were pressed for time."

The only thing I would change about this recipe is the amount of recommended cheese. I would suggest using 1cup of cheese to start. Also I seasoned with salt and pepper."

Then over remaining meat mixture. Well, if it takes 4 cups of cheese how could you only use 1 cup on the first layer?? I baked 30 minutes and added more cheese to top but not using anywhere close to 4 cups of cheese. Made it for my Bunco group and there are 16 of them so we'll see what they have to say.

However next time, I will probably use Rotel diced tomatoes and green chili's mainly because I didn't like big chunks of stewed tomatoes (I tried chopping them smaller but they were still to big for my liking) and I like my food spicy. The only thing I noticed was a 11 x 17 pan was a bit to big so I used a smaller 9\" inch square pan and it was just right."
