I added a cup of fresh salsa plus 2 fresh tomatoes to use up what was on hand. Outstanding recipe! Easier and tastier than many loaded nacho recipes I’ve tried."

I didn't have a lime, so I had to use lemon juice, which was fine. The fresh tomato mixture was very good baked on the nachos. The only thing I would do differently next time is to bake the nachos for 10 min, then add the cheese to the top. I would like the cheese more \"melty\" than baked on. I served with sour cream and sliced avocado. Yum! I've never purchased canned chili before, but DH said I need to keep a can of this around for when I'm not home to make him dinner next time! LOL"

I made it as written except for the black olives and jalapeño only because I didn't have them in my pantry. The next time I make it, I will make sure to have them on hand.\nOne of my favorite things about this recipe was mixing the tomatoes, cilantro, and onion in fresh lime juice. I think it brought a beautiful, bright, freshness that I will continue to use in other recipes. \nThis is a dish I will be making again."

These nachos were really good! I would definitely make these again and even for company!"
