I poached a chicken breast, shredded the chicken, and added it on top of the first layer of cheese. I sprinkled salt and pepper, cumin, and garlic powder over the chicken.\n\nFor the egg mixture, I added 3T of flour and 1t of baking soda to make if fluffy based on the suggestion of another reviewer.\n\nI also found I only needed 1lb of cheese. I mixed pepperjack and a mexican cheese blend."

Since it is just the two of us in my house, I halved the recipe and put it in a pie plate. I did bake it about 10 more minutes than it needed because I was concerned about how liquidy it looked on top, but upon cooling it firmed up. I also used about half the cheese that it called for, plus I used low-fat. This is a keeper!"

I chopped them and mixed them with the jack cheese and egg mixture. I found that on 400 you only need to cook the casserole for 20 minutes or 350 for 30 minutes. Added 1 small can of tomato sauce on top and sprinkled a handful of cheddar cheese and cooked it for 10 additional minutes at 375. I also cooked it in a slightly smaller pan. My husband who doesn't even care for chili relleno loved it!"

I picked the carrots out and lined the jalapeños on the bottom of the pan as best I could. This only made one layer, so I can't comment on the exact recipe.

I also sprinkle the cheese on top prior to baking and then add a bit of fresh on top of the salsa. Looks and tastes fantastic!!!!!"

I chop up olives and green onions and put a layer of that over the cheese. I always make more than this recipe does so I make a bigger batch of the milk/egg/flour mixture. I put all my layers down before putting it into the oven, so it winds up being: chili's, cheese, mixture of olives and green onions, chili's, cheese, mixture of olives and green onions, then the milk/flour/eggs mixture. I set the timer for 40 minutes and then once the timer goes off, I check for doneness and cook longer if needed (since I make a larger batch.) Someday I may try adding roasted, red bell peppers to the olive, green onion mixture. I like to serve this with Refried Beans. Ole'"

"reviewBody": "7/7 of my family members that tried this loved it. I did make a few changes to the recipe, so I can't say that I would have given it 5 stars as written. Instead of canned, I used 8 average-sized poblano peppers that were roasted, peeled, stems and seeds removed, and cut into wide strips. I also used about 1.5 lbs of pepper jack instead of the 2 lbs of cheddar, which I'm sure lent itself to a more authentic Mexican flavor, and probably made it seem less overwhelmingly cheesy. I also added an extra 2 TBSP of flour and about 1 tsp of baking powder to the batter to make it a little more fluffy and less custardy. If I had used canned sauce, which I didn't because I always make my own, I think 1 can would have been plenty! This was as close as you'll get to chili rellenos without actually making chili rellenos. I'll definitely be making it again!"

"reviewBody": "In relation to the amount of chiles and enchilada sauce, 2 pounds of cheese is unnecessary and nutritionally undesirable given our personal preferences. I elected to cut the cheese in half while other reviewers compensated by upping the chiles used in the dish . . . either way works. Another issue surfacing in the reviews is too much enchilada sauce. I stayed with the recipe but added 2, 10\" flour tortillas over top of casserole at step 3, and then added the second layer of cheese and enchilada sauce. This absorbed the ‘liquid’ some had concerns about and gave the casserole a little more substance. Also added personal seasonings since no seasonings were in the ingredients list. Removing from the oven and allowing the casserole to rest for about 10 minutes, the enchilada sauce was a bit runny but firmed up significantly after waiting another 15 minutes. With these modifications, it was close to 5* but the next day leftovers were even better with the ingredients further binding together along with more in-depth flavor. A big bonus is the ease of making this casserole with minimal prep time involved so that other things can be done while the dish bakes in the oven. A definite make again. Thanks, BonBon."

Used three 10 oz. cans of chilies, about a 1 1/2 pounds of Colby-jack cheese(2 pounds is a lot of cheese). Both cans of the canned milk and added enough regular milk to make 2 cups, and increased the flour by one more tablespoon. I did add in some paprika, black pepper, garlic and onion powder shakes for added flavor. Still baked for 30 minutes to a perfectly golden brown fluffy casserole. I know I changed a bit, but wanted to let those that need a larger amount know how easy it is to increase the ingredients a bit and still come out with a great. Every body raved about this one at our party."
