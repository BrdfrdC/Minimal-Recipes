FYI I had one piece I didn’t cook for about 4 days and it was just to overpowering after marinating that long. Great recipe! Must try!"

"reviewBody": "A wonderfully simple and very flavorful recipe. I made mine in the oven since I don't have a grill. After ~6 hours of marination it was flavor-packed.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like was the pork shoulder cut that was recommended. I cut away some of the thick fat on the outside of the pieces and it was still well-marbled throughout. I was hoping this fat would render out more but in the end some pieces were pretty chewy. Perhaps it would render more with a lower and even slower cooking time. I hesitate to go with a pork loin because of how lean it is; maybe there is something in-between? I'll figure that out for next time."

I did not have star anise either, so I ended up using onion powder, curry seasoning, cinnamon, and a pinch of bbq rub. I also used special non-salt since my mother cant have a lot of it and the soy sauce was already pretty rich with it. I used a little white wine as well, since i didnt have the correct type or substitutes. I'm very happy with how it still turned out. It was delicious and this recipe is absolutely amazing. Thank you for also adding a part for if we are using the oven! That was very appreciated! Well done!"

Side dish of basmati rice with coconut milk, ginger and scallions (lots of good recipes options) and steamed broccoli. I used pork shoulder as instructed and it was great but definitely a lot of fatty pieces to work around on the plate. I like the idea of trying with pork tenderloin next time as others mentioned."

Cut my pork tenderloin into 4 equal pieces and let it marinate for 18 hours before grilling low and slow on the BBQ. Basted it occasionally with the reserved marinade after I reduced it on the stove. Sliced it up and served it with fried rice, bok choy and the extra sauce. Better than store bought or takeout and super easy to make!! You knocked it out of the park with this one, Chef John!! Thank you for sharing!!"

"reviewBody": "This is a third review on this dish. I have cooked it with three different kinds of pork: shoulder, tenderloin and sirloin. Going from left or right that is fatty, lean and in between. I did not indirect cook so the cooking time and appearance is totally different. Takes about 25 minutes with grill direct at temperature at ~275 as suggested. The sirloin was the best but took more time to trim. The marinade for all three was the same. The shoulder was, for our means, too fatty and with excessive gristle (maybe just the particular cut?), the tenderloin was a bit non-descript and did not taste like pork - just the sauce, and the sirloin (you have to ask your butcher exactly for this cut) was, as the little pig said, just right. A great combination of tender, flavorful and without the excessive fat. Disclaimer #1: you do have to do a bit more trimming. Disclaimer #2: I marinated all three times for 2 days. Love Chef John's recipes! This recipe will remain in the often-made list."

This is a fantastic recipe, the pork came out as I had tasted it in Chinatown. After boiling the remaining sauce, I used it to baste the ribs several times during the grilling process, and the pork came out red enough without the food dye. The flavor was right on. Thank you Chef John, for another outstanding recipe."

"reviewBody": "I was pleasantly surprised with how good this turned out. While it didn't taste exactly as the bbq pork from Chinatown tastes, it is a more than worthy substitute. I made my marinade with oyster sauce (which is slightly sweeter) instead of hoisin because I never have hoisin on hand. I did not use dye, and I put about half a cup of sauce to side. With the rest I marinated 3 lbs of country ribs for 24 hours. I baked this at 325 for 2 hours then used the remaining sauce to glaze it every 20 minutes or so until it reached 170. Next time I would put aside more sauce because it was pretty delicious. My kids and I snacked on this plain and kept going back for more. With what we had left I made fried rice and they raved about it. I would definitely do this again. As a Chinese person who grew up on bbq pork, I was very pleased with this. The only changes I might make is to very slightly dial back the 5 spice and for my personal tastes make it slightly sweeter. Thank you, Chef John! You did great!"

"reviewBody": "Closest to authentic I've found, even has the actual darker more genuine color than the usual bright red restaurant versions. I do add (4) 1/4\" thick fresh ginger coins, smashed and chopped, to the sauce before cooking. I've even had to make it without the Hoisin sauce (none on hand, and no black bean sauce to make any) , and it still came out great.\n\nYou can also use \"country style pork ribs\" for this - they're nothing more than pork butt (shoulder) cut in ~2 square strips.\n\nFor leaner diets, use a pork tenderloin or thick cut boneless pork chops, taking an extra step to brine them before marinading, to keep them moist and juicy. Also, I find that the soy sauce adds enough salt, you don't need the kosher salt at the end (especially if you've brined the pork first).\n\nFor those who don't want (or can't) use a grill for this [I only have a pellet smoker/grill at home, and don't want the smoke flavor], you can still do this quite well in the oven. To do so, simply use a sheet pan lined with foil or parchment, and lay them out on a lightly greased rack - cooking oil spray is great for this. Bake at 275º for 2 hours, basting them every 20 minutes with the sauce (6 times), and turning them every other baste (3 times). Be sure to get the sides when basting.\n\nThey will cook better, without the bottoms getting soggy (even with turning), if you raise the rack off of the sheet pan by about 2\", either using small drinking glasses or similar, or racks with fold-out legs. This all"
