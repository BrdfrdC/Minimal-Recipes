"reviewBody": "This is a good recipe. It's great with a few modifications. I left out the bell peppers because to me they just don't seem to belong in stir-fried rice. I've made this twice now and it's delicious with these changes. Be sure to cook the rice the night before or morning of and refrigerate otherwise you'll have a sticky mess. Rice needs to be cold. I used 1 cup dry rice to get 4 cups cooked. That's all that will fit in my pan when I stir-fry. Be sure to not use any salt when cooking rice, because this dish will be salty enough from other ingredients. Also used 2 thick leftover pork chops cut into small pieces instead of chicken. First scramble eggs with 1 Tbs. water and cook flat in skillet with 1 Tbs. vegetable oil. Cook for 1 min., flip for another 30 seconds and roll up like a cigar and set aside. Chop into ribbons and then smaller pieces with spatula. Add 2 Tbs. oil to skillet and cook bias cut carrots 3 min; add bias cut celery and onion and cook 2 min; add 1 clove minced garlic and cook 30 seconds. Add 1-1/3 c. frozen peas (1/2 of 12 oz. bag) and cook 1 min.; add cooked meat you are using and cook 1 min. Add rice and sauce and stir to warm and mix (Sauce: 3 Tbs. oyster sauce, 1 Tbs. soy sauce, and 1 tsp. sesame oil stirred together.) Add 3-4 chopped green onions and eggs and mix to warm. Yum!"

"reviewBody": "Good, especially considering it has so few ingredients. Because I made a lot, I had to stirfry the ingredients in batches and therefore needed to add more oil. I also suggest doubling the amount of chicken, since we could barely tell there was chicken in the recipe with the amount it called for. Fresh pineapple chunks would be a good addition. My family enjoyed this. I will make it again."

Also it doesn't mention to cook the rice 1st and let chill, since it should be added to the dish while it has been cooked prior also! A little play with it in one way or another is to us just part of cooking new recipes! Enjoy!!!"

Good cooks leave in what they like, take out what they don't have on hand or like, and substitute to their or their family's taste. The addition of garlic, oyster sauce and mixed vegetables takes this fried rice over the top in flavor."

I did not use red bell pepper, pea pods, and green bell pepper. Instead I used shredded cabbage with the onions, carrots (my daughter doesn't like cooked carrots so I made sure they were just tender crisp... she ate them!), and celery. I coated the chicken with about a 1/4 tsp garlic powder, a 1/4 tsp onion powder, 2 tsp ponzu sauce, and 1 Tbsp hoisin sauce. I used low salt soy sauce in place of regular, and added a few chopped spring onions on top. Other than that (ha ha) I followed the recipe as written. Best fried rice ever!"

"reviewBody": "I used about 3 cups brown rice for this cooked in vegetable broth (3 cups cooked). I also used fresh broccoli- 4 stalks, fresh sliced poblano and jalapeno pepper- unseeded, 1 onion- sliced, 4 cloves of sliced garlic, 1 10 oz. package frozen peas, 2 peppers- yellow and red, 3 cups chopped smoked turkey and 6 eggs. I cooled the rice down after I cooked it, then stir fried the broccoli in about 2 Tb. olive oil, then added the onions, peppers and garlic, added the turkey after that to warm, then added the peas. I put the rice in another pan, cracked the eggs over and stirred until scrambled. I added soy sauce, salt, pepper, adobo seasoning and cilantro sauce. I mixed altogether. Very very good- this is a forgiving recipe- add whatever meats or vegetables you like. It's a great recipe for Weight Watchers- it contains most of the power foods! Love it- and my husband does also- he is not even needing to lose weight:)"

I included all the ingredients except the pea pods. I used baby peas instead. And I used Rice Select Royal Blend with Red Quinoa....so glad I used this rice blend. And I didn't measure much of anything (as usual) and added some seasoning like Lawry's Seasoned Salt and some pepper. My hubby and I really loved this. And it made a lot even when I scaled it to serve two. Oh, yes, and I used EVOO instead of sesame oil...my preference in almost everything. Sal....you made us really happy! Thanks."
