You can splash in a bit more if necessary towards the 5 minute mark, but a full cup is too much. Also, as others have said, a tablespoon of the meat mixture is WAY too much for must dumpling wrappers. Do half of that. Finally, the dipping sauce is not so great - you can find many better recipes out there. All that said, these dumplings are completely legit!"

I made mine with ground beef instead of pork and also chopped shrimp and 2 cups of shredded cabbages. My husband and I love it! It just taste so much better with shrimp and cabbages. You can omit the egg if using chopped up shrimp since either ingredient binds the filling. For cooking, we pan fry one side for two minutes, then pour in 3 tablespoons of water instead of a cup and let the water evaporate and then flip them to sizzle on one side for 2 minutes to let it make them crispy."

I also used ground ginger since thatâ€™s what I had on hand. For the dipping sauce I added 2-3 tbs of brown sugar to offset the tangy. Lastly, I flipped the cooking instructions and boiled them for a few minutes in a large pot first and then fried them up (hubby doesnâ€™t like soggy dumplings and boiling, then frying gave them a nice golden brown outside). It turned out great! These are a bit time consuming, but well worth it!"

I didn't have rice vinegar so I used regular instead in the dipping sauce and it seemed just fine. Not sure if this was just my experience or if others had the same, but once I added the water they were cooked in about 2 minutes. The first batch that I left in the full 5 minutes was a little soggy. I'd check them earlier just in case! Thanks for another delicious recipe!"

After frying, i throw in one chicken broth ice cube, put the top on and let them steam a few minutes. Broth really adds to the already complex flavors. We generally just use soy, rice wine vinegar, chopped scallions and a drop or two of sesame oil for the dipping sauce. Great recipe."

Also wonton wraps instead of dumpling because thatâ€™s all my local grocery store had. If you freeze leftovers make sure you keep them separated otherwise theyâ€™ll stick together and rip apart when thawed. That happened to me and I ended up cooking the big dumpling hunk all together. It was like a cake! Still delicious! Lol"

I made 45 with this batch, froze most of them and they defrosted well with no noticeable loss of flavor. When defrosting, put some flour or spray oil on the plate to prevent sticking."

If you try to fit a tablespoon of meat mixture into those little gyoza wrappers, they will open up and be ruined when you cook them. A full half tablespoon will work. And when sealing the edges, press them firmly with the tines of a fork. I know, Chinese people don't use forks, but I do!"

Thanks to the delicious spices and flavorings of the ingredients that go into these, this substitute did not detract from the recipe or the flavor of the dumplings at all. Give yourself ample prep time if making the full recipe! I cut it down to 1/4 and it made plenty for one meal. I little of the filling goes a looong way."

"reviewBody": "I lived in China for 5 years and these are authentic. I have had better dipping sauce. But I did add about 3-4 tablespoons of brown sugar which did help. I found the round wrappers in the frozen section at a Chinese grocery store or now at the regular store in the produce section. I also added purple cabbage to the inside. And then I did a version with cut up shrimp instead of pork. DO NOT OVERFILL them because they will break. When cooking, I boiled them or cook them in water for about 5 minutes first. You can eat them that way if you you want to cut out the excess fat from frying. Then I fried them in oil (a few minutes on each side until they are golden brown and crispy). They were fantastic. The next time I tried cooking as written and I thought adding 1cup of water was way too much. They turned out soggy but still yummy. You can put anything you want inside the wrappers like water chestnuts or a different kind of meat, but this is a great guide."

"reviewBody": "Excellent! I am half Taiwanese and grew up going to Chinatown (NYC) and living in a \"Chinatown\" in Queens. I know dumplings, wontons, soup dumplings, whatever! I've never ventured making them myself until now. Having my eldest son help make these reminded me of the days of helping to prepare them when I was a little girl. I followed the recipe to a T but after trying it that way here are the changes I made. I added sugar and ginger to the dipping sauce. I also tried frying them and then boiling them as stated. Boiling made them floppy so to save prep time and crunchiness I only fried them and then kept them warm in the oven. They stayed wonderfully crunchy and was a big hit with the family. Btw, I once had over 250 dumplings in my one and only freezer that I hoarded after hearing the local Chinese market was closing. We loved our dumplings and we missed them terribly. Now we can get our fill!"

I have made this a number of times, as my husband and 8 year old loves this. Sometimes I cook the dumplings in my homemade chicken broth and add a few things like soy sauce to give it a chinese flare. I have found that frying the dumplings is not necessary and I always try to freeze some of them to cook on a different night- they freeze quite well. One note is after you mix the pork with the other ingredients, let it sit in the frig for 30 minutes or more... this allows the meat to fully marinate :-)"
