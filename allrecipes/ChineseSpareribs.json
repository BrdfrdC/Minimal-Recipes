It was still raw on the inside. After I cut it, I still baked it an additional 40 mins while still turning and glazing in between turns. Came out to be medium rare (145Â°) which was perfect for me. Next time I will probably up the amount of honey and a dash more of five spice."

"reviewBody": "Kinda of disappointed. We had a little over 3 lbs of spareribs so used ingredients accordingly. That to me was a mistake because it made way to much sauce. We did marinate overnight which we usually do so no problem there. Had to eventually turn the oven up to 350 but the ribs still came out tender &amp; juicy. Warmed up &amp; used more leftover sauce on the ribs tonight &amp; were actually better than the 1st night. I was willing to try again but use less hoisin sauce &amp; ketchup because I thought it was to heavy on the taste, but hubs said no to delete the recipe. If I could give a thought, I'd keep with the ingredients as is &amp; don't increase for the weight of the ribs within reason. My ingredients list was for 1 lb of ribs &amp; we had just over 3 lbs. I really felt it was a waste of sauce."

When there's a party and serving timing isn't clear, I place tinfoil over the top and leave them in the oven to cook the meat down, then remove the tin foil to thicken the sauce when we are close to serving. Springs onions are a must to throw over at serving time as they contrast beautifully with the sticky ribs."

"reviewBody": "Good recipe and hoisin is the prime ingredient when making Chinese ribs, but if you want them to taste like the do from the takeaway, or restaurant, then you need to add a ridiculous amount of sugar. These recipes never tell you how much sugar you need to add to get an authentic taste, but you really want a cup or more for something like this recipe. Just keep adding sugar until it tastes right, you probably won't believe how much sugar you have to add, but that's the rub. Chinese rib sauce at it's core is basically hoisin sugar syrup. You might want to thicken it a little with cornstrach/cornflour."

To the marinade recipe which I doubled, I added 1 tsp sriracha, 1 tsp toasted sesame oil, 1 tsp liquid smoke, 1 tsp fish sauce, and 1 chopped shallot. Put the marinade in crock pot with the baby back ribs and then used the marinade as a sauce over the ribs and jasmine rice for final dinner presentation. Ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious and the marinade/sauce was absolutely outstanding."

I double the sauce and I used half for marinade and other for crockpot. Ribs had way too much fat. Next time i will use baby backs. Also sauce burned at bottom of crockpot so next time I will add 1/2 cup of water or chicken broth. The ribs did come off the bone easy so all good there."

"reviewBody": "Good. However, I followed the recipe but felt there was a little too much of something, and I think it was the soy sauce. You really don't need it with the Hoisin. I think next time I will sub water for the soy sauce, or just leave it out; and whiskey for the sake. I subbed sherry for the sake this time per internet recommendation. Made a double recipe for a little over 2 pounds of spareribs and added a 1/2 tsp. of sesame oil (personal preference). Marinated overnight. I did NOT follow the baking method for this recipe so I cannot rate it. Instead I used a method from a reviewer, Button Love, from Hawaiian Spareribs on this site. I baked the ribs, without a rack, on a foil lined pan, tightly covered with foil, for 1 hour and 15 minutes at 350 degrees F. I then removed the ribs from the pan, drained the grease and drippings, and then returned the ribs to the pan, poured the marinade on top, after cooking on stove top for about 5 minutes, and put them back in the over for another 35 minutes. They came out tender and chewy and perfectly coated with a baked-on sticky sauce. I recommend trying this baking method. It was easy and perfect."

I will definitely make it again, I've already purchased the missing ingredients. This one's a keeper!"

I also couldn't find sake in time, and a local store owner loaned me some Korean liqueur that is similar, and it worked fine. I made 2 racks of baby back port ribs and 4x the recipe, but had to go back and make another batch of marinade to baste the ribs. I also cooked the ribs for 1.5 hours and they came perfectly done.

I tried using boneless spareribs and a crockpot (the crockpot per other suggestions I had read; the boneless pork spareribs were, well, a boneheaded idea on my part) and it's just not the same, comes out dry and not very sauce-y. Bone-in only and use the oven method as prescribed. Definitely going to try this again the right way!"

The type of alcohol doesn't make a huge difference. I even used ShockTop beer that has an orange-citrusy flavor. Nice. I make a large batch of this sauce and reduce it to thicken for basting and then serving with the rice. I used boneless spareribs that were thick so the cooking time was a lot longer. Finishing under the broiler really makes a nice sticky, toasty glaze so don't skip that step!"

The grilling allows some good caramelization of the sauce. You could also broil and flip the slabs similarly after removing from the foil. Great with rice and sauted chinese veggies"

I served it to raves from picky eaters. Next time, I'll probably make this the day ahead, and marinate overnight to really soak the marinade into the ribs. Thanks so much for this great recipe!"
