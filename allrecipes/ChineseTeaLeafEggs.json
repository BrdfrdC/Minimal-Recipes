Followed recipe, with no changes, and they turned out wonderful. He loves them and they're a breeze to make. Highly recommend! Thanks AR for coming to my rescue."

I also didn't use the black soy sauce because I couldn't find it anywhere, but i added in some sugar to counteract the saltiness of the recipe. Although I didn't actually think they were as salty as some people seemed to think. I'm made these twice now and I will definitely continue to make them in the future. They are a nice change from regular hard boiled eggs. Now all I need is some pickled bamboo and rice porridge and I'll be back in China!"

Then I cracked the eggs and put them in and simmered for about 30 minutes.\nI did let them soak in the sauce overnight and stored them in the fridge that way, taking them out one by one only when we were going to eat them. Also, I found the recipe could be a little saltier for our taste. Otherwise, this recipe is quite yummy.\nThe flavor is meant to be subtle, so it's not for everyone. But my husband loves it."

What I usually do is that I just throw the eggs in with the sauce in the initial boil and simmer for a few hours, and just let it marinate in the fridge in a container until I want to eat one. I also save the marinade for the next batch of tea eggs I want to make. I also found that adding a small amount of sugar makes it taste better. And in general, to prevent the egg from cracking in the beginning, it is best to let the eggs come to room temperature."

I can't stress using the black soy sauce over the regular enough. They are totally different flavors and if you just use double the regular soy sauce the eggs will probably end up being overly salty."

The whey is the soy sauce and the curds get turned into miso. This is not exact but close enough. The point being that like cheese or wine there are a LOT of soy sauces out there. Find a good one or get some miso and add water if you can't find the type you like to make better soy sauces."

I ommitted the black soy sauce since I don't know the difference. I let the eggs soak at least overnight in the refrigerator. I peel, slice lengthwise and place yolk side down on my most elegant glass platter. The appearance is of delicate marble eggs. Even kids love the taste. I call them 1000 year old eggs after the traditional Chinese dish...not the same at all, but they look antique!"
