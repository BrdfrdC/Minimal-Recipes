I made the cookies a bit larger and ended up with 24 cookies. \nTo make sure they were done had to bake them longer.\nSorry ...I lost track of how much longer but it was between 12-14 mins. They were not overcooked and dry . \nI'm definitely making these again .This time I will see what 12 mins cooking does to them.\nThe coconut is not overwhelming but is definitely there and helps give that chewiness to the cookie."

By the end it was a lot of chocolate &amp; not enough dough. rough chopped almonds added in. Wow we wow these are good! didn't get 72 cookies more like 60 I think"

I cut back on the sugar and used 1/4 C. brown and 1/4 C. white sugar and beat the snot of the butter, egg, vanilla and sugars......after it was fluffy I added the rest and only mixed until everything was incorporated. I used my large cookie scoop and baked them for 15 minutes.......edges were brown and my cookies did not \"spread\" out much at all. When I put the ball of dough on my cookie sheet I mushed them down a bit and got a nice, uniform (not thin) cookie. Thank you for sharing this ..... coconut lovers unite!"

I have even added all the ingredients at the same time, just keeping to the overall volume of 4 cups to the add-ins."

It went flat so I added more flour...then I baked one more cookie. It still wasn't enough...I added a bunch more and made one cookie and it was perfect. I made these again to determine how much flour and the total amount of flour ended up being 3 1/2 cups...substantially more than the recipe. thank you for posting this!!!!"

I followed the recipe to the letter except I cut down to 18 servings (recipe made just for the hubby and I) and that is 36 cookies, which came out at exactly the 36 count! I used my small-sized cookie scoop (just over 1\" wide), and that just makes it so much easier, faster and less messy to put them out onto the cookie sheet, which I covered with parchment paper for easier clean-up later! My hubby said the flavor of these cookies was \"delicious\" and \"totally awesome\". So, this recipe is a keeper!"

Around the holidays I love craisins or nuts or both in them. Tonight I'm adding peanut butter to half the batch and am eager to see how yummy they will be. \nI make sure to always use parchment paper. I have learned that my cookie scoop sizes varies so I just have to keep an eye on them in the oven. I pull them out when the outer bottom begins to brown. Then I leave them on the cookie sheet for about five minutes before transferring the parchment paper with the cookies on top onto a wire rack. They need to set up. \nBest cookie recipe for anyone who enjoys coconut and chocolate!"

NO ONE BELIEVES me when I say I did not use wheat or add sugar only agave.
