,"description": "This is a yummy change to standard Angel Food cake. It has a light and delicate flavor and hits the spot of that chocolate craving. Note: for best flavor and texture, serve the cake on the day it&#39;s made and be sure to avoid any traces of yolk in the egg whites, which would prevent them from whipping to their fullest."

I mix all the grated chocolate with all the flour/cocoa mixture first and then proceed with the folding; much easier than the instruction for separate folding and less chance of deflating the egg whites.

I had a little trouble getting the stiff peaks the recipe calls for, but having made a few angel food cakes before, I just forged ahead and hoped it would taste the same. It rose a little in the oven, and came out beautifully. Like the biggest, prettiest chocolate meringue cookie you've ever seen. My family couldn't keep their hands off it. My one caution is to really let it cool in the pan completely - I didn't, and mine fell out of the pan and cracked when I flipped it to cool."

I love angel food, but I thought putting chocolate in was going to take away from its goodness, but I decided to try it anyways.I am so glad I did! This was better than regular chocolate cake! I used all the indredients as stated, except I took my semi-sweet chocolate (all I had was chocolate chips) and but it in my coffee grinder. Then I ground it for about 15 seconds and viola! powdered. This makes is so when you take a bite of cake it is savory and almost melt in your mouth. There are no hard chunks, just wonderful, light, chocolatey goodness!"

I didn't have the chocolate squares to grate I did have about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips I put in the food processor for a bit and toss them with some of the flour and added them. Wow those extra bites of chocolate are wow! The cake would be good without the added chocolate but who would want to do that? Really does have a brownie like flavor with the lightness of Angel food cake! Yep a keeper! will do again for sure!!"
