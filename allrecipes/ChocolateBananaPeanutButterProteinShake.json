This has been a staple drink for when I have a low protein day and I heavily heavily recommend it! Itâ€™s not visually pretty, but it is tasty!"

I made a smaller glass to test taste first using 12 oz unsweetened almond milk, 1 tbsp of honey, 1 tbsp of peanut butter, and less than half a banana , with half a scoop of Vega mocha protein powder and this turned out amazing. It wasnâ€™t too thick, didnâ€™t have a strong earthy smell, and most importantly it was good.\nI definitely will continue to use to help me achieve my protein intake.\n\nSigned, a 3rd trimester gal"

This closely resembles it but it is a little thinner in consistency. That didnâ€™t bother me though. Great flavor!"

Can't go wrong with all of these healthy ingredients! It was the perfect amount for one serving. I'll surely make again! UPDATE 5/14/20: I had whole milk and whole plain Greek yogurt to use up so I did half of each for the milk. For the rest, did same as before. Yummy smoothie!"

"reviewBody": "I have a honey allergy so I omitted the honey and unsweetened cocoa powder. I made it with chocolate milk to give it the extra chocolate flavour it would otherwise be missing but I didn't want all the extra sugars so I used only 1/2 cup and added extra ice (I like a thick shake). My brand of protein powder packs a good chocolate punch so I tried the recipe again without the chocolate milk and it still tasted like it had a nice balance of chocolate-PB-banana . I don't know what the original version tastes like but if you've got a good protein powder you can skip the honey &amp; cocoa. That's what they do at the gym."
