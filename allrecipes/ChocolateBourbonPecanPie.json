This recipe makes way too much filling for a 9 inch deep dish Marie Calender's recipe pie crust, and so, takes forever to bake, requiring constant checking to see if its done."

"reviewBody": "This is the most deeeeelicious pie I have ever made or eaten! Everyone LOVED it on Thanksgiving! And I mean, they couldn't stop raving about it. It was exactly what I expected when I wanted a chocolate bourbon pecan pie. The flavors of the bourbon and the chocolate are both spot on. I can't wait to make this again. Watch your cooking time with pecan pies though, they usually take a good 5 minutes longer than the stated time in the recipe. You can tell it's done if the outer half of the pie filling looks firm, but there's still a slight jiggle in the center when you take it out and wiggle it a little. It will finish cooking after you take it out. Good Luck!"

I made a few changes by using 4 tablespoons of bourbon, melting about a 1/2 cup of chips to mix in with the filling and also putting a single layer of chocolate chips on the bottom of the pie shell . I softened the chips in shell for 15 seconds in he microwave before adding the filling. After I poured the filling in to the pie shell, I also added a layer of pecans to make it look pretty. It took exactly an hour to bake. I covered loosely with foil when it started browning. When the hour was up, I turned off the oven and left the pie with door open to cool and continue to set in the middle. It was perfect!! Next time I may add another tablespoon of bourbon for more bourbon flavor."

"reviewBody": "This pie is delicious and was a big hit with the family this Christmas. I made a few changes—the biggest one was using a cup of agave nectar instead of the corn syrup (our grocery store was out of Karo) and it worked great. I also used 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar instead of all white, and I used two cups of coarsely chopped pecans. I used the full 1/4 of bourbon (just right) and put the 6 oz of chocolate chips in the bottom of the uncooked homemade pie crust before pouring in the pie filling that was just right for a deep dish pie. Served the pie with vanilla ice cream (to “cut the sweet” as they say in Steel Magnolias) and the leftovers were excellent too a couple days later. This recipe is definitely a keeper!"

This year didn’t have any issues with that so that’s how I’ll keep doing it. But everyone loves this pie when I make it! Took it to the work potluck last year and one of the guys ate probably half"

"reviewBody": "Much better if you cook the sugar-corn syrup-butter mix to a full rolling boil. Then let the filling cool to about 120° before slowly adding it to the egg mix. This greatly reduces the chance of ending up with a liquid or soupy filling.\nGo deep dish crust, or you'll end up with too much filling for shell.\nBlind bake the deep-dish crust for best results.\nSubstitute another alcohol for the bourbon. I've made it with rum, whiskey, spiced rum, and Grand Marnier with excellent results.\nAdd 1/4t of orange oil (thank you, King Arthur Flour!) for a really fun flavor – chocolate, pecans, and orange are made for each other."

It was the very last of my pies to disappear after Thanksgiving.My pecan pie loving husband couldn't put his finger on what was wrong with the pie. I made the recipe as written and followed other reviews advice about placing chocolate chips in the crust. I did need to bake the pie longer than stated on the recipe to get it to set up."

I also put some of the pecans in on the bottom and put the pecan/sugar/butter mixture on top of all of the chips &amp; pecans. Baked on the middle rack and no need to shield the pie crust. Came out beautifully! EVERYONE loved them!!! People were going back for THIRDS!!"

There was just a hint of bourbon flavor the day I made it, but after that it was more intense and delicious!!! \nWill definitely make again for my next Derby Party!!"

"reviewBody": "My first attempt making a pecan pie and the pie turned out very good only it was not the pecan pie I was aiming to make. If you follow this recipe you will have more than enough filling to make 1 pie. I ended up having enough filling left over to fill 6 small single serving crusts. Next time I may just make two pies or use a deep dish crust.\nAnother detail I want to point out is that the picture associated with this recipe shows pecan halves in the filling. The recipe calls for chopped pecans so where do the pecan halves come into play? Next time I will use a combination of chopped pecans and halves to make the filling.\nI used a graham cracker crust which I would use again.\nI only used 2TBS of whiskey, but next time I'd use more.\nI added the chocolate chips to the warm syrup mix which worked out well. Most of the chocolate chips melted and result was a super chocolatey gooey filling. \nCan't wait to make it and eat it again."

Except for the crust sticking to the Pyrex pie plate (I believe this happened from poking to many holes in the dough), and the filling being runny, the taste was great. I believe I will make a few adjustments to the quantity of bourbon and poke only a few holes in the crust next time around."
