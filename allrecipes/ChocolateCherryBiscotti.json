For everyone saying this recipe is soft, that’s true if you stick to the stated cooking time. After the first 8-minute bake, I ended up turning the oven down to 325, placing the pieces back upright (in the position they were in before they were cut), and baking until they were no longer soft.

I used some homemade orange extract and added some slivered almonds I had left over from another project. I also used Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolates and chopped them up a bit because they were not “mini”. I am not a fan of white chocolate so I made a simple powdered sugar drizzle icing on topped them off. Made a nice balance for the bittersweet chocolate without being too sweet. Excellent recipe!"

I alike the way it forms nicely and the amount it raises up so each piece looks nice and thick. I did one giant loaf instead of two. I made it longer and still used the 3 inch wide. Loved the way they came out. My third or fourth time using this recipe. I will use this as my base recipe from now on and just change up the flavors - next time I will use sliced almonds and orange zest and the mini chips."

My only change was to use maraschino cherries instead of candied. Next time I make these, I may make the logs smaller to produce a smaller biscotti, b/c I just like a smaller cookie. This is def a new go-to recipe for biscotti...you can basically add in anything, and I plan to try other flavor combos, though this was a definite favorite. A keeper, for sure~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)"

"reviewBody": "I LOVED these cookies! I so did not expect these to be like any biscotti I have tried with the maraschino cherries, which I presumed was used from the main picture. However, they were even better. They remind me of all sorts of Italian cookies I have tried. They are actually not excessively sweet like I thought they would be. I chose not to add the white chocolate. I thought they were perfectly sweet as is. However, I might do a few that way for a pic to post. My only changes were using just 1 teaspoon of almond extract and 1 teaspoon of water for the missing liquid. Almond extract can be very strong. It was just right in that amount to me. With the cherries I chopped them first and let them drain well on paper towel so that I didn't end up with pink biscotti. I liked the use of the mini chocolate chips. They are my preferred type to use. I also used salted butter and it did not say. I noticed though that the bake time is slightly off. On the first bake as loaves it took 31-32 minutes and then I cooled them completely to avoid breaking when slicing. After cutting, I had to bake them 19-20 minutes, flipped them, then an additional 4 minutes. I baked them each time on parchment and suggest that. I got 36 cookies total. I am going to add these to my recipe box for next Christmas. It is definitely a festive looking cookie. Ty"

I baked them exactly as the recipe called for, including flipping them over. Perfect! I can see that if you increased the chips or the cherries that the dough might not be stable enough to hold together well, so stick to about 1/2 cup of each. There is plenty to make it look pretty AND taste good!"

I had no problems with crumbly biscotti as others said in their reviews. I used my Wusthof Serrated Knife and cut while the biscotti was still warm - just a few minutes out of the oven. For the seconding baking (after cutting the biscotti), I turned my oven down to 325 and cooked the full 8 minutes on one side then 5 minutes the other. They came out perfect. Once cooled, I dipped the bottoms in chocolate (about 6 ounces with 2 TBLS butter over double broiler) instead of drizzling on top because I wanted to bite into a nice thick coat of chocolate (I'm a chocoholic, what can I say?) ."

Rather than greasing a cookie sheet, I used parchment paper. I also lowered the temperature to 300 degrees after slicing and baked 10 minutes on each side. They were very good!"

Not sure if that is the reason why or not, but this biscotti was not real crisp and hard like I like it to be. Hubby and I both disliked how soft they turned out but thought the flavor combo was pretty good. Try this recipe but use the candied cherries and maybe bake it a few more minutes."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was very simple and quite tasty. Great cookie for dunking! I know a lot of people have complained about not being able to \"drizzle\" the white chocolate as it never seems to get thin enough in the microwave. I used white chocolate chips and put them in the microwave for about 30 seconds on 50% power...stirred...then did another 20 seconds. The chocolate was actually warm, not too hot to handle. So at that point I spooned the melted chocolate into a small ziploc bag and snipped off a very small cut from the corner. I was then easily able to squeeze and pipe the chocolate onto the biscotti. Made it so easy! You can see the result from the photo I just uploaded."

I had attempted to make biscotti once before and it completely crumbled on me after the first baking, I followed the directions exact, and even measured my oven with a gauge, but they baked too long. This recipe I baked the first round for 25 minutes and I noticed they were a little under baked in the center, but that was much better than over baked because the second round of baking completed it. I'm not a big fan of white chocolate...especially since it's not really chocolate so I opted to leave mine plain, I even had the white \"chocolate\" melts ready, but I think it would have ruined the wonderful flavors. I will be making this again very soon. Thank you for sharing."

This was my first attempt at biscotti, though I am an avid baker, and I decided to make them solely because I was making gift baskets, and thought a biscotti would be a nice accessory to the coffee and tea I was giving. I was thrilled with the ease of this recipe, though I found I had to knead the dough to incorperate all the flour and the cherries and chips. I also used marachino cherries, only because I happened to have them in my fridge, and I was trying to keep costs down. A note to those having trouble finding candied cherries - they are often referred to as glace cherries, and are available in both green and red."

As prepared, I'd give these 4 stars, but if I try with marschino cherries next time, I think they'd be better and deserving of all 5 stars. Some of my biscotti burned, but I just threw those pieces out (there weren't many anyways). My biscotti looked just like ccox's picture (wow!).

"reviewBody": "These were difficult to work with -- even with a serrated bread knife. They crumble and consequently, they're hard to do at a full 10\" size. Nevertheless, they look lovely and people love receiving them as a gift. They are softer than other recipes because of their butter. If you prefer a firmer, crispier biscotti for dunking, look for recipes where egg is the only fat in the ingredients list. As for candied cherries, those are the little syrupy cherries that are sold in small, round tubs. They're usually with the seasonal baking stuff--you would find them wherever you find those tubs of chopped fruit that people use in fruitcakes. The only difference is that the fruitcake mix is multicolored and includes pineapple and candied citrus peel (which I never liked as a kid). But basically, it's the same thing. You could probably get away with using marachino cherries, but the candied cherries are \"waxier\" and have less moisture. However, they are brighter and moister than dried cherries/cranberries. The chocolate and cherries make this recipes pricey to pull off--but like I said, it looks great."

For those of you that said your biscotti crumbled, make sure you cut while they are still warm (7-10 minutes after taking out of oven). The key is also using a good quality serrated (bread) knife to cut. If you do this and follow the recipe directions, your biscotti should not crumble. I agree with others that commented, you don't need to cook that long after you flip. You just need to dry them out a little more. You can even turn down the heat in the oven.\r\n\r\nGreat recipe!

Made a few mods: I hand mixed in the flour and chips/cherries, I didn't do the final 5 minute flip/bake, and I made 7 dozen of them with cranberries (dried) and pecans (chopped) instead of the chocolate/cherry mixture. Also, instead of using the white chocolate, I drizzled vanilla almond bark (half dyed red, half dyed green) over the cooled cookies. They're so pretty! Packaged in cellophane holiday gift bags (after wrapping cookies in waxed paper) and tied with a bow. Can't say it enough how much I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this recipe! Thanks so much for sharing!

I used my Kitchen Aid stand mixer, and used the exact amount of flour that the recipe called for, and I too found the dough to be too sticky. What I did was spooned it onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, in two long shapes. Then I floured my hands really well, and kind of formed them into the rectangles while on the parchment paper. Next time I will add more flour like others suggested. I also had a problem getting my white chocolate to drizzle. I ended up throwing my first batch of the white chocolate away, and the next time I melted it in a glass bowl over a pot of low boiling water and added a little bit (1/2 Tbls) of vegetable shortening to it. That made it easier to drizzle. After the obstacles, they turned out great, with a very good flavor. I plan to make these again and give them away as holiday gifts in little plastic holiday bags.
