"reviewBody": "I have made many similar cheeseballs and the folks saying it wouldn't form a ball- a couple of side notes. You have to use full fat cream cheese and real butter; softened but not melted. Increase the powdered sugar gradually, no more than 1/8c at a time, (if necessary), refrigerate tightly sealed overnight, then form a ball while mixture is very cold- do not allow it to sit before working with it. It will be sticky, roll ball on lightly powdered sugar surface. Then press chocolate chips or pecans. Refrigerate formed ball until serving. Allow a minimum of 1 hour after rolling and before serving to firm up nicely. Ball will not be as firm as a traditional cheeseball but will hold it's shape nicely."

I served it with sugar cookies instead of the graham crackers. \n\nFour stars because it was not as received as well at my mother's birthday party . It is very sweet, too sweet for me."

My only modifications were 1) as I didn't have miniature chips I put the reg sized chips into a processor to grind some of them and 2) adding more chocolate using some chopped dark chocolate to probably come to a total of 1 cup. Put the cheese mixture onto a sheet of plastic wrap and fold the plastic over. When sealed, pat it into a ball. I chilled it for about 4-5 hours, and it firmed up nicely. Not sure it used as much as 3/4 cup pecans but put a good amount in a small bowl and patted the cheese ball into the nuts. I used Belvita chocolate breakfast wafers as I couldn't find regular chocolate wafers."

I will try on tiny teddys too since I have leftovers and some teddys in the cupboard. I did find it a little sweet, but that helps me only eat a small portion and not devour it all at once. Certainly wouldn't up the sugar any more than is in the recipe. Will make again for sure :)"

This prevents your fingers from sticking to the cheese ball. After chilling for another hour, I placed and pressed the chopped pecans onto the ball. It was too awkward to roll it. There were no pecans on the bottom of the cheese ball but that did not affect the taste or popularity of this crowd-pleaser. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe."

I would suggest not adding extra chocolate chips as this makes it a bit difficult to spread. Letting it set in the fridge for a couple of days makes it better!"

Since cream cheese freezes well, I figured this would free also."

All in all I liked the recipe and will make it again! Thanks for entertaining my sweet tooth!"

Some had trouble getting it into a ball...I scooped it onto a piece of saran wrap and forced it into a ball, wrapped it and refrigerated it. Then when ready to serve, I just sprinkled it with toffee bits instead of trying to roll it. Served with cinnamon graham crackers."

I can't even count the number of times I have given out the recipe. i have only used chocolate toffee bits for coating, but I'm sure it's just as good with nuts. It is a very easy recipe, but not something that can be put together at the last minute. I usually try to make it a day ahead of time and let it set in the refrigerator overnight and I've never had a problem with it setting. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"

Only change was to put all ingredients in the bowl at once and mixed all ingredients thoroughly once. Keeping the mixing to a minimum keeps the consistency firm to form a ball after chilling. I also chilled it in a round bowl lined with plastic wrap to keep the handling to a minimum. Wonderful treat."

It was so easy to serve this by unwrapping the plastic wrap, turning it upside down on a platter. Dusted with dark cocoa powder and served with assorted crackers and sliced fruit. Tasted just like cheese cake. Nice to have a second cheese ball in the fridge for personal indulgence. Will probably make it again for Easter."
