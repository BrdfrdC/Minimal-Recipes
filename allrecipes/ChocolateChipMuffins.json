"reviewBody": "Have made this several times thus far and they are always a hit with the kids. Even the picky eater likes them and asks for more. He's not just a typical picky eater, he has food issues (texture, look, etc.) that turn him off of several foods. For the 2 cups of all-purpose flour, I use 1 cup of regular flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour. I substitute the oil with unsweetened apple sauce to make it a bit healthier along with adding 1/4 cup of ground flax seed. As suggested, I have added 2 teaspoons of vanilla to give it more flavor. The kids do not realize that they are eating something healthier than the store-bought muffins they've had in the past. This recipe is a win!"

Doesn’t really feel like a muffin though. Kinda like a mix between a muffin and a cupcake. I didn’t have chocolate chips so I used white chocolate chips instead. Im sure they would be better with chocolate chips. Most of the flavor comes from the chips. Would make again."

It’s not too cakey like at a bakery. I didn’t change much but I have made them in mini muffin tins and it cuts the baking time down to about 12 minutes. When I bake them in regular size cupcake tins they usually need 17 to 18 minutes depending on how generous you are with the mixture. I also usually add extra chocolate chips to make sure there are enough chips in every bite."

"reviewBody": "Watch the cook time-- Recipe says 20-25 minutes. I fortunately read the reviews and set the timer for 15 minutes. They were done! Next time will check after 13 minutes. I used 1 full cup of regular size chocolate chips as that is what I had on hand. I held back a handful of chips and added on top of the muffins. Also added a bit of coarse sugar on top for gloss and crunch. Looked nice! Don't skimp on the white/brown sugar topping. It is very good! Also added the full cup of milk and 1 t vanilla as others recommended. This is not a super moist muffin, so am glad I added the extra wet ingredients. Make again good, but may further tweak and add more sugar. These are not very sweet \"as is\"."

The sugar on top created a hard shell that was difficult to bite into and they were dry and overcooked even though I cooked them for the lowest recommended baking time. If your think of making these then some modifications are needed but it would be easier to use a different recipe"

The fifteen minutes has been perfect every time and these are moist, fluffy, and perfect. Thank you for the amazing recipe!"
