I chilled in the fridge for about 30 minutes before baking, to make sure the cookies won't be flat. To my surprise, they barely changed shape, from a ball to a dome ! I let the 2nd batch stay on the kitchen counter to come to room temperature and then flattened the cookie balls little, before baking and again they barley spread ! But, they were less thick this time. And, BTW, I keep the cookie dough in the fridge and just bake a dozen at the time, for 2 to 3 days and shape the rest of the dough into balls and freeze."

Just mix all dry ingredients in one bowl then mix softened butter (not melted), eggs, and vanilla in different bowl, and then mix the dry bowl (1/2 bowl at a time) into wet bowl. Stir in chocolate chips and then roll cookie dough (like making meatballs). Cooked at 350Â° for 16 mins ( I used air bake sheets). Cookies are nice and soft and don't crumble when eaten"

Probably could of used more. A nice light cookie. Has a slight brownie flavour and texture, so the addition of walnut next time will be tried."

These cookies are not soft (also not hard) and there are way too many chips. I've made chocolate chip cookies for decades, so I knew I should make certain changes, but I like to follow recipes initially. \n\nThe chocolate taste is unsatisfying, so instead of doctoring this recipe, I will use a different one next time I have a hankering for chocolate chocolate chip cookies."

A little more delicate than I expected, but crunchy outside and soft inside. The only change I made before baking was to drop by level ice cream scoop rather than rounded teaspoon. I used my 2 tablespoon spring-loaded scoop for uniform size and shape and baked them for 15 minutes, which resulted in 36 large cookies. I also sprinkled powdered sugar after they cooled."

One thing though, they didn't expand, they turned out chunky. Next time I will flatten them a bit before baking. This recipe is def a keeper in my book!!!"
