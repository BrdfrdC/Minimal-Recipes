I managed to find shredded coconut though and I added chopped frozen strawberries as toppings. SO good and plenty chocolatey enough without the chocolate milk. I could easily eat this every morning."

"reviewBody": "This is a great breakfast (with slight modifications)! First time I followed the recipe exactly, and it tasted great but I thought maple syrup and cocoa were unnecessary if using sweetened chocolate milk. Now I also make it without vanilla extract, and cannot tell a difference. Adding just under 1 cup of milk makes it less soggy, which I prefer. So now my ideal recipe is just oats, chia seeds, unsweetened coconut shreds, and chocolate milk.\nI pre-pack several snack zip locks of the dry ingredients, and take them with me on every vacation."
