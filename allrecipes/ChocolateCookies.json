"reviewBody": "Excellent cookie! I've made these twice this week. Once, for a gathering and once just for our house. I used unsalted butter and left out the nuts. Baked on a dark non stick cookie sheet with a silicone mat, these took just at 9 minutes. On my larger stainless sheet with parchment paper, it took 10. The cookies had crisp chewy edges and tender centers. These had the rich chocolatey flavor of a brownie. Both times they spread out quite a bit and turned out pretty flat. I even chilled the dough to see if it made difference the second time. It did not. Chilling the dough made it difficult to scoop, and it didn't prevent total spread of the dough. This is a keeper. This gave me 5 dozen delicious cookies to share."

As with most all cookie recipes you must refrigerate the dough for at least an hour before using to stabilize the margarine in the dough or it Will spread out in the oven as it cooks. Give this recipe a fair shake and you will be rewarded with one VERY good cookie. :) enjoy!"

Used ungreased nonstick cookie sheets and cookies did not stick to pan after baking. these cookies do want to spread out so i rolled them into tight balls which i think reduced their spread. Bake time was 9 minutes. The result was a very good chocolatey cookie. Will make again."

I agree with everyone that the dough is sticky but what helped me achieve a perfect round color is that I used a tea spoon full and I took the dough in my Gand and rolled it into hall and placed it on the baking sheet ajd baked them that way since thw reviews said they spread out a lot. Rolling the dough into a ball made them spread out evenly and perfect while baking. Added my photo to this review."

They did not run together, but are small thin wafers. The other half of the batter (not dough) I just put in a lightly greased pie pan. Now I have the worlds thinnest brownie. I wish people could just rate the recipes as written. As a matter of fact I wish Allrecipes would remove the altered recipe reviews."

Found this recipe and gave it a try. \n\nI'm really not sure why there are so many negative reviews or people saying the recipe doesn't work. If you give them space on the cookie sheet (don't put them super close because they do flatten) then there is no issue with them turning into one giant cookie like some people have commented. \n\nI did leave them in the oven a bit longer and let them cool on the tray for 3-4 min before moving to a cooling rack. That stopped them falling apart. \n\nI also subbed out margarine for butter and it worked great. \n\nEvery issue I've seen in the comments relates to common sense when baking."

I did chill the dough for about 30 mins first, as I do with most cookies, and I left the walnuts out since the fam doesn’t like them. A little spray of Pam on the cookie sheet kept them from sticking. My teenagers and boyfriend devoured them. One review said theirs were flat and oddly shaped, and that they wouldn’t take them to a bbq or event. I did not find this to be the case for me at all, as mine came out round and soft. I will definitely make these again!"

Will do just the trick well it did for me... then spray your non stick pan cook @325° for the time recommended I did 10 min... it tasted just like brownie cookies! And they're chewy in the center not doughy but like a perfect little brownie! I'm making these more often rather than chocolate chip from now on! Also I made half the recipe hope this helps."
