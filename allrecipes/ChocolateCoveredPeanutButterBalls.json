"reviewBody": "I used this recipe to make mini “dragon eggs” for a TV show premiere, and they turned out perfectly! It was easy to shape the peanut butter into the shapes I wanted (more oblong than round- I used a spoon as a shaping guide.) I fridge’d them overnight before dipping in the chocolate, allowed the chocolate to cool for a little while (like 5 minutes) and then used a knife to carve designs into the chocolate. They turned out beautiful and taste great- super easy recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Made the coating only and sugar free. Edna's proportions are perfect. I used 100% dark (zero sugar) organic chocolate chips, almond oil and 1 T Sweet Leaf stevia. Melted in microwave, 1/3 of the recipe at a time, in a Pyrex bowl. Each batch, with my microwave, took 66 seconds at Power Level 3, stir and repeat. Voila! Thank you, Edna! Instead of peanut butter balls, I used the modified coating for my cholesterol free mocha almond cheesecake balls. Zero fat cream cheese, instant coffee, natural almond extract and Sweet Leaf stevia."
