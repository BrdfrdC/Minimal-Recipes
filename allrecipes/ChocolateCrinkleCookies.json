I did add a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips and some peppermint extract as other suggested, as we are just extra around here :-) I do HIGHLY recommend using a 1-inch scooper - the dough was super sticky but it was very easy to use the scooper to scoop it out and drop it directly into the powdered sugar (I did not roll it in my hands - with the last cookie I used my fingers to scrap the extra from the scooper and it was super sticky!). But using the scooper, dropping the dough directly into the powdered sugar, and rolling it around worked perfectly. The finished cookies were airy and melted in your mouth!"

(Also, I halved the recipe-worked great) I put my oven rack on the 2nd from the top and only baked 1 pan at a time. The tip about using vinyl exam gloves (previously bought at grocery for jalapenos) sprayed with Pam was AMAZING. Worked great. I think it would be even better if you could have one person taking a spoon of dough rolling it and throwing it in the powdered sugar and another person rolling them about and lifting them onto the baking sheet. Also, I added about 1/4 cup (for half recipe) of mini semisweet chocolate chips. Yay! I'm super happy. PS. Halving the recipe, I got 3 dozen 2\" cookies."

"reviewBody": "I wish it came in metric measurements as using scale provides more consistent results. I used another site to convert ingredients to grams. I lessened sugar by 20% and might decrease more to 300g and increase cocoa powder from 84g to 120g next time. I also added a teaspoon of espresso powder to boost chocolate flavor and might double it next time. Baked it at 8mins 325F fan mode and it came out moist, though quite lacking in a crispy outer shell. I baked previously at 10minutes but it came out dry. I also chilled dough for an hour and just used two teaspoons to drop some into a shallow bowl of powdered sugar and poured more on it before forming them into balls by tossing them around in my lightly enclosed fingers whilst shaking off excess sugar and before placing them in the cookie sheet with parchment paper. I find this to be a less messier technique and my cookies turned out more flat than the bulky round ones i had made with a 4-hr chilled dough. I am still looking to get those chewy chocolate moist crinkles. Maybe chilling baked ones in the ref will do the trick."

"reviewBody": "I love these cookies! For the holidays I use 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp peppermint extract and it gives them such a warm minty undertone. I also add a tsp of espresso powder to punch up the chocolate. I use a rounded tsp full of batter to keep my balls consistent size. That yields about 4 doz. For those of you having an issue with it sticking to your hands, try using food prep gloves lightly sprayed with cooking spray. Works like a charm and helps make nicely rounded balls without the mess!"

I will try these again! I thought the recipe was messy to make . The hint about having wet hands to roll the chocolate was great, but then the powder sugar melted. I refrigerated the \"dough\" (more like a batter) overnight and used a 1\" scoop. This rating was probably because of my \"ick\" factor. I did use a surgical rubber glove finally and it seemed to be much easier, still needed water to roll the dough. Baking one tray of cookies to get the top to crack was time consuming. I got 55 good sized cookies from the recipe."

Also I refrigerated the dough for about 3:30 and it worked for me. This really depends on what brands you use for your ingredients I believe. But overall this recipe makes really nice moist crinkles. (I suggest when covering your crinkles while chilling that you press the plastic wrap on the surface of the dough to keep it moist)"

The best way to describe these is a brownie in cookie form. A little messy to eat with the powdered sugar, but oh so delicious. I made these exactly as directed and they were perfect. I used a little cookie scoop and it only yielded 64 cookies instead of the 72 stated. These are going on my holiday cookie tray this year, but I would double the recipe because they are just that good."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is very good. I added a little more flour to the dough about 3 tbsp. Now, I usually make crinkles coating them first in granulated sugar then on the powdered sugar. This will guarantee you an extra crunchy outcome. With this method, you can cut down the sugar in the dough by about 2 tbsp. As a personal preference, I added chopped walnuts to the dough. I made half the recipe but did not get the 36 cookies despite using a 1\" scoop. Still, they were delicious! I will make this recipe again."

I apologize. The dough is difficult to work with, but i expected that. I think this particular version of the cookie is too sweet. It is also very one note and bland. It needs more salt, and i think working sour cream into the dough, like many versions do, could help the flavor profile. I would not make these again. Also, i made small cookies, yet didnt even get close to amount of cookies the recipe said."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe, and here is how to make it even better with a method of shaping the dough that keeps your hands clean. Use a plastic tablespoon measure to scoop dough into balls, and use a plastic spoon to help it out if necessary (dough won't stick to plastic). Do not bother to roll dough between your hands! Simply drop the ball straight into a small bowl filled with confectioners sugar. Use a spoon to pack the sugar on top of and around the ball to heavily coat it, while pressing it gently into a rounder shape (it doesn't have to be perfect). Use chopsticks or tongs to lift the ball from the sugar, shake off the excess, and transfer to cookie sheet. Works beautifully."

Instead of 2 granulated sugars. I put 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup granulated sugar. I chill it for 1 hour and cook it for 10 mins. And it came pit perfectly! You have to use a very good cocoa powder to enjoy that chocolate flavour. I tried once a different one and it didn’t taste the same. I am using the Fry’s cocoa powder. Just my preference after making this for so long."

Dark chocolate lovers, add espresso powder. The batter will look thin as others have said. Promise, it sets up fine. I freeze mine which causes them not to spread and to be more fudgey on the inside."

In step 1, first you \"mix\", then \"stir\", then \"beat\", then \"combine\", then \"stir\" again. These terms usually mean quite specific things. I decided to simply whisk the wet stuff, then stir (with a spatula) the dry stuff. Not sure if my results match what the recipe intends, but they look pretty much the same and taste great! Yes, in my pic you can see I over-crowded the tray, was being lazy tried to get by with just one sheet! And one cookie did escape before I could take the pic, wonder how that happened? Hmm. BTW Be sure to roll the balls while the dough is cold, or it will make a mess in your hands!"

My batter did come out very sticky, but the quick dip in the powdered sugar made them easy to shape into balls. If you want that a really crinkled look, you have to use a LOT of powdered sugar. Another hack is to sprinkle a little extra on top right before baking. It makes a *huge mess*, but you get that great contrast between the white and black."
