"reviewBody": "Excellent recipe. I doubled the butter, which made them perfectly moist. A tip: this recipe has little to nothing to do with whether or not you get a raised top. The temperature and time are what create that. Try heating the oven to 400, then, when you put them in, lowering to 350 or 375 and baking for 10-15 minutes. I did a \"test\" cupcake first. Try that to see how yours do before putting them all in. This gave me a nice raised top. I filled the cups about 3/4 like the recipe says, which is perfect for a raised top, but if you don't want a raised top, 1/2 is probably better."

I topped mine with homemade chocolate whipped cream and marshmallow halves. They were easy to make, but the texture was terrible. The cupcake itself looked beautiful. It was flat topped, exactly like in the video, which was nice because then my whipped cream didn't slide off. They rose nicely and were well rounded. But I couldn't get past that texture. I won't be making these again, sorry."

Only the butt other wise know as the bottom part. The cupcake doesn't really have much flavor. I followed this recipe down to the t. If anything it tasted like one of those mug cakes you can make in a microwave. No offense to the creator of the recipe but these cupcakes just aren't my favorite."

Used the simple buttercream frosting and put chocolate sprinkles on. They were amazing and the family gobbled them all up! Would definitely make again - family is asking when I will make them."

"reviewBody": "Delicious, but not as moist as we’d like. A few suggestions to tweak the recipe: (1) add more butter (twice as much than what’s called for) to the sugar &amp; to cream, (2) utilize just 1/2 C cocoa powder as the 3/4 C dried out the cupcakes, (3) fill up the cupcake tin just 1/2 full, as they rise a bit, (4) use a chocolate cream frosting on top &amp; to make them over the top delicious! If you filled the cupcake gin 1/2 full you’d yield 24 cupcakes, which is not a bad thing! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I wasn’t planning on making cupcakes today but mum brother was having a really stressful day so I decided to make him some cupcakes. This wasn’t one of the first recipes I saw and I liked the picture so I clicked on it, I saw that they only took 30 minutes to make and I decided to make them since I had a call with my teacher in about an hour. So I made them, following the recipe almost exactly except I usefully oat milk instead of Cows milk. I expected them to be mediocre because of the reviews but honestly, these were really good. The only negative thing I can say about them is that they were a bit difficult to take out of the pan because of how soft they were, but other than that I think they’re perfect, an the softness is more a positive thing than a negative thing. Honestly they didn’t even need frosting but I still added a little bit (mostly for decoration)."

I definitely would never recommend this recipe. The cupcakes were probably going to come out dry and tasteless. I’ve made my fair share of chocolate cupcakes for my kids. All I know is oil and hot water/coffee makes a great cupcake. I wasn’t thinking this morning. It’s just a waste of ingredients."

The cupcakes definitely turned out moist for me but a couple things you should watch out for is the bake time and how much you fill the liners with. Instead of 3/4 I highly recommend 1/2 also 17 minutes does not cut it! Bake for around 20 minutes. Lastly, we added homemade strawberry jam in the inside once they baked and frosted it with a chocolate frosting and it tasted delicious!"

I topped them with a chocolate butter cream, to die for, but they are as good just plain. Although, as I read in some of the reviews, I altered slightly the recipe according to my experience. In used 1/2 cup of butter (1 stick), a full tablespoon of vanilla, and definitely filled the cupcake liners at half; no regrets. This recipe really makes 30 cupcakes."

"reviewBody": "Came across this recipe while looking for a quick and simple chocolate cupcake recipe that I could whip up using pantry staples for my daughter. Directions were easy to follow and my daughter (2.5 yrs old) really enjoyed “helping” me! After reading the reviews, I doubled the butter. Also ended up baking an additional 10 min, so 25 min total (I used silicone pans). I only filled the cups about 2/3 full and one pan overflowed (on lower rack), while the other did not, which was interesting (I couldn’t fit both on the middle rack). The cupcakes came out super moist (almost brownie like), light, soft and very very sweet. I was going to make a chocolate buttercream frosting, but opted for a fresh whipped cream frosting instead to try to balance the sweetness and decadence of the cake. Next time, I will cut the sugar down bc it’s just too sweet and may decrease the butter to recipe’s recommended amount"
