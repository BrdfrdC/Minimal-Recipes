I used 2/3 cup of heavy whipping cream. As soon as I saw the heavy cream come to a low boil I took the saucepan off the heat. I slowly poured it over the chocolate as I manually whipped up the ganache. It took very little manual effort. After a few moments I did it! It was the perfect mirror smooth ganache. I let it cool in the fridge for maybe 5-10mins and it was ready to pour over my cake. I had no idea ganache could be so easy to make! I will definitely make this again! This recipe is perfect."

While I had the heavy cream on the stove heating up, I put the chips in a microwave safe bowl and heated them up for 30 seconds on high. I gave them a stir and put them back in for another 30 seconds. I took them out and added a little bit of rum like the recipe suggested and then added the cream. I whipped it with my whisk until smooth as directed and tucked it in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to chill so I could pour it over a cheesecake. Perfect!"

It was the right spreadable texture! I used it to finish a previously rough looking cupcake with with a layer of rough looking ganache. The cupcake came out so very shiny! I might use this as a trick to revive any leftover that cools off and thickens too much to be able to spread!"

"reviewBody": "I don’t live in America and the cream used here doesn’t firm back up once you warm it. I recommend another technique that is foolproof: whip the cream with 2tsp cocoa powder, then drip in the melted chocolate, gently stir. This way it will be fluffy and firm. If you go ahead and melt the cream it will be too liquid to cover the cake (if you also don’t use American cream). I tried and it didn’t work even after freezing it. Makes fine ice cream tho."

I didn't have any rum on hand, so I just omitted it.\nI made two recipes one with Bakers brand chocolate baking bars with 56% Cacao and the other with Toll house semi-sweet Chocolate morsels.\nJust for taste testing purposes.\nThe results... the Bakers ganache was slightly more tart in flavor. And the Tollhouse Ganache was a little sweeter. I feel that the rum will enhance the flavor of both. So I will reheat small portions of each ganache and add the rum to give you a more accurate test. I will return to complete my findings. Bye for now!!"

For the person who was disappointed because they wanted the ganache for chocolate covered strawberry's if you make this version and the strawberry are washed, dried and cold it will harden and still be delicious. You can make this recipe and it will last weeks. Just warm it when your ready to use and stir with clean whisk or spoon. This ganache recipe also makes a great chocolate truffle base."

"reviewBody": "So rich, delicious and easy! A few tips: (1) you need to weigh out your chocolate chips on a scale - using the 8 oz = 1 cup rule doesn't work for solids; (2) after you add the boiling cream to the bowl of chocolate, put a lid on top and wait 5 minutes; this provides sufficient time for the cream to actually begin to melt the chocolate without losing heat; and (3) wait about 5-10 minutes for the ganache to cool and thicken slightly before pouring on a cake. You probably could wait 15 minutes.\n\nI used this ganache for a 3 layer chocolate cake and it looks beautiful. I used high-quality (i.e., not Nestle) chocolate chips and didn't chop them at all beforehand. Very easy and straightforward, and the taste is heavenly."

"reviewBody": "What is there to say? This is about all there is to ganache. Chocolate, heavy cream and maybe a dash of rum. Easy peasy and so very versatile. Want it thinner? Add a bit more cream. Thicker, a bit less cream. You can serve it warm, cool or whipped into a heavenly frosting. Just remember to chop up your chocolate (even if using chocolate chips - it will melt faster and blend smoother). And if it is cooling before it is all blended after adding your hot cream, just pop in the microwave at half power for a few seconds to rewarm and whisk again until melted and smooth. Oh, and you can choose your chocolate too. Forget the chocolate snobs who say dark, decadent, bitter chocolate only. Yes, that makes a delicious ganache, but depending on your need/tastes, so will semi-sweet and even milk chocolate. You choose and enjoy! :)"

It will come out nice and fluffy. It is VERY rich and chocolate, so if you’re like me, and prefer milk chocolate over dark chocolate, I would get a milk chocolate baking bar instead of dark chocolate. This is a really easy and wonderful recipe!!!"

Not knowing what to expect I \"Allow[ed] the ganache to cool slightly before pouring over a cake.\" The ganache in a matter a seconds was as thick as pudding. My opinion that if you want to \"pour\" over your cake don't wait...just do it ASAP. Maybe more cream is necessary. I'll know next time to whisk and pour. This was for a neighbor's birthday party so don't know how it taste (but I'm sue it will taste wonderful)."

I served the cake not long after making and drizzling the ganache so it was still liquidy and I loved it. I put the cake in the fridge overnight so the ganache hardened into a soft shell and again -- I loved it!!! It's delicious fresh or chilled. I will say I didn't have quite 9 oz of chocolate -- I bought two 4 oz bars and didn't want to buy another bar just for one more ounce. And by the time I got done \"testing\" the chocolate, there may have only been 7 oz left. It still came out just wonderfully. I can't remember the exact percentage of the chocolate I bought -- it was somewhere in the range of 60-63%. I am SO excited about making this ganache again in the future."
