"reviewBody": "Called \"Four Layer Delight\" back in the '80s and always a hit in my family at any gathering. The original version shared with me by a friend's mom used chopped pecans in the crust and only called for one layer of instant pudding, using the larger size box. Any flavor from chocolate to pistachio is a crowd-pleaser. Since butterscotch/caramel pudding is my all-time favorite -- but I'm not a fan of the artificially flavored instant variety -- I occasionally go all out at the holidays and make a cooked pudding using brown sugar, butter, milk, and egg yolks (let cool before layering). The luscious smoothness and buttery richness of the real deal makes it worth the extra work and calories!"

I used ff/sf instant chocolate (2 boxes because I wanted all chocolate on top) made with skim milk. Very tasty and pretty ok in the calorie and fat department!! This is certainly in my dessert rotation now!"
