"reviewBody": "My old electric cookie press just wouldn't work properly this Christmas so I looked at reviews and settled on the Marcato Biscuit (cookies elsewhere in the world) maker. I wanted to try chocolate spritz for my husband. This recipe caught my attention, and after reading the reviews I decided to try it. I did use 2 tablespoons of milk, 2 teaspoons vanilla and only about 2-1/2 cups flour. The dough seemed a little sticky but I went with it. It went through my new cookie press like a dream! The taste is good, but I would prefer more chocolate so next time I'm going to try more cocoa. Otherwise, these are pretty good \"biscuits\"."

"reviewBody": "This is a great recipe when made with a few tweaks. Having made many bathes of Spritz over he years, \nI added a bit more liquid ingredients to this recipe. Firstly, I added 2 Tbsp milk along with my vanilla &amp; the added 2 tsp of Peppermint Extract to give these cookies a bit more flavor. For those who are finding this recipe to be a bit crumbly I'd recommend adding the 2 Tbsp of Milk, as the milk will make the dough softer and easier to push though your cookie Press. As a general rule you want your dough to be soft, but still somewhat firm so that the shapes will come out properly when pressed. Overall, great recipe &amp; very flavorful with the peppermint added."

They were tasty, so I'm going to try the recipe again and make some changes in the proportions of ingredients to see if I can work it out, because the recipe has potential. I just don't love them."
