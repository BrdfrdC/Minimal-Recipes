I did use a 1/2 cup cocoa powder for a stronger chocolate flavor, and buttermilk in place of regular milk just because I had it. It's not an overwhelmingly sweet cake--but that's really a good thing! It pairs perfectly with sweetened whipped cream (I also recommend using the real stuff) and the sweet/tart berries. I forgot to add chocolate sauce--but it didn't matter at all: it was delicious without it! Thank you for the recipe! This one is a keeper!!"

"reviewBody": "Made as directed with a couple changes - made the recipe one and half to insure that I would have enough to serve 12 people. I added a bit more sugar to the batter 1/2 cup instead of 1/3 and put less sugar in the strawberries as they were very sweet on their own. I also added about 1/3 cup of mini chocolate chips. I dropped the dough (approximately 1/3 cup per shortcake) on cookie sheets to make individual shortcakes and used real whipped cream rather than frozen whipped topping. Baked @ 375 for 12-15 minutes until the tops looked dry/cracked. Real hit with the family and will definitely make again."

I dropped large spoonfuls onto a greased cookie sheet and made 8 individual shortcakes and topped them with strawberries, chocolate ice cream and whipped cream. Really good. The shortcakes aren't very sweet, but aren't supposed to be. Real shortcakes are like biscuits, not cake."

The texture is that of a delicate scone. \nI plopped eight mounds of dough onto a silicone sheet lined cookie sheet and baked for 10 minutes, so I could make individual mini shortcakes. I used 35% whipping cream with the sweet strawberries. The hint of cocoa is FABULOUS! Great idea! \nThis receipe is quick, easy, tasty, and is bound to become one of my \"go-to\" summer desserts for years to come - so I thank you kindly for sharing it with us."

"reviewBody": "A nearly identical recipe has been in my family for years. It is a wonderful recipe, but you do have to understand that the cake is a shortcake, not a typical American butter cake. It is not very moist and has only a slight chocolate flavor that really allows the strawberries to shine. I only serve this cake with real whipped cream (flavored with a bit of vanilla), and a homemade chocolate sauce. The chocolate sauce soaks into the cake and the whipped cream compensates for the less sweet cake. All together it is amazing!"

When looking at the total amount of sugar, you have to be careful that you are separating how much sugar you are putting in the strawberries and how much in the shortcake.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is outstanding, and we've really enjoyed this recipe. We've had it about five times now and it always turns out great. Before cooking, the dough is nice and perfect. Its crumbly texture is perfect before and after you stretch the dough out on the cooking sheet."
