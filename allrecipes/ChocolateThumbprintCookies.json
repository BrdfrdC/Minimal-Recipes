My only wish is that the ganache might be a little firmer. Perhaps just a little extra chocolate would help."

"reviewBody": "This was a fun recipe to make and they came out super tasty! I only had a tiny pinch of cinnamon left in my spice jar so I used pumpkin pie spice to make it a full 1/2 tsp and I think the spices compliment the chocolate really well. I used a 1-1/2 inch cookie scoop and was able to get 25 cookies from the dough. And instead of rotating 2 pans halfway through I just baked one sheet fully on the middle rack then put in the next after the first was done. I also only waited a couple minutes to re-indent the centers on the second pan since it was a bit hard to get a good indent after waiting the full 15 minutes. Once the ganache was in the 10 minutes in the fridge really helped to set it immediately. This is a recipe you can definitely make the same day of a party (as long as you allot enough time for baking and cooling). After sampling a few both my husband and I really like the softer shortbread texture, thick creamy ganache, and crunchy sanding sugar. And since the semi-sweet chocolate isn't too sweet it's easy to eat more than one! These are definitely going to be a hit for the holidays!"
