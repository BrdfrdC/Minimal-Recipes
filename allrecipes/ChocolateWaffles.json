I thought the sugar amount was high but for the six large waffles ?? it made I really didn’t feel like it was overpowering. I really don’t like how prep is always 5 min, to gather ingredients and then actually prep the batter for cooking took over 15 min. I would just be transparent about that, maybe a busy parent is trying to make them."

I followed the suggestions of LISSALU and went with the 2 tsp of baking powder, 1/2 cup of dark chocolate cocoa powder, 1/2 tsp of baking soda, and 1 tsp of vanilla. I had a nervous moment because the batter seemed more like brownie batter or muffin batter (very thick) but when I put it on the waffle irons, it turned out to be really wonderful. We cooked a Belgian and we made smaller ones on the Dash waffle iron and both were great. My girls asked for this recipe to go into the regular rotation for “fun breakfasts”."

Based on others comments and my previous experience with my Belgian waffle iron, I added 2 extra T of cocoa for more chocolatey goodness, used veg oil instead of melted butter, added 1 t of vanilla, 1/4 c extra milk and beat the egg whites separately to add a bit of lift to the waffles. They turned out crisp and moist. My teenagers smeared choc hazelnut spread and peanut butter before sandwiching two together. Topped with the best Canadian maple syrup, it was pure decadence."

We all felt they had a chocolate cake doughnut flavor. My oldest really likes them, so we will keep it like that. Very easy to make. However, next time I may try to incorporate buttermilk, sour cream or yogurt to help moisten them.\nUPDATE: I switched the milk to 1 1/2 c. buttermilk and about 2/3 c. milk and it did help moisten the waffles, but my kids liked the cake doughnut flavor over the more moist waffle. (This was for a double batch.)\n11/12- Okay, just follow the directions- for a Belgium waffle, cook 5- 6 min. MAKE THE SAUCE! You have oreo waffles - kids love them!"

We added fresh strawberries and raspberries, whipped cream and more chocolate chips for toppings! I think I saw some reviewers say it was too sweet or not chocolaty enough, and I disagree (but I did add chips!) I thought the texture was wonderful and have saved this recipe and will definitely make again! Would also make for a wonderful dessert. You can make a several waffles and keep warm in a toaster oven so that you can serve a bunch at once."

Perfect waffles are a snap — so easy and quick. I followed this recipe in the sense that I just added 2 tsp cocoa powder and 1/4 cup chocolate chips. Kids love it! Will definitely make again!"

"reviewBody": "I made this tonight. It was just ok. I followed the recipe exactly, but only made the waffles. I did not make the sauce. Maybe the secret to flavor is in the sauce?. Really, the chocolate taste is lacking. It honestly didn't have much taste at all. However, after topped with cool whip and powdered sugar it tasted pretty good. Also, this is not a flae in the recipe as it most likelya calls for a standard waffle iron, if making belgium waffles it only makes 4-5. I probably would not make this again."

Also used oil instead of butter. I skipped the 'hard sauce' and instead made simple syrup with sliced strawberries as a sauce. The only reason I gave this 4 out of 5 stars is it wouldn't have been chocolatey enough for me as written, and the vanilla was a great addition. Hubby said it would be better for dessert than breakfast-but that was HIS opinion. For a dessert, I'd also add fresh whipped cream! My waffle iron gave me 8 or so waffles, so I wrapped the extras in parchment and put them in a freezer bag and froze them."

I read the reviews before I first made them and took another poster's advice and used 1/4 cup of cocoa instead of the few Tbspoons that the recipe calls for. I have a family of chocaholics that I knew would appreciate the chocolatier taste. I ran out of cocoa by makin them so much and decided to swap out the cocoa for cinnamon. I went by the recipe for them and kept to the 3 Tbs for the cinnamon. They were wonderful as well. A great recipe and a family favorite already!"

I added semi-sweet chocolate chips, and a piece of a dark chocolate bar chopped up. I called them \"Triple-chocolate waffles\".\n\nOne complaint, the sauce seemed too thick to do anything with. I added a splash more milk, making a nice creamy sauce. I dusted the waffles with confectioner's sugar and then drizzled the sauce over them before serving."

"reviewBody": "How interesting - I don't think I'd ever even heard of such a thing before. I made them exactly as written, and they turned out pretty well. At breakfast-time, the waffles' flavor reminded me of \"Cocoa Puffs\" cereal, in a non-crunchy waffle form. I didn't know what the \"hard sauce\" was going to be - another new phrase to me - but it turned out to be kind of like the frosting or glaze that's usually on top of a batch of cinnamon rolls. Upon reflection, I think the hard sauce is probably a much better companion than maple syrup might have been. This didn't quite \"wow\" me, but it was very good, and a nice departure from the usual waffles. My yield was almost 6 waffles, by the way. I recommend this recipe, and just might make them again some time."

First I used coconut butter instead of melted butter in a silly attempt to make them slightly healthier. Then I used the new dark chocolate cocoa powder and made a syrup with it too by adding about 1T coconut butter, 1T cocoa, 2T Agave and some water to thin. We ate ours with whipped cream coconut shreds, the chocolate syrup, and a few pecan pieces. OMG to die for! My 2.5 year old ate 2 without batting an eye. I would say it was a hit!"
