"reviewBody": "I bake a lot. I followed this recipe exactly to instructions with no substitutions. Firstly on induction stove, it will burn at medium heat. Mine did, had to toss and start new, and I was stirring constantly. Then, my next batch wouldn’t thicken and loose gloss. So I transferred to the stand mixer. It then thickened after over 15 minutes and became pale. I transferred to pan but overnight it didn’t harden. It’s actually so soft that I can’t cut into squares to serve, they are too goopy. Finally, these really don’t have the intense chocolate taste I wanted, it’s actually very mild. I used Carnation brand evap milk, with Costco’s Kirkland chocolate chips for reference."

I have had trouble a lot with the fudge not setting well. The proportions and the cooking time must be superb here, because it turned out great. I made it like the recipe, but cooked it 10 minutes, instead of 6. Thanks for a great recipe.\nDiane Allen, Eustis, FL"

I realized this after when the mixture didn't thicken. So, I put it all back in a large pan and doubled the recipe. I boiled it to 230 degrees then took it off the heat. I beat it awhile, glossiness never went away.\nI poured it into 2 pans and added nuts to one. To me, it was a little grainy and not smooth. It did set and tastes okay. I'll try it again with the right amount of milk."

We heated until softball. 235-236; it's sets faster. \n3. We doubled the recipe and it's doubly delicious. \n4. Ours lost its shine fast and we got it into the pan just in time. \n5. Also if you like more milk-chocolate taste try using 1/2 the chocolate -Yum!"

Also left the butter out at room temperature for 2-3 hours before final assembly to soften it. No complaints here. Used a Kitchenaid Mixer on low (not lowest but low) setting for the final mixing. I would run it and for 30-60 seconds and stop for 30 seconds or so. Scrape down the sides ect. Finally the surface would start to crack when I would begin to mix it again and basically thats when I added the nuts and I was done. Transferred to refrigerator and let cool for several hours. Was great, would make again."

"reviewBody": "I have probably made fudge about 2 x, but this was my best effort. Thanks for this recipe. I liked it's simplicity and ease. How ever, I added extra half cup of chocolate chips because my husband likes his fudge with robust chocolate flavor. I think this worked very well, hence my 4 stars rating. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of salt. It was very thick and was set in under 2 hours with a rich chocolate flavor. For other reviewers whose fudge did not set , may be trying to increase the chocolate and paying attention to the quantity of the milk will help. The 5 ounces of milk is 10 table spoonfuls. My husband and I were really impressed with the outcome considering my earlier attempts at fudge making weren't successful."

I chose this recipe because I could easily change it to meet my daughter's food intolerance. I used 2 tablespooons ghee, a pinch of salt, and 6 tablespoons palm shortening in place of the butter, and heavy whipping cream in place of the evaporated milk.\n\nThat said, the flavor was lacking a bit - next time I will add more chocolate somehow - either with cocoa powder at some point, or more chocolate chips.\n\nIt would be an understatement to say my daughter was thrilled with the fudge. I think she would give it 5 stars, but she's been fudge-deprived for 3 years now, so I think ANY fudge would get 5 stars from her."

It had been years sense i made fudge, and i had kept changing recipes. I quickly jumped on AllRecipes, like i always do, and found this fudge recipe. This is now my \"famous fudge recipe.\" It is so good and easy. I didn't have large marshmallows, so used 2 cups of mini's. I actually only used about 1 1/4-1 1/2 cups sugar (mostly because i ran out), and it turned out WONDERFULL!!!! Make sure to only use a 5 ounce can of milk otherwise it WILL NOT work (obviously.) I beat it for, um, maybe 4-5 minutes and it was beautiful. I lined a pan with foil, to make it easier, and only refrigerated it for about 1-1/2 hours and then am having it just sit on the counter, because we like soft fudge. I have a dairy allergy, so didn't try any (ok, ok, maybe i tried just a teeny-weeny bit), but everyone else says its good, and it turly is. Seriously, make this fudge recipe and you won't try another!!!!!!!!!!"

Over low heat I bring the butter, sugar, and milk to a boil - stirring constantly - when the bubbles cannot be stirred away I start timing for 5 minutes - again stirring constantly. After five minutes, I remove from the heat, add chocolate chips and vanilla, I blend with my portable handheld mixer. Then add nuts and pour into a foil lined and greased 8 x 8 inch dish. Allow to cool, lift foil out and cut into squares. I make a lot of this and give as gifts. Been making for years!"

I doubled the recipe, using 1 whole can of evaporated milk (12 oz can) 2 cups ghiardelli bittersweet chips, 2 sticks butter, 2 tsp vanilla, 4 cups mini marshmallows, 4 cups evaporated cane sugar (organic). I used a candy thermometer and cooked the milk marshmallows and sugar on 4.5 heat (setting on electric stovetop) till soft ball stage, I didn't time it, but I know it took quite a bit of time. I stirred with a heat proof rubber spatula slowly the whole time. I then dumped this onto the butter, vanilla and chocolate chips in my kitchen aid mixer. I mixed for atleast 5 min on medium speed. I then dumped into a pan with buttered foil in it. I would say a 10x10 or so would do the trick. It has the best texture of any fudge I have tried. I put walnuts on top of half of the fudge. It looks amazing, Thanks for the recipe. This is the second time I have made fudge and I am sure this will be the main recipe for me! The first fudge I made was a disaster..... have made this countless times, never failed yet. A quarter sheet cake pan works perfect. it takes about 24 min, starting the timer right when you turn on the stove with the ingredients in the pan."

I used parchment paper instead of tin foil, and it came out beautifully. It tasted and looked just like just fudge, and although I am easy to please when it comes to chocolate, it seemed like it could have used some additional flavor or punch-- it was a little bland. We did enjoy it, however, and if I make this recipe again, I will use the semisweet morsels and maybe add the orange or raspberry extract as some of you suggested. I am giving this recipe 4 stars for ease and success of directions, but omitting one for taste-- hope this helps."

"reviewBody": "Excellent! As long as you follow the directions exactly it will turn out great! Note: Only use the 5oz. of the milk, and not a whole 12 oz. can and stir CONSTANTLY. I have never made fudge before and it was not hard to make, nor was it runny or gritty from the sugar. I didn't even use a candy thermometer. This only toook me about 15 minutes from pantry to fridge to prep, and let it sit for 3 hours or so in the fridge. I also used a 9x9 pan because that's all I had and it still was thick enough to enjoy! I will make this again for sure and only gave it 4 stars because 5 stars to me is fudge that I woud die for! :) Otherwise, It was chocolatey and smooth!! MMMM!"

The only other change I made was to the nuts. Instead of walnuts, I used toffee bits stirred into one batch and crushed candy canes on top of the second batch. Both were amazing! Today I'm going to try it with dark chocolate and the candy canes again!"

"reviewBody": "This fudge never set up, a fate that apparently befell another reviewer. After an hour of beating, all I had was a bowl of room-temperature, chocolate sludge. I guess I'll have to turn it into brownies tomorrow. The recipe was followed to the letter, something I feel you have to do with any confection involving boiling sugar. I suspect the problem is that I never got the sugar-milk-marshmallow mixture up to a temperature high enough to insure that it would set up later after beating. It would help if Leema would provide a temperature to which the boiling mass should be brought. Providing such a bench mark might be so much clearer than instructions to stir and boil, then reduce heat to low and stir some more for 6 minutes. Just what temperature is \"low\" anyway. I suspect Leema's low is probably higher than the low on my range."

"reviewBody": "These were okay. Texturally, they came out fine with no problems reported by other reviewers - 5 oz evaporated milk worked fine, and instead of taking the milk mixture off the heat at 6 minutes, I used a candy thermometer and waited until the temp had reached about 235 - if some people turn the heat down low and take it off just at 6 minutes, it may not be up to temperature, which may account for the fudge not coming together.\n\nThe milk mixture was difficult to cook using a stainless steel pot - it really wanted to burn on the bottom, so I had to stir really vigorously for the 7-8 minutes I was cooking it. It still burnt slightly, although could not taste it in the end result.\n\nUsed semi sweet baking chocolate and bittersweet couverture chocolate rather than chocolate chips. With a Kitchen-Aid mixer, the fudge lost its gloss really quickly (within a minute or two), which confused me since someone here had said it took longer than expected... so I kept going and probably overbeat it.\n\n Flavor turned out pretty bland, albeit rich and dense. It really needs a flavor punch somehow, and I'm not sure what would work - more vanilla? A bit of salt (since I used unsalted butter)?\n\nWill try other recipes - I'm spoiled on a childhood of boiled fudge with heavy cream that is kneaded as it cools - now THAT's the good stuff."

I used condensed milk instead of evaporated. The fudge was horrible. It never looked how the directions described it and it tasted like chocolate sugary sand. When I realized the huge error I made the 2nd batch was much better. Another mental note, if you have stainless steel mixing bowls, then you might want to consider using a different bowl. The steel bowls get very hot while mixing the butter and are difficult to hold if you don't have some sort of oven mit handy. We just got a kitchenaid mixer so that might solve my hand burning problem if I misplace my mitts again. I'm a big fan of dark chocolate and I've used Hershey's Dark chocolate chips as well. Everyone seems to like that version just as much."

The extra chips made it quite firm but it was still nice and creamy.\nIf you make it with extra chips, it won't take as much beating.

I lined my pan with foil too so I can just lift the whole thing up, peel the foil off and cut it up on a cutting board. When it says to beat until it \"loses its gloss\" I thought I hadn't done it long enough (it was still a little glossy), but it set up perfectly. I love the crunch walnuts add to this. ******UPDATE: Made this again 12/20/5 with orange extract instead of vanilla, kept everything else the same. It was SO GOOD! Try it this way, or use your favorite flavor. (Kept the amount of extract the same, using \"real\", not artificial, orange flavoring)."

"reviewBody": "I may have stumbled upon the problem some people are having with this recipe. It's the amount of evaporated milk. When a recipe says \"one can\" I usually just go with what seems to me to be a standard sized can. But before I poured it in the saucepan this time, I checked the ounces. Whaddya know? To me, a can of evaporated milk is 12 ounces. But this recipe only calls for a 5 ounce can. So be sure to check the size of your milk can!\n\nI personally LOVE the fudge you make from the recipe on the back of the marshmallow cream jars. But the cream contains eggs and my son is allergic. (Marshmallows themselves usually do not -- weird, huh?) Anyway, this reciped turned out better than any other non-marshmallow cream variety I've tried. It's creamy, sets up well and tastes nice and yummy. (With all that butter and sugar it ought to!)\n\nA quibble is that to my eye it never really lost its gloss. But I quit beating after several minutes anyway and it turned out fine. No nuts for us due to allergy issues as well -- that can be a problem with some fudge recipes I've tried but not this one!\n\nTry this an be diligent about the milk measurement and you'll be pleased. And of course, as with anything with milk and this much sugar, forget the directions to stir \"frequently\" during the heat-up stage and just plan on stirring constantly."

"reviewBody": "I have never had success with fudge until trying this recipe. It turned out so creamy and, well just perfect. I got rave reviews by everyone that has tried a piece. I would suggest using a candy thermometer just to eliminate any doubt on when it is ready to take off the stove. I did a slight varation on it - First of all I doubled the recipe and left out the walnuts. I also used 1/3 milk chocolate chips and 2/3 semi-sweet (my personal preference). After I poured it into two pans I topped one pan with crushed candy canes and the other with walnut halves. Both versions went over really well but people seemed to really like the one with the candy cane on top. Very festive looking too. The only suggestion I have is to give a approximate time needed to beat the mixture. I wasn't totally sure if the gloss was gone but I had been beating for about five minutes (in a KitchenAid mixer) and was afraid of over doing it. It would have been nice to have a general guideline. Thank you for this recipe. I'm already planning on making it again tomorrow to give away as gifts."
