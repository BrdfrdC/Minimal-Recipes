This recipe is easy to half for one loaf and also easy to modify to your taste such as reducing the oil and sugar by 1\\4 each. I agree that it may not need to bake a full 60 minutes, but that depends on your zucchini amount and moisture. Enjoy!!!"

"reviewBody": "The taste was good- not over the top, but good. I give it 3 stars bc as someone else mentioned- it sticks to the pan incredibly bad. I’m not sure why; I greased it a good amount, and I do bake a lot, so it’s not like I’m a newbie. The batter definitely does not make enough for 2 loaves, unless you like them thin. I got one loaf out of it and 8 small cupcake/muffin size. The loaf also cooked in 55 min, not 60-70. Also. The chocolate chips sank to the bottom, even though I coated them in flour. But- to be fair- that’s one area of baking that I’ve never had success at- making chocolate chips not just sink. Lol I think if I make this again, I will grease and flour pan, or, use parchment paper. Maybe eliminate the chocolate chips."

Here is what I did: I used 1/2 cup cocoa; 1/2 cup oil &amp; 1/2 cup applesauce; 1 cup brown sugar &amp; 1/2 cup white sugar. I also doubled the zucchini to 4 cups. Most recipes I've made use 2 cups zucchini per loaf. Perfection."

"reviewBody": "This bread is delicious. I've been making it for years as my go-to zucchini bread recipe.\nJust for kicks, I entered it into my Weight Watchers recipe builder just to see how many points I would be eating. Of course, you think zucchini is a vegetable and is healthy so this bread must be not too bad on weight watchers. WRONG. For those of you on weight watchers that haven't taken the time to build the recipe, it's 10 points for 1 piece. That is both loaves cut into 12 pieces each for a total of 24 pieces per recipe. So 1/24 of this recipe is 10 points. As much as I love this bread, it's going to be an occassional treat. My family will not mind the extra pieces that I didn't eat."

I make it in a bundt pan for a nice moist cake, but I've also done mini bundts and cupcakes. But I find that a bigger cake keeps the moisture much better. So good!"

I used only half the amount of sugar, and I subbed 1/4 cup of the flour for 1/4 cup of cocoa powder to give more chocolate flavor to the cake. Also, I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate, so use some good quality semi sweet dark chocolate instead. The baking time for me was only 40 minutes. FYI, these zucchini breads don't rise much."

My chocolate chips sank anyway :( in any case, it made a yummy loaf! I filled one 9x5 loaf pan and 3 “half sized” silicone loaf molds. The half sized loafs only took 45 min, the 9x5 took 60 minutes. I’m giving 4 stars because I wasn’t a fan of the chocolate chips in the bread - it made it too sweet so for next time, I will either melt half the amount and mix it into the batter or emit it entirely. Still tastes great and all of it will be eaten!"

"reviewBody": "This bread was delicious! A neighbor gifted a ginormous zucchini, so naturally what new to do with. \n\nI did not have unsweetened baking squares, only bittersweet, so I also added a tablespoon of cocoa powder to the dry ingredients. I used mini chocolate chips and added them to the dry ingredients also. Following another reviewer, I threw in a half cup of sour cream I needed to use up.\n\nIt was fantastic!!! Nice rise, texture and moist. I’m sure it would have been very good also as written.\n\nWell done and thanks for the recipe, a keeper!"

That circumvented them settling to the bottom during baking. This is a fantastic way to utilize all of your zucchini harvest!"

I did not have any baking chocolate so used 1/2 cup cocoa and reduced the Sugar to 1 1/2 cups. But then I added extra chocolate chips and mixed them with the dry ingredients. It was perfect and did not stick to the pan!"

My family loves nuts so I add walnuts and it is spectacular. The walnuts add a subtle crunch and complement the chocolate and Zucchini. We always have a surplus of Zucchini's from our garden and this is our go-to recipe. I would recommend this and have recommended this recipe to many family members and friends."

That time, I used my cheese grater to grate the zucchini and added it at the end, as another reviewer recommended. This time, I used a vegetable shredder which got the zucchini down to almost a paste. And I added it with the other liquid ingredients. Turned out a 1*. The cake didn't rise at all and stayed wet in the middle, despite being too hard around the edges. I can only think it was the texture of the zucchini and being added with the wet ingredients? I went over and over it in my mind and I did nothing else differently. So I'm averaging my two tries as a 3*. But I'm a bit reluctant to try again."

Well, the chips fell to the bottom, they stuck to the pan and, of course, overcooked. When a recipe site publishes a recipe, I don't feel I should have to read thru countless reviews to find out HOW to make it turn out right. Actually, i dont have time to do that. The top 3/4 that did come out of the pan tasted great. I will make it again, knowing what others have said to make it correctly."

I think it depends on the size of your pan, if the mix is deeper it will take longer to cook. I cooked it in a pyrex instead of a cake pan and it didnt take quite as long. I also like the suggestion to put in mini chocolate chips. I didnt have any unsweetened chocolate squares, so I melted butter, sugar and cocoa together instead."
