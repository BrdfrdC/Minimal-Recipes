"reviewBody": "This is yummy, but for my own personal tastes, there is too much cinnamon in it. \n\nI did use half of regular Dutch cocoa (Hershey's Special Dark), and the other half was jet black cocoa. To be able to use the jet black cocoa as half of the cocoa, I had to modify the amounts of baking soda and baking powder so that they were also at a 1:1 ratio. \n\nI kept back the chocolate chips until the batter was in the loaf pans so that I could make sure each loaf got the same amount of chocolate chips. Also, I weighed the batter in each loaf pan to be sure each loaf got the same amount of batter. I then added the chips on top and stirred them in gently with a chop stick. They didn't sink down.\n\nPersonally, I would have liked a higher rise to the loaf, but it's really good. I'm wondering if a bit of buttermilk would work....."

The muffins were moist and chocolaty and my whole family loved them. The only think I would change id maybe doubling the chocolate chips. I froze half the batch for later the recipe made 28 muffins."

"reviewBody": "It tastes just amazing, but definitely needed more time in the oven compared to the recipe. I had to add an extra 18-20min bake time which after that the toothpick finally came out clean. But once I cooled &amp; sliced the bread it actually turned out to be a little mushy still in the middle. A texture I would say looked similar to if I had mixed bread with pudding. Just not enough pudding that it’s soggy looking. I’m gonna to play around with the bake time some more. I want to figure out how much more time it still needs to cook after the additional 20min that I already added to the recipes max bake time. Also I might try using foil at some point in the baking time that way I can keep adding to the total time it’s in the oven while also trying to keep the top from becoming brittle &amp; over cooked. Besides that"

"reviewBody": "I chose this recipe because it’s nearly identical to the recipe I used to make regular zucchini bread, And I love that recipe. The chocolate bread however, when it comes out of the oven, there’s very little flavor. It almost makes you disappointed that you made it. My advice to you is to make it in the evening and let it rest until the next day. It needs time to rest to come to full flavor, and then, once you cut into it, it’s not going last more than a few hours. its amazing! I alter the recipe as I do with all recipes that require some type of cooking oil, I always use olive oil. And my oven cooks it in only 50 minutes. Be sure to check it early for doneness."

"reviewBody": "I did make a few of the alterations suggested by others to make it more healthy - doing half applesauce/half oil, replacing 1 cup of flour with whole wheat. It mixed together well, had the expected taste and consistency, and baked up beautifully - I pulled the loaves out after 50 minutes because they were done. It was fluffy, moist, and delicious, a big hit with my whole family! I have no doubt that the original recipe would turn out just as well, as these are standard substitutions. A few notes based on my experience of doing this and other similar breads. First, make sure to press down/pack the shredded zucchini to get the full measure...a little extra even will be okay. Second, make sure that the pans are well greased...if you miss a spot, there's a chance the bread will stick. Finally, do not overcook! Set your timer lower than what you would expect. If you think it might be done (the material inside the cracks appears dry, it is starting to pull away from the sides, it smells done), check it and pull it. If you overcook, it will likely end up dried out as well as having that \"toasted chocolate\" taste."

I made them in muffins ( no paper cups, I just sprayed the muffin pans) so they baked about 18 to 20 minutes. I got praise from all who tasted. This goes in the faves and will be made over and over again.\nYield 24 regular size muffins"

I usually sub applesauce for the oil and find it makes for a nice and moist bread. This time I added a touch of nutmeg and added a streusel like toppping and the result was a yummy treat to add to the holiday cookie tray!"

I followed the most helpful review and did 2 cups whole wheat and used applesauce in lieu of oil (home canned applesauce so probably not the health benefit she had in mind bc we sweeten it.) I also omitted the nuts and chocolate chips bc I like neither in my breads. It will get eaten, but it isn't very chocolatey in my mind. Maybe that would be more noticeable without the heavier whole wheat flour?"
