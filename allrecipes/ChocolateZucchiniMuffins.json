Made half batch, cut sugar down to a little bit more than 3/4 cup but not full cup, added more cocoa powder by cutting flour amount down and had about 1/4-1/3 cup of the total flour being cocoa, added a few chocolate chips but not many. Perfect amount of chocolate and sweetness. When making 1/4 batch scant 2 T of cocoa and a bit less than 1/2 cup sugar. Super important bake way less than this days - only do about 17-18 mins."

I halved the batter and added about 1/2 cup chocolate chips to one half and left the other plain. Both were good, but I prefer the muffins with the chocolate chips. The original recipe is fine also - muffins are not meant to be very sweet - they are not cupcakes with frosting! I will definitely make them again - lots zucchini at the moment. Missing one? - I had to try one right out of the oven - yum!! I am going to try the savory cheddar ones in a day or two."

Worked great. Baked at 350 for 18 min. I made them and gave my son two. I went in my office to do some work and came back and he had snuck and ate SIX MORE! He said he couldn't resist because they were so good. Needless to say...belly ache :)"

I have a convection oven now and I cook all 24 muffins together at 350, they usually take 5 mins less.

"reviewBody": "I'm not sure if you can take my star rating because I altered this recipe quite a bit! First, I adjusted the servings to make 8 servings because I was going to test a few ingredient swaps.\nI used 1 egg, 10 pitted dates (in place of sugar), and 1/3 cup apple sauce (in place of oil). I blended those in my Vitamin until fairly smooth. I then added 2/3 cup shredded zucchini, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, and 2 TBSP dark cocoa powder. Mix those up well. \nThen, I added 1/4 cup almond flour and a scant 1/2 cup white flour. I added 1/4 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp salt, and kept the rest of the spices the same (all 1/4 tsp each). Instead of adding chocolate chips to the batter, I added 3 TBSP of a chopped Toblerone bar I had laying around. \nI baked as directed in a muffin tin greased with a small amount of coconut oil. \n\nThese were excellent! Not too sweet and they ended up making 9 muffins + 1 small one at 90 calories each! A great treat and one that I feel good about indulging in- thank you for this recipe!"

I NEVER use the amount of sugar called for, nor the amount of oil. I've always used at least 3/4 cup of white sugar, and up to 1/2 cup of agave or honey, and I usually use 1/2 applesauce or pumpkin, and 1/2 oil. I've never had cardamom, but I do add the other spices. These are my favourite muffins to make, and I always get 24 mini muffins and 12 full size muffins. They always rise nicely."

I added a mashed banana and only 1/2 the oil to minimize the fat but still keep the moistness; 3/4 c brown &amp; 3/4 c white sugar instead of 2c white sugar only. Omitted the ground clove and added 1/4 c mini chocolate chips and 1/4 c chopped pecans. The almond meal I have, needed to be used so I substituted one cup of the flour with that. Mini muffins were baked for 15 minutes - I made half regular, half mini for variety. The football print muffin liners were so cute that it just kicks it up a notch."

I found the original recipe a little too sweet and oily for my taste, but on second try I discovered you can half the sugar, reduce oil/add zucchini, add chocolate chips, and sub 1 c almond flour for all purpose if you like. The spices are a nice blend -- love the cardamom!"

Instead of sugar, I used honey, about 1 3/4 cup. I also lessened the oil by half, which probably made up for the liquid honey that was used instead of sugar. Then, I doubled all the spice amounts and added one more teaspoon of cocoa. I wanted it rich and spicy. So good! Highly recommend."

I subbed half the oil for applesauce (I might try subbing all of it next time) and allspice for the cloves and cardamom (I didn't have any on hand). It turned out really delicious and my two little boys (4 and 2) are currently being tricked into eating zucchini for breakfast :) I think a little bit of chocolate chips in the mix might make it a little bit sweeter, and I also meant to add some walnuts, but I forgot. I think it would add a nice texture (and some good protein!) to these muffins."

Maybe adding choc. chips again. If after that they aren't good, then I will definitely move on."

"reviewBody": "My rating is based on the recipe itself and not with substitutions, which then would give it a 4/5, I think. These were really good after I followed many other reviewers' suggestions. I doubled the spices and cocoa, and doubled the baking powder/soda as well. Even so, the muffins are fairly dense, don't rise much, and the batter really could use a little thinning out. I was tempted to add a little milk, but didn't. Maybe next time. The flavour with the spices doubled is excellent. I might add even another cup of zucchini next time. I also used half white and half brown sugar. And for those that think a cup of oil is a lot, don't forget the recipe is for 24 muffins, and that really is a negligible amount *per muffin.* Because I was nearly out, I used half vegetable oil, and half light olive oil. I am not sure if this mix would differ from one cup of veg, but I found the muffins quite dry even with a cup of oil. As I expected, storing them in an airtight container and letting them mellow together did help moisten them up somewhat. Good base recipe, just needed some tweaking to up the rating. My kids loved them."
