I have experimented with chicken, chicken stock, red bell pepper, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, canned chop suey veg. But the very best way is to use pork and the simple veg in the original recipe: celery, onion, bean sprouts. We did add salt, substituted molasses for the sugar, and increased the amount of liquids and cornstarch. We like it with rice."

Omitted the celery and bean sprouts ad I used a can of Chinese vegetables instead, which includes both. Also added a can of sliced water chestnuts and 2 Tbsps molasses. Seared the pork, onions and garlic, then put everything except the cold water,cornstarch and sugar in a pressure cooker and set it for a stew. Thickened it afterwards. It was great. The molasses is definitely the missing ingredient in the recipe as written."

Substituted no sodium chicken stock for water. Left out the sugar. Adjusted for taste with about 3/4 teaspoon Kosher salt. Served over crunchy chow mein noodles. It is a good base recipe for chop suey. Easy to modify to taste. I'll definitely use it again to avoid high sodium, high fat, MSG-laden stuff from a restaurant."

I also used a large can of stir fry veggies to the mix to make it a more colorful dish overall. Towards the end, I tasted the sauce and ended up adding more soy sauce to enhance the flavor a bit more. I probably needed to adjust it because of the additional veggies I added to the dish. I would make this dish again--but adjust the sauce to try different flavors."

As others suggested I added more soy sauce and used chicken stock in place of water. On hand I had stir fry mushrooms, water chestnuts and bean sprouts, so they went in also. We are always looking for something different for Christmas Eve and this has worked very well the last few years. Since we have already had a fresh picnic ham, Boston Butt and cured ham since Thanksgiving we need a change of pace before turkey tomorrow."

Using all the ingredient except for shortening substituted with veg.oil, added 3 stalks of bok Choy, fresh bean sprout; one large bag, a can of bamboo shoot and water chestnuts and lastly a whole 16 oz of mushrooms...for the liquid we did swap out the water for chicken broth which put a different twist to the flavor of the broth added more soy to accommodate. The different textures of vegetables were awesome. Certainly was a win with hubby! Thanks for laying the foundation. Excellent flavor!!!! Will do again soon."

"reviewBody": "I have a freezer full of frozen food- a diced celery/onion/carrot mixture, broccoli florets, and chicken breasts. Didn't know what to do and decided to find a recipe for chop suey. Random huh?\n\nI read a lot of complaints about it being bland but for me, it was perfect! Maybe because I'm big on seasoning, and I season food to my taste. I didn't have pork, so I cut up the (thawed) chicken breasts and cooked them in olive oil. The chicken was seasoned with seasoning salt, paprika, and pepper. I added my vegetables after the chicken was done and used low-sodium chicken broth as the substitute for the hot water. Added a dash of salt and pepper and even then, the mixture already tasted great. I used fresh bean sprouts instead of canned, but I'm sure that it wouldn't make a difference. Made the cornstarch mixture according to the directions, and was originally worried about the taste of the mixture. After adding it to the stirfry however...wonderful. Perfect amount of salt and sweet. (I later added red pepper flakes-- gotta have a little spicy!)\n\nIt is a very simple, fast recipe and I recommend it for anyone who wants to make a restaurant-quality meal in a short time period. I think maybe using the chicken broth will help with those who said it was bland, but in the words of Chef Ramsay \"Taste, taste, taste!\" No recipe is perfect.\n\nWill DEFINITELY cook again!"

The only changes I made are: a double batch, using brown rice (1 to 2 - rice to water - 1 hour low flame) which adds a nutty flavor and makes it healthier, instead of shortening using a 2 Tbsp of olive oil, adding an ample Tbsp of molasses, increasing the soy sauce to 2 Tbsp and reducing the water by that amount. I like using fresh organic bean sprouts and celery instead of the canned stuff. I can eat this for breakfast, lunch and dinner; and then in my dreams."

Instead of plain hot water, I subbed a hot mix of stock with some white wine and a little water. I sauteed the onions along with the pork. After 5 minutes of this, I also added minced ginger and garlic and sauteed the pork for an additional minute before I added the hot stock mix. All this really deepened the flavors to unreal levels! Then, I had mushrooms, green beans, and carrots I added along with celery just to use them up and add color. Still, it was very quick easy to make and probably the most delicious Chinese dish I have ever made at home. Thanks for the great idea!"

Then I added the sprouts and cornstarch paste and returned the heat to high for about 30 mins. To serve I added sriracha and cooked rice with Baked Egg Rolls (also from here) .
