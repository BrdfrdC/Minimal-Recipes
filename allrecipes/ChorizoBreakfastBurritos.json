Then you no longer need to cut up onion and chiles for spice. Also at the end of cooking sprinkle cheese right into pan to melt and then serve. Very authentic Mexican dish!!!"

Yes, it is hard to see the egg in the final product, but otherwise you miss out on all seasoning in the chorizo. Also, corn tortillas are the way to go!"

"reviewBody": "I used this recipe as a reference and went my own way. I cooked a yellow onion and garlic in the pan with the chorizo and added a chopped orange pepper, a can of Rotel, a can of seasoned black beans (drained), and chopped green chiles from a can (I have found that buying the whole chiles and chopping them yourself is REALLY easy, and has much better texture and flavor) and fresh cilantro that I had leftover. I fried eggs separately, warmed corn tortillas in the oven and served it open face topped with over easy eggs, Queso Fresco &amp; salsa, INCREDIBLE and not that much more work. With my leftovers I cracked 4 eggs directly into the mixture and scrambled it all together in the pan, wrapped up individual burritos with cheese (in flour tortillas that keep better without cracking) and stored them in the fridge. They've been amazing reheated in the morning. Just 1 keeps me full until lunch easily. It's so nice having a quick and nutricious breakfast in the car on the way to work. 1 minute in the mircowave wrapped in a paper towel. Glorious! I hope this long read was worth it for at least 1 person :)"

You do have to add about 3 teaspoons of your favorite cooking oil so it doesn't stick to the pan. My favorite oils to use are grapeseed oil or walnut oil. I am not a Vegan, just a person who prefers a less greasy chorizo with a healthy oil. Believe me, someone who has been eating and making beef chorizo for the past 55 years, you cannot taste the difference between a meat chorizo and a nonmeat chorizo because it is all about the many spices and vinegar used to make chorizo."

I used the whole pound of ground chorizo, chop it up with the spatula as it cooks to have smallish pieces, I then used a whole small yellow onion chopped and browned in the chorizo, I added 11 eggs with about 1/3 C milk beat in. Once I poured it in I sprinkled about 1/8 t of paprika and chili powder and then sprinkle about 1/4 t of garlic powder and 1/2 t of seasoned salt. After it is all mixed and eggs have cooked through I then topped it with cheese and popped it in the cold oven turned on to 350 degrees for about 7 or 8 min while I warm up tortillas in the pan with butter.

I highly recommend draining the grease as it is very greasy and releases a lot of red oil from the chorizo. I cooked the red onions, 1 garlic, minced, bell peppers and eggs separately. I also fried up one russet potato, peeled and cubed. I then layered the burrito with the chorizo on top of the eggs. I topped it with some fresh cilantro. The serving amount was just right for us this morning. I liked these burritos and thou my family ate these they also thought the chorizo was a little on the spicy side. I think these would have been really tasty with some mild salsa as well."

I would cook the onions &amp; peppers and then set them aside in a bowl...cook the chorizo (medium/hot heat, the mild had no flavor), then drain in mesh strainer. Put the chorizo with the onions/peppers in the bowl. Cook the eggs seperately and add cheese on top to melt - then layer your burrito with the chorizo on top of the eggs. I just used 1 casing of chorizo out of a 15 oz pack. I'll save the rest for another recipe."

"reviewBody": "I love me some breakfast burritos! This is a great start, but I do have modifications. I substitute light kielbasa in place of chorizo for less grease. Cut the kielbasa into fourths and then dice it up and saute with the onion, 1 green or red pepper and minced garlic. While mixture is sauteing, whisk 8 eggs together in a bowl and add 2 tablespoons half and half (or any kind of milk you have on hand). Then, this is where I go crazy. I add a lot of spices to the egg mixture: paprika, cumin, cayenne pepper, chili powder, garlic powder, salt/pepper and cinnamon. Yes, cinnamon. It really makes the dish! Be generous with the spices (1-2 teaspoons each) but don't use more than 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. Once that's all stirred together, scramble in a pan and then combine with kielbasa mixture. Chop up fresh cilantro, add to mixture. Heat tortillas in microwave for 30 seconds to soften them, add mixture and toppings and prepare for a taste bud explosion! I like to add Franks hot sauce, Jack's Special salsa (usually found near produce aisle of grocery store), shredded mexican cheese and sour cream. My husband and I eat these burritos every Tuesday night along with refried beans and yellow rice. Muy buena!"

"reviewBody": "I love chorizo and eggs for breakfast! I usually cook the chorizo and then set it aside in a bowl. Cook the eggs in the same pan and add the drained chorizo back into the eggs when they are nearly done (like in an omlette). But occassionally we cook diced potatoes and onion (found in the refrigerated section Simply Potatoes) with the chorizo and add them together to the eggs. Also, fold the end of the tortilla like you would when rolling a burrito and the grease won't get all over the place. The potatoes help soak up the grease too! Yummy!!!"

Spooned out as much grease as possible then add 1/3 cup of water and cooked till water was almost evaporated. Spooned into bowl layered with paper towels to remove more grease. Wiped pan and scrambled eggs and pepper/onion/garlic mix. Filled tortillas and topped with cheese and chorizo and then drizzled with Green Salsa from Dallas Tortilla Factory."

Also after reading other's reviews, I used paper towels below and on top of the cooked chorizo to remove as much of the fat as I could. This worked very well I thought. Oh, we all added salsa at the table. These turned out so delicious... family wants me to make them again next weekend. Thanks for a keeper!"

I use soy chorizo now that I am grown since it is less fatty. My husband loved this (although we did not serve it as burritos, we made tacos instead using corn tortillas). I used about 1/4 less of the chorizo than called for since we made used some earlier in the week. It was great!"

Drain the chorizo a bit. and 2. push the chorizo off to one side of the pan and scramble the eggs by themselves and then mix them with the chorizo. This helps keep chorizo from muddying up the whole thing."
