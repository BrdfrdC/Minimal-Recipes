Honestly, the chorizo rice filling is delicious all by itself, but I find cooking it in the peppers does add something to the dish and not just flavor. Cooking it in the peppers also keeps the filling from drying out.\n\nThis dish goes great with a cider (my favorite pairing has been with Bold Rock's Pineapple Cider). The sweet and fizzy of the drink works well with the slow burn of this meal.\n\nI've experimented by using regular bell peppers instead, but they just don't hold up as well as the poblano peppers."

I used a Mexican blend cheese, also topping the peppers with more during the last 15 min of baking. This is a spicy dish, so I can see why some reviewers substituted hamburg for the chorizo and bell peppers for the poblano for those not liking spicy, like kids. Of course, it's a different recipe, but as long as you like it. I'm freezing a couple, because 1 1/2 peppers was very filling."

I used a combination of hot and regular ground bulk sausage instead of the chorizo, since I don't like chorizo that much. I also used salsa instead of taco sauce. These were not critical substitutions, however. I also have found that the peppers do not take a full hour to bake--mine have consistently been tender after about 30-40 minutes."

"reviewBody": "These were ok to me. I couldn't find Poblano peppers at our grocery store, so I used multi-colored sweet peppers. I had 3 of them, so I doubled all of the ingredients to make sure I had enough filling for the peppers and it worked out perfectly. I also made this during the week and didn't want to wait an 1+ hours to eat, so I steamed the peppers first in the microwave and then just threw it all in the oven to melt the cheese. To me they were a little spicy, but very one note. I found a taco pepper recipe on this website that I absolutely love and I think I will go back to that one."

"reviewBody": "This was really good. I did make adjustments but only because we didn't have a bottled taco sauce. Instead, I used a 1/4 tsp each of cayenne and chili powder. Because chorizo doesn't routinely come in 3/4 pound packages, I used two 9 oz. packages so there was more filling to accommodate, which meant I needed more poblanos and cheese. But it worked out well and was great warmed over the next day. We'll do this again, keeping the moderations I made."

I'm sure this didn't need changes to taste amazing, it is very flexible--I added fresh corn, black beans, and diced zucchini to the mixture and used spices from my cupboard (cumin, smoked paprika, and a cuban/lime blend. I also substituted quinoa for rice. It turned out delicious (though I had to remove chorizo and substitute a turkey burger for my son). Make extra, I'm sure it will be even more delicious today!"

"reviewBody": "Huge hit! I used Jimmy Dean's sausage since I had it and not chorizo, which we have found to be super greasy. Added no oil. Added the onion with sausage in the skillet for the last 5 minutes or so. Used 1/2 Taco Bell Fire and 1/2 Verde sauce to the meat/rice mix, and topped with the Verde Sauce before baking. The men in my family would have eaten 1 1/2 peppers if I'd made enough. Everyone loved this! \nNext time, I'll use brown rice instead of white for nutrition, and I think corn (especially leftover roasted) would be a great addition. But excellent and EASY recipe!"

I also added fresh garlic once the peppers were soft. I used pace also, and did not add any to the top when baking. My family likes spicy food, and this was a hit. On the favorites list now!"

I used regular sausage, Spanish rice, chili beans in chili sauce ( I didn't have any taco sauce on hand), cilantro, onions, and red and yellow bell peppers. It was wonderful and no leftovers!!

I'm thinking that next time I'll top them with fried eggs. I used salsa instead of taco sauce (my chorizo has more than enough flavor that taco sauce would definitely over do it) and it really was good. Definitely a keeper recipe."

Since I was serving Mexican rice as a side dish, I used half a can of pinto beans (rinsed and drained) to substitute for the rice. DH wants this dish on the favorites rotation. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!!"
