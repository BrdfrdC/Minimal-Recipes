This year we added diced onion and next year we will probably also add diced bell pepper and sliced mushroom. The only trouble we've had is that we cooked it the full 90 minutes this year without checking on it and it came out a bit overcooked, so next year we'll check it for doneness at 60 and 75 minutes. Definitely recommended for an easy to make and deliciously gratifying meal on Christmas morning or anytime!"

I‚Äôve never been able to make it quite like hers but this is the closest I can get! I definitely recommend adding 2 extra eggs since the bread soaks up most of the liquid. The mustard powder is an essential part for the flavor so definitely avoid omitting it if possible. It changes the game imo."

I add cup of sharp cheddar cheese over tots, add sausage , another cup of cheese, then the egg mixture as mentioned ( I use a dozen eggs). Then a cup of cheddar. I usually use 3 cups of cheese. I have added 1/4 cup of onions , or green chiles (4 oz) or chopped jalapenos. Change it up. I do not cover. Take it out in about an hour and let it set for at least 5 minutes. Grill some corn or flour tortillas. Serve in the tortilla . No plate no silverware. Feed my cowboys at the ranch. They love it."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was highly rated and looked easy. So I tried it. It is easy. The first time I tried it, I put in too much bread apparently. (I used toasted French bread, diced.) It was just okay but I thought next time, less bread. So I made it again this morning...less bread. The recipe says calls to put it in a 9\" x 13\" glass dish...and when you make it exactly according to the recipe, using that size pan spreads it out it ends up being very thin. Still felt like too much bread. Okay...now the next time I make this I'm going to use the same amount of bread---6 slices toasted---only I'm going to double the custard part (eggs, milk, mustard and salt.) I doubt if I'll double the cheese. If it works better that way, I'll report back. If it doesn't work, I'm going to line the trash can with my copy of this recipe!"

Added a sprinkle of pepper and poultry seasoning to the recipe. Used some of the cheese to top it with and also used a smaller pan (one that I use for brownies 7 x 11?). It puffs up beautiful and golden brown! So delicious."

"reviewBody": "This recipe has been a Christmas tradition in our family for about 15 years. I don't deviate too much since I have a couple picky eaters, but this recipe begs to have additions like veggies or other meats. I do double the eggs and add some additional half-n-half for creaminess, plus a little garlic powder. Lastly, I add a bit of cheese to the top during the last 20 minutes of cooking."

Put 4 pounds of cooked sausage ( half original, half sage), green onions and chopped mushrooms on top and then sprinkled about 3 cups mixed Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese on that. Beat 1 T dry mustard With a cup of milk and 18 eggs. Put in fridge overnight, followed instructions for baking and it came out perfectly. Yum!"

If you don't toast the bread, it soaks up the cheese and sausage flavor better, and you get a fluffier casserole. \n\nAnd for a little extra flavor......\n\nI partially render the sausage, covered, and then add onions, cook covered until mostly rendered. Then uncover and finish cooking until sausage is browned. \n\nUnless it's a REALLY greasy sausage, I don't drain the grease. (not the healthy choice, but, hey, it's Christmas) The grease soaks through the bread and eggs in the overnight soak and adds significantly to flavor. Add a tsp of herb infused olive oil and it's magnifique :)"
