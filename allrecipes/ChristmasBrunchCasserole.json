"reviewBody": "A lot of breakfast casseroles end up being really heavy or soggy with cheese sauce, egg mixture, and/or grease, but this one was not heavy at all - quite light. Only adjustments I made: I added cut-up pieces of cooked breakfast sausage links in addition to the cooked bacon, (I cook bacon in the oven though, not a pan,) I doubled the amount of cheese, and served it with sour cream on the side as well - was pretty good. Like I said, we didn’t feel “gross” after eating this for breakfast on Christmas morning :) I will make it again, but probably with two more eggs, add some extra cheese into the hashbrowns, and will cover it while it bakes for at least the first 30 mins."

"reviewBody": "I hope people read the reviews before making this because it has major potential but a few flaws. First off, don’t make a mess sautéing bacon. Do it on a rack on a sheet pan in the oven. Sauté veg in butter and olive oil, for much longer than 5 mins. You want the pan to be almost dry. Cook the water content from the onions and mushrooms and season them with salt, pepper and Italian seasoning. Definitely use 6 eggs, like others suggested here. And use way more than a cup of cheese, adding with 20 mins left to cook. If you put it on from the beginning, it forms a layer of crunchy cheese and doesn’t stay on. Also, at 400 this only needed about 35 mins in the oven to set up. I made it and baked it immediately. Increased cooking time would be needed if baked from the fridge"

I took advice from some of the other commenters and put in 6 eggs instead of 4. I also added a chopped green bell pepper to the recipe. As I don't like to get the top too brown, I turned the oven down to 350 and baked it for an hour and a half, and for me, that was perfect. This recipe is a keeper!"

I also made it again the following weekend for my family and friends and everyone absolutely loved it. It'll be my go-to dish for brunch get-togethers! Thank you."

Oh, I added a little (4Tbsp) sour cream into eggs/milk before pouring over potatoes. Update: forgot to include, baked covered 45 minutes/ uncovered 15 minutes. (Had already sliced into it :-p)"

I also mixed the seasonings with the eggs and milk before I added them over the hashbrowns and bacon. And I added a ton of cheese probably at least 3 cups if not a little more. I used 1/3 mild cheddar and 2/3 sharp cheese. And I didn’t add the cheese until about 5-10 minutes before it was supposed to be finished. That seem to be perfect. Everyone loved it and raved on and on about it. I will definitely make this again"

I thought for sure it would stick without it, but it didn't at all. I used a 9x13 glass pan &amp; these ingredients fit perfectly - if I had added much else I would have needed a second pan. I mixed it all together in a bowl before pouring into pan &amp; refrigerated about 24 hours before cooking. I cooked it for 45 min at 400 degrees &amp; it was done. I left it in on warm for 15 more minutes because it wasn't time to eat yet. I didn't add any veggies due to picky eaters, &amp; although I didn't find it bland, I thought it could use a small amount of onion &amp; green pepper. I think this recipe would work well a variety of ways."

"reviewBody": "I tried crisping the hash browns on the stovetop prior to pouring into casserole dish. Then added bacon, egg mixture and cheese. I did not refrigerate after prepping, just did everything at once. I was concerned the cheese would burn prior to the eggs cooking but it was ok. My son requested mozzarella next time instead of cheddar. I omitted the onion and mushroom but my hash mix did already have onions and peppers. I may try covering with foil next time until the last few minutes."

I don’t understand why so many people loved this recipe. Potatoes made it very bland, feel like if I ever made it again (won’t), I’d stir it all up before cooking and I’d add something tastier, like sour cream or cream cheese or feta, or all that... would also double the meat and use/add breakfast sausage (for more flavor)."

"reviewBody": "I made this casserole with a few modifications. I used turkey bacon, sautéed onions, 1 1/2 cups milk, 2 cups of cheese and 4 eggs. Instead of using frozen hash browns, I made my own which I seasoned which I’m thinking saved this otherwise bland dish. I wish I had read the reviews before making it per the directions. My chief complaint is the cheese was burned. I think it would’ve made more sense to bake at 350 instead of 400 and for less than an hour if prepared and refrigerated over night. Also adding more eggs to the recipe would’ve made it feel less like a potato casserole. Overall the flavor was great and I definitely will be making this again however with more eggs and maybe adding the cheese in later to prevent the hard crusty feel it has. Thanks for sharing!"

I find this way the potatoes have a bit of texture instead of just getting mush. I also add some cooked Jimmy dean hot sausage and a mild sausage (we like meat). I also add cilantro and green onion. I also add some more seasonings such as chili powder garlic powder onion powder, paprika, and sometimes a smidge of cumin. I bake in a huge foil disposable container for 350 for almost 45 or until the egg is all set. I bake it covered for about 30 min then uncovered the last 10-15 to let the cheese brown up. I also use a blend of Mexican cheeses."

Cooking the onions and mushrooms in the bacon grease added just the right amount of savory to the entire dish. I also thoroughly salted and peppered the hashbrowns on the bottom before adding anything else. I also didn't measure out the mushrooms or cheese, but used an entire 16 oz. carton of sliced fresh mushrooms and an entire 2 pound bag of shredded sharp cheddar. I do agree that the bottom is a little mushy while the cheese on top was a little overly done. Next time, I'll cook it a little longer and wait to add the cheese in the last 15 minutes of cooktime. It was absolutely delicious, though, and so super easy to prepare. Loved only having to pop it in the oven on Christmas morning."

This is a great recipe and very delicious but it needs lots of adjustments. Instead of bacon I used ground sausage (we just like it more). There wasn't much egg to it, so next time I will use 6 instead of 4. I also added a diced green bell pepper and about 4 green onions sliced and sprinkled just beneath the cheese. A cup of cheese wasn't quite enough either so I would make it about 1 1/2 cups instead next time. Everything else about this recipe is great. Everyone loved it and I will definitely make this again with the adjustments."

Cooking the onions and mushrooms is going to take MUCH longer than 5 minutes to cook down. Instead of garlic salt, I used 2 large cloves of minced fresh garlic and added it along with the onions and mushrooms towards the last few minutes of cooking in the frying pan. In addition to parsley, I also added some thyme which added a lot of great flavor. I think the next time I make this recipe I will also try adding a bit of cayenne just to give it a little zip."

I am not sure what frozen hash brown potatoes are (already cooked e.g.?), so I just used raw, shredded potatoes. Like some reviewers did, I mixed all the ingredients together before pouring the egg over. I did add some cheese on top. Perhaps next time I'd like to first fry the shredded potatoes slightly, and then top it with the filling and egg. It could be quite nice if it had some sort of crust at the bottom. The way I made it today, does not really appeal to us. After breakfast, my husband remarked that he still preferred bacon and eggs and trimmings - I always ask for honest opinions. Not sure if I will try it again."
