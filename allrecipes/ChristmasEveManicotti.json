"reviewBody": "This recipe was not bad at all. I made it for a Christmas Eve get-together with my family, and we ate it with baby back ribs. It was not too difficult to make and my family enjoyed it. I used chopped fresh spinach, which was what I had on hand, and that was delicious, but I wasn't sure how much of it to use from just looking at the amount of frozen spinach listed in the recipe. The crepes took the longest amount of time to prepare, even though it was pretty simple to do. I added just a tablespoon or two of sugar to my crepe batter to round out the flavors. But, the crepe batter made a lot of extra crepes! I took the extras to Christmas morning breakfast with some different jams and fresh whipped cream. Also, I didn't have any wax paper, but had no problems with taking my crepes apart after stacking them up."
