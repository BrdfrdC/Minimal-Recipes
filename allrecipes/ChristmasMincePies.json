"reviewBody": "The dough was very easy to work with. I was able to use 1 large jar of mincemeat and got 8 regular 'cupcake' size tarts, and 24 mini tarts with only a tad of the dough left over. I am not good at handling pie dough made with a higher butter ratio. Just out of personal preference, next time I'll just switch the amts. of crisco (used butter flavored) and the butter for a more tender crust. The addition of the orange zest really made this a nice ever-so slightly sweet crust. These are intended as a gift but I did have to sneak one to review. Very, very nice recipe."
