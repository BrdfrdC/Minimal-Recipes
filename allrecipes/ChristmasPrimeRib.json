"reviewBody": "I was a little worried about making this dish because I’ve never made prime rib, nor do I eat it, but my family insists I make the best steaks so I thought I’d give this one a try. It was a major hit. For other first timers like me, I wouldn’t worry about getting the ingredients exactly right. It’s the cut of the meat and the cooking method that really gives this one flavor. If you’ve read other recipes, chef john’s prime rib is very basic and has over 2k 5 star reviews. Like other reviewers I set the oven to 500 degrees and cooked a 4.5lb roast for 30 mins. Then I reduced the heat to 350 for about 30 mins making sure to not open the oven door. Then I turned the oven completely off leaving the roast in the oven for an additional 30 minutes. I followed the rest of the recipe as described. My family likes their prime rib a little more done than most people. It was perfect, a true medium. Everyone loved it even the picky toddlers who only eat mac &amp; cheese! You should definitely give this one a try."

I added the water and beef base and cooked it, but it was just too much carbon. I re-did the au jus with beef base (Better Than Bouillon) and some seasonings. Letting the roast rest in a pan for 30 minutes gave me some juice to add to the sauce later, so it wasn't a total failure. But the horseradish/dijon mustard on the meat before roasting was great! The house smelled amazing and the taste of the meat was lovely!"

My roast was 6.8lbs. I forgot to take it out of the package and dry it overnight in the fridge but I did it for a couple hours this AM. I left my roast on the counter for 1.5 hours. Cooked it at 450 for 40m and then 350 for 2hours (130 degrees is when I took it out). It sat for 45m to rest. It was a medium cut. This is how we prefer it. However I think 15 less minutes in the oven and it would be medium rare."

"reviewBody": "Follow the times and temp, but I rub butter over the whole thing and lots of salt and pepper, I used Herbs de Provence. The 12.5ib roast came out at 140 internal after 24 minutes at 450 and 2 hours and change at 350. Christmas eve we ate half and the day after we sliced and reheat in broth and made the best sammies ever. Anything over 145 is garbage fit only for a dog you don't like. I will pan grill for those who can't do Mid- rare. But I will give you an evil eye while I am doing it. The son-in-law ran off with the bones saying something about his grill and being his."

I bought an14 plus lb bone in prime rib. I had the butcher cut off bone then tie it back on. I cut off about a third of the roast and froze for another day. I was a little worried that the horseradish rub would be too spicy for a few of my guests but the cooking process rendered the horseradish into a very tasty crust."

"reviewBody": "This was my first attempt making Prime Rib. I also must confess I never had Prime Rib in my life. However, Christmas 2018 was a special one and I wanted to offer my guests a main course that was not the traditional ham. \n\nThis was OUTSTANDING!\n\nNot knowing what I was doing, I purchased a prime rib with bone. This ended up increasing the overall cooking time by a hour. I made the crust and placed it in the oven at 11:30am. By 2:30pm the roast was complete. I let it sit 30 mins. By 3:00pm, we were ready to eat. \n\nMy guests had nothing but good things to say about the tenderness of the roast and the crust. They were extremely surprised when I showed them this simple recipe. They were under the impression, (similar to what I was until I found this recipe) you needed to cook the roast at a high temperature (500 degrees) then let it cool down for hours without opening the oven door. Now, I am not discrediting those recipes that instruct this method. I am sure there are reasons for this , but in a land of wannabe foodies this recipe was perfection! \n\nIt made our Christmas 2018 so memorable."

"reviewBody": "Outstanding! This recipe will replace our previous method of a dry-rub and garlic cloves. We used the ratio of 1 day/pound to dry-age the beef. We loved the horseradish/mustard mixture on the outside, along with the blend of spices. The horseradish (hot variety) was definitely not overpowering. We followed the recipe to the end of step 1, then my husband indirect grilled the roast over charcoal with a drip pan underneath the roast. We've done this grilling method many times, and it always comes out perfect. We base grilling time on 20 minutes/pound of roast. We remove from the grill when internal temperature reaches 120 degrees, then tent with foil and let stand 15 minutes. Since there was just the 2 of us this time, we had a 1-rib roast. They won't stay upright their own, so I used the tallest loop of our beer can chicken stand to hold the roast upright. It worked great! I think a rib rack would also work good, but ours wasn't accessible. Thanks for this delicious recipe."
