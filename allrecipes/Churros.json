At the temperature stated outside cooked perfectly and center was raw. So stopped and regrouped and cut the pipped dough in to thinner sections. Only until they were about 2-3 cm thick cooked did they come out correctly. This was dropping to about 300 F. Lots of work. Also not light and fluffy like restaurant type but more heavy and hard. Bon appetite."

Also make sure your churros are skinny and small... otherwise they explode. i now have 2nd degree burns covering my right hand and wrist and will take months to recover. Very dangerous! im lucky my child was not near stove and that it wasnt my face!"

The dough was also semi cool. Not sure what went wrong. The doughs flavor was not ideal for me either. I've had loads of churros in my life and this just doesn't hit the spot for me. If it was user error please provide clearer instructions. Thank you."

"reviewBody": "I made this yesterday with the modifications that Cat suggested. It was amazing! for anyone who doesn't want to make/use a pastry bag I did let the dough cool for a little bit after mixing with a spatula so i could take chunks from the dough and roll it out on a board with my hands. \n\nIn my first batch, the sticks were way too thick so crispy/doughy ratio was a little off. Once I made them shorter and a lot skinnier they tasted perfect (make them to your own taste of course). This probably can be easier if you have some type of churro maker or a pastry bag with a star tip so you can get more the edges fried.\n\nI also like another's suggestion to fry it at a lower heat for a bit longer cause I did like my dough a little more cooked on the inside - it will take a bit longer to brown. Also, if you're a beginner to deep frying - don't fill up your pot that high or oil will spill out of it!"

I've never tasted a traditional churro so I cannot compare ( I liked Costco when they sold it st their concession and I absolutely love the ones from Jack in the box) This was not as airy and the dough had no taste. I tried 3 different batches, changing the temperature each time. I had no thermometer but was able to judge by the doughiness in each. I did roll it by hand but don't think it was an issue. I cut the sugar and oil in the dough as suggested by some. I will try adding vanilla the next time and maybe follow the recipe exactly how it's written. Yes there will be a next time!"
