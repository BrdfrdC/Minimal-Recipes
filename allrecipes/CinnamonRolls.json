They are hands down my family’s favorite and whenever we have potlucks -I bring these and everyone always asks for the recipe!! So Delicious! Originally, I made them by hand and then with my bread machine when I bought one. The bread machine definitely makes these rolls so much simpler since it does most of the work. I do double the filling as suggested since my family just loves them with more gooey cinnamon filling but they are also good as written! Last time I made them, I separated them into 2 separate pans-one to stay home for my family and one to take over to my in-laws."

Now after making this recipe, there are not enough stars in the sky for this one. \nTwo mods - this New England yankee won't afford cool appliances like a bread machine. I worked this dough by hand. Two, I added slivered (yes, slivered) raisins and finely chopped walnuts to one of the logs. The other was per recipe. The differences in taste and chew were marked. My wife passed on the raisin/walnut version. I tried both and greatly preferred the added goodies."

I didn't make any changes to the ingredients. I didn't have a bread maker so I followed a reviewers instructions on how to do it manually. I laid out those instructions a little bit clearer below.\n\nModified Directions (without bread maker)\nStep A\nDissolve 1 tbsp. white sugar in 1/4 cup warm water with 1/4 cup melted butter. Stir, add packet of yeast. Cover and set aside.\n\nStep B\nMix 1 egg, 1/2 package of pudding mix and 1 cup of warm milk. Wisk. Measure out flour in separate bowl.\n\nStep C\nMix yeast mixture and pudding mixture together, mixing well. Add flour. Kneed the dough until it forms a ball. Cover bowl and put it in a warm place to rise for about an hour.\n\nPick up at step 2 of the original directions."

They are a Christmas morning tradition in our house. They do take some time, so planning ahead is key. For those of you that are worried about the time these rolls may take, here's what I do. I make these a day ahead and store them in the fridge, unbaked. The next morning, I put them in a warm oven to rise at about 200 degrees. After the rolls have risen, I bake and frost as directed. They are divine!! My family expects these every year. It wouldn't be Christmas without them!"

Tasted very good, they are a go to treat for myself."

"reviewBody": "These cinnamon rolls where amazing and so delicious! I didn't have regular instant pudding mix so I just used sugar free instant pudding mix and it tasted fine. I also wanted to triple the batch but it didn't fit in my bread machine so I just used my mixer and then let it rise until the dough looked bigger and then I made the cinnamon rolls and then let them rise for 45 min and popped them in the oven. As for the icing i only had fat free cream cheese so i just used that, it was a little chunky but not super bad. Over all the cinnamon rolls where amazing! I even took them camping lol :)!"

I made the dough in my bread machine and got the cinnamon rolls all cut and ready to go on a cookie sheet, then covered and placed in the refrigerator overnight. Pulled them out in the morning and let them rise while the oven preheated. Took about 20 minutes to bake. I whipped up the icing and placed in a ziplock bag and just snipped the corner for easy spreading onto the rolls. Will be making these again! Thank you!"

The other adjustment was to the frosting. I used less powdered sugar than the recipe called for. I would suggest adding half a cup of sugar and then adding a little at a time until you find your perfect level of sweetness."

I was always afraid to even try making cinnamon rolls but I wanted something special to make for my wife and daughter on Christmas morning. I’m so glad I manned up and took the leap of faith. These cinnamon rolls were really easy to make. I actually made them three days ahead and froze them before giving them the opportunity to raise in the pan. I pulled them back out of the freezer after my family went to bed on Christmas Eve and let them thaw and rise at room temperature over night. I woke up early to baked and glazed them before they woke up. What a surprise! They LOVED them! I followed this recipe exactly except for the nuts, we don’t like them in baked recipes. Thanks again. You really gave this family such Joy on Christmas morning."

I added just a tsp. or 2 more cinnamon to the filling, too. \nThanks for the recipe!"

I would suggest making the cinnamon and brown sugar into a paste before spreading it. Just mix it all in with your softened butter, it makes less mess when rolling and helps to make sure everything doesn’t slide to the bottom of the pan while doing the second rise and baking. I’ve already made this recipe twice and it is not my staple. My family has been requesting it like crazy! Thanks for sharing"

I chose this recipe because it said it had the instrcutions to make the icing as well. The only problem is, the ingredients for the icing are mixed in with the ingredients for the cinnamon buns, which is very inconvenient. If there is a way to list them separately that would be much better. I will have to search for a recipe that’s just for the icing."
