I did not form logs on a floured surface as I felt that would make them more dry; rather, I formed the logs with wet hands and a spatula. I used two eggs in the recipe and did not brush them with a beaten egg. Other than a touch of cinnamon and changing the way I formed the logs, I followed the recipe and it was YUMMY! I sprinkled both sides with the cinnamon sugar. Thank you SARA LEE for sharing."

However the consistency of this biscotti is odd, too too crumbly and easily breaks (not in a good way). I wouldn't make a written again.. But i will use the Cinnamon sugar topping topping to sprinkle on a regular vanilla biscotti. I recommend using 2 whole eggs instead."

Instead of butter I used equal amount apple sauce and I used equal amount of white wheat flour. Turned out PERFECT! I added 1/2 cup slightly thawed blueberries &amp; white chocolate chips. Delicious! Only 1 1/2 points (classic) each! Cant argue with that! Love love love this recipe! Oh! I did also use 2 whole eggs in the base as recommended by other reviewers ??"

Compliments came in masses, I'm not kidding!! Other reviewers said they had trouble with the dough being too dry and crumbly. I did not have this problem at all. Maybe it was because I added the flour mixture in small amounts at a time, mixing it in thoroughly before adding more. The dough was very easy to work with. If you happen to be out of parchment paper, like I was, just spray your baking sheets really well with nonstick cooking spray. It worked perfectly. We dipped ours in melted white chocolate. YUM!!"

I never had a problem with the crumbling but I added 4 full eggs (dbld recipe) and I also didn't wait for the 15 minutes to cool before I cut them. They did however sit sliced and sprinkled for a half hour while my \"second batch\" was still in the oven. For the second baking, I gave them 20 minutes and they were delicious! A definite keeper!"

Very easy to make. I love the cinnamon. I think it is sugary enough alone if you don't want to add icing. And it is very crumbly and hard to work with, but I hear that is expected of a good biscotti recipe. Great recipe, thank you."

To add to it, I put a simple vanilla icing on top after they cool for a bit (4 tbsp butter melted in small pot with 1 tbsp of water - once melted take off heat, let cool 5 mins and add 1/2 cup confectioners sugar - whisk until smooth and drizzle immediately) These were incredible! I love biscotti, and I think I've found the recipe that I'll stick with."
