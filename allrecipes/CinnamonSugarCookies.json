I’m kinda lazy, so I just put a lid on the dough bowl and put the whole thing in the fridge until it was firm enough to work with, then rolled in balls to bake. It was obvious from the amount of ingredients that the recipe doesn’t make anywhere near 60 cookies. I got 24, and I wasn’t making big cookies. Also, you only need about 1/3 as much cinnamon sugar mix as the recipe calls for."

As for the instructions, I sliced one of the logs after only two hours of chill time, and dipped the top of each cookie into the cinnamon sugar rather than rolling the log as a whole. \nI did get 20 cookies, so I would say, if you make them small as indicated, the recipe can/does yield 60 cookies. These are thin too, and since my oven runs hot, I found 10 minutes to be the perfect amount of baking time . These were delicious! I'm pretty sure the next two batches will be baked tomorrow!"

The dough/batter is so soft and gooey that I even put the entire bowl into the refrigerator for an hour in hopes of it stiffening enough to make logs or roll into balls. Nope! Didn't happen. So, I put spoonfuls onto parchment paper and baked them in hopes they would turn out good. They were flatter than pancakes. Not at all my idea of sugar cookies."

There has been times when I've used JUST icing sugar and they still turn out yummy (though they do not hold their shape when you use icing sugar. They are still VERY good though). My sister, who isn't much of a cookie eater, asks for these all the time. Everyone loves them. Although I do EXACTLY what the recipe says (hence the 5 stars) there are times I don't roll the dough into a log but into a ball. When it comes time to placing the cookies on the sheet I roll the dough into balls with my hands and because the dough is cold it's supper simple. Sometimes when I'm in a cinnamon mood I'll add cinnamon to the actual dough. Overall, the exact recipe is perfect and a keeper!"

I have to agree with others: half the cinnamon sugar and put the dough in the freezer before shaping it into logs will make the dough easier to work with! And instead of using a knife to cut 1/4 slice, use thread. it'll help keep the round shape of the dough. Or roll the dough into balls like others had done."

As I also live in Denver and altitude can affect the recipe was another reason I didn't want to overcook. I may try again, but with so many great cinnamon cookie recipes on this site, I probably won't. I also don't understand the amount of cookies that it says this recipe produces. 60, really? I didn't even get 36 from this and I was careful to cut the 1/4 inch thick slices recommended in the recipe."

The dough is a little soft when shaping the logs (or individual balls if you like) which I found to be rather annoying at times but it is definitely worth the hastle of dough stuck to your fingers--tastes good uncooked anyway, right? I put a little more cinnamon in the cinnamon-sugar coating mix, but other wise followed this to a T and was very happy."

"reviewBody": "VERY GOOD. I, too, wish I had made a double batch, because I ate A LOT of the dough while making these! I made a few changes (out of necessity): 1. Instead of white sugar I used Cactus Honey Powder (I didn't have any sugar); and 2. I just stuck the whole bowl with the big ball in the freezer for half an hour or so (I needed them to be done before my hubby came home), then used a small ice cream scooper to make balls, which I rolled in the Honey Powder and cinnamon (Suggestion: use the scooper with one hand to drop into the sugar, and use the other hand to roll them around. I got a bunch of sugar in the scooper coils from using both hands to roll balls). They were really good! Nice and soft, just like I like them. However, if you're sensitive to sweetness, I'd use the author's recommendation of rolling/coating/cutting. I will definitely make these again!!"

I did as others suggested, and put the bowl of dough in the fridge for 10 min until is was workable, then portioned it onto parchment, rolled it into a log, and put it in the freezer for an hour before cutting it up like the recipe said. One tip: I could have cut that cinnamon sugar recipe to a quarter of what it said. It made way to much."

"reviewBody": "Okay, let me first say that these cookies are AWESOME! I was a little nervous but they turned out so good. My daughter made them today and although she's only 13, she kinda struggled with the way this recipe was written. The written recipe needs some major work. In the directions, it calls for a different amount of sugar than is listed in the ingredient list. Be sure to use the amount of sugar in the directions, not the ingredient list. So, here's what she did. She doubled the recipe and the doubled up batch made 12 cookies. We added about 1/4 cup extra flour because the dough was sooooo sticky. She skipped the fridge part and rolled the dough into balls and then rolled in the cinnamon sugar mixture. Baked for about 15 minutes at 350 degrees. We'll make these again but I'm going to have to rewrite the recipe so we can do it *the right way*. :o)"

I followed the recipe exactly, except I just transferred the soft cookie dough to plastic wrap (in one clump) and refrigerated until it was firm enough to work with. I used a medium cookie scoop, rolled into balls, and swirled each ball in the cinnamon sugar mixture (which I feel, in this recipe, is way too much - half the amount will do just fine.). I baked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes (until golden brown). After a night in a closed container, the cookies were super-soft. YUM! I have already made these 5 times since I read this recipe. This is FAR better than the, sometimes bland, snickerdoodle. Give it a try fellow all-recipe'rs! You won't be disappointed. :-)"

I just sprinkled the sugar/cinnamon mixture on top and pressed them down with a fork. I had to use 1/2 self raising flour and 1/2 normal because of a shortage of all purpose so I omitted the baking soda. Now that I think of it I also changed the butter to 2TBSP and replaced the rest with some vanilla soy milk to reduce fat content, and used only the egg white for the same reason. So I guess I completely altered the recipe but they were really great anyway! This made me about 30 nice sized cookies which I baked for quite a while to get really crunchy. YUM :)"
