Both were absolutely wonderful! These will be my go tos for sure from now on!"

The sugar caramelized and the butter stayed liquid while hot. Immediately after removing from 300 degree oven maybe 5 min early, scoop them together in a pile with all the extra butter and caramel etc using a spatula. Then flatten to about a 8 inch round pile of hot seeds. Let cool completely and lift out of pan whole. Crack into pieces and yum!"

Re-laid them on the pan and let them sit till they were done popping. Best seeds I've had yet!"

The second time I forgot this but after the recommended 40 min. of baking I noticed they were just simmering in there so I removed the seeds from the oven, and drained the excess butter. Then baked for another 20min. They have good flavor and without the butter they toast up nicely. I have also tried a savoring/spicy recipe which toasted nicely but we prefer the sweetness of these flavors. Next time, I am going to try a different sweet recipe."

I highly recommend that you Rinse and really clean your Fresh Pumpkin Seeds. Then place them on clean paper towels, on a Baking Sheet, and air them out for at least 24-hours to remove the moisture. Then follow this Recipe exactly, but turn them every 15 minutes and don't be surprised if they only take 30 minutes to cook (and not 40 minutes)."
