I think people don't realize that there's 28 grams of added sugar in most 40 grams of dried cranberries; they are meant to be tart but they are not. Also almond extract is very sweet. I cut some of the confectioner's sugar out and used reduced sugar cranberries for the second batch I made and it was PERFECTION. Best cookies ever I may never make a different cookie again."

They seemed to work out quite well. After 10 minutes in oven, they looked to be too soft but I took them out anyway before they browned. after a few minutes cooling, they were a great texture...so trust the 10 minutes and take them out on time."

"reviewBody": "These were wonderful. My husband was so disappointed when he realized there weren't any more left in the cookie jar! I'll have to make him another batch. I followed the recipe exactly, using the full 2 cups of craisins (which help balance the sweetness IMO) which I chopped quickly in the mini-processor and they were perfect. I had no trouble slicing them once they had been in the fridge. My bench scraper did the job easily by rocking it back and forth a bit. The dough was very forgiving if any slices needed re-rounding. Mine took 12 minutes but also were just a bit more browned than in the vid. I think the orange zest is crucial; if your zest isn't flavorful enough, use more. Personally I wouldn't add icing or the white chocolate chips to mine. Totally satisfying (and addicting I might add) as is."

Learning from other responses to this cookie, by adding a bit of cornstarch to the dried cranberries before dicing, to ease the stickiness while chopping. Plus they are pretty to look at. So nice to see the colors on a cookie platter."

Instead of \"flouring\" the dried cranberries, I pulsed the dried fruit for a few seconds in my blender, and the consistency works so well! It also makes the fruit burst with flavor! The only thing I noticed is they do crumble a bit after you take them out, but I'm going to put them in decorative muffin cup liners for a Christmas Cookie Exchange to prevent them from crumbling."

The flavor is good, I would probably cut the craisins on half to make them look like the pictures. I probably will not use this recipe again."

That added a festive look and more flavor. (See my photo)"

Everytime I cut the cranberries would all fall out, which I didn't mind since there were way too many anyway. I will be making them again and tweaking them. I liked the toasted almonds idea. And I had to add 5 minutes extra. Maybe I'll cut them a little thinner than 1/2 inch? Still love the idea. Oh, and I forgot to chop the cranberries. lol. Won't do that again."

I left these in the fridge for longer than 24 hours and they still crumbled when I tried to cut them.\nSince I only had True Orange packets which each packet is equivalent to a wedge and used about 10, there was no orange flavor. I also think I got carried away with the Crisco butter shortening. Other than that these were OK. If I make these again I will look for the other shortbread recipe that I did that came out better than these."

I had gotten a bag of cherry craisans by mistake and decided this was the perfect recipe for them. I was right. Use 1 teaspoon of almond flavoring and 2 tsp. of vanilla. I left out the zest. These are best if baked on parchment paper. Thank you so much for this recipe."

"reviewBody": "I have made this recipe twice this week. Here is my possible explanation for why some feel the cookies are too dry or crumbly. I used the hint a reviewer suggested &amp; stirred 3 T. of flour in the dried cranberries before chopping to keep them from clinging together. That worked beautifully. With the first batch, I remembered to subtract that amount of flour from the 2 c. the recipe calls for in the batter. The 2nd time I forgot. The 2nd batch turned out crumbly and didn't taste quite as good. That additional amount of flour made a noticeable difference in the texture of these delicious cookies. Oh, I used extra orange zest also--a whole orange worth, and cut back to 1 1/4 c. of dried cranberries."

Based on other reviews I used less cranberries, and chopped them up a bit before adding, also used orange extract as I had no almond extract. Wrapped them in parchment paper because it makes it easier to roll out into logs than plastic wrap or waxed paper since the dough is not stiff. Next time I will roll out to thinner logs before refrigerating to get smaller cookies. This recipe is a keeper. I am already planning variations on it."
