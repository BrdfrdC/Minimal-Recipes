I use a black construction garbage bag because it's thick and won't tear, we sometimes have to transport it a 120 miles to Tampa to cook. I put it in a cooler packed with bags of ice around it. Typically I add more of what it calls for but keep the salt to the ratio to water. Every year with my big family of 20 or more we get nothing but complaints on the flavor and mistress. You really can't mess this recipe up."

I left it in the brine for about 20 hours. I was afraid of a salty bird so I thoroughly rinsed it. The meat was tender and flavorful, the citrus was subtle but definitely detectable. My only issue with this process was the gravy made from the drippings was plenty salty. It was edible, but I wish I could have had less salt. I would try this again, making gravy without the pan drippings."

I'll never cook a turkey any other way!"

Use sea salt or Himalayan or other good salt for a nice subtle and more flavorful brine that lets the citrus shine through. I also thought more citrus was needed and ended up adding a can of orange juice concentrate to be able to even taste the citrus."

The results were fantastic, and three days later the left overs are still magnificent and moist. I will be using this brine again. Christmas is coming. My oven is small, so I had to cook two turkeys, one on Saturday, and one on Sunday. Not a lot of left overs. Next time, I might try the brine without apple juice, just to taste the difference. This is so much better than the brine recipe I had been using. I did use 3/4 cups of salt instead of 1 cup. Maybe I will try 1/2 cup next time as my oven will only hold up to a 9 or so Kg. bird at a time. I hate my oven, but it came built into the house. do try this great recipe. I love it. Even Mr. Cranky Pants liked the results."

I make the brine the day before and simmer for 1 hour then cool till it is cool. Do not place the turkey in a warm brind. Place bird and brine in a large bucket adding water if necessary to cover entire bird and let sit for minimum 24 hours. Keep in a cool place, sometimes there isn't room in my refrigerator so I keep it on the cold garage floor. I add a tray of ice cubes every few hours to make sure it stays cold. Rinse bird really well. Those who say it's too salty don't rinse the bird enough. Enjoy and thanks for posting this recipe it's a holiday tradition in our house!"

"reviewBody": "I have always used Alton Brown's Salt Brine recipe and thought I would try this one. I really liked the moistness and flavor. I used a 5 gallon bucket from the hardware store that was doubled lined with two garbage bags. I used the recipe rather closely but added sliced candied ginger. For the liquid I used 8 cups of water and 2 quarts of orange juice. Then to make sure the entire bird was cover, I topped it off with water. The turkey brined for almost 24 hours then I removed the liquid, wrapped up the bird in the garbage bag and store it in the refrigerator for 12 hours. To roast I added to the cavity, two quartered small oranges, a quartered lemon, fresh parsley and thyme. It was delicious!"

If you follow this recipe and the perfect turkey recipe this Thanksgiving/Christmas, your nieces and nephews will ask \"Are you making the turkey next year?\" Great brine."

Then I add ice to the mixture. I keep an ice chest that is only used for brining and use disinfectant ( white vinegar usually) to clean it out. Add 10 pounds of ice, add the warm/hot brine mixture, add Turkey, add more ice/water as needed to make sure the Turkey is covered. Place something heavy over the top of the Turkey to keep it submerged. Add ice as needed. I normally brine for at least one day but sometimes two. SO good."

"reviewBody": "It was my first time ever cooking a turkey (19lbs)—let alone brining one and I did it using an electric roaster! Talk about audacity! I followed the recipe to the letter, had sensational results and more giblet gravy(another first for me) than we needed. The turkey was juicy and aromatic. There wasn't enough. It was picked to the bone. Thanks for the recipe! \n\nI found this cooking method for the roaster (no water is needed):\n1. Cook turkey at the highest temp of your roaster (ours is 450 degrees) for 30 minutes\n2. Reduce to 325 degrees for the rest of the time.\n3. DO NOT OPEN THE LID AT ANY TIME!! The bird will self-baste. You must have faith! :)\n\nCooking times (including steps 1 &amp; 2): \n8-12lbs 2h 45m - 3h; \n12-14lbs 3h - 3h 45min; \n14-18lbs 3h 45m - 4h 15m; \n18-20lbs 4h 15m - 4h 30m; \n\nIf you are stuffing your bird add about 15-30m to the above times. A brined bird really protects against drying out your meat."

So, having a bright idea, I called the folks at Butterball and they confirmed my idea. If you want to brine your turkey, and find the one you purchased already has added basting to it, simply don't add salt to your brine. So, my brine will consist of apples and juice, oranges and juice, lemons and juice, vegetable broth, garlic, rosemary, thyme, sage, summer savory and onions. NO SALT. They said at Butterball that I could still brine my turkey as long as I cut down on the salt I used in it. I will also, when I roast the bird, stuff it with apples, oranges, lemans, celery, garlic and the herbs inside the cavity as well as a butter of butter, savory, sage, thyme, garlic and Rosemary put under the skin. I will let everyone know how it turns out."

I think a huge part of that success is that I drain the turkey from the brine and stuff with new wedges of oranges, lemons, onions and add celery. I grill our turkey on a gas grill (turkey is placed in a conventional roasting pan with a rack/cooking grate) at 350 degrees and amazingly I don't have to baste but once and this turkey cooks far faster than an oven. For those who feel the recipe doesn't work - don't use a frozen turkey, always use fresh ingredients (including thyme), and keep it refrigerated, not cool, but cold. I have looked for alternative recipes and this one just beats them all."

"reviewBody": "This was the first time I have ever had a brined turkey and I have to say the juice just poured out of it like never before. I do not particularly like turkey, but I always cook a 20 to 24 pound bird for Thanksgiving. I did not rub salt on the bird first, but put all of the dry ingredients in a sauce pan with about one quart of water. I dissolved the salt in the water over medium heat. I then transferred the mixture to a large stainless bowl, added ice, water, the sliced fruit, onion, and garlic. I put my turkey in two Reynolds oven bags (I doubled them to prevent leaking). Then I placed the turkey in a large party ice bucket, poured the cold brine into the bags, removed the air and double tied it before putting it in my fridge for 36 hours. Thanksgiving morning I took the bird out three hours before it was to go into the oven, rinsed it thoroughly, dried, and stuffed with dressing. The turkey roasted for five hours and I let it rest for 30 minutes before carving. I did not baste the turkey at all and the pan drippings yielded one quart with the fat removed. I made my gravy from the pan drippings and neck meat. The most important thing about the gravy – do NOT season before tasting it. Mine had the maximum amount of salt in it to still be OK. If I had added salt to the gravy, it might have been inedible due to the salt coming out of the turkey from the brining. I found the meat to be flavorful and moist, and not salty tasting since I used an unbasted store bought turkey."
