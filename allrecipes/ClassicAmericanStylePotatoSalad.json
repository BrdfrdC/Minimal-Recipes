I only had one tiny piece of sweet pickle in a jar, so after the potatoes were done, drained them, then in the pan I poured the sweet pickle juice onto the potatoes and let them soak that up for a few minutes before adding them to the other ingredients. WORKED like a charm - gave the salad that sweet pickle touch &amp; I used red onion because that is all I had. Otherwise followed the recipe for everything else."

All celery salt is too much, but that hit at the end worked."

I used russet potatoes because my neighbor gave me about 20 lbs of them I must use up, and I did add a little pickle juice as well as switch the dijon for good ol' yella mustard. I ate two bowls of it before dinner was even ready. It was amazeballs."

I am known for making good potato salad and have a special-private version that is often requested. I wanted something different so decided to take a walk on the wild side and settled on this. Wow!!! It was delicious. I did make some changes but I don't think anything that drastically altered the outcome. I left skins on red potatoes. Used rice vinegar instead of red wine. Replaced relish with finely diced bread &amp; butter pickles. Dried parsley instead of fresh. When I first tasted it (right after final mix) I did not like it and thought oh boy what did I do. But after refrigerating and letting everything meld together things only got delicious from there. Do make this....you will not regret it. Excellent!!!!"

I agree with another critic - I tasted it right after putting it together and didn't think I liked it very much. But after chilling for several hours, it was great. I pretty much stuck with the recipe as written except I didn't measure veggie ingredients exactly (celery, pickles, scallions) and probably added a little more than called for. I would give even more stars if I could!\nUpdate - I made this again - used 1/2 of a white onion chopped instead of scallions and more salt (personal taste)- also used 2/3 cup of Hellmann's Lite Mayo instead of regular mayo. It was still great and reduced calories a bit."

I overcooked the potatoes slightly, I might have have got the wrong parsly I got the kind they us as a garnish. I couldn't find scallions at the store, some one told me ther were green onions. I think it turned out pretty good."

"reviewBody": "Truly a classic. Used small red potatoes, cut before cooking. Used white vinegar in the water resulting in nicely firm (but not hard) pieces. Used Duke's mayo (a southern brand) which is a bit tangier than Hellman's. Mixed all the dressing ingredients separately, substituting olive oil for milk. Then dressed the salad. Skipped the pickles. INCREDIBLE. Thank you for the post."

This time I went hunting for the perfect potato salad for his less adventurous tastes and found it. It's good, easy to make, and although nothing fabulous, it certainly deserves the name \"classic.\""

"reviewBody": "I just made this; exactly as written, except I used dried parsley and Vidalia onions. This has a nice tang to it. It does taste like classic salad that you might get in the deli but, of course, with a homemade boost. I would have liked my potatoes a little softer but I always prefer to err on the side of a little firmer over mushed potatoes. It is very tasty while still a little warm. I will serve it to hubby later and heâs going to love this one. He likes these mustard pickle type potato salads. I always made my potatoes for salad by boiling the cubes I had pre-cut and have never been thrilled at my results. I thought it kind of sped things up but it doesnât really. Maybe cutting them up first boils some of the flavor out of them. There is something different about the taste of the whole boiled potatoes cut up and mixed with the mayonnaise while still warm."

"reviewBody": "perfect! This is truly a classic potato salad with the perfect blend of ingredients. Only changes were red onion instead of green out of necessity and I like color. I only had apple cider vinegar and used that instead. An old Sara Molton trick (Sara's secrets Food Network) is to immediately put the vinegar on the potatoes when they are hot and they absorb the flavor. I halved the recipe because I was afraid I would go hog wild. I found the amt. of mayo almost perfect. I added just a dollop of f.f. yogurt for a bit of tang and not add extra fat. My potatoes were red butter potatoes and they were perfect in this. Lovely recipe. I like this and the \"summer potato salad\" recipe from this site. Thanks for the perfect recipe."
