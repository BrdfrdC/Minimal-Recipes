First recommendation is to cook the üçë peaches. I used two cans instead of 1, plus one can of water. Add the sugar, the water, nutmeg, and butter to a medium sauce pan. I cut the sugar by about 1/4 cup. Cook the peaches for about 20 minutes or until the peaches become tender."

"reviewBody": "I made this tonite and it was delicious! I did make a couple of exchanges of ingredients. I was out of milk but had an opened can of coconut milk which had about 6 1/2 oz. left in it. I put that into a measuring cup and added enough 7-up to make a full cup. I did not put in the nutmeg. Many years ago when I was young and had my first blender I made a peach milkshake and it was disappointingly bland. Later I read that a bit of almond extract was required to make the flavor pop. I did that the next time and it was terrific. So instead of nutmeg I put a teaspoon of almond extract in the peach and sugar mixture. If I had been using canned peaches I would have probably cut the sugar in half but I was using frozen so decided to use the whole cup. I used a 9 x 9 Corning Ware dish which was a perfect fit. I would be proud to serve this at any function. Thanks for posting such an \nEZ and delicious recipe!"

I poured this mixture on top of the batter in the pie pan and baked at 375 for 15 minutes. Remove from oven and top with:\nAbout 3 cups fresh, peeled and sliced yellow peaches, 1/2t cinnamon 1/2 cup brown sugar and a handful of huckleberries.\nReturn to oven for 20 minutes. Remove and cool. The bisquick crust is like shortbread and combined with the cheesecake filling it is amazing!"

It had just cooled for a few hours....suspense as a brave friend served herself a piece and topped it with whipped cream. She was delighted! Even the nutmeg cautious enjoyed a piece! Glad I made it! Served fresh was great, but after a day, liquid from peaches made for soggy cake-so only 4stars. Advise eating same day!"

"reviewBody": "If you don't like nutmeg, cut it by half and use that half as cinnamon. Put a couple drops of vanilla in and use 1 cup of cane sugar. Cane sugar is sweet, but not as sweet as regular white sugar. Make sure you drain the peaches thoroughly or it will turn out soggy.\n\nI also put organic vanilla in with the peaches. I made this for Thanksgiving and It was very good. I doubled everything in the recipe to have plenty. Turned out perfect. The key to baking it is to first put it on the bottom rack towards the burners for about 30 minutes. Then put it on the top rack for about 20-25 minutes until it's a golden brown color or light brown."

Added nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla to the Bisquick and milk. Served it with vanilla bean ice cream. Huge hit. Lots of great flavour. Will make again! Thank you!"
