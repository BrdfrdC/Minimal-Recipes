I put the blueberries in a little of the flower mixture so they would not settle and increased the baking time to 18 minutes because of the addition. Also, I put the batter in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to an hour before baking. This increases their moistness."

I did not alter the recipe however I added a heaping dallop of the following mixture - 1/4 c each butter (softened), brown sugar, white sugar and 2 1/2 TBSP honey to each bottom and topped with pecans then filled each tin about 3/4 full of batter. Baking time took 15 minutes. Once out of the oven I spread the remaining butter mixture on the top of each, loosened from pan, then inverted onto the cooling rack. So delicious!"

I sprinkled some vanilla sugar over the dates to prevent them from clumping and sinking. I baked them 20 minutes; 15 not enough. Result very good but a bit too sweet. Next time will reduce brown sugar to 1/3 cup."

"reviewBody": "Didn't know what wheat bran was, so I just used All Bran cereal. After reading other reviews, I tried adding a sprinkle of cinnamon, used unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil and used 1/2 molasses and 1/2 brown sugar. I made a double batch, and realized after baking them that I didn't double the molasses and brown sugar, but I liked them the way they came out! They were moist, flavorful and the raisins gave them plenty of sweetness. They don't rise very much so you dont need to worry about them overflowing the pans. Mine were done in 15 min. Easy to make and easy to clean up!"

"reviewBody": "Great muffins! Here are a few tips for bakery style tall domed muffins. I ended up using more milk because the bran was completely dry after mixing in the buttermilk, I probably added about 1/2 cup more milk and let it soak as instructed. I upped the vanilla to one teaspoon. And folded in dried cranberries, do not over-mix! Muffins are meant to be mixed until all the flour is JUST incorporated. I preheated the oven to 425F baked them on the middle rack for 10 minutes, dropped the temperature to 375F for an additional 7 minutes and checked with a toothpick and they were done! Time will vary on your oven but in general always start the temp at 425F for proper oven spring and high dome muffins. Happy baking!"

I like my most recent batch, I used pure pumpkin in place of the oil but I did 2/3 cup (on accident), but they turned out so delicious! I chop up some prunes instead of raisins, I add at least a cup of walnuts, I add whole flax seed and wheat bran, plus pumpkin pie spice and lots of cinnamon. I know this might seem like a lot of changes, but it's not because the original recipe is not already amazing! It just suites my needs and I'm so grateful because I never would have come up with the perfect muffin for me without it!! Thank you Janet!"
