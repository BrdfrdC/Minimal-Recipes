"reviewBody": "As others have stated this isn't a classic Italian Carbonara so if that's what you're expecting then this isn't what you're looking for. This is more of an Alfredo sauce than a Carbonara so keep that in mind but regardless of what you want to call it the sauce is great and this is a pretty quick and easy meal. For a richer texture I suggest cutting back on the egg whites. One or two will suffice and be sure to beat your eggs like they owe you money because you want those whites well incorporated. Also, many people have complained about ending up with scrambled eggs which is why I don't really agree with the instructions given in the recipe as there are better ways of doing this. The quick and dirty method would be to boil and drain your pasta, kill the heat and toss the pasta and your sauce into the still hot pot and mix. If the pasta isn't rinsed the starch from your pasta will help to thicken the sauce. If your pot is too hot though you still run the risk of ending up with scrambled eggs so keep that in mind. A more fullproof method and the method I use for any egg or cream sauce is to treat this like you're making a Bearnaise sauce instead of tossing it in a skillet over low heat toss your sauce into an all metal bowl and put it over the water that you used to boil your pasta basically creating a double boiler as it allows better temperature control and prevents you from scorching your sauce to the bottom of the pan so your sauces will finish rich and creamy instead of overcooked and clumpy."

Only used half a cup of the pine nuts - -next time may even use less. \nI did not put in salt until the very end after I tasted it all together - -didnt need that much as all. \nonly had half a cup of Parm cheese so I shredded some white cheddar for the other half of a cup and still came out great!! You really need to watch the heat when combining like others have said, - don't leave it alone, slowly stir to make sure you don't get scramble eggs! the minute I thought it was sticking to the side of the pan I just pulled it off the heat and continued to stir. ALSO Its very filling!"

Thanks again for your recipe."

The Real Carbonara is simply 1 whole egg gently beat and added to that 24-36 month aged parmagiano-reggiano until you acheive a thick consistency or how you prefer with a pinch of salt and a twist of fresh ground pepper and of course the smoked pancetta not cooked till its crisp.Then add to that your preffered pasta . We use Tagliatelle egg pasta. This is a true recipe from Parma, Italy. But I am sure the other is nice too but is not an original."

Should have used a large onion instead of small. The thing i liked most about this is that there was just the right amount of sauce. I was worried that it would be too little but it turned out just right. The night I made it, it seemed a little bland, but when I brought it for lunch the next day, the flavors had had a chance to really meld so it was much tastier."

The only changes I made were fyring the pancetta first and then cooking 1/2 an onion, 1 large shallot and 2 cloves of garlic in the drippings. And I omitted the pine nuts just because I don't like nuts in savory-type foods and the salt, as pancetta and parmesan are salty enough already. Thanks KMOMMYZ... good stuff :)"
