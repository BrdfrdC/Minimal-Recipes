My 7 year old will even eat it for breakfast the next day if I let him! The only differences to the original recipe I make is, I double the sauce, add some seasoned salt to the flower mixture, pound out the chicken until thin, and instead of folding the chicken over once stuffed, I roll it up. I also recommend using a thin sliced Swiss cheese as its makes for just the right ratio of cheese to ham, in my opinion. You have to try this one!"

A few pointers: make sure you use a non-stick pan that is big enough to move the chicken around a bit when it is cooking. Also, it is a good idea to put the same amount of toothpicks in each piece even if some pieces don't need them. That way you know how many to look for. Don't change a thing, it is perfect!!\nI served it with roasted carrots lightly tossed in olive oil with some seasoning and a few fresh herbs. Great combo!"

It turned out amazing, as always, just slightly different than normal. The sauce is to die for!"

"reviewBody": "Perfection! I modified this several ways, and it came out fantastic! First, I rolled the chicken, ham and cheese in Saran Wrap and put int the refrigerator for 30 minutes. That helps to hold the shape well before dipping into the flour mixture. Next, I added about 1/4 C plain bread crumbs to the flour, paprika and bouillon mixture for texture. I put 1 tablespoon of butter cut in even, small pieces in a baking dish, then added the white wine enough to cover the bottom. I put the chicken on top of that, then added 1 additional tablespoon of small pieces of butter on top. I cooked covered with foil for 30 minutes at 350 F, then uncovered, sprinkled lightly with grated Parmesan cheese and cooked uncovered another 20 minutes. I made a b√©arnaise sauce and covered with that for serving. Turned out to be the best we have ever had!"

We finished them in the oven in a uncovered casserole, 350 degrees for 30 minutes. We used a Sauvignon Blanc whine to make the sauce in the drippings and doubled the sauce recipe."
