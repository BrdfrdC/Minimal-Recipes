"reviewBody": "Great recipe and delicious. I made a few changes after reading some of the bland reviews. Started by adding a 1/4 c. olive oil to the chicken saute. Added 1/2 tsp each of oregano, basil, Italian seasoning, and parsley to the vegetable/chicken mix (along with 1 tsp. of garlic salt). Also immediately added all vegetables to the saute, put it on low heat to allow it to steam/simmer. For the sauce, I added 1/3 c. of additional chicken broth and about 1/4 c. additional half and half. Finally, after mixing all ingredients, I added 1/4 melted butter mixed with 1 c. bread crumbs and sprinkled over the top after placing the entire mix into a 7x11 casserole dish. Added the recommended Parmesan cheese sprinkled over the top and put in the oven for 20 mins at 400 degrees. I thought it might be too much seasoning but turned out pretty tasty. Definitely going to make it again. I have a 5 and 7 year old who also loved it, so that's a plus."

I get that it's based on a roux, but for this, I'd cut flour in half.\nAlso, I substituted kefir for half and half. It turned out so well! So pleased. My fiancé was raving about it.\nAlso, used fresh tuna instead of chicken. Really really good dish."

Modifications: 1) Pounded one whole chicken breast and cut into strips; 2) added 2 cloves chopped fresh garlic the last minute of saute on the vegetables; 3) used egg noodles instead of spaghetti noodles; 4) added 1/2 cup frozen peas for the last 10 minutes of cooking for color/flavor. Will likely make again, and use 3 cloves garlic, maybe add a little white wine for another taste dimension. Dish is similar to beef stroganoff."

I seasoned the chicken and mushrooms with some fresh garlic, tony's seasoning, and a bit more black pepper than it called for. I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. My fam and I were disapointed..we work hard to have a healthy diet and this recipe was a bit of a splurge for us (butter, 1/2 and 1/2, large amounts of cheese) honestly it just wasn't that good. We felt like we would have enjoyed our meal more if we had just sat down on the carpet with a cheesecake and a couple of forks. Try it you want but go for a run afterward if you can move."

Not only was it quicker to prepare (no oven cook time) than my normal chicken tetrazzini (Betty Crocker pasta cookbook), but it was also more flavorful with the peppers, fresh mushrooms (instead of canned), garlic, and swiss cheese. I also \"dressed it up\" even more by cooking the chicken in a few T. of Kraft Zesty Italian Dressing, adding about 1/2 c. chopped onion and 1 minced clove of garlic with the veggies, and using a whole cup of Swiss. I used milk instead of half and half, and served it over wholewheat spaghetti. From now on, this will be my regular chicken tetrazzini!"

Mostly because I didnt want to cook again for a couple nights. Because we like veggies at my house, I added sauteed celery, about a cup of finely sliced baby carrots (they needed using up), and about 1 cup of small brocolli florets (also cuz they needed using). So with all those goodies added to the mix, I basically made about 2.5 times the sauce. Baked all in the oven for ab out an hour with crushed round crackers mixed with parm on top. Got raves from hubby and even the teens. This made enough for a 9x13 pan to bake last night and also a smaller 8x8 pan (uncooked) for the freezer and some night when I need the kids to stick something in the oven for me. Have added this one to my box and will try with leftover chicken another time too. Did I add the sauce is the best? One of my kids licked the spoon after I poured it over the pasta mix."

Will definitely make this again."

I also think that a pasta dish doesn't need this much flour in the sauce, it was a little too much and the cheeses would have thickened it well enough. I recommend using more spices like garlic and perhaps a little mustard too, to make it more flavourful."
