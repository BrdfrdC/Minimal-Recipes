I did not add the salt with the yeast because I’ve always heard that salt kills yeast. So I mixed it into the milk, water mixture. Mixed the dry ingredients and then added in the wet. They turned out delicious and super easy considering the low rise time, 10 mins and then 30 which isn’t bad compared to other recipes. I’ll definitely be using this recipe from now on."

I warm the milk, butter, sugar and salt until the butter melts and then proof the yeast in 1/4 cup of warm water with about 1/2 tsp. of sugar and then add to the warm milk mixture and then add flour as needed and knead by hand. I let it rise for one hour, form into balls (after weighing them) and let them rise for one more hour. For those that are saying they are getting biscuits or hockey pucks, maybe check that your yeast is not too old?"

"reviewBody": "Amazing!! I used heavy cream and almond milk combined in place of the milk. Used a full stick of butter with the end like a paintbrush to slather on butter straight out of the oven. This softened the brown tops and made them SO GOOD. I also doubled the recipe and weight out 3.2 ounce balls of dough that I formed by gathering the edges into a pinched fold underneath, for a smooth round top. They were big! I used bread flour instead of AP. Mixed it up in my kitchenaid but kneaded by hand also until I was satisfied... I also accidently overproofed them for the last rise but they are very forgiving and turned out so well. It's a staple recipe now!"

"reviewBody": "I've made this recipe four times which resulted in varying level of mediocrity. \n\nMy problem with this recipe is that it calls for all purpose flour, which makes the rolls have a taste and texture that is more similar to biscuits than it is to bread, but not as good. Looking through the photos, you can easily identify those who used bread flour and those who used all purpose flour.\n\nMy recommendation is to substitute bread flour for all purpose flour, but if you don't have bread flour, just make biscuits instead. It's much faster and easier and the biscuits will taste much better."

Let the rolls proof for 45 minutes to 1 hour after dividing. I've found that dividing into 8 rolls makes a nice size and fits really well in my cake tin. My wife really loves it and it gets me off the hook for forgetting chores"

Only variation is I proof the yeast a 5 or so minutes before adding the flour (to proof add the milk water and butter to the yeast and whisk it a bit). It should get a little bubbly and have that nice yeasty smell. If not your yeast may be a little old."

What I did was heat on the stove to \"scald\" the milk and then remove and let sit for several minutes until it just felt warm. That worked perfectly for me. \n\nI wound up kneading for about 10 minutes to be sure the dough was worked properly. And then I let sit 10 minutes, then hand rolled it to 12\" uniform, and cut 12 one-inch pieces, then rolled to let rise and bake. \n\nI will definitely make these again! Highly recommend giving this recipe a try!"

I also gently shaped it into a log and then cut with a bench scraper and then into a ball shape and brushed with butter."

This temperature can start to kill the yeast, so be sure to immediately mix everything as soon as the liquid is added; this will minimize the amount of time it's in direct contact with the yeast. Also, be sure to not overheat the fluid, as that will DEFINITELY kill stuff. I was able to make these without too much trouble. fast and easy, although the recipe is slightly \"delicate\"..."

The only reason I don't make them more often is that they are highly addictive! However, there's definitely a bit of technique to it that the recipe doesn't necessarily impart, as I found out one Thanksgiving when I was recovering from surgery and my husband decided to take over baking the rolls. I'm not sure what he did differently (my guess is something to do with the speeds on the stand mixer) but they didn't rise as well for him."
