I did add diced green peppers to add a bit of texture. Everyone thought it was good, but not \"great\", so I'm not sure if I'll bother making it again or not. It's definitely hearty and great for busy, cold weekdays."

I would highly recommend ground turkey instead (it's healthier and not as fatty), more italian seasoning, and adding a green pepper (and mushrooms if you have them). I try to use beef or chicken broth instead of water. It makes plenty of leftovers that are easy to heat up at work."

I only used 1 lb of burger as well, I am not a huge meat eater. End results came out perfect. The noodles were not overcooked and the taste was good. My husband enjoyed it and added jalapenos and shredded mozzarella. I just wish it was a little sweeter. I usually use tomato soup, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper for my seasoning and sauce, or occasionally tomato juice."

"reviewBody": "We liked this pretty well! The only thing I would change is that next time I would cut the amount of salt down to 1 1/2 teaspoons and I would whirl the diced tomatoes in the food processor for a few seconds to break them up a little bit. My husband doesn't like big chunks of tomato (picky guy that he is). Also, I wouldn't forget to add the minced garlic. D'oh! \n\nThis recipe reminds me of the goulash that my mother used to make for us when I was growing up (I'm 61 years old now). Good memories!"

I also left out the bay leaves because my husband doesn’t like them. The next time I make this I would use half as much Italian seasoning as it calls for because the seasoning was a little overwhelming. You definitely want to add at least some salt to the dish to reduce acidity."

Also used whole wheat macaroni and subbed Worscestershire sauce (I didn't realize I was out of soy sauce until already being made). Forgiving recipe that you can easily tweak. Will make again, just not on a regular basis."

Well let me tell you folks if I could have had a real 5 star review I’d have given it a Big Fat 0! I followed the recipe to the T and it was the most bland disgusting goulash I’ve ever tasted I wouldn’t even feed this to my kids without adding brown sugar and ketchup just to make it edible, pretty sad when I doubt I’ll ever try to think out of the box ever again trying to make goulash besides the basic which the basic would have been gourmet over this."
