"reviewBody": "I’ve used this glaze twice now, once to style up basic grilled pork chops and the other time on grilled fresh pineapple slices. Between the sugar and the honey, I knew it would be a bit too sweet for us. I did give it a pretty healthy squeeze of fresh lemon juice which toned down the sweetness, but that’s personal taste kicking in. Worked out well on both dishes, and I feel certain it'd be a winner for glazed ham."

"reviewBody": "I did not like this recipe. Aside from the lack of instructions, I did not like the taste. The honey flavor was overpowering. Maybe some spices would have helped. I mixed the ingredients, then poured it over the ham. It was runny and didn't stick to it. I baked the ham an additional 15 minutes with the glaze and it all pooled in the bottom of the pan. I had to pour it on the ham like gravy. (which I later regretted when i tasted it) I feel like I should have cooked the glaze in a sauce pan to thicken it first, but that wasn't mentioned in the directions. Safe to say, I will not be making it again."

Everyone in my family complimented how great the ham was multiple times... Even the very picky eaters that seem to always find something to complain about. My son said it looked like food you would see on a tv commercial it looked so good, lol. Very easy. very good. Will definetly make again and would recommend to everyone."

It took some time but well worth it. Honey baked Ham has nothing on this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I hate ham, but my mother-in-law ordered me to make one for Easter dinner (we had it a day early this year). I bought a Costco pre-cooked and pre-sliced ham and used this glaze instead of the one that came in the package with the ham. I made extra glaze and was very, very generous with the glaze when cooking, and also put some out on the table so people could put extra glaze on their ham, if desired (I can only tolerate ham when it has tons of yummy glaze to cover up the hammy taste). OMG -- the ham was DELICIOUS. Everyone commented about how good it was, and my husband said it was better than Honey Baked Ham. This is my new favorite main course to serve when entertaining since it is so darn easy and stress-free."
