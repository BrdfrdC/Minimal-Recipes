The same result can obtained with unsalted butter plus a few drops of oil which would raise the cooking temperature without without burning the potatoes. Of course, each stove is different and you may have to adjust the temperature based on the type of pan you are using."

After the 5 minutes, mixed it about and patted down again, this ensured even cooking."

I did add some shredded onion to the mix and next time I'll add a garlic powder. ( not fresh garlic since it'd burn in the pan). I did use a cast-iron skillet and it browned up nicely. Instead of 10 minutes, I went almost 20. Not crazy crispy but just enough so they weren't mushy. Thanks again for another spectacular simple recipe."

After soaking potatoes and drying them out, I put them in a large bowl as loosely as possible, and microwaved for 1 minute, twice (with a minute in between) to evaporate more of the moisture. I then added all of my seasonings and mixed before cooking in my cast iron skillet."

"reviewBody": "Instead of the butter I used canola oil. I also was admittedly a little heavy handed with the cayenne, but it works! Kicked them up a notch ?? I didn‚Äôt have regular paprika so I used smoked paprika and it added a nice smokiness to them. Instead of one big batch I made a few servings, kinda like pancakes, and each turned out nice and crunchy. \n\nHaving a shredding attachment for a mixer or food processor will make this easier for sure! That‚Äôs said, pressing out the water was the hardest part for me. Instead of using paper towels, I used a kitchen towel to dry the shredded potatoes in batches. Not only does it cut down on single use paper products but it‚Äôs easier to ‚Äòwring out‚Äô the extra moisture. \n\nI love that there isn‚Äôt any filler or binding agent and I‚Äôll make these again, hopefully soon!"

Of course it will be accompanied with wonderful tasting hash browns!"

But even then they are very good, just a little less crisp then when using the amounts that the recipe calls for."

All three of these things made prep for this a breeze!! I'd never thought of using clarified butter for this but oh my gosh was it delicious! I made my own by heating a stick of butter and carefully removing the solids on top with a spoon. I saved them and put them over the eggs I served with the hash browns. Yum!!"

I added fresh chopped chives during the last couple of minutes of cooking for extra flavor. So much better than frozen hash browns!"
