"reviewBody": "Very good recipe. It came out very velvety buttery smooth. Only change i made was using 1 3/4c heavy cream and 1/4c of skim, bc thats what i have normally in the fridge. And i didn't strain the cream, so i could keep the vanilla bean particles in the cream mixture. Otherwise followed everything exactly. For me, it only filled 6 ramikins about 1/4\" to the top. Will definitely be making this again!!"

"reviewBody": "Although the taste was good I have two issues with this recipe, or perhaps my interpretation of it. By whisking as it says to do you create a lot of bubbles. I read somewhere else using a spatula instead gets rid of the bubbles. My bigger problem though was I could not get the creme to set, they came out rather runny. Thoughts?"

"reviewBody": "These came out great in terms of flavor and texture, a bit too sweet for my taste but that could easily be adjusted. The only thing I did differently was add a folded tea towel to the bottom of the roasting pan, lay the ramekins on it and then fill up with hot water. The towel keeps the ramekins from sliding around and adds and extra layer of insulation for gentle cooking."
