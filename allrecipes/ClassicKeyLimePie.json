A great way to grab and go to put in your lunch or take on picnics. Also great for parties too. When I use this recipe I add 1/3 cup more lime juice. I also hand squeeze my limes and I also leave the pulp in mine. WOW what an amazing flavor. I love the fact its four ingredients and that's it. So easy and simple. My husband says, there is no Key Lime Pie out there that can compare to mine. :)"

"reviewBody": "I've been baking this pie for years. Never had added sour cream, but my recipe did call for egg. I tried this recipe with the sour cream and it was delicious. I used the bottled key lime juice because the store limes are about the size of cherries.\nIt works very well with the bottled juice. By the way, the 8-10 minute bake time is correct. It does not have to be bubbling on top. It will gel up very well when refrigerated. As one baker stated, she placed left-over filling in the frig, unbaked, and it\nwas perfect. I believe the 10 min. baking time was because of the raw egg in my recipe. Also please purchase a zester. My best cooking implement."

Desserts are a treat to be savored over time, and not necessarily shared. Saying that, I can't wait to serve this to special friends. I did follow the recipe exactly, except I used a gluten free graham cracker crust since I am celiac. I also used the whip cream on top of each cut piece rather than on top of the whole pie. I think the pie will last a bit longer, since only the two of us will be eating it. I have a whipper too, so the whipped cream stays fresh over several weeks."

When you take your first bite, you're doing the happy dance. \n\nWhen it came to the baking time for the whole pie itself, I'm not sure if the time in the instruction is correct. It said 7-10 to minutes, or when you see tiny bubbles. The pie was in the oven for about a 1/2 hour until I saw the tiny bubbles.\nSo keep in mind, the pie might be baking longer depending on your oven."

Using key limes though they're tedious to juice makes all the difference in the taste. I also sprinkled a bit of zest on top of the fresh whipped cream. Looking forward to making this again....our next family dinner"

Rather than trying to squeeze out 2/3 cup of juice out of those tiny key limes, I bought a bottle of the 100% key lime juice and I also used a Keebler graham cracker crust. Those two shortcuts made preparation a breeze without sacrificing flavor or quality."

Also, if you're making the crust, use about 1 1/2 packages (there are 3 to each box!) of graham crackers and crumble them in a food processor.\n\nAddendum to the above comment:\n\nMy wife suggested that we lower the amount of sour cream just a little bit, and it worked wonders! It's not AS rich, and the short baking time worked just fine."

It was so easy to make and turned out fabulous! So creamy and sweet, but tart. Everyone in the family, kids included, loved it!! It is definitely something I'll make again!"

I cooked 20 mins waiting for the 'bubbles' to appear but didn't. So when I saw the edges cooking, I took them out of oven. I filled a shallow container with leftover filling, and wouldn't you know, it was a great, creamy consistency w/o any cooking! Next time I will just fill and chill overnight and NO cooking. It's summer, no need to bake bc it doesn't use eggs."
