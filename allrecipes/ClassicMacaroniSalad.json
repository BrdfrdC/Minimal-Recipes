"reviewBody": "As regards the sugar and salt: both are excellent flavour enhancers. The sugar called for here though, is desert-level madness! At just under half the called for amount, the sweetness will blend into the background. So 1/4 cup of sugar gets the job done and gets out of the way. 1/3 cup isn't a deal breaker, but anything more and you will be tempted to put whipped cream on it and serve it with tea. As for the salt, I'd recommend starting at 1 tsp. Unlike the sugar, you can always add a little more salt after the salad has cured overnight. And about that overnight cure... it really isn't optional. This is one of those dishes that is completely different after it has rested. I give 1 star ratings wherever the basics are wrong, but as others have noted, once you correct course this recipe is a great starting place to feature whatever fresh herbs/veggies are growing around you."

"reviewBody": "Joined the Bereavement Committee at Church and was immediately drafted into food prep. Made this recipe and it very popular. Based on the reviews I read I cut back on the sugar but I've made it 3 times now and each time I keep increasing the sugar a little. Currently at 3 tablespoons, but still may increase it next time. There is a perfect blend between the vinegar and the sugar. I'm going to find it! After a funeral Mass we have a buffet out for the family and friends of the deceased. We are privileged to offer them some comfort in our cooking and baking. This salad was such a winner that it was requested I do this dish again. Thank you allrecipes!"

I would recommend cutting the sugar in half or adding a tablespoon at a time and tasting it because I found the finished product to be way too sweet. If you run into the same problem I did, I ended up squeezing a fresh lime into it and adding more mayo and mustard to cut the sweetness. I also added two chopped hard boiled eggs to cut the sweetness."

And I did not have the pimentos so I added chopped green olives with pimentos and a little bit of the brine! Definitely cut the sweet. And I used red &amp; orange peppers - again - for flavor, crunch AND visual. A great addition! Need to go back and look at my pasta box! I used a whole box and I think I should measure 4 cups - wanted a little more sauce. Will make again!"

"reviewBody": "My experience with this recipe was good although I had to make changes. I didn't need so much, so I halved the recipe. Also, I would never put that much sugar into food that's normally savory. With the recipe halved, I only put in one tablespoon sugar, and then, after tasting at the end, about another two tablespoons (otherwise too vinegary for my taste). I didn't have pimentos, plus I forgot I'd just had to clean out my produce drawer, so I didn't even have celery or a carrot. I could only refrigerate the salad for about half an hour before we ate. Even with all these changes, the macaroni salad tasted great. My husband agreed."

I used 1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) and while it's delicious I think next time I'll only use 3 tablespoons sugar and adjust from there if needed. This is a great base recipe as you can really customize it to your liking. I added some capers for a little salty brininess and some chopped up sweet pickles. Also added some chopped hardboiled eggs and garlic powder and paprika. Didn't add the carrots or red peppers. DELICIOUS!"

I don't really like the idea of putting so much mustard so I only put 1/2 T plus 1tsp in mine. My guests asked for the recipe. This is a salad you want to make a day before so that the dressing is not so runny. Once it cools, it's creamy and delicious. Loved it--will make again and again."

No pimentos either because I don't like them. The rest of the recipe was exactly as written. We loved the flavor. I added extra veggies (peppers, celery, carrots) because I try to sneak in as many veggies as I can. I was concerned about the consistency of the sauce but we allowed it to refrigerate for four or five hours before eating and in that time it had thickened up considerably. This will be our new macaroni salad recipe. Thanks for sharing with us!"

I was afraid it would have too much onion, but it turned out just great. Needs a little more of the dressing, however, as it was a little drier than I prefer. Note to vegetarians: add little cubes of very firm tofu (pressed dry) and you have a main dish. The salad needs a full day to marinate."

First few rounds I stuck to the recipe exactly how it calls for. I really wouldn't do anything different except adding more carrots for the crunch. I used carrot chips. I added 3 heavy table spoons of roasted red peppers and it doesn't look noticeable so I may or may not add more in the future. Stick to the recipe exactly as it calls. I have gotten so many compliments and requests for it. STIR STIR STIR.. Stir it around after making and before serving. The macaroni absorbs the liquids so stir it. It will be perfection."

I also used only 1 Tbls. of mustard, and I only had one medium sized carrot, so I finely grated that. I didn’t have pimentos. Although I think that would have been good. It has a nice, tangy taste."

I use whipped dressing instead of mayo. Naturally I had to taste while still warm, it will be better once cooled and flavors blended. I omitted, well actually I forgot to add mustard. It depends on your taste. I don't think it needs mustard. I also omitted carrots, never had this recipe with carrots in it, so it did not appeal to me."

Added chopped shredded carrots, chopped celery and sliced black olives! Delicious! I doubled this recipe for a 4th of July BBQ. I used 1.5 boxes of elbow macaroni and doubled the sauce part. I only used 1/2 cup sugar total for the 2x recipe. I also added a little extra mayo and mustard, as it seemed a little vinegary to me. I didn't add the pimento peppers or green peppers. I used celery, green onions, sliced black olives and chopped shredded carrots. It was so freaking good! It tastes better if you make it the night before too."

Me and my family begrudingly ate it since we hate throwing away food. \nNo flavor to be had at all and definitely not a classic Macaroni salad. I should have known by the picture alone because the classic macaroni salad has much more liquid to it. This one is the most driest macaroni salad I've seen in all my life.\n\nGoing by other people's reviews, it seems like I made the right choice in reducing the flavor but I almost would have prefered to taste overpowering sweetness than a light vinagar paste."

I chose to grate all the veggies to add their flavor &amp; beautiful color without having the individual pieces outshine the deliciousness of the dressing. I also dissolved the sugar in the vinegar before incorporating into mayo mixture. I definitely recommend refrigerating for about 4 hours to allow all the flavors to come together. I added small cubes of cooked ham &amp; grated sharp cheddar bc that’s the type of mac salad I wanted. Greatly appreciate this recipe. Very versatile. My family throughly enjoyed."

The husband developed an allergy to eggs several years ago, and it's been kind of a pain in the neck. I really miss macaroni salad with eggs in it. Anyhow, I gave this one a try, using very large elbow macaroni, and it was pretty darn good. It's a sweeter one, as opposed to a savory salad, so it was a very good side to have with ham we had for dinner. I think it would be a good addition to any picnic table, cook out, or barbecue as the mild flavors would complement, and not detract from, the main course. I let it chill in the refrigerator for several hours, but am eager to see how it will taste tomorrow. I would make this again as I continue my search."
