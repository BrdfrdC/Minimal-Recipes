The sauce on top was a nice mixture and had a unique flavor, which we enjoyed. But if I took a bite of just the meat alone without the sauce, it was bland. I also had to cook it way less than what was suggested. I did like the addition of the chopped veggies though. I think I'll continue my quest for the perfect meatloaf."

No need for ketchup or milk to moisten the mixture. No packaged soup mixes. The veggies do the job, making the loaf moist and extremely flavorful. We don't care for a glazed meatloaf, so didn't make it. Deducted one star because the cooking time was wrong. Baked at 325 for 45 minutes, not more than 125 degrees, so switched to convection at 350 for an additional 20 mins. To sum up: Best. Meatloaf. Ever. (except for the cook time!)"

I also used approx. 1.75 lb. ground round and .5 lb of ground pork instead of all ground beef - this is just a personal preference of mine. I small diced all the vegetables which is quicker for me than using the food processor. I also felt the baking time was off as noted by others. I baked it at 350 for about 45-50 minutes. Took it out at 155 degrees and let it sit tented for about 5 minutes. It turned out great. This is a new favorite of ours."

I followed the recipe EXCEPT, after making a sort of puree of the veggies in my food processor, I added the egg, Worcestershire, herbs, salt, pepper and cayenne pepper and pulsed it a couple of additional times in order to make sure these ingredients would be well mixed throughout, too. I didn't see any \"downside\" to doing that.\n\nNext time, I'll add more onion (one whole medium onion), another tbsp or so of Worcestershire sauce and maybe some hot sauce to the blend of veggies in the food processor. \n\nIt would be just fine without the glaze which wasn't wonderful - I'll experiment with that next time.\n\nIt took quite a bit longer to cook than the recipe suggested."

"reviewBody": "Timing Issue: I made it exactly as it was in the video and instructions (NOT in a loaf pan) and the internal temperature after 40 minutes post-glaze was only 107. And that was with convection, which generally cooks faster. So the timing is WAY off. Perhaps it's my oven? Though I don't recall any other times when my oven cooked far too cool/slow, especially not a consistent problem. So either the time is way too short or the temperature is too low, or both. I cooked it an additional 15 minutes, then turned it up to 350 because that didn't do nearly enough and gave it another 27 minutes to reach 160. So overall, it took 1 hr and 37 minutes, mostly at 325 then at 350. There were several times that I took it out to test the temp, so that impacted it as well, but for most people, I'd say it's safe to just cook at 350 (from the start) for an hour post-glaze.\n\nLuckily I was just cooking for myself tonight, and not others! The timing would have been unfortunate.\n\nAside from the timing and temperature issue, the recipe tastes good. All of the best meatloaf recipes I've made have vegetable puree in them. It just takes the flavor to new levels somehow, and they are always so moist. The flavor in this one was good, but the moisture was not there. I mean, it wasn't super dry, but I think the long cooking time impacted the texture for sure. The glaze on this one is quite good--I like my meatloaf on the sweet side.\n\nSo this recipe lost a star for the super weird timing/temp, and another sta"

"reviewBody": "I’ve been making meatloaf for years but like to change it up occasionally. The flavor of this meatloaf was great. Mincing the veggies in a processor made a huge difference in the moistness of the meat. I made recipe as written. The cayenne definitely kicked it up a notch. I also put a shot of hot sauce into the glaze. The spiciness of the meatloaf may be a turn-off to kids. 4 stars because the cooking time was off. After cooking for 55 minutes at 325 meat temperature was 116. Turned oven up to 350 and cooked for another 1/2 hour which brought it up to 160."

I agree with others that the cooking time is hugely off. typically I cook a meatloaf at 400 deg for an hour and it's perfectly cooked through with a nice crust. I have one in the oven as I speak and have not varied the ingredients, but you can bet it will take longer than the recipe calls for. Otherwise, it's very delicious and moist."

I didn’t have any breadcrumbs or crackers, so I used some herb seasoned stuffing (Pepperidge Farm) and it was just fine. The sauce was easy to make and very tasty. This meatloaf is surprisingly low cal - the veggie filler again. Chef John’s mushroom gravy recipe with mashed potatoes was 5 stars. The only reason I didn’t give the meatloaf 5 stars was because the loaf pan was quite full of water - I suppose from all the veggies. I’ll use a bigger loaf pan next time so I can drain the water. Pure comfort food - and I will make it again!!"

"reviewBody": "I really enjoyed this recipe and I noted in the comments the disparity in estimated cooking time versus actual cook time. I did not have this problem but the shape of mine wasn't nearly as thick, only about as high as the width of my hand (basically child size fyi). I learned from my mother to always put an indent in the middle of meatloaf for more even cooking as well, that made a huge difference. The indent was roughly half an inch deep and ran down the middle, leaving the full height of loaf on the entire perimeter. I put the loaf in for the initial 15 minutes and then glazed it with equal parts, brown sugar, dijon, and chili sauce and only a tiny squirt of ketchup. The sweetness of ketchup can be overwhelming and the zing of chili sauce contrasted nicely with the sugar. It was only in the oven for another 20 minutes, 35 in total. I let it rest as I was finishing my potatoes and it was perfect. Juicy, and only the barest touch of pink in the thickest spots. Unfortunately no pictures, but the uncooked loaf was probably 7.5-8 inches wide and about two thirds the length of a 13x9 pan to give an idea of why my cook time was so limited. I will definitely be making this again in the future."
