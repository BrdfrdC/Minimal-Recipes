It took me a few times to get it perfect, best advise, go slow, even though it’s a quick recipe, I just give it time. I cooked the rice till it was done then added the sugar, the sugar seems to change the cook on the rice. I doubled it, but went down to just one egg, and put twoTBSP brown sugar &amp; two tbsp butter in with the egg. I wanted it more creamy, less custard’y, and I like sweet, but I also taste it to make sure it’s rite for me first."

When adding the egg/vanilla mixture you HAVE to stir it in quickly to turn it into a custard like consistency . This was the most delicious rice pudding I've ever had."

"reviewBody": "This rice pudding turned out with the rice still pretty hard and not pudding-like. I'm not sure where I went wrong with this recipe as I followed it to a T (except for the raisins because I don't care for them). In fact I cooked the rice for a little more than the recommended 6 minutes as I could tell it wasn't done. After I was done adding the egg, the rice still didn't look quite done but I thought it might soften up while it stood for 30 minutes - nope. When I came back after 30 minutes, the rice pudding had formed into a hard ball-like shape in the pot. To try to salvage it, I added another cup of milk and stirred, and more milk afterwards too. Still on the hunt for the perfect rice pudding recipe..."

You must add enough hot mixture to the eggs to bring them up in temp to add to the rest of the pudding or else the eggs cook! The instructions just say \"add a small amount of hot mixture\" and that just doesn't cut it. I would like to spare someone else from the same mistake if possible. I also added a little extra sugar and no raisins and it is amazing. I've made it every day for a week now."

"reviewBody": "This is so good! I have been trying for years to find a recipe that tastes like the rice puddings at the Greek restaurants and this is it! Only thing they do is garnish it with sprayed whipped cream and cinnamon. Rice pudding really is a formula recipe like baking. Follow this recipe verbatim. I used golden raisins, my preference, and 2% milk as my only minor deviations. Do not use non fat milk, artificial sweeteners, or regular rice, and expect this to turn out thick and creamy. I made sure not to boil it at the end, as stated, so it did not separate. It stayed pudding like with that suggestion. Unless one eats large desserts, I would say this is probably closer to 5 servings. This one is being saved in the recipe box, for future rice pudding cravings. ty"
