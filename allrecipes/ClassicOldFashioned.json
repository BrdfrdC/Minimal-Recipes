"reviewBody": "Not a bad recipe at all. Ensure you are using the \"good stuff\" as others have mentioned. Makes a world of difference. I typically use a sugar cube and some water with bitters. Also make sure you get large ice cubes for this drink. They dont melt as fast and water it down. I would never use a full orange slice. This isnt a screwdriver. Instead a hint of orange goes a long way with a simple twist of the orange peel over the glass then put the twist in the drink. Also luxardo cherries are a MUCH better choice for this drink. A little pricey but well worth it. As an added bonus if you want this drink smoked, use wood chips on a safe surface, light them on fire with a blowtorch, then place your glass over the wood chips to catch the smoke. While the glass fills with smoke, make your old fashioned and transfer it in to the smoked glass."

"reviewBody": "This sounds like a pretty standard old fashioned, and the way I used to make it. Now I use all fresh fruit, and it is the best ever. I combine several dashes of bitters, a fresh cherry (cut in half, remove bit, then squeeze some juice into glass and add remaining cherry). A slice of orange (a small amount if the juice is squeezed in, then twist the rind to get the oils and essence). Several ounces of bourbon (or rye, etc, but I love Makers) sugar/simple syrup (I prefer sugar in the raw or a cube, it will bring good flavor) add a splash of water and stir. You get good bourbon flavor, with just a touch of the sweet and the juice to cut it. If you are making something like an old fashioned you need to taste the bourbon, if you don't want to taste it go get a vodka red bull, or a wine cooler."

I bought some Jameson whiskey for a dinner recipe and had some leftover and decided to try a classic cocktail. This tasted like straight whiskey on ice. I tried to modify it by doubling and then tripeling the simple syrup, doubling the oranges and squeazing them, and then adding in a couple of splashes of the cherry juice from the jar as others suggested. It made it more palateable then, but it still tasted too strong to drink. I wish I wouldn't have spent the extra money now on the bottle of bitters now. It couldn't be tasted anyway. I don't know what to think? Maybe, I just don't like whiskey? Hmmm"

"reviewBody": "My father had one of these when he came home from work. When we do the same it is in his honor. I keep a jar of orange slices marinating in the simple syrup in the refrigerator for this drink. We use Ancient Age bourbon which is what he used. According to the reviewer in The New York Times Ancient Age is just as good as the top shelf brands. The aroma is so evocative of my dad's favorite drink and so 5:30ish."

"reviewBody": "this is the classic recipe. It is missing something though. You will need 2 orange slices &amp; 2 cherries. When you put the sugar cube/simple syrup &amp; bitters in the glass, also add one orange slice and one cherry. This all gets muddled (squished) together, topped with ice and then the whiskey. Garnish as directed. DELICIOUS!"
