I find the cookies are exceptional with Nuts For Nature nut &amp; seed butter (almonds, cashews, chia seeds, hazelnuts, sunflower seeds and Brazil nuts) from Costco. We triple the recipe, (except the dough is stiff enough at 6.25 cups of flour), and add an entire 737 gram (about 26 oz) jar of the Nuts For Nature. Now I can't imagine using plain old peanut butter. I just hope Costco keeps selling this stuff."

"reviewBody": "The recipe came together easily. I used natural crunchy peanut butter (so no added sugar) and I feel that tempered the sugar nicely. I also added more than 1 C of peanut butter - more like 1&amp;1/3C- not as strategic baking move but because I just wanted to finish off the jar. They came out great! They aren‚Äôt what I would call crunchy but they are light and crisp. I think next time I may use extra crunchy PB or maybe add in some chopped peanuts just for added crunch and peanut flavor as a personal preference. Otherwise great recipe - thank you!"

Doing test cookies allows you to make adjustments for the cooking time; should I roll dough in sugar or not, should I press with fork or not. I am not a fan of rolling cookie dough balls in sugar before cooking. I may try sprinkling after they come out of oven before they cool down. Or dusting them with powder sugar for something different. After reading reviews, I made these adjustments above in the ingredient list. Enjoy. I will try again."

However I would definitely cut down on the sugar quantity. Just too sweet. Cannot for the life of me understand people suggesting dredging these cookies in sugar before baking! Totally agree however with adding vanilla. Also the instructions are too complex. Just throw everything in the bowl, beat well with a wooden spoon. Spoon out onto the tray and press down with a wet fork. No need for complicated equipment or adding the ingredients in any particular order!"

Second I put my pizza stone on the rack under it to help regulate the oven temp. My cookies consistently came out perfect at 9 minutes. My batch yielded about 60 cookies. I had some left over melting chocolate and drizzled it over some."

(Which in total is supposedly sweeter than sugar) and GF 1 for 1 flour. The cookies seemed greasy (when raw) but where dry in the end, and not very sweet, we decided they would be good with frosting. Kids ate them. I'd definitely siguest more sugar if using the gf flour ( nature's promise)and making them for kids., if not frosting them. I think an adult, may enjoy them as a light snack, as is they where maybe a bit less sweet than a regular gram cracker. Happy to use up my messed up speadüòÅ seems like they could be rolled if you'd want to do such a thing."

I found them to bake and taste just like the homemade peanut butter cookies that my sister and me used to make when we were children. I think the sugar amounts provided the correct amount of sweetness to compliment the perfectly peanut flavor. Anymore sugar would risk a hyperglycemic coma. The peanut aroma filled the house and drove my dog nearly crazy, as she loves peanut butter dog treats."

I gently pressed my fork to flatten raw cookies a tiny bit, then sprinkled with white sugar and baked at 350 for 11 min. The pb chips and toffee bits beautifully melted into the cookie, they were soft and delicious!"

After I took out of the fridge and saw the dough was still too sticky to use, I put it into the freezer for 15 minutes. Still too sticky, but I went ahead anyhow. Forget about making those pretty cross hatch marks, the dough sticks to the fork. When I took the first batch out and moved them to a cooling rack, half of them fell apart. Baking the 2nd batch for 15, will see if that helps. Very disappointed with this recipe."
