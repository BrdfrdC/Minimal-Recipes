I modified this by adding orange bell pepper and using a shredded mexican cheese blend, green onions and only a few tablespoons of parsley. Thanks for a simple yet great tasting meatless nacho recipe!"

"reviewBody": "These were really good. However, I found the suggestion of the one reviewer to add green onions, on top after they were done, to be needed. I used baked tortilla chips and reduced fat cheese and it worked fine. I had all of the ingredients for the pico de gallo except lime, but subbed lemon juice. To save time, I just followed the layering technique and microwaved them for 2 minutes. 1/2 recipe fit on a large dinner plate and served 2 well. TY"
