"reviewBody": "Perfect as it is. The first time I made it I even sprung for the saffron. It has become a staple here with a few changes. I add garlic and mushrooms with the onions, canned or fresh. (If canned mushrooms, I drain off the water and dice them to match the onions.) Skip the saffron and chili flakes but while the broth/stock (whichever I have at the time) is simmering I add a little onion powder, a little garlic powder, maybe a 1/2 tsp or so paprika and some parsley for color. I may also dice in some cooked shredded chicken or sliced smoked sausage. I've even tossed in 1/2 cup or so of frozen peas to the broth a couple times. With the additions I will usually go 375 for 40-45 minutes then the 10 minute rest. My son and I also like sprinkling some soy sauce on our portions. If you actually read that whole speech my main point is this, you can do anything with this and it's awesome!"

Instead of chicken stock, I used Better than Bouillion veggie base and omitted the extra rice (it isn't necessary imho). Put everything together in a baking dish and baked according to the directions. I will make this again for sure."

The texture was great, not sticky or soggy at all. The only change I made was that I didn't have saffron so added a pinch of turmeric instead, to give that slight golden hue. I also decreased the salt by 1/4 teaspoon as I was worried it would be too salty with the chicken broth. Our teen-aged kids both enjoyed this as did one of their friends who had 3 servings! :)"

I also use jasmine rice as that is all I keep on hand for white rice and I really would recommend that or a basmati. I also recommend a good quality bone broth or stock as it really makes a difference in flavor. The rice has great flavor while also being mild enough that it could pair with almost anything well."

Each grain was separate (not that it matters to me), and the texture was perfect. Next time I might add some slivered almonds and a little parsley at the end."

Followed recipe exactly minus the saffron. This recipe is a good base to be creative with. After it is done any sautéed or steamed vegetables could be added for an unlimited variety of flavor combinations. A good way to use up small amounts of left over veggies. I am going to have fun being creative with this recipe. Thanks Chef John!"

I skipped the oven in favor of using one pot on the stove. I cooked the onion as directed, added the stock and seasonings to the same pot, brought it to a boil, added the rice and then covered and reduced to simmer until done. The rice tasted so good, perfectly fluffy, and flavorful! I have no idea how the oven would have changed things, but was happy with the final result."

Because I had veggies in the fridge to use up, I diced zucchini, yellow pepper and mushrooms, added them to the onion, butter/oil mix just as it finished browning to just slightly soften and coat them. I then simmered no-salt chicken stock with chilli powder and cumin in the same pot I had used to saute the onions then poured it over the jasmine rice and veggies in a 7\" wide square baking dish, covered with foil and followed the baking directions. The rice came out fluffy and tasted amazing! A perfect side dish to my roasted chicken thighs. Thanks for showing how to bake rice to perfection."

This recipe has been A game changer and SO versatile. I make it \"plain\", I've made it 'spanish' adding tomatoes, chilies and balancing the liquids; add brocolli and chopped chicken (top with cheese while it rests), still plan to try adding some Red beans and some sausage for a meal version! THANK YOU for this one. OH and VERY IMPORTANT is to seal the pan- the steam cooks the rice ! I actually use heavyt duty plastic wrap as a first layer sealed THEN heavy duty foil (or the foil lids that come with disposable pans @ Sams) over that sealed tight. I know it sounds scary to put plastic wrap in the oven, but keep it under 350 degrees and it works - I PROMISE!"

We were very disappointed but I think that it was totally related to the fact that is was brown rice and also maybe not the best quality rice. We had to put it in a pot and bring it to a boil and let it simmer for about 20 minutes. Still crunchy but edible. Anyways, flavour was good and I will try again with better quality rice and long grain white rice."
