Then I looked at reviews and some found that to be the case too but then said let it sit overnight and it makes a huge difference. Well, it really did. The next day when I planned to serve them they were just perfect. I didn’t need to go into damage control at all. I will make these again. The family loved them and asked for the recipe!!"

I'm not usually a big fan of fresh dill, but it was perfect in this recipe! I'm making another batch right now before my dill goes bad and because my girls have gone quite crazy laying eggs with the longer days!! Definitely recommend this recipe!!"
