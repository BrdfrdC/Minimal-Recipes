I use ground turkey instead of ground beef and doubt anyone can taste the difference because of how flavorful this version is. I also cook my potatoes in milk to make them extra creamy. I use the warm milk to mash them and they're delicious. I have learned to not mash them quite as smoothly as if I was serving them alone because they blend in too readily with the meat and vegetables. I think the separation of the layers is more attractive when serving. I'l always liked Shepher's Pie and this version is my new favorite!"

"reviewBody": "100% recommended! \n\nI added additional veggies; green beans, mushrooms (baby bella), diced tomatoes (canned, Italian seasoned), and frozen/shelled edamame. Red/orange/yellow and/or green peppers would be phenomenal as well (next time!). Tomato paste works great to thicken it up a little instead of adding extra flour. If you want to save some time: use instant mashed potatoes (make according to the package instructions) and layer 'em on top and/or generic, frozen \"mixed veggies,\" usually some combo of peas, carrots, corn, and beans is perfect; just throw the whole bag in. Also for next time, I will replace the potatoes with mashed cauliflower and broccoli. I made this once substituting ground beef with ground chicken/turkey (you can use any ground meat or leftover. Actually leftover beef roast, cubed or thinly sliced/chopped would be awesome). When I made this for my vegan brother, I substituted ground beef with mushrooms (chopped portobello, white, and shiitake was the combo I used). I have also just used generic \"Italian seasoning\" (marjoram, basil, thyme, savory, rosemary, and oregano) if I am out of the fresh stuff and it worked just fine \n\nThis is a GREAT, EASY, PERFECT fall/winter comfort food!...and plenty of ways to make it even more healthy and get all those veggies into ya! \n\nI think I have made this 5-6 times and love to play around with the recipe...its super flexible and if you don't have 1-2 things, there's easily something you can replace it with.\n\nThanks!\nJ"

"reviewBody": "One of the things I loved about this recipe, before I even made it, was that it offered variations on it, depending on your preferences. My husband loves anything spicy so I chose the zesty option. After reading other recipes and variations on them, I decided on four changes...to use a crust on the bottom (Pillsbury Pie Crust), substitute mixed veggies with frozen corn, layer the corn on top of the meat mixture but below the mashed potatoes, and to replace ketchup with tomato paste. I also used an extra 1/2 lb of ground beef and cut the Worcester sauce in half. I first put the crust in a hot 350° oven for about 7 minutes while I cooked the meat mixture. Assembly was a snap, and I added another 10 minutes to the cooking time.. This dish was indeed zesty and very tasty, and my husband and I both loved it. I definitely will make it again, but here’s what I plan to do next time...I will eliminate the oil altogether and cook the ground beef first, then cook the onion in the juices with the ground beef, drain, and then add the spices. I’m not a big fan of Worcester sauce and may cut it even further, if not altogether. I think the mustard alone would provide just the right amount of tang. Now that I’m done talking about it, I can’t wait to make it again."

I used about half balsamic vinegar ketchup to give it an extra kick. I have often found that tomato soup in recipes can be too runny, so I used tomato sauce. I also did not have regular Dijon, so I used chipotle mustard. I think I will try it again, sticking to the ingredients to a T, and see how it turns out. I also preferred my veggies, peas and corn, layered on top of the meat mixture. When first done, it was a little runny, not really sticking together like a pie.. but after it sat overnight, it was more solid. The meat mixture itself was great, and I think could be a stand alone recipe for a home made sloppy joe mix..."

I sprinkled sharp cheddar shreds on top of the potatoes after the casserole finished cooking (about 1/4 cup). Will definitely make this again."

Although, I did have to play around with the potato amounts, but that doesn't change the rating. Recommended."

"reviewBody": "My boyfriend orders this dish pretty often from the neighborhood Irish Pub and since he had a tooth pulled earlier today, I thought I'd treat him by making it myself. This is the recipe I chose to follow.\n\nThe *only* change I made was substituting the ground beef for meatloaf mix (ground beef, pork and veal); everything else was true to the recipe.\n\nHe loved it! He said it's BETTER than the dish at the pub! And that's saying a lot -- he's one HECK of a picky eater! I thought he'd get a bit anxious seeing the ketchup and mustard as ingredients (something he'd define as \"weird\" in a Shepherd's Pie) but once the dish came out of the oven, he could not stop marveling over how great it smelled. And that was only a prelude to the great taste!\n\nI myself had two servings. Great recipe! 10/10, will make again! Thank you!"

Combining chunks of the left-over roast, the veggies, and then using the left-over mashed potatoes on top. English food, on the whole, tends to be bland so the spices in this recipe are great! I serve it with beef gravy and yorkshire puddings..."

I didn't add thyme or rosemary, but I did add Epicure's Roasted Garlic and Epicure's Beef and Pork seasoning. I also decided to opt out on the ketchup and tomato juice but I used 1 and a half cans of tomato paste instead. I would suggest adding the salt and pepper according to taste as I ended up using much less salt and a lot more pepper (personal preference)."

I would recommend tasting your the meat mixture to add more salt and pepper to your suite your taste buds.\n\nOther than that it was easy to make and a great comfort food that will keep the the belly full and satisfied."

I was a little wary of using the whole amount of dijon but it didn't overpower at all. The only change I would make is to use tomato paste instead of the ketchup, as I thought the sweetish tang of the ketchup was a bit much and add a bouillon cube. That's just personal preference, though. All in all, a great meal, thanks :)"
