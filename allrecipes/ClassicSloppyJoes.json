Also, I didn't have brown sugar on hand so I added a bit of lime juice instead for sweetness. A large variation I know, but it turned out amazing!"

"reviewBody": "I have made this recipe twice, once with the green peppers and once without. It's better with the peppers. They cook very nicely with ground beef, so you don't get an overpowering pepper taste. I add the salt and pepper to the ground beef while it's cooking to enhance the flavor of the meat. Some reviewers said it tasted too ketchupy. The longer you let it simmer, the more the ketchup will cook. I added about 20 minutes cooking time. I think it will be a good base recipe to customize, but I do like it just the way it is, and so do my teenage boys, one of whom is a very picky eater."

Will definitely be making this again."
