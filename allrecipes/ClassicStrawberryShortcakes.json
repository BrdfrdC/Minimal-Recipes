"reviewBody": "Excellent! Made these for guests last night. I neeeded a quick, easy to fix, seasonally appropriate dessert to serve with our summer meal. This met my expectations exactly! :) As with any recipe, I have a few suggestions for improvement. The next time I make these (there WILL be a next time!), I will substitute heavy whipping cream for milk (for richness) and add a bit of vanilla (to enhance the overall flavor) as others have suggested. I baked my shortcakes for 11 minutes, but feel they would have been fine at the 9 minute mark. After sititng for 10 minutes, these split beautifully (i.e. no crumbles!). NOTE: My grocery store only had 2 lb. containers of strawberries. This recipe instructs to add 1/2 c. sugar to a quart of strawberries. There are approximately 1.5 lbs. of strawberries in a quart (this conversion ONLY applies to strawberries; with any other ingredient, you cannot convert from pounds to quarts). I added 3/4 c. sugar to mine with great results. Filled with the delicious strawberry mixture and Cool-whip, this was really a great treat - and my guests couldn't have agreed more. Thanks!"

"reviewBody": "I wanted more of a cake consistency as opposed to biscuits, so I added 2 eggs and an additional tbsp of sugar. I used a hand-held mixer to get the batter nice and smooth, and poured into a jumbo sized muffin tin. I baked them at 325 for about 25 minutes. This yielded 6 perfect shortcakes that were easily sliced in half to layer fresh whipped cream and strawberries. I chilled the fresh strawberries mixed with sugar for 30 minutes before serving….makes wonderful strawberry syrup. I used the “whipped cream” recipe on this site and sub’ed granular sugar for confectioner’s sugar. I think these were the best strawberry shortcakes ever and my fiancé agreed!"

"reviewBody": "This was a really easy and delicious shortcake. Nothing trick but quick. just don't overbake the buiscuit dough. I baked the biscuits in muffin tins and they came out perfectly round. I baked for exactly 11 min, and the insides were just slightly soft, perfect &amp; moist. The top did crumble a bit when I sliced them warm, but once the berries &amp; cream were added, you couldn't tell the difference, although I did try these without slicing, still very good. To enhance the flavouring of the strawberries, add as much as 1/4 cup of lemon juice with 1/2 cup of sugar (or splenda) to the strawberries, mix well and allow to sit for as long as possible (10 min or up to a couple of hours). Really good..."

I had guests over, and I only had to spend 5 minutes preparing the shortcakes to go in the oven. And five minutes more to assemble them after baking. I will definitely do these again. BTW, I didn't split the shortcakes because I didn't want to risk them falling apart. I just put shortcake, then cool whip, then arranged sliced strawberries on top-perfect!"
