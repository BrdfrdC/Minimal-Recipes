Just be sure to dip them in the liqueur first, otherwise they are dry. LOL (no pun intended). If you have a nice glass bowl, it makes a nice centerpiece, although it doesn't last long."

"reviewBody": "An authentic Italian recipe does not include whipped cream or nearly as much sugar. The original recipe calls for five eggs, half a cup of sugar, one teaspoon of pure vanilla flavouring and one pound of Galbani mascarpone cheese. The brand is very important. Galbani is imported from Italy and is the best available domestically. The savoiardi biscuits are dipped in two cups of strong espresso coffee and one third of a cup of brandy or kahlua."

"reviewBody": "Turned out very good! However, I had a problem that I didn't see anyone else mention. When I stirred the egg yolks in a double boiler, they cooked! I didn't realize it so after stirring 10 minutes on lowest heat, I tried to whip it in a kitchen aid and nothing was happening except it was getting dryer and stiffer. The problem was a very thin metal double-boiler steamer pan - it held too much heat! I started over with new eggs, and used a small pan with a thick ceramic bowl over it, and stirred for 5 minutes. It was smooth, sugar dissolved and it was beautiful! When I whipped it in a cold bowl, it was perfect! So watch out for a bad double-boiler. If it looks wrong ( not like in the video - then it is cooked.) Used soft lady fingers, used up 2.5 packs of 12 each -made in 9X13 pan. Added 1/2 cup espresso to Kahlua. Also sprinkled cocoa over 2nd layer of ladyfingers. Will make again!"

Someone else commented on the lady fingers having to be soft and it's right - you have to get the soft ones - I get mine at Trader Joe's. TJ also sells Mascarpone cheese at a reasonable price. Anyway, I made this for the office party last week and it was a huge success. I also like the coffee liqueur flavor over brandy which is used in some other recipes. I think the coffee liqueur makes it taste smoother without being overpowering. This recipe isn't hard to make but you have to follow instructions closely. Also, you can use just about any bowl but a glass one makes it interesting. If the bowl isn't exactly the right shape, that's not a big deal. Just cut the lady fingers to fit properly. Bon Appetit!"

If you don't want to drink it, do not add it to your tiramisu!\n\nMarscapone is high in fat and will separate as it gets warm. Let egg yolk mixture cool completely before adding refrigerated marscapone."

Used the mascarpone substitute from Giada' s website (Googled mascarpone substitute), and strong coffee so it's kid-friendly, and my world-travelling best friend says it's the best she's ever had. Really hard to find lady fingers where I am, so I use (2) 12 oz packages of Stella D'oro brand Margherite (spelling?) cookies, and the recipe uses every single one, minus two or three for snacking. Can't even tell that it's not exactly authentic. Super easy to make, and delicious to boot. It'll even impress the in-laws."

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe and received excellent reviews! It was so delicious, but I did do a couple of things differently.\n1) I used Italian Savioardi cookies I found that were harder than the soft Milano ladyfingers. I think they are more authentic, and liked the sugar on the top layer of the cookie. \n2) I mixed 1/3 cup of coffee liqueur with one strong espresso for extra coffee flavor. Because the cookies were hard, I did need the extra liquid to get them to my desired softness.\nFor assembly, I used a springform pan and followed the directions like the recipe indicated. Next time I will line the sides of the pan with cookies first, then line the bottom. I quickly dunked both sides of the cookie in the liqueur, placed in the bottom of the pan, and brushed a little more on top. I also brushed the cookies on the sides of the pan a little so they wouldn't be too hard to break with a fork. The cookie layer was perfect!!\nI also think there is enough cream to do three layers. (I only did two layers and it was fine but the cream layers were quite thick).\nOverall, great recipe and I will definitely make again!"

The taste was creamy, sweet (but not too sweet), with almost a tang. This is a recipe I will be making again! The only changes I will be making are the shape of the cake. \n *I do not want to toot my own horn, but I was impressed and so were my guests*"

Then the Tiramisu must sit in the 'fridge overnight at the bare minimum. The egg is the hardest part, you are actually making Sabayone. Whisk constantly while cooking and don't let the mixture get too hot. Excellent recipe."

We actually line our pan/trifle with the ladyfingers and use a turkey baster and brush to spread the expresso/kahlua mixture we make. The ingredients can be expensive but a couple of tips: if you have a trader joe's, they have the mascarpone cheese and the heavy whipping cream for a fraction of the cost. Near the holidays, they even carry the lady fingers. They don't have them for too long so go in when you can and stock up. It was about 1/3 of the cost at the local Italian market. We make this recipe for people and we always have the nicest thank you's. People love it. Hope it helps."

"reviewBody": "Great news everyone, you can make your own mascarpone cheese at a fraction of the price and it tastes great, easy too. However you have to make it at least one day before making your tiramisu. In a double boiler bring one quart of heavy cream to 90 degrees farenheight (takes about ten minutes). Stir often to keep the cream from scorching. Add one tablespoon of tartaric acid, (or try one tablespoon of lemon or lime juice or one tablespoon of vinegar). Let cool. Keep stirring until you begin to see separation of whey (clear liquid). Line a sieve with three layers of cheese cloth or three coffee filters and place sieve over a pot or bowl. Pour cream inti sieve and cover. Place in fridge overnight to allow the whey to drain. The next day, vola, you have mascarpone cheese. Peel away filter and place cheese in an airtight container till ready to use. Use within five days. I suggest you google this and or watch you tube videos. Now for my rating, great recipe but way too much sugar and I do have a sweet tooth. Will definatly make again but less sweet. Thanks for sharing."

I then refrigerated the mascarpone/egg mixture while I was beating the whipping cream. . And lastly, I poured the mixture onto a cheese cake pan and proceeded to chill it overnight. \n\nThe result? Rave compliments from colleagues and friends all over! This is certainly a keeper recipe!!! Thanks Carol:)"
