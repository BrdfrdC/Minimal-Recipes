I sautee fresh mushrooms, diced celery, and onion in a little butter until softened and then stir in the cream of mushroom soup, milk and a tablespoon or so of sherry to give it some richness. Combine with the egg noodles and bake with your favorite topping (sometimes I use the French's fried onions for a change) and it's really good, too. The thing here is, there really is no right or wrong. I've read some suggestions here that I will try so thought I'd add my thoughts here, too. My guy hates tuna (or so he says because he loves this recipe!)."

This one is easy to have the ingredients on hand, and everyone in the family is happy when I make it. Make it as written, or make changes to suit your taste. I like to add a jar of artichoke hearts chopped up for an interesting taste, and I always sprinkle in some grated parmesan +/or romano before baking. One time I crushed up some seasoned crutons for the topping instead of bread crumbs. Go with what you have, and have a good dinner!"

This was a good recipe for the picky eaters in household G, plain and easy to dress up individually for differing tastes. I used cream of chicken soup, half &amp; half, Italian breadcrumbs, and added pepper. It was a triumph in the eyes of G, but I will tinker with it more. Add garlic and onion powder, cayenne pepper, paprika, and some mushrooms."

Instead melt slowly in five second intervals until almost melted, then let it sit for a minute to finish melting - and be sure to cover the butter, it will pop and splatter a bit."

In Uruguay, I could not find any Campbell's soup, so I used a mild pasta sauce, celery is almost non existant so I used frozen broccoli, diced onions, half a green pepper and some garlic, the pasta was whole wheat bow ties, lots of cheese in the fridge so I added some mozzarella to give it a more creamy look, also added some freshly ground peppèr, for the topping I crushed a few salt free crackers, added done grated cheese, a drizzle of olive oil and put in a 350 degree heated over. The compliments made me feel almost as proud as the dish tasted. As it was. Cool night we had the wood fire going so this is added to my list of comfort foods"

Also, instead of bread crumbs, we buttered two slices of bread and tore them into pieces and covered the casserole top with them, buttered side up.

I haven't had Tuna Noodle Casserole since when I was growing up, and when everything was a casserole of some sort. Today I had a nostaligic moment come over me when I thought, \"Hmm, it might be nice to make that.\" I found this recipe and thought it looked like what I recall. I followed it to the letter. But...oh, the result was so not my childhood memories. It was creamy and looked right; however, there was an oddness to it that no one in my family could quite place. I rechecked and all my ingreients were in date, so I know we're okay there. Perhaps I'm not a Tuna Casserole gal after all? Sadly, my dreams of a nostalgic dinner went into the rubbish with this casserole, and we had a Ramen Noodle night instead. Oh well. You win some, you lose some, right?"

I doubled the noodles, which created enough servings for my husband, me, and our three young children, with enough leftovers for one serving. It did also make it so that it wasn't very saucy, which both the hubby and I liked, but I would still use slightly more liquid. I also used cream of mushroom soup because it was what we had in the house, but would like to try it with celery. If I were to make this recipe again, I would add 1/2 small onion, garlic powder, black pepper, and a pinch of salt to start, along with double the noodles and either another 1/2 cup of milk or 1/2 cup of sour cream, as some other reviews have mentioned, and see how it tastes with some seasoning in it."
