I loved how simple it was to make using up the leftover turkey carcass from Christmas dinner. My husband and I both had the flu over the holiday and because of the simple recipe I could make it even though I was not feeling my best. It was just perfect for dealing with a sore throat and aches. I have tried many different soup recipes over the last few years and this is my favourite and will be my go to from now on."

Next time, I will not double the poultry seasoning or the pepper. Also, I made the broth the day before and chilled overnight so I could skim off the fat. I let it simmer several hours the day I made the broth and again the final day to reduce the broth (I used 4 quarts of water) for a stronger turkey flavor. It was very tasty and had great turkey flavor!"

"reviewBody": "After reading the other reviews and knowing that turkey rice soup can be a bit bland if you aren’t careful, I took most of the advice submitted by others and will summarize what I did differently to reach the rating I gave the soup. I refrigerated the stock when it was done then skimmed off the fat the next day. After letting the stock reach room temperature, I added chicken bullion (1 cube or 1 tsp), I doubled all the seasoning (including the garlic) listed in the recipe plus added 1 tsp of parsley to ensure a flavor boost. Before I put in the meat and rice, I added 4 tsp of salt (this took the soup to a good base that people could add a bit more if they wanted) and 2 tsp of pepper. I agree with one of the other reviews that more meat is needed so I added 2 more cups of turkey; adding one more cup of rice gave it the consistency I was looking for. Hope this helps anyone out there who wants to try this easy recipe and is looking for more flavor. Enjoy!"
