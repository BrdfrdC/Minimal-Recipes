The batter became very thick very fast, so have your maker greased, and pre heated .. Came out crispy and thick. I let them cook a couple of extra minutes, because of the thickness, it was fine but I don‚Äôt know if it was needed. So 5 star with the GF MIX. I can‚Äôt imagine the regular recipe would be anything less than great. Thanks for sharing a seeming basic waffle recipe! Jan Toronto (Canadian flour used, there is a difference‚Ä¶.google it!)."

"reviewBody": "NEVER TOO SALTY when you use UNSALTED butter. If you're using salted butter, do not add more salt. The author of this recipe likely assumed people would know this but many do not. I have tried many waffle recipes &amp; this is BY FAR THE BEST!!! After reading reviews, here is what I did differently: 1) I used UNSALTED BUTTER! Many complaints about waffles being TOO SALTY There's a very high probability that they used salted butter plus added salt according to recipe. The salt content in butter is oftentimes very high &amp; adding more salt will make for too Salty waffles. This is true for any recipe because there's no way to know how much salt is in the butter. 2) I added a squeeze of lemon juice to my warn milk. 3) I added a small dash of both cinnamon &amp; nutmeg to batter, each less than 1/8 teaspoon."

They bake up perfectly in my Cuisinart Classic waffle maker, making exactly 8 waffles total. The leftover waffles freeze well and reheat well in the oven too. For those saying the recipe called for too much baking soda, please note: it calls for Baking POWDER, not Baking Soda."

Enough for breakfast. HOWEVER, had we been a larger brunch group thinking a doubled recipe would yield 20-24 waffles, we would have been sorrily mistaken, disappointed and un-waffled. A penguin once made me waffles. Said he was going to make 6 waffles. Man made 7 waffles. I appreciate honesty. I appreciate when I awake to an intended amount of waffles. I see effort, but I don‚Äôt see execution, but I absolutely loved the waffles."

"reviewBody": "So I followed the measurements as written. I did sub allulose for the sugar because I was feeding diabetics. First...I needed more liquid. With the measurements, I made a dough. I added roughly an additional cup and a half of warm milk. I added an extra 2 tbsp of butter too. This allowed the dough to become a batter. I tasted it and it had bitter flavor so I wasn't hopeful. It cooked up great with a crisp to it, as other reviewers remarked. There was no bitter taste. The cinnamon shone through. I sprinkled dried cherries over the batter in the waffle iron. It added additional sweetness. I made 8 individual squares. I'm not sure I Would make this again just because of the batter consistency."
