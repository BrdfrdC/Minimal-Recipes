Salt may not be required depending on what else you are serving it with but I always put in a pinch but I love salty food. To make it a little healthier use vegetable oil, solid is best but the stuff in the bottle will do fine. But always always heat the oil first."

Bake for 15 minutes at 450 and without opening the oven, turn to 350 for another 20 minutes. At our house, we like them as a side dish with soup and this alternative prep method allows me to fix them after work on a week night"

I may try again with a roast, and will update my review if I get better results."

I did (with the exception of cooking them in individual muffin tins), and the only problem I experienced was the cooking time for the drippings prior to pouring the filling in. Mine were starting to burn after 10 minutes in the oven, so I pulled them at that time and proceeded with the recipe. I understand why these pair so well with roast beef - they are perfect for sopping up all that gravy goodness! I will use this one again, my guy and I ate nearly every one of them. Thank you for the recipe."

I putin about a teaspon of beef granules and t. of chopped parsley or chives, just to make interesting.

The only thing I would like to add is that you REALLY need to serve this IMMEDIATELY. Unfortunately, I let it sit for about 20 minutes while I was preparing all the finishing touches to my dinner and during that time it flattened a bit. It still tasted good, but I'm sure it would have been even better had it been directly out of the oven."
