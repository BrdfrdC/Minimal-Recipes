The only thing that didn't go as planned was that the cheese never got that nice golden brown colour - no matter what I did. At the end of the day, it tasted fantastic, and that's what really matters!"

I’m tired of people leaving a review after they’ve changed the recipe to the point it’s not the same recipe. If you people are so good, then post your recipe as a new one. No one really cares about your ridiculous Additions to the ingredients. If you’re going to post a review, then post it AS IS!! \nYour changes are not the recipe so your 5 stars don’t mean a thing. Your recipe probably doesn’t hold water to this person’s recipe. So either do some work or leave a legitimate review. Anyway this recipe as is was great!!\nFC"

Used no-boil noodles, and started with a layer of sauce on the bottom first before adding the first layer of noodles. Also added some milk to the recipe to increase liquid ratio for the noodles. Turned out great and children have requested this recipe be added to our regular rotation! So thank you!"

"reviewBody": "Okay, I give this 4 stars because I try it their way, and I had a problem with cottage cheese being used. So I go back to my tried and true. First of all, if you use the flat \"No need to boil\" lasagna noodles it will taste even more Italian homemade. Second, don't use cottage cheese because if people don't like cottage cheese right out of the container because of texture they will have the same issues eating lasagna with it. Instead, if you must have that authentic cheese filling because I prefer mine without it, use the RICOTTA cheese instead and stir in lots of shredded parmesan cheese and about 1 tablespoon oregano and 1 egg (egg not necessary if you use lots of parmesan as the binder). \nAnother tip is if no one has an aversion to pork in the family take a 1lb package of breakfast sausage and mix in about 2 tbs of Italian seasoning, fry, and drain and add it in along with the ground beef.\nAlso, make a small pot of sauce or jars of marinara sauce you heat up on the stove. So those who like extra sauce can put it on the plate first and put the slice of lasagna on top of the extra sauce. This way you don't have to fret over if it's too dry or not. If they think it's dry add extra sauce and get over it."

"reviewBody": "I absolutely love this recipe, although I don’t follow it 100%. Here are some of the changes I make: I usually cook 2-3 lbs ground beef because we like our lasagna meaty over here! I use a decent amount of seasoning (seasoned salt, pepper, oregano, Italian seasoning) and another tsp or 2 minced garlic when cooking the meat, and I use ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. Since I make it with more meat, I use 32 oz of ricotta cheese and 4 eggs instead of two.One must? Thoroughly season your ricotta/cottage cheese mixture!! I season mine with Italian seasoning; seasoning salt, pepper, garlic salt and pepper, and oregano. Since I use more meat, I also usually have to cook it a little bit longer. I normally cook it 45 minutes or more before I remove the foil for the last 20 minutes or so to brown the cheese. One last little tip I have is to stick four toothpicks in it so your foil doesn’t take away all your cheese!"

Next level was ground beef and pork sauteed with onion/garlic and covered with a jar of pasta sauce with meat in it, and the layer of pasta again. Next was the ricotta cheese layer and noodles. Last layer was spicy chicken Italian sausage covered with a jar of spicy sausage sauce. I discovered too late that I had only a bit of mozzarella cheese, so I mixed it with my plentiful mild cheddar cheese and parmesan, and covered the entire casserole with it before baking under foil for the hour. I made my 16\" x 12\" x 3\" roaster full for leftovers guaranteed. This was way easier than I expected!"

Instead of 1 lb. of ground beef, I used 3/4 lb of ground beef and 1/4 lb of sweet Italian sausage. They liked this zesty flavor. Storing the rest of it in individual pieces in freezer for microwaving later."

I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, regular noodles instead of whole wheat (also oven-ready so no need to boil), and I used Italian sausage out of the casing with ground beef. It was about 3 pounds of meat all in all. One pound of meat is not enough for a 9x13 pan of lasagna. It was very delicious the only thing I would change about how I made it was the sauce... I did not put enough sauce in there but it was still tasty. I highly recommend."

"reviewBody": "Family loved it, will definitely make again! I used Mexican queso fresco instead of cottage or ricotta cheese (didn't have either on hand) which gave the dish some counterbalance to all that melted mozzarella cheese. Although, I had doubled the cheese amounts than what the recipe called for, it was still not enough for layering. I ended up (generously) layering in mozzarella cheese. I used an organic, diced tomato and basil sauce which gave the final dish a rustic finish, but the recipe definitely needs more sauce. Pair it with a good wine and enjoy."

Since my son likes cheese I mixed in to the cottage chees some Parmesan/Romano and sprinkled some on top before adding shredded mozzarella about 30 minutes into the baking. Lastly after cooling for 10 min. I sprinkled on some fresh parsley. Yum!"

As someone who doesn't like cottage cheese, I cannot imagine having Lasagna without it now.\n\nHowever, I would recommend increasing the cheese mixture by about 50% depending on the side of your pan. My pan ended up being a little large and ended up with poor overall coverage with the cottage cheese mixture."
