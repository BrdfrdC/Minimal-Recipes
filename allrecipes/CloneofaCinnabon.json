No bread machine . .. had to go buy some margarine . . and I only use instant yeast, so I used the same amount and mixed it with some of the flour. I mixed the sugar with all the wet . . then added the flour/yeast/salt. Kneaded it with my Kitchenaid for five minutes after I kneaded it by hand a bit. This was the softest, most pliable dough ever. Thank you, Martha, for your posting this . . finally found the soft bread texture I have been searching for! I don't know if the margarine made a difference or not, but the recipe worked well for me, and I have plenty of margarine left, so it will be a while before I try it with butter!"

"reviewBody": "I mixed all the filling ingredients together and found it difficult to easily spread this over the dough. Maybe my butter wasn't soft enough. Rolled from the 21\" edge and accidentally cut these 1.5 inches and got 14 rolls. Next time I'll cut them 1.75\" for 12 rolls. Baked at 350 degrees for 22 minutes, and had to push down the popped up parts once during baking.. Only used about half of the icing and found that this is plenty enough. Alot of work, but super yummy! 2nd time: used the bread machine and put cut cinnamon rolls in the fridge over night. They didn't rise much at all before doing so. Next morning - out on the counter for 2 hours then baked at 350 degrees for 25 min. Turned out hard. Tasted ok but texture was bad. 3rd time- Used KA to knead the dough for 5 minutes and added an extra 1 tsp milk to the dough. Let dough rise an hour 20 minutes in an oven prewarmed to 170 degrees then turned off. Placed a damp towel over the dough. It didn't completely double but I took it out and rolled it anyway, pressing the cinnamon sugar mixture into the dough by hand. Let the rolls sit on the counter for about 45 minutes covered with wrap and a heater blowing on them ( they didn't double in size). Baked about 30 minutes at 350 degrees. They did rise in the oven and were big and fluffly. Kept adding minutes and checking for doneness. Were doughy inside at first. Next time - will use the KA again, as the end result was much lighter and better. Spread half the icing on immediately then saved the rest for personal preference."

The next morning I preheated the oven to 350 and baked them for 25 minutes, uncovered. I left them in the oven, turned it off and opened the door while I made the frosting. Before frosting them I flipped them over onto parchment paper. These are delicious and easy to make. Thank you for sharing your recipe!"

Put in frige overnight. Take out at least 3 hours before you plan to cook to let rise. So soft and goey always a huge hit! Should come with a warning label. You will be ask to make them all the time!"

I let the dough hook do it's thing for about 5 minutes and then let them proof in my oven (proof setting) for an hour. After I made the rolls I refrigerated until morning then put them back in the oven on Proof for an hour before baking them. I ended up having to bake for 20 minutes, but I turned the oven down to 350 degrees for the last 5 minutes."

"reviewBody": "If you love soft and fluffy cinnamon rolls with the perfect amount of caramelized sugar and cinnamon goodness inside, give this recipe a try! I followed it exactly as written, and the only change I made was to restart the dough cycle after kneading so it had two rounds of kneading. The dough came out perfectly hydrated and smooth. Getting the dough to flatten out to the right size was a challenge because the gluten kept pulling it back, but some gentle stretching and resting worked wonders. All in all, if you follow this recipe as stated you will not be disappointed."

"reviewBody": "Anyone who says these are nothing special must have done something wrong. They are so fluffy, soft, and gooey! I think Clone of a Cinnabon is a misnomer - everyone who ate one said they are BETTER. I did use my Zojirushi bread machine for the dough, letting it rise in there for an hour or so because my house is cold. It was a bit of a pain to roll the dough out all the way, but 100% worth it. The only thing I did differently is that I used butter instead of margarine in the dough because that's what I had. After getting the rolls in the pan, I had to improvise for the second rise since my oven doesn't have a proof setting and its lowest temp is 170. I turned the oven on to the lowest temp for 10 minutes and then shut it off and propped the door open. Then I covered the rolls with a kitchen towel and set them in there (with the door propped open) until they had doubled in size again. Pulled them out, heated the oven up to temp and baked. I just finished eating a leftover one from the batch I made yesterday and they reheat (15 seconds in the microwave) BEAUTIFULLY."

"reviewBody": "I made this as is. What would have made it better was the missing ingredient: heavy cream. After the second rise, slowly pour warm cream over and around the rolls and then bake. This causes the sugar to be more gooey rather than grainy. It also creates the gooey caramel sauce. Another thing about this recipe for beginner bakers...do not be tempted to add more than 4.5 cups of flour. The dough should be tacky but not sticky. When you‚Äôre doing your first prove, lightly grease the bowl so the dough doesn‚Äôt stick and cover with a towel or wax paper. I preheated the oven to 200F, turned it off immediately, and did both proves in the oven. Prove until it‚Äôs doubled in size...about 30-45 minutes. Over proving will make the dough airy. Bake at 375 for 20-27 minutes."

"reviewBody": "This is perfection! I had never baked rolls before and these were really wonderful. I made a few changes after reading the reviews: I don‚Äôt own a bread machine so I made these on my KA using the hook. I weighed my flour (22 ounces) and a bit more since it seemed the dough needed some extra (1/4 c approximately). For the filling, I only used half and it seemed perfect for us. I also added 1/2 C chopped pecans and sprinkled them on half of the extended dough so I got half of them with pecans and half without. We all thought the ones with pecans were better. For the frosting I used Raskas cream cheese and had to add some (2 T aprox) greek yogurt since it was really dense. Baked at 350 F for 30 minutes, 2 pyrex with 7 rolls each. After taking them out of the oven, I turned them over, frosted and put them back into the oven (turned off) to keep them warm. They were a BIG hit at home! Thank you for a fantastic recipe!"
