We cut that recipe in half for 2 since it said it served 4; however, to have a taller glass, you had to make the amount for 4 anyway. The first time around, we used all ingredients in the amount stated; the second time, we cut the mint leaves amount in half. We used fresh mint from our garden, which was nice. We enjoyed these and will make them again in the summertime."

There is no sweetness whatsoever with the coconut cream alone. I might even throw in some shredded coconut for the second batch. One can of cream makes 4 servings. Also I will pour the rum generously:)"

Added a bit more of the coconut to it, and since I noticed one reviewer mentioned the Wray &amp; Nephew white rum...I remembered a bottle of this \"moonshine\" like rum I brought home from Jamaica, mon! I put some in....be careful with this over-proofed white rum if ya' use it. Hard to find here, though...I've only seen it in Jamaica. It's what they put in those wicked good rum punch drinks! Have fun! ;-) Thanks for the reminder, blacksnapper!!!"
