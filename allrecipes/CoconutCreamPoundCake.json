I baked it in a 13 x 9 pan because I don’t have great luck with bundt cakes-dark edges or not coming out of the pan without breaking. I started baking it for 30 minutes and then testing every 2 minutes after for maybe 10-12 more minutes. I found the cake dry and crumbly so not sure what the answer is-also add canola or vegetable oil? It had a really good flavor but the texture bothered me. Maybe I cooked it too long but the middle still seemed jiggly so I’d leave it in for a couple more minutes."

I would make this again with the following changes: 1 1/2 t. coconut extract, 1/2 t. vanilla extract, 1 t. baking powder. I would still put the coconut in the food processor but afterwards I would soak it in milk or coconut milk for added moisture."

"reviewBody": "I made half the recipe and it was very good. I used 1 1/4 c of sugar, and I still think 1 cup would be enough. I toasted a bit of the coconut to enhance the coconut flavor. The golden bits inside looked pretty. I doubled the coconut flavor too, but with the toasted coconut it could be fine to add less coconut flavoring. The cake is dense but not too dry. It yielded about 12 cupcakes. If you bake in dark pans, beware that you might need to lower the temperature to 300F given that this cake benefits from slow baking. The sugar of the coconut will add to the batter plus it can cause over browning. Like others suggest use less sugar and beat the cream cheese and butter well and after adding the sugar. Make sure the sugar/butter mix catches enough air for a lightweight result. Will make this again."

The crust on the cake was very dark- not burned, but dark. That tells me too much sugar (as it was plenty sweet)and baked too long. I'll make it again with some additional adjustments."

So I followed my instincts and some of the tips. I added a teaspoon of vanilla, a teaspoon of salt and 4 tablespoons of coconut oil, and I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup. I baked in a 4qt (10x15) rectangular baking dish for 65 minutes at the specified temperature. I wish I had taken it out 5-7 minutes sooner, but - this is a fabulous, basic recipe that you can tweak or customize to your taste and produce a wonderful, dense and flavorful pound cake."

Because some folks suggested adding more butter - I just added little canola oil - maybe 1/4 cup. Also, at others' suggestion - I added little milk - probably about 1/4 to 1/3 cup. Mine cooked about 1 hour &amp; 10 minutes. Delicious! I will probably make for mother-in-law - for our Mother's Day gathering. Thanks for a great recipe, as well as for helpful reviews!"
