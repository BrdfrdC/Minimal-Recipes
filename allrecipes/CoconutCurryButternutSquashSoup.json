So good! However! This soup is amazing! Made as is but doubled the yellow curry and added some ginger. I did need to thin this quite a bit - needing more liquids (my guess is too much squash) but the result was still a new favorite. Thanks Mint&amp;Mangoes for sharing this awesome and mostly easy recipe"

I love Panera's Autumn Squash soup, but this is even better. I served it with toasted Rosemary bread. So tasty and satisfying."
