It probably helps that I am from the beautiful Isles of Hawai'i and as cliché as it might be, we love coconut!\n\nThanks for sharing a little bit of your family with the world!"

I forgot to add the 1-1/2 cups of milk and was worried about stiffness but instead, it still took 1.5 hrs to bake/set--with the oven turned down to 300F. The coconut flakes rose to the top and started to brown so I covered it in the last .5 hr. When is the right time to add the flakes--does anyone know? Finally, I didn't have vanilla so I added 1/4 cup vanilla syrup but it still wasn't sweet enough."

"reviewBody": "oh. em. gee. The first two times I made this, I thought it was sooo good. But both those times I accidentally forgot to add the whole milk, and the resulting texture was delicious, but firmer and tasted eggier than as the recipe calls for. If made to the recipe's specifications, this is so fluffy and delicious it will MELT in your mouth! And none of that yucky eggy taste. I'm sitting here taking it all away from my guests to gobble it up in the privacy of my room because it is THAT good. I added a generous helping of vanilla [2 tspn?], a little coconut extract and a teeny bit of almond extract. In Canada, sweetened condensed milk isn't sold in 14oz cans [as far as I could see] so I had a little less, but I think not being overly sweet adds to the charm of this dessert, and it is still sweet and custardy. It is also important not to let your sugar burn/brown to much, as the flavor WILL show through. I gave up and put it in the pan still slightly lumpy this time around because I can't seem to avoid slightly burning it, and it turned out just fine. I've also made it with a sprinkling of cardamom and it turns out HEAVENLY, tastes like a chai flan or something. This recipe is enough to make two pans - WHICH YOU WILL NEED. One for you, one for everyone else :D Some notes: it will deflate slightly when cooled and lose some of its volume, so you can think about cooking in a deeper pan. Also, DO NOT FORGET THE WHOLE MILK. num num num. thank you so much for the recipe!"

I used a 3 qt glass (pyrex) baking dish as indicated. Overall great tasting dessert. Will make it again really soon."
