Instead of having a harsh, made-in-a-lab flavor that smells like suntan lotion, this coconut flavor is mild and delicate. I usually serve it with Kahlua or Tia Maria drizzled over the top, but chocolate syrup will definitely work too. I love coconut flavor but I'm not always crazy about the texture. Chopped pecans on top are a nice alternative."

You may need to let it in thaw for a bit first...or just eat it slowly...or put some in the microwave for a few seconds). To make this even more decadent, I cut up an entire milk chocolate Lindt bar and toast about 1/2C (maybe more?) slivered blanched almonds and throw them in."

If you love coconut like I ALWAYS have, one would remember that delicious ice cream, yet people think Iâ€™m bonkers). The only thing I did was add chocolate chunks. Unbelievable!! Made it soooooo many times, as I LOVE coconut. Thick, rich, and creamy. Better than anything you could buy, and I know, Iâ€™ve tried them all.

"reviewBody": "I doubled the recipe, because I love coconut ice cream. I used Coco Lopez brand cream of coconut which I found in the alcoholic beverage section of the grocery store. I didn't see 14 oz cans, so I used 15 oz cans and the end result was not overly sweet. It was perfect. I omitted the coconut flakes because my son doesn't like chewing on coconut. I think it's the dry texture of the coconut that he doesn't like. Because of this he says he doesn't like coconut, but I am determined to give him a positive coconut flavor experience! I love the combination of pineapple with my coconut flavor, so I also did the following: In a small sauce pan, over medium heat, I dumped two 8oz cans of crushed pineapple with their juice. I used two, because I doubled the recipe. I added 2 tablespoons of sugar (one per can, if not doubling recipe) and 1 teaspoon of cornstarch (half a tsp if not doubling). I reduced it a bit, stirring frequently, till a (chunky) syrup consistency. Then I put this pineapple mixture in a plastic dish, in the refrigerator, uncovered until cool to the touch. I added this to the ice cream maker about half way through the churning process, just to incorporate. (If you use a can of crushed pineapple and drain it and add that to the ice cream, you may get icy bits or crystallization of the pineapple juices, and it can be an unpleasant texture in your otherwise creamy coconut ice cream. The cornstarch adds a type of jelly-ness that will freeze much nicer and will"

It was very good but I felt a bit on the sweet side, perhaps because I didn't use heavy cream? I'll definitely make this again but will use unsweetened coconut to cut back on the too sweet flavor and will use half &amp; half again to cut back on the fat content &amp; calories. As another reviewer suggested I added the shredded coconut to the blender to chop it up into smaller pieces. One additional change I plan to make next time is to reduce the amount of shredded coconut by at least half as I thought 1-1/2 cups was too much and took away some from the creamy texture."

I used whole milk and a little evaporated milk. As for the coconut part - I had a can of unsweetened coconut cream from Trader Joe's. If you're not sure which you have, just look the ingredients list. I was glad mine was unsweetened because I could control the sweetness and type of sweetener. I added 1/4 cup plus about 1 T. honey, and for me it was the perfect sweetness. I felt I could indulge more since I wasn't using refined sugar, and it wasn't overly sweet. Next time I'll try it with the cream, and I'm sure it will be richer and even more delicious. I imagine I'll make it over and over again for the next 6 months, and my baby might be a coconut fan like me. :)"

"reviewBody": "Really good stuff. The first time I made this had a big mistake - used Trader Joe's Coconut Cream, which is thick and creamy but not sweet, so after tasting while mixing, did a rush fix by adding agave syrup which wasn't cold. That seemed to throw off my Kitchen Aid enough that it didn't set up well until after @2-3 hours of freezer time. I also added store-bought toasted coconut flakes about 15 minutes into the stirring process. The ice cream was great tasting (We liked the toasted coconut in the texture) despite the near miss of using Coconut Cream rather than Cream of Coconut, such as Coco Lopez. Have followed directions with the right stuff since then and it is a fun flavor change from vanilla."

"reviewBody": "UPDATE: I made this recipe for the second time and it was flavorless. Really disappointing. I realize that it matters what kind of Coconut Cream you use. DO NOT use the Trader Joe's version -- this is bland as all heck. Taste the cream and make sure it is sweet before you make this recipe. I think last time I just went to a store that mostly sold south american products and it came out great! \n\nOLD REVIEW:\nThis recipe is amazing! Anyone who is complaining about it, probably didn't follow the directions and used coconut milk or water instead of cream. Use coconut cream! And definitely put in the flaked coconut (found in any supermarket next to the chocolate chips!). I was truly surprised at how creamy this ice cream came out without cooking it like a custard. I was also surprised at how sweet and delicious it came out without adding any sugar. Plus, it is so easy. I'm going to make it again and again."

"reviewBody": "I used Coco Real brand cream of coconut in a white squeeze bottle, got it in the liquor section, with the mixers. It's thick and sweet...if it's not, you have the wrong coconut product. However, mine came in a 21 ounce bottle, so I had to guess how much to use. I added about 1 1/3 cups and the ice cream was just a little bit on the sweet side, that combined with the addition of Baker's sweetened angel flake coconut. (I put about 1 cup coconut in Ninja/food processor and buzzed it to about half size to lessen final chewiness). Next time I'll go with 1 cup cream of coconut and a teaspoon of coconut extract and see how it turns out. I also stirred 1/2 cup each of chopped pecans, walnuts and sliced almonds at the end, they gave a nice crunch and helped offset the sweetness, which was not overpowering, just a tad too sweet. It tasted like Baskin Robbins Nutty Coconut. A flavor explosion in your mouth, my husband said. For those who said it didn't turn out, you did used the wrong ingredients, please don't slam a good recipe by giving it one star because you changed ingredients. The recipe does not use sugar because the cream of coconut is sweet enough. Excellent recipe."

Next, put the coconut flakes (I used 1 cup of unsweetened) in the blender and blend until the coconut is the texture of corn meal - do this so your ice cream isn't chewy. Add the liquid ingredients. Chilled cream of coconut will separate and solidify so don't be surprised. Also, I used 2 cups of heavy cream rather than just 1.5 cups. This made the ice cream smoother. Blend it all together, transfer to your ice cream maker, and voila! Perfect coconut ice cream. Thanks for sharing this recipe."

BTW...You'll know you have the right coconut product when you open it. If it isn't very syrupy and sweet...stop! The creme of coco is just sweetened condensed milk that happens to be made with coconut. If you have any doubts you can do what someone else did. Use an equal amount of regular sweetened condensed milk with some coconut extract."

"reviewBody": "This is exactly what I was looking for.... and I can't believe how easy this recipe is to make. I was originally looking for a coconut pineapple ice cream recipe, but thought I would first look for just a coconut ice cream recipe. When I saw a couple of the reviews that mentioned adding in crushed pineapple, I decided to try it too. I made the recipe exactly as written, but right before pouring into my Cuisinart ice cream machine, I added a 20 ounce can of crushed pineapple (I bought the kind in juice, not syrup) . But first I used my wire mesh strainer to drain the pineapple juice off the pineapple, and I pressed the pineapple gently to make sure it wasn't too wet before I added it to the creamy coconut mixture. I didn't want the extra liquid to ruin the recipe results. I turned on the machine and poured in all but a cup of the mixture. The pineapple adds volume so I was afraid it may overflow if I poured all of it in. After about 20 minutes it was thickened nicely. I put it into a quart ice cream carton (I bought a bunch of these online - they are perfect for storing your ice cream - you know the white cardboard round ones with the lids). Into the freezer it went. Of course, there was a bit left over that my husband and I divided up and ate immediately - it was every bit as delicious as the coconut pineapple ice cream we had at a fancy ice creamery in Florida!! Absolutely amazing flavor - this one does not disappoint with weak flavors."

I adjusted the recipe to 1.5 cups milk; 1.5 cups half and half; 1 x 170 g box Grace Pure Creamed Coconut; .5 cup toasted coconut; dash of almond extract; dash of white vanilla extract. This made an improvement in the recipe.\n\nI still need to play with this recipe to give it more flavour and use the heavy cream to see if it will make the ice cream more creamy in texture."

Next time I want to add either pineapple at the end or swirl some dark chocolate sauce into it, yum! The flavor is full and super coconutty. I opted to leave out the shredded coconut as I don't like the chewy texture.\n\nI think the people that made it used either coconut milk or coconut cream instead of CREAM OF COCONUT. They are NOT the same thing. Cream of Coconut is found with the mixers in the wine/beer section of grocery stores, and is a pre-sweetened coconut mixture used as the base of pina coladas and the like. If you used coconut milk or coconut cream instead, there is no sugar in this and it will not only not be sweet, but it will have minimal flavor and will turn very icey with tons of crystals after sticking the container into the freezer to harden because of the excess water content."

This is also one of the easiest ice creams I've made as it calls for so few ingredients and no extra steps like cooking the custard or mixing and chopping. This is a lovely, pure white ice cream, easily adaptable to endless toppings or additions if you choose, though it is perfect just as is. For this occasion I just drizzled some chocolate syrup on the plate and added a few fresh raspberries and chopped chocolate covered almonds. I followed the recipe exactly as written, but chopped the coconut finely in my food processor. I added the coconut to the cream mixture and then let it steep its flavor into the mixture while chilling in the fridge for several hours. This is one of those few recipes that exceed your expectations."
