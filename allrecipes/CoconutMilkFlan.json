"reviewBody": "Yikes. First time making both caramel and flan. The caramel took me much longer than the recipe described and I got huge sugar chunks at first that I had to crush and melt before the rest of the caramel burned. Ended up tasting okay and not crystallized but will try the no stir method next time. The problem was the custard. I don't know whether I cooked the mixture on the stovetop too long or left in the oven too long (since it's covered with foil I put a 1 hour timer on and didn't check it) but the end result was scrambled eggy. Others found the texture so off putting they wouldn't eat it.Not a fun time but may have been my fault."

"reviewBody": "3.3.21 The biggest issue I had with this was the texture/consistency. It was unlike any flan I’ve ever had. It was wet, soft and for lack of a better word, mushy, and it sunk in the middle. Also, the caramel that was released onto the plate was like water, not thick or syrupy. One other thing that I didn't like was that I ended up with over 1/2 cup of the filling left after filling six 4-oz ramekins, and I hate wasting food! I honestly do not know what went wrong here, I thought I'd followed this recipe to the letter, but it certainly did not live up to my expectations. The one thing I can say is that it tastes good, although I couldn’t taste even a hint of the coconut milk. Granted, I haven’t made many flans, so maybe this was human error somewhere along the way. I don’t know, but I think I’ll just move on."

Also a little more description was absolutely necessary in regards of turning sugar into caramel. I will try again, but a different recipe altogether."

Pulled out after 45 minutes and surprisingly it was still delicious . But was frustrated that I didn't follow instructions so I made another batch this time following recipe and instructions to the letter. I also used a trick I do when I make Creme brûlée . I put a dish towel on the bottom of the roasting pan before I pour in the water bath. Well anyway the first batch was delicious but the second was outstanding!! It looked so perfect and when my daughter and her boyfriend came over the next day for lunch they were just amazed. Trust me just follow the recipe and the instructions and you will really enjoy this flan. Thank you for the recipe..."
