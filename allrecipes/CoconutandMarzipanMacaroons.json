"reviewBody": "This recipe failed miserably. Macaroons would not set up, tried baking the 2nd tray a bit longer...same thing. Stayed a gooey mess. What is worse is the marzipan is very expensive....ingredients were over $20. in total and I had to throw it in the garbage. I'm a pretty good baker and have never had a recipe fail like this....ever! I wish I could give negative stars."
