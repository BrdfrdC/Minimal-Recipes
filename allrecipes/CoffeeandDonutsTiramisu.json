"reviewBody": "The taste is great, though I don't think my coffee was strong enough because I could barely taste the coffee flavor. The one issue I had was the fact that 1, 10oz bag of mini donuts was not enough for two layers. I had to run back to the store in the middle of putting this together to get another bag of mini donuts (and that bag barely had enough for a full second layer). I'll make this again though!"

So I did mini cake donuts and dipped them in the coffee. Had it all sit over night. It was good but I won't make again."
