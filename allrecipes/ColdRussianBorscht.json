I added a little bit of lemon juice. I put it all back into the pot to simmer and added about a cup of heavy cream. I garnished with cucumbers and fresh dill. Great flavor. I left off a star because I didnt wind up following the recipe to a T, however, it was great recipe to start from and it was really inspiring. I didnt change it much."

Changes I made to match her recipe: no onion, no pepper, apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, and I strained the final soup. (Her's was served as a broth.) I remember her pressing the heck out of the beets in the strainer to get every last drop of juice, so I did the same. The proportions in the recipe are spot on, and it tastes great. I have to admit, I don't even add the sour cream. It's great on it's own."

This releases more flavor into the liquid as it boils due to increased beet surface area.\n2) I use a blender/food processor to puree the beets after they have cooled.\n3) I add the diced cucumber to be blended into the chilled soup.\n4) I add 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of unflavored yogurt to blender to combine everything smoothly."

I followed the recipe with out any changes so I assume it turned out correctly. However, I found it almost completely tasteless. I will probably not make this again."

Then I just blended it all in my blender. I also added cooked ground (minced) steak which i lined the bottom of my bowl with and poured the delicious hot pureed soup on top. The dollop of sour cream was lovely and i swirled it in each bowl before serving for presentation purposes. This is not only great chilled but also quite delicious hot... great recipe!"
