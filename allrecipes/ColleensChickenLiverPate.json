"reviewBody": "11.4.17 This site has a lot of chicken liver pate recipes, and I’ve tried many of them, but hands down, this is my favorite! Gotta tell you, I hate trimming chicken livers (it’s all in my head, I know), but when pate turns out this well, it’s definitely worth it. The texture is creamy and spreadable, and that little kick from the peppercorns and red pepper flakes is spot on, maybe the balsamic calms it a bit?? And trust me, it’s not too hot, and doesn’t overwhelm the delicate flavor of the pate. One thing that the recipe doesn’t tell you to do is to take out the bay leaves before putting the mixture into the food processor; please do that. I followed this recipe to the letter and added scotch, but I can see bourbon working just as well, if that’s your preference. I know there are a lot of liver haters out there (I’m obviously not one of them), but if you like pate, put this on your to-make list. It would be a perfect appetizer for the upcoming Holidays. I vacationed in France last month and thought I’d had the best pate in my life in Paris, but this recipe measures up very well. Colleen, thanks for sharing your recipe, going into my Favorites file, we loved it!!!"
