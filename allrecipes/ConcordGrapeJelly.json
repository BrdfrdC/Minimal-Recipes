Just give it a little time and it will firm up. I also only used 5 cups of sugar per the other reviews; it's plenty sweet. I can't imagine what the 7 cups would taste like. Next time, I will use my juicer instead of extracting the juice like the first part of the recipe says."

I did like the taste and texture. But either way would have been good I'm sure. It yielded 4 and a half pint jars."

I decided to make jelly and grape juice with the bumper crop that I have this year. I made two batches of this jelly. The first batch is setting very well and is really good but very sweet, as are most jams and jellies. The second batch I made was with half the sugar. It didn't set too well so I am going to reboil it and use more liquid pectin (a friend who makes jams and jellies all the time told me this would work). Anyway I am very pleased with this jelly and found it extremely easy to make."

Made 3 separate batches using Certo pectin. If you don't quite have enough juice, add more water. I used a metal mesh large drive with my potato masher. It gets the most pulp out. My grapes had seeds. Then with the left over skins/seeds I put into a pot added a gallon water and whisked. Then pour into large jar with cheesecloth. I made grape juice. Add sugar to taste. I made 13 pints of jelly and 3 quarts grape juice. So much better than store bought!"

The first time I did it, my pot was too small and when it boiled over the mixture hitting the burner caused an immediate kitchen fire - tried to salvage the jelly but it hadn't cooked enough to jell properly so I had to throw it out. The second time (after buying a 12 quart pot), Kroger was out of concord grapes so I had to use white grapes. Recipe worked wonderfully and the jelly is delicious!"

"reviewBody": "I had extra grapes, so I had more juice after crushing, and it seemed to not need much water. Flavor is excellent! I strained the juice through a cheesecloth-lined sieve, and the jelly was very clear, not a speck of pulp. Have extra cheesecloth on hand. I had to change it a few times as the pulp clogged it...well worth the little extra effort, although overall, this recipe is quite easy. I'm a beginning jelly maker and I didn't screw this one up!"

It's really sweet (obviously with that amount of sugar) but tastes so fantastic! I was afraid to cut the sugar because some said they did and it worked and some said to not cut the sugar since it could alter the outcome. I got ten 250ml jars out of this recipe. Used fresh picked grapes from a friend's house in BC. Would definitely make this again."

"reviewBody": "I tried to use Truvia to replace half the sugar, but I think that messed it all up. The color looks good, it has a good flavor, but it is really sweet. The other problem is that it is very runny, it looks like grape juice!! The little bit that was left over, didn't fit in the jars, set up nicely in the fridge, but softens up pretty quickly once on toast. I did use the pink carton of sure jell for less or no sugar, so I think the problem has to be because of using Truvia. I used 1 cup Truvia ( the container said to use 1/2 as much as sugar) and 1 and 1/2 cups sugar. Any helpful comments?"

I had to adjust the rest of the ingredients for less. \neach batch made 8 Jelly Jars worth. I love it so much Im telling everyone about it, and how easy it was."

"reviewBody": "This is a great recipe...written fairly easy to follow...it is similar to that of most jelly recipes as they all follow the basic recipe of fruit, water, sugar, pectin...even if you look at the pectin recipe insert in the box it gives you very similar ingredients and measurements...I did cut back the sugar to 5 cups. (that's why the 4 star instead of 5)...it's more personal preference. I find the sugar covers the grape taste if there is too much. My concords were super sweet on their own. The sugar is probably needed as part of the thickening process but mine was even gelling as I was getting to the last jar. The hot bath can be eliminated...if your jars are still hot from sterilization and your jam is hot as you are pouring it into the jars they will seal. Usually the bath is to ensure sealing. Very grateful for the recipe as it gave me the direction I needed with grapes and making jelly with them for the first time!"

If you are looking for the grape flavor to come out more, I'd recommend cutting back on the sugar by at least 1 to 1 and 1/2 cups. This was my first time making my own jelly; thanks for the starter recipe!"

I searched for other grape jelly recipes and found that most were saying 1 pouch (85 ml) of liquid pectin to 4 cups grape juice. I put in 1 pouch and a half of another pouch for good measure. It came out fairly firm. So next time I will use 1 pouch of liquid pectin, which is about 3 oz. I also cut the sugar down to 6 cups. The jelly is still quite sweet but all around I am happy with the way it turned out."

I did read some other reviews and used more grapes than called for to make the 4 cups of liquid since water would only weaken the taste. I also used about 5&amp;1/2 cups of sugar instead of 7 to cut back on sweetness. My jelly set up almost immediatly with no problems and i did not process it, just tipped it over onto the top and let it cool down that way for about 1/2 hour then tipped it back upright and the lids could be heard popping inward to seal the jar."

Crushing, juicing &amp; straining the grapes may seem like a pain, but the end product is worth it. \nDon't try to make a double batch because 1. when the mixture boils hard for 1 minute, it really foams up high. It would have boiled over my big jam pot if I increased the recipe, and 2. large batches (i.e. more than 4 c. grape juice) of grape jelly don't seem to set up well."
