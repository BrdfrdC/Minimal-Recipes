My sister looked up what to do with dry cookie batter on the internet! It did say, not to worry, all was not lost! I added a small amount of water and the dough took shape. It was not necessary to refrigerate. They went through my Mother's 50 year old press without a problem. Other than the batter problem, they had a very good flavor and texture."

"reviewBody": "Followed the recipe pretty much exactly (except didn't brush tops with egg white/water mix) and these are buttery and easy to use with my pampered chef cookie press. This is thrilling! They are not an overly sweet cookie, but that is how spritz cookies are and how I like them. These are light and delicate, and even the shapes that usually fall apart didn't. Easy to decorate too with sprinkles or sugar. I did not chill the dough at all, just mixed and started pressing, then decorated and baked for 12 minutes on my PC stones. My husband taste-tested the dough and couldn't stop. I don't have a heavy-duty mixer, so it was a little tough doubling the recipe with my standard size bowl and mixer. I will probably use a larger size bowl or do two separate batches next time. I couldn't find my usual recipe and chose this one from the reviews - I think I've found my new go-to spritz cookie recipe! Thank you!"

Used one whole egg and one yoke, with no 2T of water.\n3. Added 1/4 t of both nutmeg and cinnamon.\n4. Added 2 t of butter flavoring.\n5. Specifically did not chill the dough. I have a Pampered Chef cookie press and the dough has to be a uniform, sticky texture. If this dough is chilled (like, if you have something better to do first) then make sure you work the dough with your hands to make sure it is all smooth before using.\n6. I don't like putting egg whites on the tops of cookies, so remember that if you don't do this, the cookies will not turn brown on top. So don't wait for that to happen before taking them out."

But even w/ my ultra-sweet royal icing, it still (to me) didn't balance out the blandness of the cookie and sweetness of the frosting. I'm not even sure if that makes sense, but all I know is I've had better, and will try a shortbread cookie recipe next time."

"reviewBody": "Not bad at all! I use only organic ingredients (except for sprinkles on top, which look so cute!) - I find that organic stuff just tastes better. I also didn't separate the eggs, maybe I should try, but they tasted wonderful blended in as is. I also used half whole wheat flour for a little more body and substance, so they don't taste like \"just cookies\". One other change is the butter - I used salted, I always find with unsalted butter the result is kind of bland.\r\n\r\nThe batter didn't even need to be refrigerated for the first batch, but I stored it in the fridge while a batch is baking! Very easy, very quick, I might try a bit more sugar next time (or maybe some brown sugar would give it a little more zing). \r\n\r\nI know it sounds like quite a few substitutions were made, but I never make anything strictly by the recipe. This is a great base to add your own changes!"

"reviewBody": "Great recipe for cookie press and easy to assemble. I used a recently acquired old Mirro 358 cookie press that came without instructions/recipes. I had to make minor adjustments with the bake time &amp; temperature but made no change in the ingredients. Great cookie for afternoon tea. Thanks for sharing."

"reviewBody": "Absolutely delicious. I Have been looking for a good recipe to use with my cookie recipe. They are all too floury. This was the BEST! Light and buttery, not too sweet, and NOT floury at all. I substituted the water with buttermilk, and added 1/4 cup of sugar. Be sure to refrigerate to stiffen dough if you want your dough to hold the shape from the press. Thank you so much! This is the best cookie recipe for my press so far! I will be making these alot with 6 kids in my house!"

I won't even give my friends the recipe (I want my cookies to be the best). I was unsure as to how long to chill the dough before filling the press so I only left it in the fridge for an hour and was surprised as to how easy the dough was to work with. Thanks for making my cookies a hit at my son's pre-school --- Michelle"
