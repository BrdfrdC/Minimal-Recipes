"reviewBody": "I’ve made a lot of coleslaw, and after mixing up the dressing, I knew it was too runny. I added more mayo, whisked again, and that took care of the dressing consistency. I didn’t use the packaged slaw, just chopped up some cabbage and shredded some carrot. This turned out OK and, honestly, I can’t really say whether or not it tastes like KFC coleslaw, but I know it was too sweet for our taste. Thanks for sharing your recipe."
