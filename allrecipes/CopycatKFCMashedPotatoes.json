This recipe’s ingredients are pretty much what I typically use, although I’ll also add some sour cream or softened cream cheese if it’s in the fridge. So I can’t really say if these mashed potatoes measure up to KFC’s. The only thing I can say is that these are some pretty tasty mashed potatoes. They taste good, and the consistency is spot on."

Combine liquids in microwaveable bowl, mix in flakes and salt, turn with a fork until well-moistened mass. Microwave 5 minutes loosely covered. Stir in butter, add pepper if you like. Done. 6 servings in less time than peeling and cutting potatoes."

Then go crazy and add diced red bell pepper and chopped scallion to the parsley that you use as the garnish (in equal parts). KFC will envy you and your version of their mashed potatoes! (and do not even think about adding crumbled cooked bacon to this recipe!) LOL!"
