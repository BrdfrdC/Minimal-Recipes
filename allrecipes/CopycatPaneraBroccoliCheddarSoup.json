I liked the of course lots of pepper, some salt and I added the ground mustard and the nutmeg but I probably pass on the nutmeg and I added paprika cause I didn’t have smoked paprika, and then I added some Tonys. The first time I made it I made 2 cups of chicken stock and 2 cups of half-and-half, but it was too rich so this time I made 2 cups of chicken stock, one cup of half-and-half, and one cup of milk I added a little bit more broccoli then it said, and I use my milk butter to grind it up not completely, but I still left texture"

"reviewBody": "So I've used different variations of this recipe from other websites which were just ok but left the soup kind of runny and not quite right. This one is the best but there's a critical step you can't deviate from which is step 3 of letting the liquid simmer first and adding milk gradually to control the thickness. Letting the roux and the stock simmer is the KEY. It allows you to create the liquid portion of your soup to your liking. You must also carefully manage the crunchiness of your vegetables to your liking in this step. I prefer mine slightly crunchier than the Panera version which over cooks the veggies in my opinion. This is definitely one of the best recipes for this soup and step 3 is your stick shift so you need to carefully control to your preference from here. You can also add additional seasoning at this juncture if you want."

"reviewBody": "Honestly, overall it's a good recipe to use as a base when making broccoli cheese soup. I say it's a base because you really have to add extra to it to even make it a full soup that would actually serve 8 people. Starting off due instruction #2 before 1. it takes way more time to make the flour mixture before you make the onions translucent. Second, when making the flour mixture you may need to add more flour to thicken a little faster than the given time of 20 mins. I would add at least another 1/3 cup to help. After adding the flour mixture to the veggies that are cooking to soften you'll need to add at least another 2-3 cups of stock in order to cover the veggies and make it look like it will feed up to 8 servings. Then let it all simmer for about 20 mins to cook together. After all this it will taste like a broccoli cheese soup."

"reviewBody": "It needed a half cup flour because it was too thin initially. After a few hours of resting, it thickened more. I added 1 teaspoon garlic paste, a half teaspoon ginger paste, hot sauce, and radishes. I used 16 ounces of Velveeta. It was just like Panera’s and was delicious. I used a hand blender so it stayed in the pot."

"reviewBody": "The original recipe from Panera is excellent without question however, I just had to customize this Copycat a bit based on what I had available. Firstly, no chicken stock available so I used powdered chicken bases which required no additional salt added. Also, no milk or half and half so I used available heavy cream! I cut way back on the butter as there is an abundance of milk fat in heavy cream. In order to cut back on the glutenous wheat flour, I added diced potatoes to the mix and used Gluten Free rice flour to thicken. As a added flavor component I added a tablespoon of French Onion Powder and Wahlah! Pure heaven! also: used Sharp Cheddar Cheese!"

I doubled the recipe because I was making it for a restaurant/bar. It turned out better than I expected. The only thing that disappointed me was it did not yield as much as I expected. I will definitely use this recipe again but I will double the ingredients."

This one, though, it was very good. We followed all the ingredients, as directed, and we made bread bowls to put it in. It was an absolute smash hit and my family has had nothing but good things to say about it. Worth a try for SURE."

"reviewBody": "Good basic soup but the process is way off. 1. Melt butter and cook onion, celery and carrots (needs garlic) until tender, add flour and cook 2-3 minutes to cook the flour. 2. Slowly had broth while whisking and simmer until thickened. 3. Add broccoli and simmer about 10 minutes until broccoli is tender not mushy. Season as you like. I like a dash or two of Worcestershire. 4. Add milk or 1/2 and 1/2, bring to a bare simmer. 5. Slowly stir in cheese a handful at a time and stir until each handful is melted. 6. Check seasonings and simmer a few minutes to warm the soup through. 7. Top with crisp bacon crumbles and chopped chives. Didn't mean to hijack this recipe but you don't need 2 pans, just makes more work."

"reviewBody": "Loved the recipe, instead of regular salt, I used Himalayan pink salt and some celery salt to bump up the flavor a little. As someone who has had more gallons of the Panera soup than I care to count, this is spot on for their recipe. I do recommend chopping the broccoli finely before adding it in. Next time I will probably add 1/4 tsp nutmeg and a tsp of garlic powder. And I’ll probably have my sourdough bread bowls baked by then too."

"reviewBody": "I liked the soup in the end, but there seemed to be too many steps with this recipe to me. I melted all the butter and sauteed the onion, carrot and celery till tinder. Then added minced garlic for a minute before adding a bit of cayenne and the flour, I used almond, worked fine. Then added the stock, smoothed the mixture before adding twice the amount of broccoli. Simmered till tinder, cutting up the broccoli before adding heavy whipping cream for the milk. Brought it to a boil to thicken. Remove from heat for a few minutes before adding the freshly grated cheese, you may want to add extra too. I would use fresh broccoli in this, I was trying to use up some frozen that had been hanging around, I think it added too much moisture to the mix. The nutmeg was a nice touch in this. Will make again!"

I also sautéed the onions, carrots, and celery in a sauté pan together while I melted the butter in a stock pot and whisked in the flour. You don’t have to cook the milk and flour make sure for 20 minutes to cook out the flower. I’d say less than half the time will do it. From my experience broccoli turns brown at about the 10 minute mark so I fork tested my broccoli until it was tender but with a bite. You can adjust your own seasonings so I added a little more salt and pepper and a half teaspoon of garlic powder. Definitely a keeper."
