A few changes I made to the recipe: -I reduced the 1 cup of sugar to 3/4 cup, so when I added the brown sugar it's an equal 1 full cup of it. -I added 1/4 cups of chopped pecans to the batter. You can easily throw in some chia seeds to give it more fiber if you wish. Overall it's a delicious base for any quick bread and I recommend smearing it with some cream cheese."

We don't like cloves here so we used pumpkin pie spice and used 2 tsp only Then I used only 3 small eggs, only 1 cup of sugar and 2/3 cup oil instead adding more pumpkin. Took 1hour 5 min to bake and we are all happy! Beautiful loaf, beautiful flavor- this is a great keeper!"

I followed others' advice and increased pumpkin to 1 cup (I used fresh, since it has a milder flavor definitely need the full cup), reduced oil to 2/3 cup (and used some olive oil as healthier than regular vegetable - can easily do more than half with no real difference in flavor), and reduced the amount of clove. For clove, I found 1/2 tsp was actually too light. Go with a little more, say a heaping 1/2 tsp or even 3/4. Quite yummy! And stayed moist for a couple of days after."

Over the years (with the aforementioned recipe) , I have made a few variations. One, no oil - replaced with apple sauce and then reduce the sugar by about a half cup. Also, I add raisins, cranberries, pecans, and walnuts to some of my batches. Yum yum. :)"

We have 6 year old twins who are pumpkin bread experts and they say this is even better than theirs. Great recipe!"

I absolutely love fall spices like cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves but I will say I think the clove is a bit strong.

Overall, I would say this recipe provides an excellent foundation for pumpkin bread that you can tweak here and there to your liking."

I used the King Arthur Measure for measure gluten-free flour, and it tastes just like Starbucks’ recipe. I read through a review that said to use a half of cup of oil, and the entire can of pumpkin so I did that. I also? subbed in 3.5 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of the other spices listed in the recipe. I baked it for close to 70 minutes. It is moist and delicious! Excited for my husband to try it when he gets home from work."

I followed the recipe exactly and even added the toasted pumpkin seeds on top and it was super moist and delicious! Everyone enjoyed it and I will be my new go-to recipe for pumpkin bread! Thanks!"

I also added a tat of cardamon just because I got it in my pantry and want to use it before it gets old. But all this is not necessary as the basic recipe is great."

My husband wanted more spices. But it's a good compromise. I made it with GF flours, brown rice, chickpea, almond meal, and some Bob's. Will make it again. I would like it to be a little more dense next time. I agree with those that thought it needed more pumpkin, maybe some oil or butter?"

I also used 3/4 C white sugar and 1/4 C brown sugar to cut down on the sugar. You won't miss the extra sugar a bit especially if you make the basic cream cheese frosting on the all-recipes website. Everyone that tastes it asks for the recipe ! Moist and about as perfect a pumpkin bread as you can find. It does taste similar to Everything Bunt Cakes pumpkin cake if you've tasted that."

I wouldn't say it's exactly SB flavored, but it's definitely extremely close. Im only removing one star because I would do slightly less sugar (I have the opposite of a sweet tooth) and maybe throw in some pumpkin spice to make it even more flavorful. Either way, it's an EXCELLENT recipe."
