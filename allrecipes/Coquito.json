"reviewBody": "I loved it. The rum is there to dilute the sweetness of the drink so if you make it virgin remember to add something that won't add too much more sugar to the drink like coconut water or it will be too sweet. I use coconut flavored rum (Don Q) and coconut water so as to not diminish the coconut flavor. I wouldn't recommend any spiced rums unless you are into that. It would take away from the subtle taste of the coconut. If you are a traditionalist then go through the extra work of squeezing the milk from ground coconut so it tastes like your grandmother's, otherwise save yourself time and the extra labor by getting good quality coconut milk. I am parcial to the Goya brand. Buen provecho."

Since eggs don't have to be cooked I just throw everything directly in the blender, except for the 2nd can of evaporated milk (because it doesn't fit), pour it into a pitcher, and stir in the 2nd can. Usually gone within hours in my family."

While I love coquito, I find it to be a bit too sweet for my taste and for that matter, I didn’t use the full can of cream of coconut nor condensed milk - used about 3/4 of condensed and about half can of cream of coconut. Did not use cloves, and initially did not add the water since it’s not in any other coquito recipes, but after chilling, it became quite thick and I did end up adding the water, which did not change the taste nor the texture, just thinned it a bit. Have made it a couple of times since my first attempt. Definitely recommend."

Love both but prefer Ponche just a little because it is thicker. \n\nTry it also with a real cinnamon stick and leave it whole in the bottle. \n\nA variation also adds a bit of maraschino cherries and juice to give it a different taste.\n\nOh.. and these drinks are served in much smaller glasses than in the video. I would say a serving should be 2-3 ounces."

This season I tried a couple of changes that I think really made it even easier and quicker to make without changing the quality at all. I didn’t use the eggs (that cut down significantly on the time), and I used 1 cup of Rum and 1 can of Coconut Milk (instead of water). The yield is still 2 full 750 ml bottles and it was just as thick and creamy as it was when I used the eggs."

I did not change any of the ingredients but I didn't blend it because I don't have a blender. I was worried at first because the condensed milk and eggs didn't get thick for me. I then put that in a mixing bowl and added all of the other ingredients. I just stirred it with a whisk. Now that it has been chilled, it thickened up. I LOVE coquito and I am so glad I can now make it! I will be making it again next week for my family. Thank you so much!"

I followed the directions pretty much exactly except that I replaced coconut milk for the water. I used Bacardi Superior and added ice to my container before serving. It didn’t taste watered down at all and the alcohol content was pretty high. Everything raved about it and I thought it was pretty easy to make. I mixed the eggs and evaporated milk on medium almost constantly. I used a handheld thermometer to check the temp."

Instead of the 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk, I use half a can. I use a cup of white rum and 1 cup of water instead of the 1/2 suggested. Instead of ground cloves and cinnamon, I use the sticks and boil the cup of water. I like to infuse the flavor of cinnamon and cloves in the water and then garnish ground cinnamon when ready to serve. Hope this helps!"

I followed other reviewers suggestions and simmering on the stovetop and I replaced the water with coconut milk. After a taste test the following day I felt like it was too sweet and did not have enough Bacardi. I topped off the bottles with a lot more rum which helped cut the sweetness just right. For the double batch I used about half of a 750 mL bottle of Bacardi and it definitely tasted boozy without being too strong. I’m definitely making this again since it was incredibly easy and tasty!"

I wasn't quite sure what the recipe meant by coconut cream (Pepe Lopez?), so I used two 5.5 ounce cans of unsweetened coconut cream - the super thick, stiff stuff. I also added about a 1/4 of orange juice to brighten the taste. Excellent!"

I make mine with more rum but not everyone like alcohol like some of us do and therefore the water. Those who think this is sweet should not be searching for eggnog!!! I am puertorican so don't let my name fool u. Anything other than coconut flavor is NOT coquito :p. This is my recipe and it was changed by all recipes to use a double boiler. You don't need to use a double boiler in my opinion as long as the eggs are fresh. If allergic to eggs, you could ommit them altogether and it won't change the flavor much; if at all. It will be just less thick and of course and eggless eggnog :). Instead of plain water I sometimes use coconut milk if I have it on hand. Coconut water will make it a bit salty and the use of coconut milk instead of coconut water is recommended or just use plain water. You still need the coconut cream for the coquito regardless so don't confuse the two."

For a bit more flavor you can also add Caption Morgans which kicks it up a notch. There are hundreds of variations to Coquito so don't be intimidated into thinking there is one right way to do it. My great-grandmother from Puerto Rico insisted that you never put egg yolks in. It is not intended to be Egg Nog. (And always use fresh coconut shredded add evaporated milk, use cheese cloth to squeeze \nout milk.)"

This recipe comes the closest to hers. Now, I did what ShannonS recommended **for the most part**, but I'm not sure how in the world, but mine ended up being about 2 gallons! (Probably used more alcohol xP Yum!) \n\nI used authentic Caribbean rum (thank you family!) and for the lighter weights of my friends who aren't too fond of \"strong flavors\", I used some Malibu in their portion with a shot of the good stuff. (Yay! More for me!)\n\nI deviated and made my own leche condensada, but I didn't boil it down until it was completely thickened, which allowed me to remove the water from the recipe. I also only used about 3/4 of what the recipe called for and found it to be just right. I also boiled a cinnamon stick in with the leche evaporada.\n\nHighly recommend this recipe. Also, play around with it. Tasting as you go is the best part! I'm not too fond of cloves, so them down a bit and upped the cinnamon."
