Tastes like good, old fashioned, freshly-made corn relish and has the right balance of sweet-sour. We had it last night served over grilled chicken, and my husband raved about it."

To make it even easier, I use 4 cans of white shoepeg sweet corn rather than fresh husked corn - just as good and often better. I also add more cucumber than recipe calls for. Great with Thanksgiving turkey and you can make it a day ahead."
