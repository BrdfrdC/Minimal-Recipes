They do not require 5 hours of cooking. Also soaking the meat the night before in cold water will remove much of the salt. I wash it several times. Also boiling rather than roasting removes a lot of the salt. I change the water after it has boiled for an hour and you still have enough salt. The recipe is missing a lot of essential information and tips."

My other comment would be don't bother with the seasoning packet that comes with it. Pepper, some garlic and onion work well. This oven roasting brings out the flavor where boiling it always seemed to make it meh. IMO. This is a great way to cook what can be an inexpensive cut of meat, especially around St Pat's day when everyone has it on sale."

"reviewBody": "This turned out really great for me. I used my cast iron dutch oven and only needed to roast it for about 3 hours at 300 (my roast was probably half the size of the recommended one from the recipe). I added some frozen chopped napa cabbage to the bottom under the roast. I ussed a very high quality grassfed nitrate-free corned flatiron beef roast from US Wellness Meats and believe it or not, I actually had to add salt at the table. The flavor was incredible though, and my kids loved it too. But I can see how if you used one of the cheap nitrate-laden grocery store roasts you would not want any extra salt. Still, I'd recommend paying more for the healthier and tastier roast, I will definitely be making this again. YUM!"

"reviewBody": "BEST corned beef ever! I read online that steaming is the key to a moist, flavorful corned beef so I tried this. I did not cook the veggies with my meat but followed directions very closely. I poured a bottle of dark beer into the roasting pan and added enough water to come up about an inch in the pan. Put the flat cut beef on a rack in the pan and sprinkled the pickling spice packet and chopped garlic over the top. Sealed pan very tightly with heavy duty foil and cooked in oven about 2 1/2 hours (I had a 2 lb roast) Let it rest, sealed while I roasted our garlic red potatoes. When we took the foil off I was shocked at how the meat had barely shrunk, and the beautiful color and tenderness. Tasted wonderful - I will never make a corned beef any other way! No more boiled to death St. Paddy's dinner for us!!"

"reviewBody": "RE: CalliCo's review; you may well be right about the extra water leeching out the salt but a better way to do it would be to soak (changing every couple of hours) in water overnight in the fridge. To much water will still put you into the boiling catagory. I had a recipe for \"roasted\" corned beef but lost it. We've improvised and indeed, it is a bit salty. Soaking helps a lot. Aside from that this is a superior method. Esentially braising. I finish up with open roasting and/or broiling to carmelize the surface. Much more appealling than boiled."

"reviewBody": "My 3.67 pound corned beef took 3.5 hours to cook at 350. \"Corned\" refers to the beef being cured or pickled in water saturated in salt; therefore, no salt was applied, just the packet. Boiling is easier, but this was a good alternative; however, some corned beef is saltier than others and mine was VERY salty. I \"saved\" it by soaking it in water until it tasted just right. Soak it for only a few hours - not all night, or it'll take ALL of the salt out rendering the corned beef essentially tasteless. My family had it the next day for lunch."

The Corned Beef does have a strong flavor when done so I would not recommend this to someone who likes their food with subtle flavor. One warning is it does not need more salt added. Part of the strong flavor does come from the salt already added to the corned beef. I would definitely make this again. Since this review I made the recipe many times. I also made it in the crock pot and it worked very well. I cooked it on low for 6 to 7 hours and when it had an hour left I added the potatoes and carrots."

"reviewBody": "What on earth did I do wrong?? This was EXTREMELY salty. I did everything according to the recipe directions with the exception of just putting a dash, and I do mean a dash of salt yet it was so salty we just couldn't eat it. I was so disappointed. The meat was very tender and juicy and it smelled DELICIOUS as it was cooking though. If I can find a way to make it without it being so salty I would. Maybe corned beef brisket is just salty to begin with...I'm not sure because I've never made it before."
