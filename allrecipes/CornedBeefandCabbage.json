"reviewBody": "I have been making my Corned Beef and Cabbage the same way for years and it‚Äôs always a hit and SO TENDER!! Is the key!! *4 lb ROUND cut. ( Can use Point Cut, but you end up with less meat that if you used a 4lb. Point Cut.) Round cut is perfect for longer slow cooking. * Remember, the lower and slower the MORE TENDER. :-). Too fast and high temp setting, your meat will not be as tender. *Put in Crock Pot with its included seasonings from package. Cover meat with 3 or 4 cans of Coca Cola. Yes! The soda! Need more liquid to mostly cover meat? Add some Apple juice.. I like to pour about 1/2 Cup of real real Maple Syrup the top of your Brisket when it begins to cook. If you don‚Äôt have Maple Syrup, that‚Äôs fine. *Turn Crock Pot to HIGH for 1 to 2 hr. Until low boil. Reduce to Low and slow cook for 8 hours. *Remember the lower and slower the more TENDER. 3 hours before done add Red potatoes, not fully peeled. Create a peeled ‚Äúbelt‚Äù around its ‚Äúwaist‚Äù which allows liquid to slowly enter into the center of the potato for better flavor. ( See photo for example of potatoes cut before I added the rest of the ingredients.) Add mini carrots or regular carrots peeled or unpeeled, however you like them. Cut down the center then width wise to desired size. Or just cut widthwise without cutting lengthwise. *Meanwhile, With sharp Chef knife, Cut cabbage in half then cut those to halves in half to make 4 quarters.Lay cut side down over carrots and potatoes 1.5 to 2 hours before Corned Beef is done.Or steam in separate pot, cut sides downward in about 1 to 2 inches of liquid made from from the crock pot, some vegetable or chicken stock/broth and and top with butter once fork tender but still Al dente. *Serve w any kind of Mustard as a condiment. *Leftover corned beef is great for cold or warm sandwiches. I like heated on a roll with melted Swiss cheese! Enjoy! *Can also make Corned Beef Hash."

"reviewBody": "Been making this for 50 years and still loving it. I do shortcut the cooking time by pouring off about half the liquid into another large pot with a steamer insert when the beef has about 1/2 hour to go. I then replace the missing liquid in the beef pot with more water (very hot) to finish the cooking and use the scavenged liquid to steam the veggies while the beef is finishing. The steamer with the \"beefy spiced water\" flavors the veggies without soaking them and everything is piping hot when all is done. I get the potatoes going and then add each of the veggies as the clock runs out - the timing of each addition based on how crisp I want them. I , like some other readers, add onions and sometimes green beans (which might be bordering on sacrilegious) to the pot. We eat the sliced beef with a side of \"sauce' (horseradish mixed into sour cream.) Absolutely, YUMMY! I'll be shopping for a brisket today! P.S. I prefer Flat cut just because there is less fat and it slices into more attractive slices. Some say Point cut is more flavorful because it has more fat but unless you ate them side-by-side I don't think you'd find an appreciable difference I also recently tried buying a whole brisket and corning it myself. Mine had not been trimmed (I don't know if that's an option) and at least 1/2 was fat to be trimmed away. It was a real JOB! The brining process also requires special spices which I had to buy AND some days of baby-sitting - I found the whole process very tedious. The end result was good - a different flavor than I am used to but very good. Not sure I will do it again - ideally, I'll get my sister to try doing it and then get her to share the result with me - LOL !!"

We usually boil until simi-tender then smoke it for about an hour or so and always add garlic and some other seasoning as well! We also do a more traditional version of throwing it into the crock pot with the seasoning packet, extra pickeling spice, garlic, dehydrated onions, and sometimes a little bit of beef bouillon. Then add in potatoes 15 mins before you're ready to eat then about 5 mins before you're going to pull it out add the carrots and cabbage!!!! Either way is super amazing!!! This recipe is good but could always use some extra ingredients too"

Yes, I added a controversial onion üòâ, roughly chopped and right at the beginning so the meat simmered in an onion spiced broth. We did all our veggie prep the night before so while we were entertaining and as the timer went off, went back and dumped in. We thought this recipe as stated was divine! Thank you Laria!

I followed the crockpot instructions in the video which added onions that are not included in the recipe. I didn't have beer so I added 4 beef boullion cubes along with water. In addition, I added 4 garlic cloves in with the veggies because everything is better with garlic! When I added the cabbage after 8 hours, I was skeptical about how good a dinner that had boiled in water all day was going to be. I didn't need to be worried because everything tasted great - veggies needed a little salt but the corned beef was tender and flavorful. I learned I didn't need quite as much water but otherwise the crockpot directions in the video were spot on. We will definitely be having corned beef and cabbage on St. Patrick's Day from now on!"

"reviewBody": "Agree with \"Protomind\". All the taste has to come from the corned beef and vegetables alone. For heaven's sake, don't add spices, wine or flavored broth. Do not \"brown\" the meat. It doesn't do the texture or flavor any favor. It doesn't hurt to throw in a couple of large, sweet onions for the last 30 to 45 minutes. They do complement the cabbage. I simmer (maintaining a very low boil or bubble throughout) the corned beef for five hours and add the potatoes and carrots for the last hour or so. Yes, you don't want mushy cabbage. You do want the corned beef flavor in it. Cut it into wedges and throw it in the pot for the last thirty minutes of cooking. For the hearty souls in the crowd, serve with a good cream horseradish sauce on the side. Penname: \"Dergen\"."

"reviewBody": "I've made corned beef and cabbage this way for many years and it's delicious. Nowadays however, I use my electric pressure cooker; it's quicker and easier cleanup (so call me lazy!) The meat goes in the pot with it's own juices, some water and 1/4 to 1/2 cup of GOOD quality, cloudy, apple cider vinegar, depending on the size of the meat. Please DON'T use the clear, cheap cider vinegar - you won't get a good result. I cook the meat for 40 minutes, then add the cabbage, carrots, some chopped onion and let it go for another 10 minutes. It turns out delicious, with a hint of tangy flavor from the vinegar. My husband is a mashed potato fan, so I make them to go with it; he LOVES this meal!"
