Much more fun when everyone gets their own chick... Very delicious dinner, easy and very festive!"

"reviewBody": "The sauce described using this recipe turns out pretty good, but the recipe itself contains a few massive flaws. First of all, the amount of sauce it tells you to make for 4 hens is grossly insufficient and there is no way you could possibly baste the hens with such a small amount of liquid. I made a double recipe for the sauce and still BARELY had enough for only 3 hens. 2nd the cook time is MUCH longer than stated here. For typical sized hens you will probably need an additional 15-25 minutes depending on the size."

After 25 min, lowered temp and flipped them breast side down when adding the wine/broth and continued basting through remaining cooking time (which was perfect). Don't waste that precious lemon inside the cavity that has now been infused with broth, garlic, rosemary and butter. Serve with the hens and let your guests use as much or as little as they like. Use the roasted garlic on crusty bread. Just WOW!"

"reviewBody": "I cooked four hens for the four of us—but we only ate two of them the first night. I plated a half hen for each person, which was plenty with the sides I made. I used pieces of preserved lemon in the hens, and the flavor came through even better than in a full size chicken. I didn’t have any rosemary sprigs, so I just left them out. I sliced up an onion and scattered the pieces in the foil-lined roasting pan, then placed the hens on top. I distributed a bunch of heirloom carrots around the hens with the garlic (I didn’t quite have 24 cloves). To make the sauce, I used about twice the wine and chicken broth and threw in some leftover duck drippings. I like sauce. I served the hens with the carrots and boiled Yukon gold potatoes that I finished by frying in duck fat. Oh, and I had some enoki mushrooms--gave them a quick fry and garnished with those. The leftover hens were great the next day."

The garlic in the pan was very much underdone - crunchy textured. Instructions did not specify where to place the rack so I baked then hens in the middle rack. Perhaps a higher placement would have been better. Definitely needed to season the hen cavities and under the skin. I followed the recipe and there was little flavor. Add some tweaks (herbs, spices and seasonings) and this could be an excellent recipe."

I have never had an issue with timing following a recipe (within 5 min)... these took 1.5 hours of cooking time to reach 74°/juices running clear.\n\nTasty to be sure but unfortunately my side dish, which could have taken an extra 5 minutes of sitting and reheating, was a disappointment after 25 minutes of sitting and reheating."

I made a butter and herb mixture that included adobo, minced garlic, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, dried thyme, dried basil and dried rosemary. I put that under the skin of the hens and on the outside of them. They came out great. Few other minor adjustments I made but all in all this recipe helped me make a great meal. Thanks!"

Easy to put together and was enough for two meals."

Maybe I didn't cook it right, but I tried to follow the recipe as closely as possible. I also thought it would be more flavorful. I'll try again and update my review another time."

I didn’t use wine, just added more chicken stock to make the difference in liquid. I also added sliced purple onion in the cavity. Also used a tablespoon or 2 of corn starch to thicken the sauce. Next time I’m going to use limes instead of lemons for a stronger citrus note. Or I might just do it the same way again. Again, great recipe and easy to make!"

I put the hens on a low rack so they would not sit in the bottom of the pan and get soggy. As one reviewer suggested, I poured about a cup of chicken broth in the bottom of the pan before baking. The garlic smelled strong but was mild in taste. I did double the sauce and it was needed, especially for leftovers. I will try it again with lemon as I'm sure that's delicious, too."
