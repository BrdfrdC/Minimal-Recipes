I use a can of chopped mango, drained, instead of the fresh mango. Saves a lot of time &amp; effort! I add a little more mayonnaise &amp; raisins to keep it from being so dry. Refrigerate for a couple of hours before serving, &amp; we love it!"

I had homemade mango chutney preserved, so used that, but in the absence of fresh mango, I used canned diced pears. AWESOME. Next time I will make sure to have fresh mango."

The mango chutney and curry powder in the yogurt really adds to the flavors in this dish."

It was nice served on lettuce with toasted brown bread on the side for dinner, and I plan on making a sandwich filling of the leftovers."

Add a dash of worscestershire sauce for a twang and have it in a sandwich or on a Jacket Spud(large potato baked in the oven in its skin until the skin is crispy and the inside fluffy and lovely!) I tend to prefer chopped dried Apricots and sultanas to fresh mango, for more of a kick used spicy mango chutney! Yum!!!"

Served it with a curried chicken fried rice that complimented the sweet mango taste of the main dish. Next time I'll try non-fat mayo or make my own olive oil mayo to see if it affects the taste and flavor; should give the dish less fat or at least less bad fat."

I just went ahead and mixed all the mango pieces and the cashews in, instead of saving them for garnishing. I really like cashews, so I used a full cup, and we didn't have sultanas so I used regular raisins with good results."
