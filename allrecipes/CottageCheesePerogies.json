Eat them with sour cream and you will have a wonderful dinner. You can easily double or triple the recipe and place extras in the freezer."

Will definitely make again, next time Iâ€™ll change up the filling as another suggested with mashed potatoes and cheddar cheese!"

Cook on high just till it boils, take off heat and let it stand for 3 hours. Use a colander with small holes to seperate the cheese from the juice. Ready to use.\r\nI also use milk instead of water for the dough."

These are amazing served with a cream gravy and strawberries. So good!"

It makes a world of difference. Also, our family boils them them fries them in butter and then boils them again in some milk or cream (depending on how healthy-ish we are feeling). I love them fried in lots of butter then covered in warm cream as a treat. If I'm particularly lazy, I won't even fill them, I will make the dough, cut it and fry it in butter, then add the fried dough pieces, cottage cheese and warm milk in a bowl and eat :D"

I boiled them till they floated then set aside to drain then I fried them till lightly brown on both sides. I also made patato ones. just boiled the patato mashed it up threw in a little milk, oregeno and basil and salt to taste. I liked the cheese the best though."

"reviewBody": "This is a great recipe! The baking powder addition makes the dough easier to roll out. Good idea. I beat lightly, together 1/4 cup of water + one egg and brush this onto my dough before filling and sealing. This helps to keep the perogies sealed. I highly recommend buying a HunkieBill's Perogy maker (originated in Winnipeg). This wonderful kitchen gadget makes 18 perogies in 5 easy steps. 1.Roll out dough and place on perogie maker. 2.Fill pockets. 3. Roll out another dough and place on top. 4.Press together and cut with rolling pin. 5. Remove excess dough and tap finished perogies from perogy maker! You can order one online."

I used Michigan brand cottage cheese (dark blue tub) as it has a very low amount of moisture in it and it has small curds. I also added white pepper and sea salt in the mix. I boiled them and then cooked them in a frying pan with a little butter to give them a crispy coating that my family loves. I got 19 out of the batch I made."

"reviewBody": "This batch of perogies is possibly the most wonderful food I've ever made by myself. I gave it a 4-star rating because it needs some adjustments to get it that way. After reading another review, I made this batch half boiled and half pan fried to test it out. It's true, the boiled ones turned to soup and were edible but not that tasty. The fried ones are amazing though! I added pepper, italian seasonings and parmesan cheese to the filling and panfried them in olive oil for a few minutes. They broke but still turned out really wonderfully. Pan-frying in olive oil made them really crispy and fluffy but not too oily. They still had a little floury feel on the outside too. I highly recommend frying instead of boiling. \n\nI've never had perogies before! Thanks so much for this recipe!"

My Ukranian mother-in-law made wonderful perogies but after boiling and draining them she would top them with boiled whipping cream that had fresh dill, sliced onion and salt and pepper incorporated! This is an additional extra flavor enhancement and delicious (and I don't even like dill!)"

Once you have boiled them you can then pan fry them with butter and onions if you wish.\nFor those who are having difficulty with them falling apart when they are being boiled, you must make sure no filling touches the edges of the raw dough as you are closing them shut. Give them a good pinch, let them rest for a bit and pinch them again just before you place them in the water. If they are not closed before you boil them, don't place them in the water. Scrap that Perogie and try again. And be sure not to over stuff them!\nDon't like cottage cheese? Perogies can be made with almost any filling. A lot of people use mashed potatoes with cheese, or onions and bacon."
