Also, I didn't set them on paper towels after frying because I was afraid they would stick to the towels and come all apart. A dash of salt on them after frying and before eating (after they cooled from SUN temperature!) and they were fried squash. I'll do better next time."

"reviewBody": "Ok....in theory this should be delicious-but there are a few issues. Since butternut squash is such a firm squash it should be noted that your slices shouldn't be any thicker than 1/4 inch. Also, this really is a bland recipe. More salt, more pepper, more garlic, and herbs are what I added. And, for us anyway, because our slices were thin and we got more, we needed about double the breading per weight. Other than that I am glad that I can across this recipe because it was a great new way to enjoy butternut, and a healthier way to enjoy something fried :P"

Keep the heat over medium-low or else the oil will begin to burn after frying several batches. Serve with ketchup or even barbeque sauce, yum!"

I expected this to taste different and tried not to compare the two, but I just really didn't think these were very good. The corn meal breading wasn't great and they were quite bland. The squash on the inside was nice, but there are so many great recipes for butternut squash that are far less trouble and tastier than this one.

I originally tried to bake it but that didn't work at all (after 20 minutes the bottoms were still not getting crispy/golden), so I ended up frying them anyway, and they still turned out great! I did follow a couple of reviewers' suggestions. I cut the milk in half, added hot sauce to the egg mixture (which didn't even add a hint of spiciness so I won't bother next time), and added extra salt/garlic powder/onion powder. We had to still add some more salt after frying but they were REALLY GOOD. I'm not usually a huge veggie person but I think I liked these better than fries! Might try them with bread crumbs next time and try baking them that way, but these are definitely worth a try."

"reviewBody": "Oh yum! This was great! I had an extra large yellow squash to use up and wasnt for sure what I wanted to make with it. I started reading that they could be fried up like fried green tomatoes and decided to use this recipe. My hubby gobbled them all up! He loved them so much! I did only add 1/4 cup cornmeal since Im not much of a cornmeal person, and then just added 1/4 cup more flour. It was plenty of cornmeal in my opinion. I could taste the cornmeal perfectly fine on the finished product. I may even reduce it slightly more next time. I will for sure be making this again when we have an abundance of squash. It would be great with all different varieties. Thanks for the recipe!"

I didn't use the egg or the cornmeal. I just soaked the sliced squash in a bowl of milk and then dipped the slices in flour seasoned with seasoning salt and a little black pepper. I will be making this for many years to come. Also makes a fabulous appetizer for almost any meal!"

I have also made them gluten free by subbing in a blend of brown rice flour, potato starch, and arrowroot starch for the wheat flour...can't even tell a difference. I just use garlic powder and then extra salt. Threw in some onion powder also. SO GOOD! Not healthy, but who cares??!"

And this recipe was perfect. I'll use it every time I fry squash. Oh, one thing though. It needed more salt. Sprinkle a little kosher salt on each one after they come out of the grease. Kosher salt makes them PERFECTO!"

Thanks, I'll make this again it was so much better than cooking the frozen pre-breaded ones from the store."

"reviewBody": "OH MY! This is a great recipe! Our neighbors had given us squash &amp; zucchini from their garden. I went in search for recipes, and found this one. My husband and I hadn't had fried veggies since we were kids! To the flour mixture, I added garlic powder(omitted garlic salt), onion powder, sea salt &amp; course ground pepper. I was out of milk, so I used evaporated milk. I dipped the veggies in flour mixture, egg &amp; milk, and back in the flour mixture. As soon as I took the veggies out of the pan, I added more salt. I had fixed a big meal, but most of it was left over, due to us filling up on the squash &amp; zucchini! We had some left over and wanted to enjoy these again. I placed the veggies on a cookie sheet, and placed under broiler until nice and crisp. I repeated on other side. They were just as good as the day before. I'll certainly make again &amp; again! Thanks for sharing."

My dad grows fresh yellow squash each summer and that is what I use - just slice into rounds. I usually add a little garlic powder or garlic salt to the mix, and omit the milk and just use an egg wash. Once hot out of the oil, we top with a generous sprinkling of salt (to suit our family's taste)."

If you like a thick crust, definitely double dip - egg, then dry mixture, then egg, then dry mixture again. Yummy!"

I did change the recipe up a bit by using (I am a season person, the more, the better!)salt, pepper, garlic powder, parsley, and season all in both the egg wash and the flour/corn meal mixture. I put it in a zip lock bag which makes the clean up easy."
