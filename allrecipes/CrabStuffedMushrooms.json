I especially liked that it didn't call for cream cheese and breadcrumbs, as I feel those items are unnecessary fillers. I want the main ingredient to be crab and that's what I got with this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Understanding that most people who come here for recipes will generally take what is presented and modify it to their taste/needs, I found this recipe to be a great base from which to work. I used 12 ounces of mushrooms instead of a pound (because that amount can conveniently be found packaged in the produce section), 8 ounces of crab meat (Boss brand crab meat which comes in 8 ounce containers--and I used claw meat specifically), and changed all fractions to 1/2 for all other ingredients (so if it called for 1/4 teaspoon, I used 1/2 teaspoon, etc). I did not have savory, so didn't use it. I also substituted Old Bay seasoning for paprika (because Old Bay has paprika in it). I also used just a smidge of Lawry's Seasoned Salt. In the future, I will probably try experimenting with mixtures of Parmesan and either Mozzarella or Cheddar cheeses to make it a stringier texture."

I used claw crab meat rather than imitation, makes a world of difference. Was served as the main course. When using the large caps be sure to choose ones that are very thick. Otherwise they lose body. The thick ones cut like a steak with a crab stuffing topping. We did not use any of the bread crumbs. We aim for a very low carb diet."

I used baby bellas. I added sweet peppers and a little Worcestershire sauce, and skipped the savory because I don't have it. Next time I would use provolone or mozzarella to top with rather than the parmesan. Very good with some slight changes."

If you don't want soggy mushrooms - bake the mushrooms cap side down on a baking sheet for 15 minutes in a 300 degree oven Remove from cookie sheet and place on a paper towel. Let them drain. Then when most the water has drained, fill them with the stuffing and proceed with the recipe. Soggy stuffed mushrooms aren't very appetizing."

"reviewBody": "Very tasty! Not a lot of work either! I used 4 jumbo white mushrooms, so the cooking time was 25 - 30 minutes. I used 1 can of canned crabmeat. Also, instead of the individual spices i just used the Costco brand Italian seasoning. Due to their size I served these to be eaten with a knife and fork - which seemed to make eating this yummy appetizer even more enjoyable!"

The first time it seemed to be missing something but was close to being what I wanted. \n\nI added 2 cloves of garlic, 1 teaspoon paprika, 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil and 3 tablespoons of cream cheese. Baked 350 until mushrooms are nicely done, about 25min. I found this to be much more flavourful."

Like some other reviewers, I also used garlic instead of savoury, included some extra grated old white cheddar in the mix instead of the extra parmesan (still sprinkled parmesan on the tops, of course) and I did, in fact, grease the baking dish with some butter. Also used fresh-packed immitation crabmeat. They were easy to make came out beautifully, and so yummy. A big hit with me and my guests. I will certainly be making these again, both when entertaining and for my own personal dinner. I also reheated the leftover filling the next day to make a wrap with some fresh spinach for my lunch and it was excellent."

There is a group of spices known as savory and two of the best know are summer and winter. Just use the thyme and sage blend and you will enjoy the flavor of this recipe. Leave the 1/4 teaspoon of tyme out of the recipe as the tyme in the savory will be enough for the recipe."

I made these almost exactly as written (my parmesan on top was a little scant, and I forgot the paprika). Overall, I thought they ware good, but they were slightly undercooked (and my mushrooms were pretty small!), they were a little watery, and the onions were a tad too prominent. When I make them again -- and I will! -- I'll add some lemon juice, cut back on the onion a bit, and possibly add some bread crumbs or crushed bread stuffing to absorb some of the moisture. I'd also be really interested to try subbing cream cheese instead of the mayo. All that said, these are fairly tasty, easy, fast, and taste more caloric and indulgent than they are."
