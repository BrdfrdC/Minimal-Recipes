Great dipped in coffee or desert wine"

I made 2 variations, 1 cranberry-almond with almond extract and 1 apricot-almond with vanilla extract. I dipped the tops in some Merkins dark chocolate wafers melted down which added a nice touch I think. As suggested by another, I added my fruit and almonds to the dry ingredients while mixing which produced an even distribution in the finished biscotti. I didn't wait for the biscotti to cool after the first cook , but cut it into slices and then spread those out on the pan and right back into the oven at the lower temp."

Yet the biscotti turned out almost as hard as a rock (even tougher than my dog's milk bones). I've always made biscotti using another recipe that uses 1/4 cups of olive oil. Should've stuck to that cos they always turn out perfectly. Too bad I've drizzled chocolate over this one, otherwise they could've gone to the pooch."

I moisten my hands and transfer from bowl to parchment paper lined jelly roll pan and form. Re-moisten hands as necessary. SO much less mess and no added flour makes this really light and tasty. I use 1/2 Tbls almond extract and 1/2 Tbls vanilla extract and a dash of salt. We now enjoy this every morning with breakfast. Thanks to my daughter-in-law for making this for me at Thanksgiving where I fell in love with it. Less sweet than so many other options."

"reviewBody": "I really like this recipe. This morning, I guess because I felt so relaxed sitting in the sun, drinking tea and munching this biscotti, I looked up the history of biscotti on Wikipedia. Apparently, it was originally created as a waybread for travelers, soldiers, sailors, etc. The name \"biscotti\" means \"twice baked\". The second baking removed all excess moisture, allowing the bread to keep for long periods of time. The lack of oils also helps with this longevity. This recipe is closer to the original soul of biscotti than most other recipes I have seen and I like it for that reason as well as its simplicity and adaptability. I have replaced 1/3 of the flour with whole wheat, cut back the sugar in the dough, (instead rolling the logs in sugar before baking) and added a great variety of fruits and nuts (last night was apricots, pistachios and cashews). This is a recipe I'll make again and again as a light and tasty companion for my daily cups of tea. I might even try it the more Italian way with an after-dinner glass of vin santo!"

It's become my standby recipe. There's nothing like a cup of tea with biscotti."

I used 3/4 White sugar and 1/4 Brown sugar as I find it gives a more balanced taste. I did sub out the vanilla extract and use an almond emulsion along with an orange oil which really amped up the taste. The cooking time was way off for me, I had to bake them 10 mins longer."

I found this recipe and loved it. I took two things from Giada - I added ORANGE ZEST and I toasted the almonds on the stovetop for 3-5 minutes. I added the orange zest to the mixture at the same point as the cranberries and almonds. Fabulous! I will absolutely use this recipe in the future!"

"reviewBody": "The BIG problem I had with this recipe was telling you to let it cool before cutting it up. Most everyone knows the consistency of biscotti... they're hard and brittle. If you let them cool and THEN cut them, they'll shatter. You HAVE HAVE HAVE to cut them fresh out of the oven before they start to set. They're like \"crispy\" chocolate chip cookies... gooey at first then as they cool, they harden so you're limited on time. \nOtherwise, The recipe was pretty good. I couldn't find my quartered almond pieces, but I added LOTS of dried cranberries so I'm afraid the extra solids in the cookie may have made them hard to stay together... not sure though. I would have added them, if I could have found them!"

I replaced 3/4C of the white flour with whole wheat and added walnuts instead of almonds. My family really enjoyed them and I'm making another batch right now to bring to my sister who lives 4hrs away. The use of a pizza cutter really makes cutting these a breeze! I've never made biscotti before this xmas and I'm hooked! Oh, another thing about this recipe is that you can use the basic ingredients and add anything under the sun. Enjoy."

I also added the rind of an orange, and some of the juice ( a few tablespoons, I didn't measure) because the dough seemed a little dry. I took another reviewer's advise and used sugar instead of flour when shaping them into two logs. I stood the slices on the cookie sheet for the second baking, this way they don't have to be flipped half way through baking time. This is a very traditional recipe with no butter or oil added. I used my KitchenAid mixer, had no problem with crumbling or dough being too wet as others have mentioned. Love these!"

"reviewBody": "This is a keeper! I ALWAYS follow the recipe as written to begin with. This one doesn't need any tweaking! But I would add that if this is the first time anyone is going to try making Biscotti, here are a few tips on getting the Biscotti batter onto the cookie sheets. You will need two parchment paper lined cookie sheets, one for each Biscotti log. I sprinkled a bit of flour on an area of the parchment paper approximately 14 inches long by 1 1/2 inches wide. I put half the batter (about four big spoonfuls) down the center of each cookie sheet. Then I smoothed the batter into shape with a butter knife. This skips the step suggested in the original recipe that says to make the logs first and THEN transfer to your cookie sheets. This is very sticky batter, and can be very messy. My results were wonderful! Now that I know I've got a keeper, I'm going to start to \"tinker.\" I think the first thing I\"m going to do is drizzle white chocolate over these for a real gourmet treat. Thank you for a great recipe. Happy Biscotti everyone!"

I also used half sugar and half splenda, and half almond and half vanilla extract. I cut the biscotti as soon as it came off its first bake and had no problem with crumbling either. I must have just gotten lucky. This was incredibly good and I can't thank you, Kathianne, enough for posting this recipe."

Biscotti is a pretty expensive treat to come by and I'm elated to know that I can now easily make it! The only infinitesimal issue I had with this recipe was the fact that the consistency of the batter.. was sticky and also NOT a dough. It was more like a sticky cake batter type thing. So, I did not log it. Instead, I let it just spread out as a circle. Either way, I cut it into straight lines and the biscotti looked and tasted FABULOUS! I used both almond and vanilla extract, used half brown sugar, and added 1 tbs of lemon zest. next time, I think I'll just use all almond extract and cut down on the sugar a bit. THIS is my new all-time favorite biscotti!"

Upon reading the recipe I found the one tablespoon of vanilla extract seemed to be a little much, so I added just half a teaspoon of vanilla and a quarter teaspoon of almond extract. When I brought the dough together I thougut it a bit looser/gooeier than I anticipated. I found it eaven harder to get it formed into the \"log\" shape in which it needed to be. I was worried it would flatten out in the oven, but was pleasantly surprised when I peeked through the door, about ten minutes into baking, to see evenything was puffing up nicely. I baked them on parchment so when I removed them from the oven, I just pulled the parchment up from the cookie sheet and moved it, dough and all, to the cooling racks. After cooling, slicing was a breeze and I moved them back into the oven on cookie sheets lined with parchment. Ultimately, the stickieness of the dough concerned me, and I think the use of parchment paper made the whole process easier. This stuff even sticks to wax paper!"

I ended up putting it on the parchment paper and shaping that then freezing the whole thing to get it to hold the shape. Once it baked the parchment just peeled off (love that stuff!) Since I had read so many comments about it crumbling, I used a very sharp serrated knife and sliced as soon as they came out of the oven while they were still on the parchment paper. The inside was a bit undercooked, but I was able to slide each slice onto a clean cookie sheet for the second bake. Amazing, but the finished result looks ok and tastes quite good."

I don't know why other recipes are used - when this one is so low in fat and so easy to make! It is really versitile! I used 3 eggs instead of the 2 eggs and 2 egg whites. I also used a little less sugar than what was called for - and it was sweet enough. I have made it as written and I have also made it with other modifications. I made it into Coconut Biscotti by omitting the almonds and dried cranberries, and added 2 cups of flaked sweetened coconuts and 1 tsp. cinnamon. I also made it with chocolate chips and sprinkles some cinnamon sugar on the sliced biscottis when the baked the second time. They were all fantastic! I will be making this again! UPDATE - I made these for PASSOVER! Instead of the 2 1/4 cup flour - i substituted 1/2 of that amount of matzo cake meal and 1/2 the amount of potato starch! I also made another batch and instead of flour used 1/2 the amount of matzo meal and 1/2 the amount potato starch - both came out great - but i liked the one with matzo cake meal as it has a finer crumb than matzo meal. - Both were fantastic! I used chocolate chips instead of the almonds and cranberries."

Biscotti is not supposed to have oils or fats in them and are supposed to be one of the more nutritious cookies that you can make as a result.\n\nWith that said, I have made this recipe a dozen or so times and I have added a few things that others may find handy:\n\n1) You can \"knead\" the cookie dough in the bowl you are working with. You may need to wet your hands to avoid copious amounts of batter sticking to you.\n\n2) Add the almonds and cranberries to the dry ingredients as it is far easier to incorporate them into the dry than the wet.\n\n3) Add lemon zest or orange zest to the mix to make the cookies even more aromatic and enjoyable. \n\n4) Instead of the \"logs\" that are suggested, create 2 giant cookies about 5-6 inches in diameter. Put them on baking paper to ease in cleanup and removal. The cookies will be cut in straight lines and result in large biscotti instead of smallish ones. With a circle, there is not need to cut on a bias, since any angle is straight in a circle.\n\n5) If your fingers can stand it (or use an oven mit), cut the biscotti into fingers almost immediately upon removing them from the oven. The biscotti will still be soft enough not to crumble when you cut them and you can save 10 minutes of cooling time.\n\n6) Ensure that the second time you bake them, you lay the fingers bottom-down instead of possibly on their sides. This will prevent uneven browning on the sides.\n\n7) Coat with chocolate o"
