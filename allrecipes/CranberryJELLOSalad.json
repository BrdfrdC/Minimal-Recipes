The only thing I do a little differently is to make sure the cranberry sauce melts into the hot jello and then I mix the chopped pecans in with the crushed pineapple. We also put ours in a jello ring mold, let it set overnight in the fridge, and then unmold and slice it like a bundt cake for serving. It's a great recipe and is easy to make and always turns out great!"

There's just something about the tart, sweet crunchiness encased in jello that makes this dish a tasty alternative to the holiday dinner table. Having said this, I found you can play with this recipe and have interesting outcomes. I recently made this with orange zest and a couple of pinches of ground cloves (added both to boiling water). This took an already amazing-tasting dish to a whole different level of goodness. This is definitely a permanent dish for the holiday menus."

"reviewBody": "Just what I was looking for but with a few small changes. First I use cranberry jello, whole not jellied cranberry, plus a 1/4-1/2 c finely chopped celery, and walnuts. The celery really takes it over the top. It seems odd, but it makes a huge difference. Craving it already! If you find the cranberry too tart, then either double the recipe and do 1 each of cran and cherry or cut it with the cherry. Or even add cherries. That's the beauty of a recipe like this, you can play around with it and see what you like!"

I highly recommend using the whole berry sauce in place of the jellied... the berries add a certain something special to the contrast. Also, rather than simply sprinkling the pecans on top of the salad, I mixed them in well with the rest of ingredients to get a little in each bite.. delicious! Be sure to get as much of the juice out of the pineapple as possible, you won't be disappointed with the result!"

And my family loves lots of pecans so I double the pecans and let them jell in the salad.

Don't omit the nuts as some other reviewers suggest...they really balance the tastes in this salad. If someone doesn't like nuts, they can always take a scoop from the bottom instead of the top (where the pecans are)."

The only changes that I made were to use cranberry jello in place of cherry and to use WHOLE berry cranberry sauce instead of jellied. I also omitted the nuts totally to make it more kid friendly and it didn't seem to make a difference."
