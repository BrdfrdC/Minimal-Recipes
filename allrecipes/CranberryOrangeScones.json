"reviewBody": "Michelle Hoile, you have some ‘splaining to do about this recipe! It’s just terrible.\nThis was a sloppy mess, more like batter than dough. I threw out the first batch because I thought I had measured the liquids incorrectly. Second batch, same mess so I just kept adding more and more flour though not enough to get it to form a soft and sticky dough. Poured it onto a well floured surface, dusted the top with flour and folded more flour into it. No more spreading across the floured surface. I covered it with a bowl hoping that it would absorb the added flour and I’d be able to handle it enough to roll out and cut. I had to fold in more flour. I was able to stop it from spreading and formed a quasi round form and cut the dough into eight triangles. Baked them for 15+ minutes and they came out tough with the inside still raw and tasting like uncooked flour so baked them 10 minutes more. The result was a heavy, hard “scone”, if you can call it that. I’ll make them again and decrease the buttermilk to 1/2. I wasted money I shouldn’t have spent. I wish I had read the reviews on this recipe because I would have used a different one. Ugh! I do not recommend using this recipe."

Next time I'll add some chocolate chips. We did not icing the scones because we don't like overly sweet desserts. BTW, my old mixer threw dough all over the place and my husband had to clean it up. He promptly ordered me a brand new, state of the art mixer."

The directions say to add the buttermilk and juice until the flour is absorb and the dough is sticky. Well I guess my guess was still too much liquid. I then kept adding a little more flour, trying to guess was “sticky” really meant. I guessed wrong. It was pretty sticky and difficult to roll or cut into a shape but I did my best. They spread out and flattened out into a blobs in the oven. They tasted pretty good, but this recipe needs some help."

I use the juice of half a large orange in the recipe and the door was just way too wet. Other than that, the recipe taste delicious and I will make it again but using much less juice"

I don't understand why people rate this a 5 star recipe and then go on to point out that the liquid measurement is wrong. When I see a 5 star rating I assume that it's a recipe that requires no adjustments. I won't make that assumption again."

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe reducing the buttermilk to 1/2 c and adding an extra 1 tbsp. I checked for consistency which should be sticky but not too much. Now, as for technique, I used Chef John's Scones recipe from this site. Make into rectangle, fold it in thirds once, rotate 90 degrees, pat into a rectangle again and cut. I made 14 round scones of 2\" diameter. Cute and good. Could not stop eating them even without glaze! They were fluffy and perfectly sweet!"

"reviewBody": "I did not have an orange, so I used a tangerine. It was delicious. The only roblem I had was after food processing it, the batter was runny and sticky. I was unable to cut the batter, but I formed as lumps and it worked wonderfully. I think I may have processed the butter too long. It was sand grain size not pea grain. I should have been a bit more cautious with the addition of buttermilk. I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour."

"reviewBody": "My dough came out very loose, more like a batter so I think one cup buttermilk is too much. I will reduce that next time. I had to add more flour to compensate. I cut back on the cranberries and then was sorry I didn't put the whole cup in and I would probably add more next time. The icing could also use some orange zest for more orange flavor. I loved how easy it was to put everything in the food processor so I will try this out again with adjustments."

"reviewBody": "These are fantastic scones!! Flakey, buttery, orangey, not-to-sweet, light, tender, and oh-so-yummy! They were so easy to make too! I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of cutting this into only 8 scones. They baked perfectly in 17 minutes. I did find the glaze to be a bit lacking, for my personal taste preference. I had about 2-3 tbsps of orange juice left, and added the 1 cup powdered sugar to it--and that just didn't have much flavor-wise, and was too runny. That was an easy fix by adding 1 tsp orange zest, using 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, pinch of salt, couple drops of vanilla extract, and 1 tbsp heavy cream. That made more of a glaze that I prefer. Other than that, this recipe is perfect! 10 star scones! Thank you so much for the recipe!"
