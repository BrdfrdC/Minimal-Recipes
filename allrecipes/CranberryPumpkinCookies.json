Since some reviewers thought the cookies retained too much moisture the next day or two, I left the cookies in the oven 2-3 minutes longer than I usually do for a drop cookie. Finally I finished the cookies off with an orange glaze. This is definitely a recipe I will be using often."

Remembered I had oranges, then put the orange zest in there, and didn't grease the pan because I missed that step.#Quarantinecooking2020. Turns out they were great! Can't imagine how fabulous they would have been if I had made them like the recipe said!!"

Leave out the nuts because too many people I serve them to have nut allergies. \n2. Use craisins instead of fresh cranberries. I can only find the fresh ones few a weeks in the winter and I need to eat these for months and months. \n3. Add chocolate chips. No explanation needed."

They are great. Light and cakey. My husband who likes to complain, loves it. Last year 's cookies were much denser yet excellent. Served them during a Studio Tour to rave reviews. I like both versions and will bake these again. I have a freezer full of fresh pureed pumpkin to use. First time I used the spice listed , this time increased the cinnamon to two tsp., and added about 1/2 tsp allspice, and a 1/4 tsp cloves."

I just pulled them out of the oven, and my first thought was \"Well...these are an odd color.\" The color wasn't like other pumpkin cookies I've made, it has a purplish hue. But I couldn't wait to try a bite, and when I did all my worries went away. I think they are just fine as it, but I added a glaze to the top (1 1/4c powdered sugar, 2-3tbl orange juice, 1tbl orange zest, dash of cinnamon) and for us it made them GREAT!"

A texture that is both dry (from the coconut) and moist (from the others and baking to just the right brownness). The first batch disappeared in minutes!"

I omitted the nuts and the orange zest (didn't have any oranges) and then forgot to add the ginger another reviewer had used. Despite being a novice, these cookies turned out tasty! They are not sweet and they do have a cake consistency. I followed another reviewer's suggestion about using my spatula to flat them half way through baking. Good tip! The original picture shows icing on the cookies but I had no idea how to do that. I bet they would be even tastier (and a bit sweeter) with the icing."

Well, not very cranberry-ish or pumpkin-y. :( 'Wasn't really enough cinnamon to really tell it was there. Pumpkin is pretty bland by itself. This needs, my opinion, more pumpkin &amp; more spice(s). It may be one of those that's fabulous with the glaze, but I want to base my judgment on the cookie, not the great glaze. 'Fair? :) ... BOOKMARKER"

It's so hard to find good persimmon recipes and I tried this on a whim and it has gotten rave reviews from everyone. I do use pecans instead of walnuts and add 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I have tried it with both dried and fresh cranberries and it is definitely better with the fresh."

"reviewBody": "Loved the recipe. I made some changes to make the cookies \"healthy\". I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of the regular white stuff. I used expeller pressed canola oil instead of butter. I used 1 cup of UNPACKED light brown sugar instead of the white stuff. And finally, i used pumpkin kernels instead of walnuts. The pumpkin kernels deemed appropriate since the cookies were made from pumpkin. The cookies turned out FANTASTIC. Just so the readers know, vegetable oil is better for you than animal fat (butter) so the canola oil works best. Olive oil could be used but it has a distinct flavor but does not keep its heart healthy fats at HIGH temperatures so it's not good for baking or cooking. But if you DON'T care about the heart healthy fats then you most certainly CAN use olive oil as a binder (but remember the flavor!). Also, the whole wheat PASTRY flour is low glycemic and has fiber so it makes the cookies filling without the sugar high (along with using UNPACKED light brown sugar). Whole wheat PASTRY flour is"

"reviewBody": "I made these cookies a few times. Reading reviews one person chopped cranberries– 1st time I put cranberries through a slicer-didn’t like result. Next time followed recipe totally – cranberries were SO GOOD whole and fresh - next time used 2 ½ cups of cranberries. I used a 1½ inch scoop for cookie size. Small number of cranberries leftover- I simply stuck on cookies – then used sliced almonds topping cookie dough and press the cookies a little wider, and baked at 375 for 18 minutes. The cookies do not spread at all – so they can be close together on cookie sheet for baking. One review used milk and powdered sugar frosting after cookies cooled. First few times I used normal consistency for powdered sugar frosting. This photo I used a thin frosting (enough milk the frosting was a runny consistency) using pastry brush covered cookies lightly. The cake like cookies with the crunchy almonds – oh – what an improvement, I simply used the almonds because they were ‘on hand’ (I’d over purchased sliced almonds for another cookie use!) 10/2015 update - these are big favorites this time of year. My addition of almonds on top - is labor added, simply folding almonds in after the cranberries is less work and adds the enhancing crunch. Great cookies!"

"reviewBody": "I'll start with my son's review -- \"this tastes like pumpkin pie\" -- and it does. Of course, I always add nutmeg and ginger to anything with pumpkin in it, and it worked for these cookies as well. For the taste of the cookies, I have no complaint, they pass the test! But I kept them covered for two days and the pumpkin is so moist it kind of makes these feel and look like dough balls. I made them Saturday to take into work Monday, and this morning (Monday) they have some bluish-green mold growing on them :( So, be warned, put them in the refrigerator if they're going to last more than two days! Also, the cookies will retain their shape while baking, so if you don't want malformed balls at the end of it, you may want to smoosh them down a little. All in all though, these are a tasty treat, and I will be making them again :)"

I know some reveiwers used dried cranberries, but I think you are missing out if you don't use fresh. Now with that being said, I always make a batch just for me with some changes for dietary needs. First I sub the sugar with 1/2 cup splenda brown sugar blend,and I use 1 &amp; 1/4cup AP flour and 1cup multigrain flour. I really like the multigrain flour in ths cookie, it gives it a wonderfull nutty flavor."
