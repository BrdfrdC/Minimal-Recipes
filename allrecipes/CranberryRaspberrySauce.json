I'm excited I followed the recipe only thanks to others suggestions made it with apple sauce instead of merlot. My Mom is super dissapointed not to be able to get the raspberry cranberry sauce in a can anymore and I said why not see if I can do it myself. Tomorrow I will procure some gelatin mix to see if I can make it jellied and give Ocean Spray a run for their money. Yeah DIY'ers! I hope it turns out ok after this step and that it will last till the weekend Acck it's only Monday! THanks again."

This is super simple and as others, I used apple juice instead of the Merlot(we are not wine drinkers so I did not have any). I also made a second batch without the raspberries. Both were easy and delicious! Easy to make and put in the fridge the night before. I like canned, but I love these so much more!!! Am a type 2 diabetic so will try it next time with Splenda!"

"reviewBody": "This was really tasty and easy to make. I did substitute a few things. I used about 3/4 cup of frozen and thawed raspberries and 1/4 strawberries and 1/4 cup of black raspberries. Instead of the wine I used white grape raspberry juice and reduced that to about 2/3-3/4 cup due to the additional liquid from the thawed, previously frozen berries. Let it come to a boil and reduced to a simmer and cooked about 12 minutes. I just gauged it by consistency and letting the cranberries burst. Thickens even more in it's own when chilled. Tasted awesome warm or chilled! Perfect blend of sweet and tartness. Definitely will make again and experiment with other berry options!"

"reviewBody": "This was the first time I made cranberry sauce from scratch instead of opening a can. I used the suggestion of apple juice, but used a little less than a cup. I ended up with just a little more than 2 cups of fresh raspberries so I used a little less sugar. I added orange and lime zest. It came out perfect and the right consistency (not too thick and not too watery). I made this 2 days ahead and unfortunately due to a storm knocking out power we didn't have it on Thanksgiving. It got a little more tart over that time so I may not cut back on the sugar next time. Tastes great on cheesecake!"

This is the first recipe that has actually wowed me! I did add a dash of cinnamon and 1/4 t. of orange extract. I wanted the orange flavor, but I didn't want to dilute the merlot flavor. (If you don't have orange extract, you could probably use orange zest.) The merlot is what really makes this sauce a standout! (BTW, I think this is the first five-star rating I've given on this site!)"

Can still taste the wine, but it is not overpowering. I also used 1/2 white and 1/2 dark brown sugars. Goes well with turkey (obviously) but also good with chicken or pork."

It's nothing like a traditional cranberry sauce ... it's sweet, but with the tart bite from the cranberries, too. Suspect it would be wonderful over ice cream or spongecake ... or both! Anxious to taste it on the turkey on Thanksgiving."

Also, I used half white sugar and half brown sugar...just my own preference. Finally, I added 1/2 t. vanilla and 1/4 t. cinnamon to the mixture while it was cooking. I can't taste the cinnamon much but the vanilla really added some great flavor. Great recipe as is...or altered a bit!"
