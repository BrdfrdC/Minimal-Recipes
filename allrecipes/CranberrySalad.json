I used about 3/4 cup Sucralose(Safeway's fake sugar), three Clementines for the one orange, both walnuts and an apple, and a dark jello. I didn't have lemon, so I added about two tablespoons of lime juice. As others suggested, I cut down a lot on the water, and used the reserved pineapple juice as part of it. It was crunchy(celery, nuts, and apple) and delicious--not too sweet. It was photogenic, but I forgot to do that! We had so many delicious things that I think someone must have taken a picture. I left the leftovers with the hostess, but my daughter and I like it a lot, so I'm going to make us another one."

Makes the gelatin much more flavorful -- we still prefer the cherry jello to the cranberry -- otherwise too tart. Makes a lovely molded presentation."

The ground orange with peel is what sets this apart from so many other recipes. Cannot say enough good things about this recipe, and am glad that it is online for others to enjoy!\nEDITED TO ADD: There is one change I would make to this recipe if you watch the video. Do. NOT slice the whole orange in pieces and throw it in the blender with the cranberries. First, Peel away just the colored orange part of the peel and toss into the blender with the cranberries. Second, peel the white rind from the orange and throw it away This is white pith and very bitter. NOW, Cut your orange in the chunks and throw it in the blender and proceed. Always toss away the white part of the rind with any citrus recipe including recipes made with lemon????"

I got lots of compliments at Thanksgiving by people starting with, \"I don't normally like cranberry salad but this is really good, could you give me the recipe?\" I used sugar free raspberry jello and also 3/4 c of sugar instead to lighten it. Also only used 1 cup of hot water."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe! I left out the celery and added a small peeled apple instead. I find that it really helps if you use some of the excess pinapple juice in the blender with the cranberries first. I don't blend the oranges or apples. I agree with only using 1 cup of water, too. (you can also use strawberry gelatin mix) Everyone in my family LOVES this cranberry salad! Yummy!!!"

I also add 1 tsp. lemon juice. The smaller amount of liquid makes the salad firmer as I usually pour it into a jello mold."
