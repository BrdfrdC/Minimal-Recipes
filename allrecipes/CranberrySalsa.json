Third, I found there to be too much liquid so I pressed some of the liquid out using a sieve just before adding it to the cream cheese. I've also made a variation. During the summer, I couldn't find cranberries so I substituted an equal amount of kumqats. It was delightful."

My family discovered that it is especially delicious when served with cucumber chips instead of tortilla (although wonderful that way as well) and the red and green were perfect for the Christmas appetizer spread.

Added a little crunch, and a touch of sweetness. I could see adding a sweeter apple and maybe getting away with even less sugar. Maybe will try that next time. I poured it over cream cheese and served with scalloped red pepper flake crackers. Ended up pulsing it a little too long because I forgot to add the jalapeño. But texture is still good since the cranberries are sturdy. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This was not very good. I live in the heart of. cranberry country in New Jersey and I’ve made almost every cranberry dish known. Unfortunately, I should have avoided this one. If you love cilantro you’ll love this recipe. The cranberries, jalapeño and most everything else was over powered by the cilantro You may ask why? The directions are the reason. No recipe should be published without some guidelines....what does a “bunch” of cilantro mean? Apparently, much less than I added. How about 1/4 cup chopped and verbiage “add more to taste”. Just a suggestion. I should have known to steer clear of recipes with vague quantities. My fault"

"reviewBody": "Wow! Had cranberries left over from making Christmas potpourri AND was asked to bring an appetizer to a dinner party. When this recipe popped up, I thought I’d give it a try. I didn’t tough chop onion or jalapeño as directed which made it a little difficult to blend at first. I used 1/4 c Splenda and 1/8-1/4 c sugar, and 2 T lime juice. I see what others are saying. First bite you aren’t sure, but once you get used to the flavor combo/tartness, it’s soooo good! I’m going to serve with wheat thins, but I had some crustini ? bread bites I used to test it and it was great as well. Would be nice to have that and wheat thins as options. Also, it made so much I couldn’t neatly fit it all in my serving dish, so I experimented with fat free cream cheese in my extras dish. It was great. I don’t think I would have known, but some cream cheese connoisseur may say otherwise. If you are a calorie counter, this way, Splenda/part sugar is at most 77 calories per serving not counting cream cheese/crackers."

"reviewBody": "I have made this several times in the past 2 years. I only made a couple of adjustments. I found it needed a lot more salt but the sugar has to be added in small amounts and tasted. The sugar will depend on how tart the cranberries are. I also zest my limes before juicing and add zest. I served it with and without the cream cheese twice and almost everyone chose without as their favorite. I serve Tostitos scoops with it. I found out you can freeze cranberries easily either in their original bag or as I did by placing the bags into freezer bags. They remain fresh like this for 8-12 months."

"reviewBody": "I was excited to bring this to our annual camping trip. There were about 21 of us, all adults, so I thought it'd be a fun &amp; different type of snack. Most of the people are open to trying new things. This recipe bombed, no one liked it for more than one mouthful. It was over powered with cilantro taste, which surprised me since I used what it called for. Not sure what it needs to be better, but I guess I won't waste my time trying to figure it out. I'd say if you don't like cilantro, don't add as much as called for. No other ideas of how to make better. Maybe add a can of crushed pineapple?"

Per reviews I only used 1/3 cup of sugar, used 2 pickled jalapeños (seeded) and a little of the jalapeño juice. My son said \"it is amazing\" ~ Thanks for posting!"

"reviewBody": "Modifications needed, but highly recommend this...\n\nWe have made this recipe for last 10+ years. I found it in the comments of a lifestyle blog. Here is the revised recipe: 1 pkg whole fresh cranberry, 1 small bunch cilantro (you can use thin stems), 1 small bunch green onion (whites &amp; greens minced), 1 lime zest &amp; juice, 1 or 2 jalapeno (seeded), 2 tablespoon minced ginger, 1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. We use food processor only for the cranberry and mince everything else by hand.\n\nOther tips: Ginger is the magic ingredient. Sugar - start with 1/3 cup sugar; 3/4 cup sugar will make this too sweet! ( I use 1/2 cup sugar in a double batch). It's better on tortilla chips than with cream cheese. Make it at least 4 hours prior, but preferably night before."

Made a day ahead of time and and let it sit overnight in the fridge. I served this on a turkey tacos and it was outstanding! Also goes well on chips or crackers and I think would be wonderful mixed with Greek yogurt. I'll definitely be making this again!"

It lasts well (a week in the 'fridge), and is extremely easy to prepare!"
