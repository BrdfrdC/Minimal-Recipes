I thought the cinnamon taste was a bit strong so I cut that and the nutmeg, as well as the pecans in half. As delicious as it is, it's utterly amazing mixed into some good Greek yogurt. Can't recommend this recipe highly enough!"

"reviewBody": "This is an easy recipe to follow. I doubled the recipe because I wanted to give some away as gifts. Easy to make and place in jars with a bath canner for 15’. I tried some while warm and it was great. Not to sweet and nit to tart. The only issue I have was once it cooled the orange flavor was obsolete and the cinnamon flavor was powerful. I even decreased my cinnamon and added an extra orange with orange extract so I’m not sure what happened. I usually make another recipe but this one sounded so good. It is better as far as sweetness. It was a great addition to my sliced turkey sandwich that I had for lunch and it’s great on oatmeal! We’ve also used it as jam on our toast and pancakes! Thank you for posting. Easy peasy and great gift idea during the holidays."

Still, to be fair, I made tons of changes without knowing the outcome so that may not be a fair judgment of the original. I just utilized the ideas that attracted me to this recipe. Next time I’d use les salt, though. I like my sauce more tangy than sweet, and I like it chunky. I didn’t want to drown out the cranberry flavor with pureeing everything so I kept the additions chopped."

Following another reviewer's tip, I use a can of mandarin oranges. I use the juice from the can as part of the cup of water. Also, I can't ever seem to get a pear ripe when I need it, so I just use two different varieties of apple. And we're kind of traditional, so I use dried cranberries instead of the mixed fruit. It's amazing. Try it. You will LOVE it! Thanks so much for the original post."

I use about 1/4 c of sugar instead of a full cup, use a small can of mandarin oranges in place of the fresh orange, add a small can of crushed pineapple, and if I can't find good pears, I use 2 apples instead. Once everything has cooked and completely cooled, and I add a pint of fresh blueberries. I try to cook at least the day before to give all the flavors time to meld, but I don't add the pecans until just before serving so they don't get mushy. Terrific recipe as is - all of my little modifications are just personal preferences."

When dissolving it, I used half water and half orange juice. I also used a can of drained mandarin oranges to make it easier, coarsely chopping so they wouldn't be in whole pieces. For fruits, I used dried cherries, cranberries and apricots. I'd chop my pecans a little finer the next time; I would prefer that over the larger pieces I had. I also added about a tblsp of brandy to the mixture. It's cooling now but will be great for Thanksgiving this week, and I'm thinking even to gift for Christmas. Nice recipe!"
