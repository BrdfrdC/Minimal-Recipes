The base of crans and apples makes this recipe very adaptable. The only other thing I did was add just a pinch of salt to make the flavor shine just a bit more. Excellent combination!"

My hubby liked it too. The apple retained it's own flavor which was a sweet balance to the tart cranberry. (I used Gala apples) This is an easy recipe and a definite keeper."
