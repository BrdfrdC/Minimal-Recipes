I also did half with chocolate chips and nuts, not adding sugar and other half with fresh blueberries and a bit of grated lime with sugar as in recipe. This was because I didn’t have any oranges or cranberries. Next time I will follow the recipe to see if it is even better! Overall pretty yummy with tea or coffee in hand."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe for scones! I followed the recipe as is until I realized my cranberries were bad so I substituted Craisins. I also didn’t have half and half but I did have heavy cream. After mixing, my dough was too dry so I cut the orange in half and squeezed the juice of half the orange into the batter. Just before placing the scones in the oven, I sprinkled them with some turbano sugar. I used the juice from the other half of the orange, mixed it with some powdered sugar and made a glaze which I drizzled over the finished scones. They tasted AMAZING! I have now made this recipe three times in the same manner. I varied the shape each time (triangles, biscuits circles, and ice cream scoop balls) watching the baking time for doneness."

I chose this one because it didn’t have a long list of ingredients that wouldn’t have made that much difference anyway. The only thing I changed was I added 2 1/2 cups of flour instead of 2 cups and 1/4 cup Splenda instead of white sugar. The 1/2 extra cup of flour made for a better dough. The Splenda instead of sugar cut down the calories, if only a small amount. They were absolutely delicious!"

Very tasty and not too sweet. I also added dried cranberries and a little orange extract as I did not have any oranges. I added a sweet, smile orange glaze to half of them. I would put marmalade on the others. Would also make smaller ones next time as these are sizable if you make just 6. A keeper for those who love scones. Recipe was straightforward."

"reviewBody": "There is a problem with this recipe. If I use the ingredients as listed, the batter is very thin and goopy, just like others have described. I used the yogurt as some suggested, but the batter was still far too thin to roll out. So bakers have to choose if they want to use the ingredients as written and then drop the scones on a baking sheet with a spoon, or if they want add LOTS of extra flour and perhaps cut back on the amount of liquid, so that they end up with a firm enough dough to roll out and cut into circles, as the recipe instructs. I went with the second option. The results taste okay, but are a bit chewy. The next time I want to use up left-over cranberries, I'll look for a different recipe."

The dough is very sticky and since making the first batch I have purchased a dough scraper. Using a spatula I turn the batter out onto my flour covered granite countertop and sprinkle flour on top and keep lifting and turning the dough. I forms a nice 6\" circle that I cut into 6 wedges and lift with the dough scraper and set individual wedges on my baking pan. ( I bought my metal scraper at Bed Bath and Beyond and I love it!) Thank you for this recipe, I follow it exactly other than a little more flour while kneading."

Once it became semi manageable I used a bakers spatula coated again with flour to flatten a circle to cut into segments. They turned out delicious. Just the next time I’ll add a half cup more flour."

"reviewBody": "First time making or eating scones.... I read all the reviews and made a few adjustments. I used raisins and cinnamon, instead of cranberries and nutmeg, and evaporated milk instead of half and half since that is what I had on hand; otherwise I followed the ingredients. I stirred the ingredients together rather than trying to knead it. After mixing the egg/milk mixture in with the dry ingredients, I allowed it to rest for about 5 minutes or so. The mixture was sticky, more like a thick batter than a bread dough, but rather than add additional flour to be able to roll, I just used a serving spoon and spooned portions onto the baking pan. The end result was nicely browned on the outside and tender inside. With butter and jam, my family gave them 2 thumbs up! I will be making them again. Thanks!"

I also used a food processor, rather than doing by hand. For scones, use a light touch! Nothing more than a few pulses. Also let the scones rest 10 minutes, prior to baking. These taste so fresh and zesty, they are wonderful! I add a glaze of confectioners sugar, butter, orange juice and zest mixed together, after they cool."

The only thing I change is to substitute pecans for walnuts, as I always have a big supply in the freezer. Don't be put off by the fact that they are not easily kneaded -- like, not at all for me. I just schmoosh it all into a circle and cut into wedges and manage to transfer them to a parchment lined baking sheet. Yes, the dough is really sticky, but you will develop your technique after a couple of bakings. You'll love these!"

For a traditional scone only add the amount of mixture needed to bring dough together. If you use a lower fat dairy product it will bake out as cookies. They are very tasty, soft and flaat."

Rather than continuing to add flour, I finally scooped them out like really wet drop biscuits. . . I think I'd start with half the liquid called for and add from there as needed. (And, yes, I AM an experienced cook.) :-) I have noticed that many of the other 5-star rated scones on this site call for an egg wash--not for the egg to be incorporated into the dough. Doing that would also decrease the liquid a good bit and would probably mean that you did not need to add a lot of extra flour. . . Just an idea--haven't tried it that way. Again, they tasted good!"

I made a few tweaks only because it's what I had on hand.\nI used fresh cranberries, which I chopped coarsely in the food processor with the walnuts and then set aside and dusted the berry/nut mix with 1/4 c white sugar. I omitted the nutmeg, but I placed the other dry ingredients in the order given, into the work bowl of the processor and pulsed a few times. I added the butter cubes and pulsed a few more times, till it resembled corn meal. I used 1/2 c vanilla Greek yogurt in place of the half and half, and and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract, and beat it with the egg before adding to the work bowl. Pulsed a few times. Turned out on a floured board and kneaded maybe 5 times, shaped and cut as directed. Baked on a buttered and floured baking sheet as instructed. I will be making these again."

I also reduced the amount of half and half cream to half a cup in an attempt to correct the problem that some reviewers faced regarding the stickiness of the dough. Half a cup of cream gave me the perfect consistency to form the dough into balls, flattening them into 6-inch discs and cutting them into wedges. I will definitely continue to make these, particularly, if I want to impress guests and family with delicious breakfast or brunch!"

Once everything was combined the \"dough\" had the consistency of a muffin batter and was incredibly sticky. It was impossible to knead or roll out. I added about 1/2 cup of flour as suggested by other users but the consistency still wasn't thick enough. In total I probably added 1.5 cups of flour just to make the batter workable. While they look great, they came out quite bland in the flavor department. I doubt I'll try this recipe again."
