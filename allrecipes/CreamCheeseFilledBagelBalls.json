I didn’t have the bagel seasoning so just made up a mix of what I had.\nGreat as is but you could easily use flavored cream cheese or even other cheeses I think.\nToday I’m going to try with garlic in the dough and cheddar cheese in the center to seven with ravioli for dinner\nThank you!"

"reviewBody": "This is a really easy and versatile recipe. I didn't have geek yougurt ( I don't like it) so I used french-style yogurt with blueberries on the bottom. I tried it twice and liked both, but the second time, I added a little sugar to bring out the taste of the blueberries more. The balls this recipe makes must be huge because I halved the recipe and still got 10 two inch balls. Tasty though."
