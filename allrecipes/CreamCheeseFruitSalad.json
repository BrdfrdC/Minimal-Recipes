My family loves it-in almost any combination!\nI have added pudding, pie filling, and other combinations also. \nI like mini marshmallows, cherry pie filling (good for Christmas or Valentines Day, sometimes mandarin oranges (drained), sometimes walnuts instead of pecans . . . or not at all. I do try to keep combinations complimentary. \nTry FREEZING it! Can be frozen in pans and cut into bars or frozen in serving size cups (try adding sticks for frozen popsicles). Remove from freezer to the refrigerator about an hour before serving."

My stepmom made this and I just picked the bananas out before storing mine and it's still THAT good. I plan to make this myself but omit the bananas all together as I'm not a fan of them anyway. Definitely a keeper and a VERY tasty dish!"

I tried to healthy it up some. I used lite whipped topping and used fat free cream cheese. I probably will not use this much marachino cherries next time. I'd also exclude the bananas as well and substitue another fruit like strawberries. Definite must try!"

And I left out the raisins. I made my own whipping cream using heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla, way better then store whip cream. This was the first time I made my own whip cream and was worried about how it would work in a recipe like this. It turned out great. I always make \"Gourmet sweet potato classic\" (The best sweet potatoes ever!!from this website) for the holidays and end up throwing away 3/4 of the heavy cream. I will never throw away the cream again. Thanks for this recipe! I WILL make it every holiday. BTW I put the left over fruit salad in the freezer in small freezer bags to eat later."
