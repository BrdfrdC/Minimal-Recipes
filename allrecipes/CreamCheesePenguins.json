But apparently, I did have to stop sending pictures of the army of penguins I was creating to my daughter....something about she was in class...maybe a test....she's going to block me....meh. They were super cute, and the taste was okay, but the taste was the secondary factor. I used chive and onion cream cheese and just had to do the roasted red pepper scarfs from a suggestion! Thank you! I'll have to prepare another army for this Holiday!"

"reviewBody": "Great party appetizer. Just be forewarned, it's more effort than in might appear. My suggestions:\n\n- Be sure to get Jumbo olives. Extra large are not all that big.\n\n- Use flavored cream cheese or add some ranch dressing powder or other seasoning. Plain cream cheese is too plain.\n\n- Making scarves is great, but it's a lot of work and the result can be good or bad. Better to just pipe some extra cream cheese which then flattens a bit when you affix the head, to create a sort of white scarf.\n\n- Cut a little extra off the open end of each olive to make more room for piping the cheese in.\n\n- Get big fat carrots. Carve the beaks out of the carrots before slicing them. It may end up being easier to use a different carrot for the beaks.\n\n- Use neufchatel cheese. It pipes much easier.\n\n- If this is going to be for an event that you want to impress folks, I highly suggest you make a practice run a week ahead of time."

It's great to take to someone else's home as it's a bit time consuming, so you don't have to worry about preparing a lot of other things!\nI too used the chive &amp; onion whipped cream cheese and put in a plastic bag with corner snipped. Worked great! Gave it a little rolling look to it too.\nI will carry them to the party in a muffin tin, 2 to a spot, laying down for ease of transport."

Making it again this year for me and my dad since we're doing finger foods (ironic since he hates penguins). I had a bit of trouble getting the cream cheese into the olives as they kept splitting more than intended and tearing at the sides, but the end result was so worth the mess. This year I'm going to use herbed cream cheese for an extra hint of flavor. Also, the pimento scarves are adorable but can actually be difficult to do, at least that was the hardest part for me. Worth it though!"

I made them for my youngest granddaughter's first birthday party that was penguin themed. Her birthday is December 28th, so they were well received. I didn't change a thing, but I did use a piping bag to fill the larger olives with the cream cheese. Will definitely make these for years to come. Well worth the extra effort just to see peoples faces when they see them and hear them tell me how brilliantly creative I am."

I used that for the filling rather than the store bought cream cheese. A tip for folks that might want to try that option.... add a bit of sour cream and let the cheese ball set to room temp; makes it so much easier to fill these little cuties."

I tinted some of the cream cheese with blue coloring and placed it on the platter with little swirls to look like waves. I piled the white cream cheese higher on the other side of the platter to represent the snow bank and covered the 'snow' with the penguins. I put single olives with the carrot noses in the water like they were swimming. Really cute. Crackers can be served with the platter to use up the 'water' and 'snow'."

"reviewBody": "Cream Cheese Penguins Haiku: \"5 stars for cuteness. More like 1 or 2 for taste. Tossed the leftovers.\" These are absolutely precious, and not as time-consuming to put together as I thought they'd be. My 1-year old's party was penguins, so of course I had to have this adorable army of penguins as an appetizer. I know my review won't be of any major assistance, considering all the helpful tips in the 100s of other reviews, but I'll go ahead and toss in my two cents: cream cheese should've been flavored, or at least had herbs added to it. These just tasted so boring! :( Also, to make it a bit easier: secure large olive to the carrot feet 1st, and then slide the head on - not as difficult as holding all 3 parts together and lining up a toothpick at once. And absolutely spooning the softened cream cheese into a baggy w/ the corner snipped off for piping is a HUGE help. They brought a smile to everybody's faces, but not to their bellies as there were tons that remained uneaten, but I am delighted to have made them anyways!"

Instead of carrots for the feet, I purchased a round block of cheese and shaped the feet appropriately. This meant that the penguins did not fall down at all, and the appetizer was tastier. I also made blue jello and had the penguins \"skating.\" Adorable!"

I rinsed the canned olives, then soaked in balsamic vinegar to try and get the \"tinny\" flavor off, which helped a little. Other tips: mixed cream cheese and soft goat cheese together, added a little dry ranch to the cheese mix, used the tip of a star cookie cutter to cut out the carrot slices (easy and uniform) and used a pastry bag and large tip to pipe the cheese filling into the olives."

It was a little time consuming, but well worth it. Thanks for sharing this recipe - I'm make it again."
