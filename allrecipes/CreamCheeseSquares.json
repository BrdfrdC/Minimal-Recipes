I put some cinnamon on the bottom pastry, put the cream cheese in, put the second pastry on top, poured the butter on top, used a pastry brush to even out the butter, put the cinnamon on top. Put in the oven for 30 min, turned around half way through added some sugar to the top finished off. It came out really good and the crust came out nice and buttery."

Cut dough in half, rolled out thin, one for bottom and half for top. Trimmed excess on bottom but folded over sides of top. Came out pretty! I used a bit less sugar and cinnamon mix for topping, which was fine. SOOOOO good!!"

"reviewBody": "I took the advice of others who have made this recipe and I took it one step further. Everyone who has tasted the recipe has loved it and they all want me to make them some. I went on Amazon and bought some 8x8x2\" aluminum baking pans with lids and I take the basic recipe and simply split it between the 2 cake pans. In addition I took a 21 oz can of cherry pie filling and spread it over the cream cheese filling and once the cream cheese filling was covered with the cherry pie filling I shook some powered confectioners sugar on top of the cherry pie filling to tame the tartness of the cherry pie filling before I covered it with the remaining crescent roll topping and then finished the recipe as written with the melted margarine and sugar/cinnamon before baking it in the oven. I did use my mixer to mice up the cherry pie filling as it has large cherries in it as it comes out of the can. The result was a much more decadent dessert square. My friends and relatives wholeheartedly approved the changes I made. Try it... You can also use a 21 oz can of apple pie filling which is even as good as using the cherry pie filling. Yummy"

It would be a nice base recipe to add fun flavor combinations to, but as-is I would never make it again."

The top was beautiful- crisp and light brown, but the bottom wasn't cooked-very doughy. I put it back in the oven and covered the top and the bottom baked well enough, but I wanted it a little more firm. I took it out because I was afraid the top would burn. For those of you in the know, would it be possible to cook the bottom, then add the cream cheese and cook it per the directions? I did take others advice and added some fruit on top of the cream cheese and I do not know if that affected the fact that it didn't cook on the bottom. Excluding the bottom- superb and I will definitely make this again! YUMMY!"

I've now made this many times, the flexibility of this recipe is amazing. 1) have made it with the cream cheese (CC) as a base, topped with 1/2 pint fresh blueberries, 2) only 1/2c sugar in the CC and one heaping tablespoon sugar in the melted butter, 3) dusted the dough w/ coconut flour (can use almond, hazelnut, etc. flour) for an extra hint of flavor, 4) can skip the cream cheese and use a favorite chocolate bar... the possibilities are endless. It truly tastes like a pastry! I cut it into squares and save in refrig or freezer. I toast in a pan to heat again before serving. THANK YOU, it's a great way to have, on-hand, a treat the seems so much more complicated than it is - has a croissant-like pastry taste w/o all the work!!"

"reviewBody": "Great simple recipe for a tasty treat! I made some minor adjustments after reading reviews. I prebaked the bottom layer for ten minutes to avoid a soggy bottom. I used the full amount of cream cheese and sugar in the filling but added two eggs and 1/2 tsp lemon extract for additional flavor and to lighten up the middle. I used a full half cup of butter on top with the amount of sugar and cinnamon stated and it came out beautifully! The butter and sugar caramelized to a nice crust, I would not recommend cutting it back. I also used sweet Hawaiian crescent rolls instead of plain. Super tasty &amp; look nice. Will definitely make these again!"

Second layer of rolls was topped with 1 tablespoon of melted butter sprinkled with 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I made mine in a 12\" x 8\" glass pan for 30 minutes. I let it cool for about 30 minutes and cut a small slice out and it is heavenly, not too sweet and adding the egg makes this dessert filling taste just like cheesecake!!"

I warmed about 3/4 cup strawberry jam plus a splash of lemon juice in the microwave and spread it over the cream cheese. I melted 4 tbsp of butter to brush on the top but it was too much. 3 tbsp as suggested by others is enough. I sprinkled a little cinnamon and sugar on top and a little raw sugar. This was delicious and perfect. Also used a glass 9 x 13 pan. It baked for 27 min in my oven."

"reviewBody": "These turned out really good. I followed the recipe exactly. The only real problem I ran into were the cresecent rolls. Unfortunately mine were room temperature so they tore easy. The bottom wasn't too bad because I could shape with my hands. I managed to get the top covered but it wasn't \"pretty\". I reccomend you keep your rolls cold and roll them out into a sheet before laying the sheet ontop. I think the recipe calls for too much butter and sugar. Next time I'll use 4-6 tbsp of butter and a heaping 1/8 cup of sugar. I also think the top would be better using all brown sugar or a mix of brown and white, I'll try that next time."
