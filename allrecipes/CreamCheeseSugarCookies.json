The best method I found was freezing the dough, then letting it warm up slightly to make it easier to roll. I have a granite counter, but I found it easier to roll out the dough between 2 pieces of parchment paper. I recommend 1/4 inch thick, as this recipe does not rise, and 1/8” was too thin and brittle. I frosted with Royal icing."

"reviewBody": "These cookies turned out great. The only thing I added was the seeds of one vanilla bean to the creamed mixture...just to deepen the vanilla flavor, before I added the flour. otherwise I followed the recipe as is. They were yummy and I received great compliments. Next time, I would add some salt crystals to the cookies. I also cut these out directly on the baking mat, so that I didn't lose the flavor to the flour that is usually used to rollout and cut the cookies. Next time, I would replace the almond with lemon juice or more vanilla...but that's a personal preference - I just don't like almond extract. My in-law who is a good baker wanted the recipe and her son loved them."

A couple of tricks, as the dough is a bit soft, is to flour the rolling pin, and use a very thin spatula to get the cookies from the workspace to the baking sheet. I always frost with cream cheese frosting."

"reviewBody": "These cookies are sensational. I made the recipe as is and cut it in coin shapes which I sprinkled with powdered sugar. The tangy cream cheese made this cookie unusual for a sugar cookie. I followed the suggestion of rolling it on a bench flour mix with sugar. I combined 50% sugar and 50% flour. It does make a difference. Also, my personal suggestion would be use a flexible bread maker's bench scraper to work it. It will be your BFF once you use it with dough that has the tendency to become sticky. They are inexpensive and save you a lot of tears of disappointment. A granite plaque also might help you as it tends to stay naturally cold making it easier to work sticky dough."

"reviewBody": "Tasty but do not hold their shape during the baking process plus you need to only roll to 1/4 inch not 1/8 - they completely lose their shape if only 1/8 inch thick. Also 375 is too hot - - the edges burn and the center is almost raw. I am so disappointed - I spent too much time and money on these and now I have no sugar cookies for the kids."

Mix till properly creamed... the sugar becomes one with the butter. Then add 1 egg, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 tsp of almond extract mix again. Then add 3 1/2 cups of flour 1 tsp of baking powder. I also did a chocolate raspberry filling. Heat a 1/4 of whip cream to just a boil take off heat then add 3/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chip. Mix til smooth. Put in piping bag. Pipe an amount around the the edge of the cookie then fill the Center with 1/4 tsp of raspberry jam. Delicious!"

I also added about a teaspoon of fresh lemon zest. They were soooo much better than plain sugar cookies. I decorated them with royal icing. For strength, I made them 14 inch thick. I use bands that are placed on the ends of the rolling pin to ensure. These bands are the key to getting a very professional look and uniform thickness. Because of the thicker size, I cooked them until golden on the bottom, about 12 minutes."

"reviewBody": "I will definitely make this recipe again, but there were a few adjustments I made. First, I added more vanilla about a TBSP) and less almond extract, simply based on my flavor preference, and I also added about a 1/2 c more sugar and an extra ounce (about 4 oz total) of cream cheese after reading another review that the recipe was bland. I also did not add as much flour as it called for because I often find sugar cookies too dry. I mixed until the dough looked dry, not sticky, but not overly floury. Finally, we did not use them for cutouts so I cannot attest to how they would work with cookie cutters. We rolled them into little balls and dipped them in different sprinkles, then baked. They were amazing! They are so soft and they have a wonderful flavor, sweet, but not too sweet, and the cream cheese adds a subtle richness to the overall taste. I will definitely make these again. Maybe next time I'll try them with cutouts, but I will likely need to use more flour for cutouts."

"reviewBody": "I was surprised at how delicious these were! I love baking cookies but sugar cookies have always caused me stress because I couldn't get them right or find a recipe that was acceptable. I was skeptical about them at first because there are no leavening ingredients, but it turns out this is great because they hold their shape perfectly. I usually prefer a softer sugar cookie and was concerned about the 1/8\" thickness but they were the perfect Christmas cookie texture (it turns out soft cookies probably weren't ideal anyway). The dough was such a beautiful consistency after rolling it out that I actually picked it up to show my mother. They cooked evenly, didn't spread, and didn't brown too quickly to catch. I gave it 4 stars because I did not follow the recipe perfectly and I think my decision to not do so was correct. I put a full tsp of vanilla extract instead of 1/2. The almond extract added a very nice and subtle flavor, but (in my opinion) it would have been too front-and-center if it had a 1:1 ratio with the vanilla, or worse yet the cookies would not be very flavorful. SAVING THIS RECIPE. THANK YOU FOR SHARING IT!"

"reviewBody": "This may be the first successful sugar cookie I have ever made. I have a new oven, so the bake time requires some work, but the cookie taste was wonderful. I didn't have almond, I just went with what I had. I never use anything but real butter. I made them in my food processor. It handled it just fine with just a litle prodding, but I would split the dough if I were to make a larger batch. I'm not a baker, so I followed the instructions mostly. I did roll, but will use parchment paper in the future, or flatten small scoops with a walnut or a fork. I love the idea that the dough can be frozen for later. I think I might keep these on hand. I almost grabbed a pre-made roll at the supermarket, but I followed through with my vow to work until I could make good cookies. I don't think I need to go any farther, but I have new confidence for trying out a few more baked goods recipes. I'm going to read over the comments when I do - they are all so helpful. Thanks to everyone."

It is a soft dough, so be sure to chill it for at least a few hours or overnight, roll small, chilly amounts of it with a dusting of flour and between parchment paper - and don't overwork it. The cookies baked nicely for me at 350* for 13-15 minutes - and were easily decorated with colored sugars, stiff buttercream frosting and/or royal icing."

The flavor was pretty good, but not worth that Herculean amount of effort. My house is warmish, but not a sauna! It shouldn't have been that difficult to work with."

I double the recipe because I used 8 oz of cheese instead of 3 oz and I didn't put salt in the cookies. The dough I made was perfect after 8 hours in the fridge. I let the dough thaw a little so it was easier to roll out for about 30 minutes. The cookies cut-out nicely and didn't need to flour the rolling pin. I baked my cookies until I saw a golden edge appear in the oven around 8-9 minutes in the oven @ 375 degrees. All I have to say is I made over 30 cookies and they were mostly gone with a day and half. Definitely recommend this recipe to anyone."

I also rolled the dough to 1/4\" thickness rather than 1/8\" and baked slightly longer since I like my cookies a little thicker. They also did not spread very much while baking."
