Initially, I thought the batter was too runny and I questioned if I made a mistake in measuring the flour and sugar. So I baked just two to see how they would turn out, and they turned out fine. The filing was easy to pipe in. I used a large metal tip to core the cupcake, and the filing went in easily. Didn’t feel like making the icing so just used store bought, and they turned out super good! Thx to whomever posted the recipe. I’ll make again!"

They looked like they had hardly any batter in them, so I scraped all of the cupcakes into a bowl and made one cake ball instead. I am not sure how this happened considering no one else seems to have had this issue. I would be interested in trying them again if I can figure out how to not make them sink and basically evaporate."

The filling is perfectly fantastic, nothing more to add about that. I topped them with butter cream frosting (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/7638/butter-cream-frosting-i/), which was the perfect combination. While they can keep for a good while, all 36 of mine were gone in two days. This is an amazing recipe."

To the people who said the cake was just ok or that they use a box mix you are crazy, the cake is perfect and delicious and so much better than all the chemicals and garbage in a mix and it took very little effort to make them. This will be my go to recipe for chocolate cupcakes! They rose up nice and high and were perfectly moist and tender. I had a bad batch of filling (old shortening? Used up a small piece that may have been in the cupboard awhile) but the consistency was perfect and filling the cupcakes is simple if you poke through the tops with a pastry bag and tip. I used the same frosting recipe as other reviewers mentioned and even wrote it down on the printed recipe so I don't forget what goes so well on these. Terrific recipe and thank you for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "OK, well after reading the other reviews, I decided to change up the recipe a bit and this is what I did: Add a heaping Tbsp of instant coffee to the milk (don't worry, you won't taste the coffee), and stir until dissolved before you add to the dry ingredients. Instead of a whole cup of water, only add 1/4 cup water and then add 3/4 to 1 cup of SOUR CREAM. You might have to add a splash or two more of the water to get a good batter consistency. This made a really moist, decadent cake. I baked them at 350 for 23 minutes becasue of the sour cream additional ingredient. I had to fill the cups pretty high as it is a bit dense and doesn't rise a whole lot. I made a German Buttercream for the filling - NO CRISCO! Then I dipped them in a chocolate ganache and used more buttercream to do a curly doodle on top. They ended up looking just like the Hostess cupcakes but taste WAY better. They also came away from the paper wrapper FLAWLESSLY. EVERYONE WAS RAVING!! My kids went nuts. I will be making these again!!!"

So I put the filling on the top. The filling was like a doughnut glaze. I also loved the subtle chocolate taste. It was delicious! My whole family loved them! \n\nP.S. The first few that came out of the oven had a bread-like texture, but now they have a nice cupcake texture. These are GREAT!!!\n\nTIPS: I reduced the salt to 1/2 Teaspoon of Salt, because I thought it was way to much. I also used canola oil instead of vegetable, because canola oil has almost no taste."

Next time I will do all butter for the filling, and omit the shortening. While good, I admittedly am a butter-snob and I could taste the shortening (which I didn't like too much). Overall, this was a big hit at my son's 10-year-old birthday party."

I don't recommend this in a cake form at all. Not that it diminished flavor. Those boys polished off the cake in no time flat I guess, and it was suggested that I make this again for someone else, but I might have to stick with the cupcake version next time.\nOn a side note, I did add vanilla to the white filling portion as suggested, and I think that helped the overall cake be a little sweeter. But that's just a guess as I was trying each layer individually rather than combined."

"reviewBody": "Just to be clear, I'm not reviewing the cake part of the recipe, just the filling and the idea of a technique for applying it inside. The cake you use doesn't matter. The filling and technique will work with any cupcake recipe. The filling is light and sweet. Instead of milk, I used coffee creamer and the texture and flavor were just perfect. As for putting the filling into the cupcakes, I went from the top instead of breaking the bottom paper, (which makes for an unholy mess on your serving plate.) I was going to frost them anyway, so it didn't matter that a dot of white filling showed through the top. I used a pastry bag with a #22 tube. Buried the tube all the way to the coupler into the cupcake. I squeezed until the cake started to expand, then eased off the pressure as I withdrew it. Worked very well, and it's infinitely easier and faster than cutting the core, removing it, filling and replacing the core. No need for any such gyrations. If you have cake decorating equipment, I recommend this time-saving technique."

I used basic buttercream frosting and piped long strips of white across to resemble bandages. Then tinted some frosting yellow for the eyes and some red for the pupils. Very sinister! But best of all was the taste...so good and moist! I didn't change anything in the recipe (which is rare for me) and they were great. I will definitely make these again. This is a good basic chocolate cupcake with or without the cream filling. They were not dense as some reviewers reported...maybe they didn't sift the flour? I always do for my baked goods. Or maybe they didn't mix it long enough? Mixing it longer produces a lighter cupcake. To fill, I simply carved out a divot with a knife, spooned the filling in and trimmed the divot to cap the cupcake...it was perfect!"

The kids ate the plugs! \nI've given this recipe 4 stars, simply because it isn't as chocolatey or rich in texture as I'd expected. It's very good, don't get me wrong, I would just increase the cocoa from 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup or more next time I make them. Normally I make a vegan chocolate cupcake recipe that uses avocado, and I find it has a more dense, chocolatey texture and flavour than these."
