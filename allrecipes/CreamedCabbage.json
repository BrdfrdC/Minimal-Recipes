I used a cup of chopped ham, used a cup of cream and spiced with two tsps of tarragon, kosher salt and pepper both to taste and added a tsp of sweet paprika."

Settling on a 4 since he would love if I made again but the tang on the sour cream is just not the creamed cabbage I am accustomed - which is okay! I halved the recipe entirely EXCEPT the bacon and then added some chopped onions to the cabbage sauté. Glad I tried &amp; thanks for sharing!"

I'm glad I didn't have the extra bacon grease un the pan. Didn't need it for taste. I also added the crumbled bacon while it was cooking. Not much to it for being so tasty. This will be another healthy vegetable side on my list."

No more watery, limp boiled cabbage for us at our house! The only thing I would say is that this needs to be made and served at the last minute as the cabbage will lose its crispness, and will wilt and lose its green color if this sits for too long."

This dish was a huge hit on my dinner table. For the first time ever, I had no leftover cabbage! I made it exactly as the recipe reads. I cant think of anything I could do to improve it. This is a keeper. Try it!"

"reviewBody": "Very nice. Think it could have used just a bit of something like pepper to give it just a little kick. Certainly using a whole head of cabbage made A LOT of the dish. I will cut in half next time. My first four slices of bacon didn't produce as much grease as I think I was expecting so I browned 4 more slices but only used 1/8c margarine to help compensate for more bacon grease."

"reviewBody": "This is excellent as written. I've made it a couple more times adding what ever is on hand. If you have diced ham instead of bacon, don't worry, it's still great (just add some type of oil, maybe 1tbsp ). I've also shredded carrots into the mix, minced garlic, beef or chicken stock (or cubes). Good with coconut oil instead of bacon fat, try also with Sriracha, cayenne, and a dash of Tabasco for some kick. Mushrooms are good in it, diced potatoes, parsnips, turnip (may need to be steamed a few minutes). Again, don't go crazy and add all these extra ingredients, but it's a solid and versatile recipe that I'll continue to experiment with lol!\nEdit: I've never added flour to it either, turns out fine."

"reviewBody": "I used a package of bacon cooked this and half cup of Tasso. I then took an onion and cook the onion and the bacon fat. Didn't use all the bacon just the bacon fat. Then I followed the rest of the recipe and used a whole head of cabbage and a cup of light sour cream. Someone else had recommended putting breadcrumbs on top and I did this but I think it's better to mix it with a little butter and toast it and then put it on top rather than put it in the oven because my bread crumbs never toasted. I ended up just mixing it in and it tasted great but if you wanted that breadcrumb topping look then make sure you mix it with some better something. It's not a healthy recipe at all but it taste great"

Also added a few tablespoons of chopped red onion, a dash of garlic salt, and about 2 cups of roasted baby yellow potatoes....hard to get the rest of the family to eat cabbage."

Thanks for this recipe."
