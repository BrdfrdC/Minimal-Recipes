Used white long grain rice, and made sure to bring whole milk to full boil before adding rice, then lowered heat and kept pot covered between stirring. Be patient and you will find the thickness increases if it cooks longer than 1 hour ( if it looks runny). It does not thicken as it cools like other puddings. I like a sprinkle of nutmeg with cinnamon on top and for company a dollop of whipped cream. Make the day before and allow to chill. Comfort food!"

The cinnamon, raisins and chopped apples added last in the pot, then choc chips to finish. Best rice pudding I‚Äôve ever made."

I was disappointed when it was still soupy the next day, however, I read some other reviewers and realized I might just need to heat it back up and let it thicken...I did and it came out perfect.

Many recipes I‚Äôve seen use a double boiler with precooked rice. The best way is too cool the rice in the milk. Don‚Äôt be shy about going a little longer than an hour but stir frequently! Scalded milk flavor is not good. I also like to add lemon peel to the simmer (remove before you cool the pudding)."

Bringing the egg mixture to room temp. before combining with the pudding. I dashed a splash of nutmeg to the egg mixture as well. It was definitely quite tedious monitoring the pudding (for 1.5hrs on my stove) but as others had said, WELL WORTH IT. It is now chilling in the fridge for tonight's dessert. \nThank you to our creator!"

"reviewBody": "This rice pudding is so addictive. The Mother of ALL rice puddings. I‚Äôve made this recipe as written twice. Other times since, I‚Äôve added a little bit of real butter. I always use whole milk. Some helpful notes I picked up in other reviews:\n-Bring milk/sugar to a soft boil, then add rice. \n-set a timer to stir every 10 minutes. \n-I don‚Äôt put the lid fully on, just leave it cracked open a bit so no boiling over\n-as it thickens, I set timer and stir every 4 mins\n-I probably cook it like this about an hour and a half\n-when it‚Äôs the consistency I‚Äôm happy with, I take it off the burner for 10 minutes to cool slightly\n-then I add the eggs, milk, cinnamon, vanilla and butter\n\nFor my next trick, I‚Äôm adding cardamom. Or Nutmeg. Or maybe allspice? \n\nI might even experiment with adding an extra egg. I LOVE the rich custard-like consistency of this. It‚Äôs amazing warm or cold. \n\nI never will eat any other rice pudding again. They are all inferior to this one, I promise you this."

I used a crockpot liner and did add the extra 1/3 cup sugar as another reviewer suggested and also put in cinnamon sticks while it cooked on low overnight. Added 1cup of raisins and topped each serving with whipped cream and a sprinkle of sugar/cinnamon blend. We all loved it!! Will make this again for sure. Thank you for sharing the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I think the flavor is great. I made it the first time following the recipe, started the 1hour after it came to a boil. I even cooked it about 10 mins longer. Omitted cinnamon. Used Abborrio Rice for creamy results. I used 2% milk. Even with additional cook time, it was runny. I made it a second time and continued to follow recipe instead this time I used 1 heaping cup of long grain white rice and 1 cup Abborrio Rice. I pulled the 1/4 cup milk from the half gallon, rather than in addition to. After I cooked it the 1 hour after reaching boiling, it was very thick. I pulled about a cup or so out into a bowl and mixed in the 1/4 cup milk, 3 beaten eggs, vanilla, splash of salt. Then incorporate that mixture into the rest of the pan. Came out great!! Perfect consistency. Again skipped cinnamon. The flavor is great and I'm anxious to see after it chills overnight if it still has a great taste and has not gotten pasty."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is delicious and very forgiving of substitutes! I'm dairy intolerant so the first time I made this with rice milk and it turned out perfectly with no other adjustments. The second time I tried it with almond milk, which has a lower fat content, and found that it needed much longer cooking time, so I'd recommend cutting back the amount of almond milk by perhaps a whole cup. I also used coconut sugar on my second try for a healthier alternative with a richer taste. I imagine playing around with the sugars (i.e. half brown, half white, or some sugar replacements) would work out as well.\n\nProTip: If you underestimated how much cooking time the pudding needed and it didn't thicken up enough in the fridge, just throw the 9x13 pan in the oven at 250*F for a couple hours, stirring occasionally. This will help the excess liquid evaporate without overcooking the pudding."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is great, although it does need some changes! I have listed them below...\n1. I use 2% milk which cooks and tastes great! I'm sure any type of milk would be great, although I find I make the best rice pudding using 2% milk.\n2. I use 1 1/4 - 1/2 cups rice. The first time I tried this recipe with only 1 cup, it did not turn into rice pudding as there was too much of a gap between the milk to rice ratio. \n**NOTE** this is also preference. If you like your rice pudding more or less dense, add rice accordingly. To make a standard rice pudding though, about 1 1/4 cup rice should be fine.\n**NOTE 2** As you are watching the rice pudding, you can add or take away rice until the last 10 minute mark (just dont take or put in too much!)\n3. Time varies a lot!! I have made this recipe both in 1 hour, 2 hours, etc. You have to look at the rice pudding and wait until it thickens to let it sit for 10 minutes and then add the rest of the mixture! Be patient! If it is taking a long time, increase the heat slightly but watch it carefully!\n4. I always put the heat slightly more towards medium heat. I think this makes for the right consistency. Along with this though, you have to be more watchful over the pudding to ensure the milk doesn't burn or the rice doesn't stick to the bottom.\n\nOverall, this is a great recipe! It is a hit amongst my entire family! \n\nHappy baking! :)"

"reviewBody": "Absolutely Delicious! I've been wanting rice pudding but with so many recipes on here, which one to try? I always read the reviews first and when I saw that others made this in the crockpot, I thought, how much easier does it get? I followed the ingredients \"as is\". I warmed the milk (I used skim as that's what we drink) on the stove, just until barely warm. I then put it in the crockpot with one cup of long grain rice and the sugar. Truth be told, I did add another 1/3 c. of sugar. I set the crockpot in high and stirred every 30-45 minutes. I checked it in 3 hours and there was still a lot of liquid in the pot so let it go another 1 1/2 hours on the Low setting. At this time I beat 3 eggs and tempered the eggs with pouring a 1/2 cup of the hot milk in with the eggs before adding to the rice mixture. I also added the vanilla and salt at this time. Let it cook another 20 minutes and it was thick and yummy. So easy, no pot to watch. The milk didn't burn on. I will definitely fall back on this recipe anytime I get the desire for rice pudding again. Oh, I added the cinnamon at the very end. Delicious!"

"reviewBody": "This was delicious, but I did change it a bit: I first soaked a cup of raisins in about a cup of Salted Caramel Bailey's , per a suggestion to soak raisins in liquor. Then for the pudding, I combined one can of sweetened condensed milk, about a half pint of half and half, and whole milk, to get to the half gallon needed. Because of the addition of sweetened condensed milk, I reduced the sugar to about 1/3 cup. I also added a stick of cinnamon. I then started out cooking in the crock pot, per many suggestions, but it was not getting to the right temp to thicken quickly enough for me ( I was bringing it to my sister's that day), so I put it all in the pressure cooker and set to the \"rice\" setting. I tempered the egg mixture with 1/2 cup rice mixture before adding, then added the liquor soaked raisins, and kept pressure cooker on low for another 20 minutes or so. It was a little bit thinner than I wanted, but it did thicken up a bit after sitting and then chilling. When it was ready, I served with a dash or two of Penzey's cinnamon blend and whipped cream. HEAVEN! Everyone thought the addition of the Bailey's soaked raisins was awesome. The only thing I would do different next time is maybe reduce milk by about a cup and do it in the pressure cooker to begin with."

I used a bit less sugar, which for me is the whole point of making it myself.\n\nAs usual for these recipes, the actual time it took was more than the recipe said.
