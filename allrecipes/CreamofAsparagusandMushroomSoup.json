I looked up herbs that go well with asparagus and one of those was tarragon, so I put about 2 tsp. of that herb (dried) into the soup about 10 minutes before serving. That was it! I also discovered my mushrooms to be less than fresh, so I had to omit those, but in all honesty, the soup doesn't absolutely need those, so you choose. Keeping this in my \"Soup\" file on this site and WILL make again."

"reviewBody": "This soup is absolutely phenomenal! I used my own chicken bone broth, and since it would be pureed anyway, I tossed the asparagus (minus tips) and the potato into the food processor and finely chopped before adding them to the broth mixture. It made it easier to puree the soup later with my submersion blender. Since there were only two of us tonight, I finished up to adding the half &amp; half, then cooled slightly and froze half before adding about half a cup of half &amp; half to the soup in the pot. (I added a a note to the freezer container to add half &amp; half when I serve the 2nd half.) Great recipe! The potato adds a wonderful earthiness to the flavor and mushrooms make everything better! I will definitely be adding this to my holiday menu."

That's the art of cooking in my opinion, to make it my own. But really, this was pretty much spot on. Toward the end, I had fun sampling tastes in little dishes. One with a bit of Worcestershire sauce. Wow! Then another small sample of soup with a few drops of Braggs amino acids. Wowzers! Deelish! Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I will forward this to them with my adjustments. (Note: Boil the chopped potatoes &amp; asparagus in 3 cups of water until soft. Use a potato masher instead of blender. E.A.S.Y! Then simply add all of it to the pot of soup.) Voilá (Also, this is my very 1st recipe review online ever!)"

"reviewBody": "This is pure ambrosia! I made one change, and only because we made a mistake in shopping...I only had four cups of chicken stock, and the second box was beef stock, so I used 2 cups of the beef. This is the best soup ever. Years ago, in a snooty French restaurant, my husband had cream of asparagus soup, and he bragged about it all the time. I used this recipe to quell his need for it...and he swore it's better than what he got in the restaurant. I also upped the half-and-half by a quarter cup, using 1 full cup. Next time, I'm going to blend the bacon into the soup as well as having some for garnishing. The flavors were spectacular, and I'm already planning a huge batch so I'll be able to can some for this winter while asparagus is still easily available. My most sincere compliments to the home chef who created this recipe!\n\nSubsequent batch: I boo-booed. I got distracted and put in *way* too much chicken broth. 2 full quarts instead of 6 cups. I know I'm not going to be the only one to do this. I fixed it by adding a second medium potato, and using cream instead of half and half. The resulting soup was still heavenly, subtle and delicious. The thickness of the cream made up for the extra broth, as did the extra potato, all without noticeably compromising the taste or texture. This stuff's just perfect."

I used low sodium stock so it really did not increase the saltyness. I also left out the flour. This makes a large pot so the neighbours are also enjoying this. Will make again."

I tend to have a strong preference for chunkier soups. I wouldn't mind trying to puree more of the soup next time. Regardless, the flavor, though, was absolutely wonderful. There isn't a single thing that I would change. I suspect that you could remove the bacon and bacon drippings if you so desired."

I am giving only four stars just because I think it could have done with just a little herbal seasoning to liven it up a bit. Next time I will make a small bundle of herbs (like rosemary and a bay leaf) and remove them before pureeing the soup. I will also double the mushrooms next time because we love mushrooms. A splash of sherry might have also been nice."

"reviewBody": "Just made this Christmas Eve for Christmas lunch tomorrow and had to have a cup to taste test before serving my guests. Very good soup overall, and adding the bacon drippings adds a smoky flavor to the bottom of the flavor profile, and the contrasting texture of the asparagus tips, which I blanched in salted water, along with the sauteed mushrooms, which I drained, made the soup almost a one cup meal given the protein value of the mushrooms. The crumbled bacon on top made this extra decadent, and tomorrow I plan on making some homemade croutons from a stale baguette, which will give it even more crunch. The only thing I added was some fresh squeezed lemon juice, and some worcestershire sauce to give the soup and overall more complex flavor. The asparagus was a much more subtle taste, than a traditional asparagus soup, where you primarily taste just asparagus and onion or asparagus and leek. This soup has it all. Thanks for sharing your recipe!"

So, personally, I started by skipping the bacon...didn't want that texture in a creamy soup. Instead, I used previously reserved refrigerated bacon fat. Another recipe suggested a diced Jalapeno, which I added to the mushrooms, celery and onions plus a few cloves of Garlic and my homemade Seasoning Salt. I used the fresh Turkey Stock made from Thanksgiving detritus...though chicken would be better probably, Plus I don't peel the spuds. I used unsalted butter because like the Stock...it's what I had. The blending was a lot easier w/ a stick blender. Also less salty considering it's MY stock recipe, unsalted butter and my own Seasoning Salt. BTW...The soup is great w/ tremendous flavor. My guest loved it and I'm counting on it freezing well."
