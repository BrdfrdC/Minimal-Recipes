If you're sitting down and it is the majority of your meal, I'd call it 3 servings as written. I did not puree the entire batch of broth, mushrooms, and onions. I did about half and liked that approach. I wanted some discernible pieces of mushrooms and onions in the soup. End result was very thick as written. My husband was calling it gravy. I would probably use more broth/stock next time. I added water to leftovers to get it back to a creamy soup consistency."

"reviewBody": "I usually make new recipes as written, but cooking the mushrooms and onion in boullion didn't sound very appealing, so I fried them first. However, I realized after frying them, that it really didn't make a difference, as I didn't carmelize the onions, and the volume of mushrooms meant they didn't brown either, so next time I will cook them in the stock as the recipe says. Much less work! I accidentally put in more mushrooms than asked for, probably a good two cups worth, so when fully pureed it was thick enough, so I didn't thicken with flour. I accidentally used milk instead of full cream, but because I had extra mushrooms, I still added half the amount of cream to partially make up for it. Despite my ineptitude, the soup was quite delicious. I may never eat canned soup again! Next time I will follow the recipe exactly and update my review then. My apologies to the recipe creator for messing up your very easy recipe. I clearly was off my game, but the soup still turned out to be delicious."

Instead of just adding the flour, butter and milk to the shrooms, I did a light roux with the flour and butter, adding the half and half before transferring that to the stock pot with the veggies and broth. I also have an immersion blender so I took a couple of ladles of mushrooms out of the pot before puréeing the rest, adding them back at the end for some texture. So good! Thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This worked out well, but I enhanced it a bit. It's not necessary, but I sauted the mushrooms and onions before adding them to the soup for blending. I also added more sherry 1/4 cup and saw another recipe which included gorgonzola cheese which I warmed up when I warmed up the soup and added when we had another serving and it was even better if that is possible. My recommendations is to use a variety of mushrooms of texture (and taste). I also added 1/4 cup of heavy cream and cut back on the half and half. If you add the gorgonzola, you don't really need the heavy cream. It's a rich soup. A cup will do."
