"reviewBody": "I made broth with the carcass the first time I made this. I also added 2 cups of rice that I let cook naturally right in the soup. I've NEVER used stuffing!!!! I then began making this all the time, but substituted chicken and box broth/stock (low sodium.) I now only use turkey after Thanksgiving. That's the only time I make the stock as well. I have used Rotisserie Chicken, canned chicken or Instant Pot shredded chicken. My favorite chicken type to use is seasoned pan fried chicken breasts. I season both sides of the breasts with garlic powder, seasoned salt and paprika. I fry the chicken in a little olive oil (Extra Light Olive Oil.) I cook for 5 TIMED minutes per side of chicken. I use a timer and I do not touch/move the chicken until the buzzer goes off. If I am ever unsure because a piece looks bigger than another, I test with a thermometer. I use regular sized breasts, not thin sliced or tenderloins. So far, I've been right on the money perfect. Don't over load the pan. I do the chicken a few pieces at a time to avoid steaming the chicken. I also used Acini Di Pepe Pasta or Pastina instead of the rice. I also add 2 cups of frozen corn to the soup. I add the corn in when I add the chicken. I don't add the little pasta until after everything has been added and it is bubbling and simmering. My family and friends love it. I get requests all the time and I have a picky family. I usually serve some sesame seeded bread sticks with this meal."

Super easy to adjust portions. I used full veggies, half the butter and flour, half the cream. and about 5-6C of stock. Very “chowder-like”, and the thickness is easily adjusted by starting with less stock and adding adding a bit more as needed. The only real change was using broad egg noodles in place of the fettuccine. Topped each bowl with some dry stuffing as a garnish!"

I added a lot more stuffing (prob 1 cup or so worth?) and LOTS of extra seasoning .... just was a little too bland leaving it straight by the recipe. It thickened up really nicely though, and with a little hot sauce and a fresh bun for dipping it was delicious! It also makes a lot, so we froze half of it for another time."

And I pull the turkey off the carcass before boiling the bones and then add it back in when the soup Is done so it doesn’t lose its flavor. This is classic in our house though. Every year, the day after Thanksgiving, I make this recipe. I think my family is more excited for this soup than our actual Thanksgiving dinner ??"

"reviewBody": "I had to change this slightly to fit our dietary restrictions. I used Coconut milk instead of half and half, changed the butter to margarine and eliminated the extra salt as we're on low salt diets. As others stated as well, I chose to add potatoes instead of fettuccine, to make it more like the restaurant version of this dish. I should've added more stuffing as well, as others said, too. We added it in each bowl when we heated it up.\n\nI found that the potatoes sucked up almost all of the salt in it. We added a lot more salt, and spices to enliven it, and it was then really good. I messed up the flour roux so I had to add corn starch at the end to thicken it. I used a stick blender to smooth it out, and my hubby didn't like that it was smooth and not chunky. But, that's my fault, not the recipe. \n\nOverall, I will make this again and highly recommend."

No bouillon or poultry seasoning since turkey had been roasted with a dry brine that included many species and turkey carcass boiled with soup greens. Added three quarters cup stuffing instead of 1/4 cup...because...stuffing. Prior to adding half and half, turkey, stuffing and fettuccini, used a stick blender to emulsify the veggies. Absolutely fabulous flavor!!!!!! Fantastic recipe. Thank you."

I also added a bay leaf for additional flavor. Occasionly I add cooked rice instead of pasta. Alternatively I have used heavy cream to make it thicker as I use it as a base for pot pies, putting a biscuit on top. I recommend cutting the veggies nice &amp; big. I also add cut mushrooms just cause I love a fungi! Hee Hee!"

I think next time I would partially precook the fettuccine and then add it. I think next time I’ll up the amount of vegetables and try wild rice precooked instead of pasta. This made a huge pot of soup so next time I’ll only make a half batch. This was a tasty soup and a bit different than most turkey soups. I will make it again."

However, with all the butter and half &amp; half, it is not a low-calorie soup...but it is worth the splurge!! I increased the amount of carrots &amp; celery, and added onion. Might try it with chicken when I don’t have a turkey."

I took the meat off the carcass before making the stock to avoid it getting rubbery then added about 2 c. meat back in at the end. I cut the liquids/flour in half to try a half recipe but I still used 1 c. each of the onion, carrot and celery. I added about a cup of wild mushrooms, peas, and corn. Rather than stuffing I used about 2 c. of the left over wild rice and mushroom side dish. I also tossed in some leftover fresh sage, oregano and parsley at the end. This is a wonderful, flexible and delicious soup. I froze several portions and look forward to having Thanksgiving again this winter."

I also added a box of chicken stock, which did thin it out a bit. I also used Creole seasoning and a bit of extra ground thyme in place of the poultry seasoning. This was the first time I roasted the turkey carcass and I'm a definite convert! The flavor was rich and light, for sure the best turkey broth I've ever made or tasted. Eating this soup is like eating a light gravy with bits of goodies in every bite. My family agrees this soup is a new Thanksgiving traditition, along with gravy shots at the end of the meal. :)"

I had made a good bone stock using a couple turkey carcass' from turkeys I cooked for the church the day before (turkey carcass, parsnips, carrots, garlic, Italian seasoning, onions-skin and all, pepper but no salt since I brine the turkey and the drippings are plenty salty.). I ran my cornbread stuffing through the food processor just so it would be more consistent in size. The soup was simple to make and tasted delicious. Since I was out of celery I just added celery seed. Plus the stuffing had plenty of celery in it. I think today I will saute up some kale and add that to the soup as well bc the kale will go great with the cream base. I will be making this again, thanks for sharing it."

I add in bay leaf, carrots and celery trimmings, onion with its skin and parsley if I have it. I cook it all on Thanksgiving day. Boiling it for hours for a nice bone broth. I strain it and refrigerate it overnight (my garage is so cold I usually put it in there). Next morning I skim off the fat and my nice broth is ready to make a soup of my choice.

I was happy to read the reviews from the people who didn’t add the stuffing because I’m gluten free and wanted to make sure that it wasn’t an integral part. Used gluten free noodles but I’m not convinced the soup needed them. For us it’d be just as good without them. Thanks for a great recipe!"

I roasted my turkey with an herb-filled recipe so the leftover bird and resulting stock were amazingly flavorful. I used whole wheat wide, flat pasta and broke it into spoon-sized pieces. Quite yummy!"

I use egg noodles (really want to try homemade noodles with this, but haven't yet) and I add chicken stock and always add the entire box of stuffing (also wanting to try homemade with this step as well.) Also adds a ton of flavor if you do three boils instead of one. Makes your broth crazy rich! Makes a ton and freezes great!!"

For the first time I did not have any leftovers beside the carcass and l have always given it away in the pass with not knowing what to do with it.. Glad I kept it! I found this recipe and I was skeptical on how it would turn out, stuffing? fettuccine noodles? I made as written with an add of two chopped garlic cloves and 1/2 or 1cup homemade Turkey gravy made from the drippings. Kids (7-11) loved it and came back for 2nd helpings. Will make this always after thanksgiving! next time i’ll make with gnocchi.."

"reviewBody": "I made this soup last night for my family and we all enjoyed it. Anything that starts with 2 sticks of butter is going to be yummy, but in an effort to cut some calories/fat from the soup, I used 1 cup 1% milk and 1 cup half and half, and it was still very creamy and delicious. I didn't even have a full hour to simmer the turkey carcass, and it still turned out to be very flavorful. 1/4 cup of stuffing could easily be increased up to 1 cup, as this makes a lot of soup and extra broth, and I didn't even notice the stuffing in the soup with only 1/4 cup in there. Overall - great recipe that is pretty easy to make."

Also my guests at all the stuffing so there were only remnants that clung to the sides of the turkey. I boiled the carcass with celery and onion after having picked all the meat off. This gave the broth some extra gusto.. I left off most of the butter lest I die of a richness overload."

"reviewBody": "This turned out extremely well, with plenty of opportunity to adjust flavors to your taste. The only reason I substituted was to accommodate the leftovers I had. I had made a slow cook turkey stock the day before, which was thick when it cooled, so I used 8 cups of that with 4 cups of water with the broth. I also used leftover gravy (about 1/2 cup) instead of the poultry seasoning and salt (my stock was already seasoned and flavored, too), I also used more like a cup of the leftover stuffing / dressing. Lastly, I used fat free half and half, because I can never tell the difference. And I added a bag of frozen peas as others had suggested."

I was amazed that I got 3 cups of turkey off of the carcass which I thought I had pretty well picked over. I put the carcass in a crockpot and slow cooked it all night. Make sure you add at least 12 cups of water if you want to get this many servings. I followed the recipe except I didn't have any stuffing to put it. Hubby thought it needed more zip so I added a T of Santa Fe Blend &amp; about a half C of onion &amp; garlic croutons. I also upped the amount of fettucine to 8 oz. as we like lots of noodles. I broke the sticks of fettucine into 4ths, but next time I'll break them into smaller pieces as they'll be easier to eat. Yummmmm!"
