Then I crumbled the remainder of the topping over it... Baked at 350 about 40 minutes &amp; it was delicious!\nPS. I used sour cream in place of the yogurt because that was what I had on hand- wonderful!"

I mixed my apples (about 4 C total) half/half with McIntosh and Honey Crisp. Also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the yogurt mixture for a little extra spice. Topped it with vanilla bean ice cream. I'll make this one again."

The pie filling is very good, but found there to be too much of the topping for my taste; need a lot of whipped cream or ice cream to make up for the thick, rather dry topping."

I made four pies for a large group, and they all raved. I went home and made another for my family who couldn't get enough! This is the perfect pie. I used fresh berries and also covered the edges with foil for protection and after 55 min. it was perfect. I bake constantly always looking for new recipes. this is my new \"go to\" pie. I look forward to trying it with different, seasonal fruit."
