It was fabulous---as good as a much more complicated recipe. We have this every week."

Cooked my pasta not quite al dente so they would finish up in the oven and hold their shape. Used my own pasta sauce and added a little browned, crumbled Italian sausage. Next time I would used more grated cheese, especially on top. Overall a good and easy baked pasta dish."

I used a tomato, onion, &amp; garlic chunky pasta sauce, so I think that added flavor. I do feel like it was too much cream cheese though. Mainly I would lower the cream cheese by 1-2 oz (for full recipe). I'd also add in some more veggies, like diced bell pepper. We liked this enough to make it again with tweaks."

I enjoy it with and without olives, but either way it tastes delicious!! \n\nVery creamy and hearty. Very easy and delicious."

So I added about a tsp of dried minced onion and about a tsp of garlic powder to the sauce. Also mixed the sour cream into the sauce. Will make again with pepperoni chunks incorporated."

The cream cheese and sour cream gave the sauce a smooth texture that tasted wonderful. I did add some Italian sausage just because my boys aren't big on vegetarian meals, but otherwise followed the recipe as is. The prep is nice because it was easy and quick, so this works well for a weeknight meal too."

Second time I added the sour cream directly to the sauce instead of layering it, used 12 oz of shredded mozzarella and also added 1.5 lbs of cooked chorizo, my family went crazy over it!! Will definitely put this recipe in our dinner rotation from now on. Thank you!"

Super recipe, albeit not exactly super low fat, but awesome for meatless Mondays as well!! We're not big mushroom fans, so I halved the amount &amp; sauteed them first (dry saute) to eliminate the mushiness. However, they add just the right amount of flavor to this recipe. I also added a large onion, finely chopped into saute mixture with garlic and used 2 c. of boullion (used cubes) rather than broth. Yum!"

I did not layer the dish but just added the grated cheese here and there as I spooned it into the dish reserving 1/3 of it for the top. Gently tomato flavor which did not upset my GERD. I can have my Italian and sleep at night too!"

I did not use as much sour cream in the middle layer, though. I did, however, use the entire 8 oz. package of cream cheese and added a bit of water to the sauce to clean it out. To also added small cut up pieces of soppresata to it. Might add ground beef or sausage next time. AWESOME!"
