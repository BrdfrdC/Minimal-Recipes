Reduced lemon to juice of half lemon and half of the zest as well. We used 24 oz of large scallops and patted them dry and added paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and cumin to one side before popping in the skillet. I also used linguini and added spinach to the mix when adding the pasta to the sauce. With our modifications, one fourth of the recipe was 425 calories so fit nicely into my diet."

The sauce looks thin as it cooks but if youve finished the pasta in the cream as the recipe suggests it gives the sauce enough starch to thicken significantly as it cools.\n\nThis is a perfect special occasion dinner. Deadly decadent and sufficiently sophisticated, it is sure to please everyone at the table."

I used Taylor Golden Sherry. It was not too strong. We really enjoyed this with the larger scallops. Next time I might use 1-1/2 pounds instead of 1 lb. because the leftover pasta has no scallops in it! Another yummy recipe from Chef John."

The sauce didn't thicken up as much as I would have liked but it might have been because I didn't let the alcohol from the sherry burn off enough. All in all, the garlic, sherry, butter and cheeses made it very tasteful. I will definitely make this again."

"reviewBody": "This is definitely going in the recipe book. First time cooking scallops and it was a hit. Things I did differently:\n\n1. Only used a little lemon juice and omitted the rind (come on guys you know your taste better than Chef John. If you don’t like a heck of a lot of lemon reduce it)\n\n2. Used sea scallops instead of bay scallops\n\n3. Added more seasoning to scallops before searing the first side i.e. onion and garlic powder, Hungarian spicy paprika, accent and a small sprinkle of cumin\n\n4. Added spinach towards the end to make it more visually appealing while adding a veggie to meal\n\n5. Used half n half instead of heavy cream (what I had on hand. Just add more cheese to thicken if needed)"

I read some people thought it was a little too much lemon so I only used half of a lemon juiced and it was the perfect amount for us. I'm sure if you made this with the dry sherry it would be just as good too! Chef John's recipes don't disappoint, at least they haven't yet for me."

"reviewBody": "I'm always amused by people who complain when others review a recipe after making changes to the original. COME ON, PEOPLE!! Use your imagination. A recipe is nothing more than a guide. There are lots of times when, out of necessity, due to lack of ingredients, or just personal preference, changes can easily be made, and it doesn't take away from the intent of the original recipe. Here is one such example. I didn't have Bay Scallops, but I DID have some frozen Sea Scallops in a big bag from Costco. I simply used them and cut them in quarters. I didn't have heavy cream handy, so I used milk. These were minor changes and didn't detract from my hero, Chef John's, recipe. I'm sure I used more garlic and basil than he called for (probably more sherry, too!) The result was fantastic. If you like scallops and pasta, this is one you just can't mess up. It's THAT easy . . . and GOOD!!"

I used white wine instead of sherry, and loosely measured everything else (meaning I probably doubled the butter). I didn’t have a lemon so just used lemon juice and based on other reviewers didn’t go too crazy (a couple of squirts). Used coffee cream as that was what I had on hand. Loved the spice, and how simple this was. Will definitely be making again!"

Comes together quick, so have everything chopped, measured and ready to go once the scallops hit the pan.\nAlso, b/c we love scallops, I doubled the amount (I get them in a 2 lb. bag), but left all other proportions exactly as listed. Wouldn't change a thing. Served with crisp-tender asparagus."

I'll have to try it with fresh next time. It still turned out delicious though! Thanks Chef John!"
