I made only a couple changes: I made my own crust, I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup, I added some vanilla and sour cream to the custard, and I used brown sugar on the crumble topping. Honestly, I have never made or even tasted a Blueberry Pie before this but I thought it was going to be better. It was good but not OUTSTANDING, which is what I was hoping for. I will move on to other blueberry recipes until I find the best."

I used hand picked Bog blueberries (Alaska) which are more on the tangy sour side than sweet like your typically grocery berries. My first bit could figure out what was happening with all the explosive fathers going on. The sweetness of the creek filling and the sour of my berries had my tongue in a massive debate. The. The crispy crumble topping that was so perfectly crunchy just pulled the whole thing together. Wow, wow! Huge winner and definitely adding to my family recipe book with a few minor changes to fit family preferences."

I have used the recipe several times for blueberry pie and have replaced the blueberries with chopped rhubarb, red raspberries, diced nectarines and chopped chopped apples. With the apples I added cinnamon in the filling and topping, in the nectarine pie I added almond extract in the filling and sliced almonds in the topping and lately because there are only two of us I’ve cut the recipe in half to make a six inch pie,it works perfectly. I also add lemon zest to my blueberry pies now it makes the blueberry flavor stand out more."

"reviewBody": "I have made this particular recipe on numerous occasions. it usually turns out very well, and there are usually no leftovers. I use half the amount of sugar in the custard base, and I use three quarters of the sugar in the buttery crust. Do not use fully frozen blueberries or use too much sour cream in the custard sauce. This will cause your pie to have a soupy texture. I use two and two thirds cups of blueberries per pie. I have found that using three in the pre-made pie shells that I use tends to overfill them. This last time placed crushed walnuts on top of the pie after I had sprinkled the buttery topping. it turned out phenomenally well. perhaps some of these suggestions May help you but I definitely would recommend cutting back on the sugar as it does not usually dissolve properly in the mix"

The blueberries are now all over the bottom of my oven. I however am a traditionalist I guess.

I don't get a sloppy pie but one that when you cut into it and lift out the slices, it's a beautiful thing. The only tweak that I've done with this recipe is increase the berries from 3 cups to 4 or 5 cups depending on what berry I use and the size and depth of my pie plate. I tend to keep the amount of sugar to what the recipe calls for. Best pie recipe on the web!"

Probably I’ll add the new concoction as a separate recipe, eventually.\n\nFirst made a blueberry pie filling, simmered 1-1/2 containers of blueberries with 1/4c water, 1/4c cherry juice, 1/2t vanilla, 1/3c white sugar, 1T cornstarch.\n\nDidn’t have enough blueberries, so greased a 5x8 pan.\nDidn’t have a pie crust so made double the crumble (half white sugar, half brown sugar, lots of butter) and used half as the bottom crust. Baked the bottom crust for 10 minutes at 400. \nAdded 1t cinnamon to the custard and cut the sugar in half.\nLayered the crumble over the custard over the blueberry filling and baked for 25 minutes.\nSo. Amazingly. Wonderful. (with vanilla ice cream)"

"reviewBody": "First I will say that thi is a super easy pie to make. I ended up using some frozen blueberries we had that I wanted to use up. I will agree with some of the other comments about it being a tad too sweet. I'd personally cut back the sugar in the crumble topping to about 1/3 cup instead of 1/2. Then substitute some oats or maybe chopped nuts. The other thing I did was add a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping and then some cinnamon and vanilla to the custard itself. The only \"spice\" in the original recipe is salt. Lastly....Would I make this again? Yes I probably would. It's unique enough and a bit out of the ordinary so I king of like that."

I used exactly what the recipe called for, no substitutions other than the fact I used fresh picked blackberries instead of blueberries. When I made it the second time, I added cinnamon just because and brown sugar to the crumble. I don't own a pastry blender so I melted the butter into the flour and sugar for the crumbled topping. Great recipe!"

I used about 3 cups of blueberries (simply because I didn’t want leftover berries-using 2 cups would’ve been fine) and increased the other ingredients slightly—this recipe is impossible to mess up. It took longer than advertised to bake probably because of the increased berries, but it was worth it. It’s now a must-do favorite for all our guest visits."

"reviewBody": "First time I followed other reviewers' suggestions to add vanilla to custard and cinnamon to crumble and change half the white sugar to brown sugar. Those suggestions were all good. However, I also reduced the total amount of sugar based on some reviews, but this was a mistake. To me the custard did not balance with the topping. So, second time I still used other suggestions even added a tad more vanilla, but I did not reduce the amount of sugar. In fact, I used 1/3cup white, 1/3 cup brown and 1/3 cup Splenda and it was perfect. I gave 4 stars even though we loved it because I do not believe it would be as good without the addition of vanilla, cinnamon and brown sugar.\n\nUpdate: I have now made this pie 4 times in the past month... my family LOVES it."

Next time I’d go with 1/2 to 3/4 cups sugar in the custard, depending on the sweetness of your berries. Mine weren’t very sweet, but 1 cup of sugar was overwhelming.\nI didn’t go with my instincts &amp; made the streusel as directed with white sugar... Definitely go for brown! And add a splash of vanilla or almond extract to the custard as well.\nNote: the topping gets soggy after a day, so make sure to eat it sooner than later. \nBest part of the pie was the crust!

I don't like the idea of my blueberries being on the bottom of the pie and the custard on top so I was tempted to stir the blueberries in with the custard before pouring into the deep dish. I decided to follow the recipe to the letter and am very happy I did. There were plenty of blueberries bubbling to the top when I pulled it out of the oven. \n\nOur guests, who have dined with us many times, implored us for the recipe - a first! The woman, who would usually bring a dessert to our dinner parties, said she was going to stick to bringing appetizers as she didn't want to compete with anybody who could make desserts this tasty.\n\nThis recipe is easy and produces spectacular results. FWIW, I used fresh blueberries from our garden."
