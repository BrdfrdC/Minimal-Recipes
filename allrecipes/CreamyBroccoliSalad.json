"reviewBody": "This is a wonderful way to get everyone in the family to eat their vegetables, even those who don't like broccoli. I did make a few adjustments. I doubled the recipe so my adjustments are also doubled. I used organic raw apple cider vinegar, 3 tablespoons. I also added 1\\2 teaspoon of dry mustard and 1\\8 cup milk. My adjustments made the dressing a little thinner because the original recipe was a bit to thick. Using organic raw apple cider vinegar and increasing the amount by adding another tablespoon and the addition of the dry mustard made for a for a slightly more complex flavor. I air fried the bacon to reduce the total fat. Overall the family gave it 2 thumbs up!"

I added a few tablespoons of water after I tossed the dressing to thin it out as I added chopped chicken to it and I wanted a little taste on that as well. I added dried cranberries (I love the tart). I agree, let it sit for a few hours by making this ahead of time. Thanks for a great recipe!!"

I add thinly sliced radishes, definitely more broccoli, some pine nuts (or whatever nut you like for a little extra texture), and I like the 6cheese finely grated Italian mix. Be sure to mix sugar &amp; vinegar first, after melded, then mix in with the mayonnaise. Always gets raves and requests for the recipe."

"reviewBody": "I love broccoli salad but have never had it with Mozzarella cheese, gives a nice mild creaminess to the salad. I used part skim Moz. and an 8oz. chunk shredded yielded about a cup and half of cheese. I had two heads of broccoli, so not sure if that was a pound or not. The dressing was pretty good and not as vinegary as other dressings tend to be, I just added the sugar until it reached my sweet preference, just a bit under the amount called for, and I added in a few grinds of black pepper. I've learned over the years when you make a broccoli salad, make it several hours before serving so the broccoli has time to absorb the dressing, the longer the better, if you want crispy bacon just wait and toss it in later. This salad is good enough for company and will be in my recipe box."
