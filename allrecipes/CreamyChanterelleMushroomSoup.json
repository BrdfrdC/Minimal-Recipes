"reviewBody": "I have never had Chanterelle mushrooms until this year. I never knew what those wonderful orange mushrooms were. Luckily a friend told me about them. They have been prolific this year in my yard and in the yards of two neighbors that luckily don't like mushrooms. After collecting them, I had enough to share with other neighbors and friends at work. Recently I collected half of a paper grocery bag of them! I don't want to waste them! I found this recipe and it is wonderful!! I never follow recipes exactly, but this is a great one to start with. I added bacon for extra savory and added garlic powder, dried basil, and dried thyme. When serving, I topped it with fine grated parmesan cheese. It was easily one of the best soups I have ever made! Thank you for the recipe!!"

"reviewBody": "This was delicious as is; however, I prepared it with veggie broth instead of chicken broth. In the second attempt, I added a bay leaf when cooking the shallots (removed when serving) and added 1/8 tsp. crushed red pepper, 1/8 tsp. ground sage, and 1/2 tsp. dried oregano. I also used Kerigold butter and heavy whipping cream instead of half-n-half. These changes weren't necessary, but I was trying to dress it up for an event. Also looks great served with a dollop of creme fraiche."
