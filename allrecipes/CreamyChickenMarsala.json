I noticed that it was a little soupy, but I personally like more sauce when it comes to this kind of dish. I didn't notice the overpowering taste of onion until the next day so next time I'll cut the small onion into half. If you wanted to thicken the broth some just add a little more cream of mushroom soup to it. I also added garlic, and opted for season salt, garlic powder, and black pepper instead of just salt and pepper."

However, I have found that the recipes that actually use heavy whipping cream in place of the cream of mushroom soup, as well as include some sherry as well taste absolutely amazing and give more quality flavor. I’ll definitely keep this around for something that can be made quickly."

Two suggestions I picked up from other reviews were using the fat free cream of chicken soup and the ½ cup chicken broth and ½ cup of Marsala wine and I am glad I did. I did dredge the chicken breast in flour mixed with the ground pepper and ½ tsp. of garlic powder. Doubled the mushrooms using 8 ounces and also used a whole shallot chopped fine instead of the onion. I browned the chicken separately , removed and set aside. Then saute'd the shallots, some fresh garlic minced and the mushrooms. Added the Marsala, chicken broth and chicken soup, blended well in the same skillet, brought to a light boil, turn down to simmer then returned chicken to the skillet. Let it simmer about 5-6 minutes. Perfect! Chicken does not get over cooked this way."

It was also quite delicious the next day as leftovers, easily warmed in a microwave."

"reviewBody": "This was so easy and so good! Followed the recipe exactly except I let it simmer covered for about 45 minutes - steam built up under the lid and caused the sauce to be a little thin. Next time I'll either leave the lid off or vent it. I served it over brown rice - my son said the leftovers where even better the next day. Will be making this one again! Thanks for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "As I live in Japan, I had to substitute some of the ingredients because I couldn't get Marsala wine or the mushrooms. I used \"Akadama\" which is a sweet red wine and I substituted \"shitake\" mushrooms for the cremini mushrooms. I gave it 4 stars, but my partner, who is Japanese would give it 2.5 stars and the reason is that the first few bites are really delicious, but after that, the flavor is a bit \"persistent\". (Japanese people, in general, prefer more delicate flavors...) I would definitely make this again. It was quick and easy! For the pasta, I used \"fresh\" fettucini pasta."
