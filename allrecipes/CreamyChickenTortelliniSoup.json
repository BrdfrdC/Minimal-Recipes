The red pepper flake gave it a good kick but if you don’t like spicy (I’m not into hot but this was perfect) leave it out. I used one cup of chopped spinach and it was perfect mix. If you want it thicker use the recommended 10oz chicken broth. I used 2 cups which did make it more soupy. Great recipe for sure."

"reviewBody": "This was simply delicious. I'm a good cook, so every recipe is subject to my culinary whimsy, this one included. Here's what I did: 1. I used 2 1/2 cups of chicken stock. Brought it to a boil and added both the chicken and pasta. (I used frozen mushroom ravioli because that's what I had in my freezer.) I stirred in the thyme and pepper. 2. When chicken and pasta were both cooked through, I added some fresh baby spinach that, in hindsight, I should have chopped up a bit. 3. I stirred in the canned soup until it was smooth, then reduced the heat and added the half &amp; half. (Which in my case was 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup milk because, again, that's what I had.) 4. After tasting the finished product, I felt it needed a little brightness, so I squeezed in the juice of half a lemon. Perfect! Don't be afraid to make it your own. It's good!"

"reviewBody": "Tortellini with creamy chicken sounded comforting and a great change from a tomato based sauce. I just had to try this. I omitted the spinach as I don't like it, but I would make this again and add some baby spinach at the end until just wilted. Also used evaporated milk instead of half and half. I made some changes to adapt this for a crock pot supper on a busy weekend. I added the broth, cream of chicken soup, evaporated milk and seasonings to the crock pot and stirred them together. Doubled the amount of thyme. Then added a whole bag of frozen tortellini along with leftover cooked seasoned chicken. Stirred it together, covered and left it to cook on low for several hours. Garnished with a shake of paprika and Parmesan cheese. This was a thick soup, though it could be thinned with more broth. Served with biscuits. This is definitely a keeper! Very adaptable recipe. Might add some mushrooms &amp;/or peas in a future remake."

I did not measure my liquids or Tortellini just eyeballed them. Added fresh spinach which gives you the option of using as much or little as you want. Lots of mixed pepper. I think i will use a splash of Texas Pete next time and see how that will taste. Love this because of all the things you can do to make it your own. Good base recipe. Thanks"

I added all the other ingredients to that same pot. I upped the salt a little, doubled the pepper and added some poultry seasoning. I cooked the tortellini separately then drained it and added it to the same pot I started in. I added fresh spinach just before serving to let it wilt. It was good, I enjoyed the heartiness and added a few croutons on top. Use your imagination, it's a good starter!"

The second time around, I followed the suggestions of another reviewer and sautéed a small onion in a little butter, added in a clove of garlic, fresh thyme and salt &amp; pepper. Then I added this mixture to the soup. I also used about 10oz of fresh spinach which I think gave it a fresh taste and was not an over abundance of spinach. I probably would have preferred more spinach myself but overall an excellent base for tortellini soup."

There are just a thing or two I would change for next time (and there will be a next time) We also found it to be too salty and would do only one can of the cream of chicken soup in future. I added onion, as someone else suggested, and I also added two carrots and a stalk of celery. I think I would increase all those veggies next time. Loved the tortellini in the soup and would try it with the chicken/bacon tortellini next time. Probably any flavor of tortellini would be good. Oh yes, I think I will add some garlic as well. I know, I know, you will say I am no longer reviewing this soup, but it is a very good starting point."

If you don't like cream-of-whatever soups, by all means scroll on to the next recipe. And if you know you don't like those soups, why would you even bother making it or commenting?

I try to stay away from processed foods like condensed soups, so I increased the broth to about a quart and a half and added two tsps of corn starch to thicken it a little. I also added salt, since I wasn't adding the soups. I will say the broth I used was from a baked turkey. I also sautéed an onion and carrot in 2 Tbsp of butter. It was delicious with these changes and Parmesan cheese at the table. I would probably try flour next time to thicken it. The cornstarch didn't quite thicken it as much as I would have liked. My hubby loved it. I will make it again."

"reviewBody": "I followed the directions almost exactly except I sautéed 1/4 of an onion and 2 cloves of garlic in a little butter and added it to the soup. Also, I didn't have spinach on hand so about 5 minutes before serving I threw in about 1 1/2 cups of frozen peas. It was DELICIOUS!!! My entire family raved about it! This is my first review!"

Also I probably made it too bland by using salt free chicken broth (was serving it to a senior group). Anyone have any ideas for cutting the half and half since I put a lot of it in the freezer."

"reviewBody": "I made this with some leftover turkey from thanksgiving. It's a good base, though I did make some changes to give it more flavor. First I sauteed a small yellow onion, celery and garlic in a small amount of butter; increased the amount of thyme to 1 tsp. and added a few dashes of cayenne pepper. I also increased the amount of chicken stock and added a little heavy cream because I didn't have more half n half to add and as I used a larger size pkg. of tortellini it needed more liquid. I did cut the cream of chicken soup down to one can because I didn't want it to taste like canned soup."

I cook all of those together in the chicken broth until tender, then mix into the soup. I have 3 kids ages 15, 12 &amp;5 and they all love this recipe. With a little doctoring, I give it 5 stars."

I used tilapia rather than chicken (seasoned with Old Bay), peas rather than spinach, and I used a full tsp of thyme and pepper plus added garlic and onion powder to taste, and a tiny bit of red pepper. Turned out just delicious! So use it as a base and experiment!"

"reviewBody": "I LOVED this recipe!! So easy to make, quick, ready in a snap!! Today was a cold day in March and this soup really hit the spot!! I searched for a \"canned chicken breast\" recipe and got this recipe which called for \"canned chicken broth\" and \"canned cream of chicken soup\". I still went with the canned chicken breast, which shortened my cooking time by about 15min. I also used dry packaged tortellini instead of refrigerated, because the dry 12oz package was .99cents and I got more tortellini. The dry tortellini required double the amount of chicken broth so that it could cook for 15min. I used fresh spinach leaves out of a bag found in the salad section. I loved this soup! Try it tonight!!"

"reviewBody": "Here's the thing- as written, this recipe is a GREAT base, but it's pretty bland and I'd probably give it 3 stars. But with some VERY simple changes this is a solid 5 and I don't want to discourage others from making it by only giving it 3. Here's what I changed: Saute 1 small, diced onion in 2 Tbsp of butter with 2 tsp minced garlic. Add thyme (increased to 1 tsp), black pepper (increased to 2 tsp), 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, 1 Tbsp poultry seasoning. Add this mixture to the soup. I also decreased the spinach by about 1/2 a cup because there was just SO much spinach in the soup. After the changes (none of which really change the basic recipe) this soup is PHENOMENAL!!"

I put about 2 tablespoons butter, choppped green onion and some fine chopped bell pepper into pan and cooked to soften. I then added 2 cans of broth as one was not enough to cook the tortellini. Fresh spinach was all that I had on hand, chopped and added near the end to wilt properly. An extra sprinkle of grated parmesean on serving and a sprinkle of garlic croutons. This one is definitely a good base that can go in many directions."
