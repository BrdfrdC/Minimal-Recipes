I don't know how you get a warm creamy sauce when you add cold milk and cream to a warm pan with hardly anything else in it and then serve. I think the directions fell apart after cooking down the chicken broth for 10 minutes. I won't attempt this one again."

When cooking the chicken, I added a little extra butter b/c it looked dry. I also put a little bit of garlic salt on the chicken breast before I cooked. \n\nI also made eggplant parm with this dish. When this sauce mixed with the tomato sauce, it was so good Will use a version of this recipe (plus tomato sauce) to make a rosa sauce ."

I nearly doubled the sauce by adding 2 1/4 C of cream instead of the amount called for, 1/2 C of chicken broth instead of 1/2 C of water (why not?), and only 1/2 C of milk. I also added a pinch of nutmeg, 1 TB of Rosemary, salt and pepper to taste, and used only 2 chicken breast halves, cut into bite sized pieces and given a nice browning with the onions and 1/4 C of white wine. I did need 2 tsp of cornstarch to thicken the broth, but it was still a great meal."

It was just us 2, and I read other reviews about wanting extra sauce so I just made the whole thing of sauce. I tossed the noodles in half the sauce and poured the rest on top. It was good. It was lacking in some flavor though. Butter would make it better. I'm not sure what it is but something else was missing. I advise improvising and definitely adding a good amount of butter. I don't think you can really mess it up."

Although, i recommend the chicken be made in one pan, sauce in another and pasta cooking in the side BUT start the sauce first then make the chicken and pasta at the same time. The way the recipe has it, by the time your sauce is done, the pasta and chicken are cold and needs to reheated in microwave :( but seriously delicious though!"

I do not care for pasta, especially with a creamy sauce, but I actually enjoyed this as well. I gave it four stars (my husband said four, my nephew said 4 1/2 and I thought 4+). I did have to add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce and I also added mushrooms, which were a great addition. Otherwise, I made it exactly as written. I would agree with those who said to make sure the white onions are chopped small.\nThanks for submitting a recipe I (the non pasta lover) will enjoy making! It will go into our rotation!"

I added red pepper, asparagus, mushrooms, green onions and sun-dried tomatoes to the chicken broth, covered, and simmered 10 minutes (as per recipe). Everything else I followed to the original recipe."

Based on other reviews suggesting that the sauce was a little runny, I added 1/2 tsp of flour to thicken the broth mixture and used slightly less milk and cream. I also added frozen peas while the broth was simmering. The added color was nice and it created another level of texture which was nice. When everything was done, I layered the pasta, chicken, cream sauce and topped with a little mozzerella and baked for 10 minutes on 250. The extra step really blended the flavors. The family LOVED it!!"

Then the next day I took the refrigerated leftovers and began my augmentation. I reheated the sauce and chicken and added shredded Swiss cheese, seasoned salt and freshly ground black pepper. Once I poured this over the hot linguine I topped it with Parmesan cheese (in addition to what's in the original recipe) and chopped parsley. I could have tried other ingredients but these were what I had on hand and thought might taste good. It worked! I served this the next day to a friend who came over for lunch and he loved it! Not sure if I'll ever make it again though."

Also, I use boneless chicken thighs, not breasts, in everything including this because chicken thighs are juicier, have more flavor, and are richer in general than chicken breasts. Why everyone has such a phobia about dark meat chicken is beyond me because the taste is superior to white meat. A few extra calories are not that bad, and the great chefs of the universe will tell you the same thing--they prefer dark meat to breasts. Dark meat won't kill you."

I minced the onions (not the green onions) so they would dissolve into the sauce, which worked very well. I did add a little Cajun seasoning to the sauce to punch up the flavor a bit, and I thickened it just slightly with a corn starch/water slurry. When plating I garnished this with green onion tops and diced tomatoes for a little more color. Delicious! And one I’ll be making again!"
