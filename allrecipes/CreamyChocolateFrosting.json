I didn’t want to open a can of evaporated milk ‘cause what are you going to do with the rest of the can? I had half and half on hand. I used salted butter and I cut back on the amount. I didn’t want to use 2 3/4 powdered sugar but I used 2 cups. The possibilities for adjustments are there! Heck, I didn’t even sift the sugar and cocoa. I just threw everything together! It’s a great recipe and it’s so good!"

I think I prefer recipes that used melted baker's chocolate, sometimes more of a pain but better taste in the end. This is good if you need something quick but, for sure add more cocoa and some salt."

Just take double the milk and place on your stovetop at medium low for about 25 minutes (don't let it boil!). It will reduce by about half. Then let cool. I had about 1/2 T left over which I just dumped in my morning coffee. I paired this frosting with \"Crazy Cake\" from this site. I will probably try melted butter next time as Naples34102 suggested to see the difference."

"reviewBody": "I’ve never made frosting before so I’m very happy with how this came out. I doubled the recipe so I could make two dozen of these ice cream cone cupcakes and had quite a bit leftover. I didn’t have the 5.5 cups of confectioners sugar that it called for so I used what I had which was about 4.5 cups and it was plenty sweet. I would probably keep it that way in the future as long as the icing itself doesn’t become too runny from the last of sugar. I’d definitely recommend this recipe."

I filled my cake with raspberry filling so i only piped a ring/border around each inner layer and i ended up having a little bit left over. Overall great recipe!!! Thank you"

I didn't end up using all of it and it was SOOOOO sweet. Way too sweet for my taste. I added some salt to cut the sweet which worked well (I used salted butter too). My next try I'll cut the sugar by at least 1 cup but keep everything else the same."

First recipe I find is this one and it was perfect. I made 1 1/2 recipe, had left over so the regular recipe was probably enough . I used a 9x 13 pan. I added a little more powdered sugar for my taste and and extra Tablespoon of milk. I used milk cause I was out of evaporated milk other then that it was perfect.I put it in my favorites for next time, will definitely use again."

"reviewBody": "I was not a fan of the recipe. I creamed the butter to perfection and alternated adding the dry mixture and the sweetened condensed milk and it was still like Fudge—not creamy or spreadable at all...so I added 50% more sweetened condensed milk; not much improvement. After adding several tablespoons of 2% milk, I had a frosting...but it was still just a boring, powdered-sugar flavored, not overly creamy frosting that didn’t spread the “best” (or worst) I’d ever worked with (hence a not overly pretty cake). This one was too sweet and not creamy enough for my preference and I don’t even know how others made it workable as written, but maybe that had a bit to do with where you live? It didn’t work well on a cold Midwest day for sure;)"

Me and my family decided to use this recipe to top a chocolate marble cake for Easter, ( I'm not the type of person with the moral of \"Oh well the costumers always right\" but) We checked the ingredients multiple times and I'm sure we had measured correctly but...alas it was just a liquid mess, not creamy frosting, but liquid chocolate. We applied it to the cake when the cake was cool, so It wasn't that the cake was too hot, and the frosting melted, but that the recipe consistency was a flop. It was however delicious so next time I would just add more cocoa and sugar."
