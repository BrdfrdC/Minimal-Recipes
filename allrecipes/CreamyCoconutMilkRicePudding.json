"reviewBody": "Wow! This blend of flavors is incredible. I did not have whole milk, so used almond milk instead. I also used 2/3 of the recipe, as I only had one can of coconut milk, which was only 2 cups, but ended up adding the full amount of rice (regular long grain rice) in order to absorb all the liquids. I tossed everything except the rice and peaches into a saucepan and stirred until the butter melted, added the peaches and rice, then let it sit for about a half hour. Finished it off for 2 minutes in the microwave to further absorb the liquid. It is delicious!"

I followed the recipe as stated except for three things: used 3/4 c white sugar (which may be as sweet as 1-1/2 c raw sugar..I don't know), added two handfuls of raisins when adding the eggs and milk, and finally sprinkled the cinnamon and pinch of nutmeg to individual servings. There are many comments about changes other cooks have done with success. I enjoy this dessert!! Light, not too rich, and while warm, I couldn't leave it alone. Yum!"

"reviewBody": "Yum! This turned out pretty well, although I did follow the advice of others and cut the sugar by half. Even then it was a touch on the sweet side. Also, I cut back on the spices. To be honest, I think I liked it best just before adding the spices. The next time I make it I will just sprinkle cinnamon on the portions of people who want it. Finally, I found that after 18 minutes, my rice was not yet the right texture. I dumped in some more milk and cooked it for another ten minutes. That was the right amount of time for my rice to become the perfect texture."

"reviewBody": "Very tasty, but as others have said, 1.5c of sugar seemed like a lot for 3 cups of rice. Others have said they cut the sugar in half, but I thought maybe that was overkill, so I cut down to 1c, which is cutting by 1/3. And that was 3/4 cup turbinado sugar with 1/4c white sugar, because I thought I might not care for all turbinado. It's borderline too sweet, so next time I make it I'll indeed cut back to 3/4c. Also, a quarter-cup of butter seemed like a lot, so I used only 3T and it tastes fine.\n For the spices I went with only 1T cinnamon and 1t nutmeg, and that was plenty for my taste.\n To me, rice pudding HAS to have raisins, but I didn't want to just add them at the end like the recipe says, which wouldn't give them much time to plump up, so I added them when there were 5 minutes left of the 18-20 minute boiling period. That gave them that 5 minutes, plus the 2 minutes after adding the milk &amp; eggs, plus the time for the pudding to cool down, and that seemed to be about right."

Also, for aesthetics, I like my rice pudding to look white and then add cinnamon on top. Adding vanilla, cinnamon makes the pudding turn brown."

I added extra vanilla (I like the flavor) and kept all other ingredients and measurements the same. I tasted it before adding the butter and probably could have done without it, but alas, I added it anyway. I will definitely make this again with some of the other variations I've read in the review section."

I omitted the nutmeg and only used half the cinnamon as I was afraid of losing the other flavors in there. The raw sugar adds an extra dimension. I will surely be serving this at this winter's holiday potluck. The perfect combination of exotic (because of the coconut) and traditional (because of the raw sugar and the cinnamon)."

I also don't like things too sweet and watch my sugar intake, so used only 1/2 c sugar and it was still wonderfully sweet and mild tasting. One more modification--I used yolks only. I made the basic version and then let people add raisins, cinnamon, nutmeg, or fruit as they preferred, and got a lot of compliments. Thanks for the excellent recipe!"

I also only could find organic coconut creamer at the store which worked great. I used only about 1tbsp of butter and it came out really good. Next time I'll cut the sugar way down (probably 1/2 or 1/3 of the suggested amount) and just add enough to taste since it was very sweet.\nOverall a great recipe though."

I tried this recipe with vanilla and wasn't a big fan. Vanilla is overpowering. I reduced the vanilla by half next time and i couldn't help but feel it needed ice-cream as it was overly vanilla tasting again. Third time i substituted nut and even my women asked for seconds, just use the same amount of nut as they use vanilla in the recipe and your cool bannanas mate."

I wasn't sure how I would like the cinnamon on the pudding (can't stand the taste of nutmeg so that was a no brainer to leave it out lol) so instead I left it out and exchanged the vanilla for half coconut extract and half rum extract. Once it started to cool down I added some very well drained crushed pineapple to the pudding. It was like a Pina Colada flavor. Would for sure make it that way again!"

I didn't have whole milk (or cream), so I left out the sugar and added a can of sweetened condensed milk at the beginning and probably about 1/2 c. of 1% milk at the end of the cooking time. I also added a little bit more coconut milk, but not much and some chopped Pink Lady apples. I didn't try it, but I'd be willing to bet that some chopped cinnamon and sugar almonds would make an amazing addition as well."

I slowly added one cup of the hot rice mixture to the eggs, and then added the eggs/rice mix back into the main dish. I will make this again. Thanks"
