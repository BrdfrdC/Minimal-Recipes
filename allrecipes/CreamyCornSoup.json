"reviewBody": "Slightly above average overall. Best thing is it is quick and has a good flavor for less than 30 minutes. I modified slightly. I used 1 whole onion, 1/2 tsp tomatoe paste, 1 tsp olive oil plus 2 tbsp butter in lieu, plus added 1- 12 oz can cream style corn. Nothing like my more complex tasting, long standing, personal corn and shrimp soup recipe which takes a few hours to develop flavors. But much faster if craving a fast corn soup."

"reviewBody": "My husband accidentally bought 4 cans of creamed corn rather than regular corn so I was looking for a recipe that I could use at least one of the cans. This was quick and easy and I found that I could make little changes to personalize it however I wanted. First off, instead of two cans of corn, I used one can of corn and one can of creamed corn, which I think helped thicken it too. Followed a previous review and did equal amounts of butter to flour (3 tablespoons). We also had some frozen veggies that we needed to finish off so we added those in and because of no onion on hand, used dried onion flakes. This soup turned out great! My daughter who doesn't like soups liked it because it's more of a chowder and I liked that I could use milk rather than cream or half and half. Definitely keeping this handy!"

My daughter put 1/2 of the corn in the food processor to make it creamier, and it did not disappoint. I tried to get my husband to walk down the block for a rotisserie chicken to add some to the soup but he wasn't feeling it. It was creamy and yummy anyway."

"reviewBody": "I thought this tasted okay. I was looking for a corn soup or chowder to use some corn I had just cut off some cobs. I did use no sodium broth and fresh corn instead of canned. I am glad I did because, with the added garlic salt, this would have been way too salty. I ended up using corn from 4 cobs for the 2 12oz cans. I subbed 1 Tblsp. of dry parsley for the parsley and it worked fine and just did a pinch or so of black pepper, as I don't really care for it. I tasted it and thought it was missing something and a little too thin. I ended up adding a Tblsp. more of flour, and whisking that in, and chopping up a couple of sprigs of green onion and adding that also. It much improved the taste and texture. I had no bacon like a lot of the other corn soups and chowders tend to use as garnish, etc. but we did sprinkle it with a cheese blend. It was filling tonight and quick for what I had in the house."

I started by sauting two very thinly sliced chicken breasts, removed and then proceeded with the recipe. I used 2% milk and two cans of Campbell's chicken broth I added the second one after I saw how it lacked the extra \"soupy-ness\" I like. It was more like a stew. I did have to thicken it a bit after this with a flour slurry. I also used frozen corn, added diced pimentos and the chicken back in. Next time I'd cut back on the corn. I was very surprised that you could taste the cream cheese, there isn't much in it. Served it with oyster crackers and cheddar cheese."

I also used dried paresley instead of fresh (can't stand the taste of fresh unfortunately).Used frozen white corn instead of canned to cut down on sodium and added my own salt to the mixture. At the end added some cheddar (mild) and melted through because the milkiness alone was not enough flavor for me. I think tabasco, worchestershire, or Old Bay would be nice additions as well. Almost a 5 but not one of the best I've had. EXTREMELY EASY... and anything I don't want to puree is tops with me."

I added about a cup more broth than called for (and it made just enough for 3 adults and 2 kids as the main course of dinner). I also used Neufchatel cheese, and was afraid it wouldn't work, but it did. It was actually very thin until I added the cheese, and I was worried. At first, the cheese broke up into little chunks, but I wisked it really well and it worked fine. I don't use canned corn so I used 3 cups frozen (a mix of white and yellow). I used garlic powder and just a sprinkle of the garlic salt. Served with crackers and a nice green salad."

I added 4 small chopped red potatoes with the corn and cream cheese, brought to a boil, and then covered and simmered for 20 minutes. This softened the potatoes and melted the cream cheese.

So use at LEAST 3 Tbsp of BUTTER to your flour. I also use fresh or frozen corn, never canned, unless that is all I have. If using canned, Definitely drain it! Also I always add in a good amount of cheddar cheese to my own bowl and I think that helps with the taste. Also if you can, go out of your way to use fresh parsley, it does help and you notice the flavor tremendously. But I love the soup"
