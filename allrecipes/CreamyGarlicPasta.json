I cook a couple of strips of bacon in the pot, then sauté the garlic in the bacon grease with the juice from one lemon, omitting the olive oil and butter. I also use a whole box (1 lb) instead of 1/2 a lb. I found that this gives a better consistency and gives my family of four enough for leftovers. I often serve it with roasted vegetables. This is a staple in our house—my picky eaters love it!"

Started with 1/4c and thought it was plenty - especially since I sprinkled with shredded Parmesan over each serving. Loved this pasta as written and would absolutely make again! Make again as is, to pair with some blackened salmon or even add some chicken or shrimp to it. No matter how you pair or add, this could be the basis for a date night meal! Thanks Celestial!!"

I made the recipe as written (4 servings) the only thing I'm going to do different is cut the recipe in half.! at 4 servings as a side there was enough left over to make an entire other dinner with, cut up some sausage and fried it up a little, add some peas and a little milk, mixed it all together with the pasta!"

I did reheat the chicken strips in the oven after coating them with some garlic, oil and some blackened seasoning. I added the mushrooms about a minute before the pasta was done and then added the cream and cheese. I used the cut up chicken strips to top off the pasta. It was delicious either way."

We had fresh gnocchi, but it turned too mushy for our liking (cooked for 7 minutes instead of the 12 for regular pasta). I’ll keep this as an easy meal favorite. On another note, we didn’t find the garlic to be overpowering (although we love garlic and added an extra clove to the recipe)"

Next time, I would use less Parmesan cheese and maybe a a thicker pasta, like maybe linguini fini. I don’t care for spaghetti and I think fettuccine would be too thick. It was very quick and easy to make. I loved the “one” pot recipe, not a lot of clean-up. I would make this again. Thank you"

I did add canned chicken, and on the side I cooked up some jalapenos and onions, that I didnt mix with the pasta. I like spice but not everybody does, so i just added the onions and jalapenos on mine. So good!! Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make again. Maybe I'll add some mushrooms next time."
