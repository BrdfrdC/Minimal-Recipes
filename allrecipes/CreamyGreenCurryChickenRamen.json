"reviewBody": "I loved this! The ONLY changes I made was to chop two jalapeños (because mine were on the small side) and half the fish sauce because I had a picky eater guest I was worried about. I also added the chicken AFTER sautéing the jalapeños and red bell pepper (yes, I moved both peppers to step 1). I wanted everything to be semi-cooked before moving on in the recipe. Even with those minor modifications- this was delicious! Fun, easy, and a new twist on ramen deliciousness! Thank you fabeveryday! Kudos to a great dinner!"
