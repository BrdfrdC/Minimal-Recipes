Sprinkled a little flour over bottom of crust. Sprinkled ham mixture over floor of crust and sprinkled more cheddar/swiss over the top. Baked"

To save prep time, I mixed all ingredients together (minus the cheese for the topping) and it turned out great. If you are watching your carbs, leave out the pastry crust and just poor mixture into a buttered pie dish. My quiche was done in 40 minutes. Very tasty dish."

This was so absolutely delicious! Definitely a make again recipe, though I would probably add pepper into the mix somewhere and I'm going to try with sausage and/or bacon."

I love Dijon mustard but found it wasn't mixed in the meat well enough, it requires a lot of work to spread it around. I just finished the last piece from two nights ago and find the Dijon mustard flavor seems even stronger! I had Canadian Bacon so used that and no honey mustard anymore so used the Dijon. It's a hard decision about giving it 5 points."

I used gluten free flour for my pie crust and was worried that the pie crust wouldn’t turn out and the whole dish might be ruined, but thankfully it did and I was happy. Very tasty!

I think I would maybe include regular onion to give It even more flavor and maybe cayenne pepper. The honey mustard adds some great flavor. I’d make It again but might add some modifications. I think it will just depend on what you prefer in a quiche. The filling did tend to over flow the crust so be sure to put a pan beneath It in the oven to protect from spills/overflow."

Think I’ll use a shorter pre-browning time for the blind baked crust, or start with a frozen pastry shell (mine was storebought and from fridge. Brava on this recipe!!!!!"

"reviewBody": "I took a gamble on this one since my husband doesn’t like Swiss cheese or onions. He ate it! It was very tasty, but I definitely needed a deep dish pie crust. The filling went way past the crust in the dish. I considered omitting the green onions, but I’m so glad I left them in. I did omit the salt, as the ham was salty enough. I didn’t have honey mustard, so I used 1 T of Dijon and 1 T of honey. Worked for me! If I were making this for myself in the future (sans picky husband), I’d use more Swiss and less cheddar, but I love Swiss cheese!"

Excellent in both texture and taste. Served with a salad. Perfect for warm summer night dinner. Was hoping to have leftover for lunch tomorrow but all gone. Will definitely make this quick and easy dish again soon. Thanks for submitting it."
