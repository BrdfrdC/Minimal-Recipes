"reviewBody": "These were sooo good. The Yukon Gold potatoes are key. I tripled the recipe and liked that I didn't have to peel 12 pounds of potatoes. It takes longer to cook the potatoes whole but I did it in three batches and was working on other dishes while they cooked away. The skins come off easily after cooking and then the stand mixer does all the work. I used whole milk instead of half/half and used less than stated to get them to the right consistency. Used salt to taste and could have easily just eaten them up at this point. I did layer each batch in the crock pot and added butter between the layers - but I used one stick total and honestly I thought they tasted better without the butter. Turned the crock pot on the morning of Thanksgiving - stirred a few times - and was ready by dinner."

The recipes that called for cream cheese were too rich for serving with gravy; other recipes tended to collect water overnight. \nThis is a wonderful recipe. Using the russet potatoes and keeping the skin on while boiling was the answer. After fixing and refrigerating, I warmed mine to room temperature in the microwave and then added butter, covered with aluminum foil, and heated up in the oven. They came out with the dinner rolls, nice and hot and yummy."

There are more than I need because I was afraid to halve the recipe on my first attempt, but I am sure they will disappear. Now to see how the meat turns out."

Recipe said, and reviewers concurred, that key to good taste was to wait until the day of serving to add the butter. But even a day after that with butter it still tasted good. I used unsalted butter because I like to add my own salt; I find the sweetness of unsalted butter with the freshness of my own added salt makes a good contrast."

I also used an electric hand blender and it worked fine. Came out creamy, and like someone else said - like instant (super creamy) but better!"

"reviewBody": "These potatoes were extemely easy to make. The ratio of potatoes:liquid was right on. Everything blended well at the end (was looking soupy but I kept going). My only changes were to keep the skins on and to place in a 200 degree oven to keep warm. This recipe really is a make-ahead one with no loss of flavor."

"reviewBody": "I cooked my potatoes a couple of hours before our Christmas lunch, keeping the skin on. After they were done, my husband started peeling the potatoes for me. I started w/ a few potatoes and some half and half and used my electric beater to mix. As he got more peeled, I added more potatoes, and more half and half, etc, etc. I eventually added my salt and black pepper. Right before serving lunch, I heated the potatoes in the microwave and added a stick of butter. They were really thick and very tasty. My children love mashed potatoes and went back for seconds….and yes, thirds."

"reviewBody": "I'm giving this 5 stars even though I altered the recipe somewhat. It is a good base to start with. I was cooking for 15 people and wanted to have plenty of potatoes (plus leftovers!). I used about 13-14 lbs of potatoes, cooking in three separate batches. I did peel the potatoes first. When mashing I added 1/2 cup half and half, a couple of ozs of cream cheese, about 2 tbsp butter, salt, freshly ground pepper and onion powder to taste for each batch and as I finished each batch I put them in my large slow cooker. The next day I added additional butter while reheating. I got many compliments from my family and they tasted great with and without the turkey gravy."

"reviewBody": "Great ideas and basic recipe for make ahead mashed potatoes! The recipe and tips on keeping the potatoes warm helped this busy cook during Thanksgiving! I made the recipe the night before Thanksgiving using white potatoes I peeled and cut before boiling. I then followed the recipe and instructions, using a mixer to mash and blend the potatoes with low-fat half and half and a \"sprinkling\" of salt. Thanksgiving day I continued with the rest of the recipe and tips and had fantatic, fluffy, creamy mashed potatoes that no one knew where made the night before! Thank you for the recipe and ideas! :)"

"reviewBody": "Just wanted to say these potatoes were great. I didn't make them ahead of time though. I made them for Thanksgiving dinner and this is what I did and it worked great. I boiled them, drained off the water, and since they were done a little bit earlier than I thought they would be, I put the lid on the pan and set them aside. They will stay warm quite a while like that. Came back a few minutes later to peel and mash, but my daughter said I should leave the peel on the potatoes...my other daughter and grand daughter agreed with her so that's what I did. After mashing them, I put the butter on top of the potatoes and covered with lid. Just before it was time to eat, I put the pan on the stove on low heat while heating up the half and half, poured that over the potatoes, added salt and pepper\nand by the time the milk was stirred in real good, the potatoes were prefectly warm. Very good. And if you like potatoe peeling try leaving it on....I'm glad I did."

Actually, I think I made them the day/night before, and put them in my crockpot on low T-Day morning. They were hot when I was ready to serve..\nI lost the recipes..came back here to find. \nNow that I think about it..I had some leftover cauliflower from a dinner the night before..I pureed that and added to the 'tatoes..noone noticed."

Not only were they good, my guests ate them up so fast, I barely got a taste! Heating them up was so easy. I just popped them in the microwave for about 7 minutes on high, stopping once to stir. Once heated, I added the recommended butter and covered with plastic wrap until lunch time. They tasted divine! No one guessed they'd been cooked yesterday...and I certainly didn't tell! Oh, one more thing, pierce the potatoes with a fork a few times before boiling with skins on."

I'm sure you could add things to them but I think the whole idea of this recipe was \"make ahead\" saving you time and stove space later. I'll use this again in the future for when I need extra time to make something else to go with them. Thanks for the recipe!"

I make them early in the morning and put them into a crock pot,with a stick of butter on top,put on the warm setting."
