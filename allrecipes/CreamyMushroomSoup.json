I read a review that said to use beef stock, but didn’t have any on hand so I used one cup of chicken that I’d made the night before and one cup of water with a beef bouillon cube. Added parsley to the mix and used full fat milk with a little extra butter. No cinnamon but plenty of pepper for a nice kick. Delicious!"

"reviewBody": "Loved it. Needed a hot dinner quick for a hungry husband who likes mushroom soup. We're adventurous diners, but the cinnamon felt like a risk. Both of us loved it, even the cinnamon! Hubs said \"It's a keeper.\" Decided not to puree the mushrooms per usual and liked the change.\nWill be my main Mushroom Soup recipe from now on... so fast and delicious. Served it with split bolios, buttered and topped with cheese. 2 minutes in the toaster oven at 400!\n\nUmm, the whole dinner - comfort food taken up a notch and on the table in less than 30 minutes. Thank you, Lori, for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Very good! I made this yesterday, knowing it would be even better today! I scaled this down to 4 servings and used a 10 oz pkg of white mushrooms. I did not have half &amp;half on hand so I used 2% milk. That could be why it was on the thin side, not creamy. Maybe a little cornstarch would have helped that. (Heavy cream would work here, I'll bet.) I also did not have shallots available, so I sauteed 1/4 chopped onion along with the white mushrooms. I used beef broth instead of chicken and also added a little white wine, thyme and did do the cinnamon. Delicious soup and comes together very quickly!"

"reviewBody": "I can't pass up 1/2 price mushrooms at our awesome Italian market. We toss them into spaghetti sauce, fajitas, chicken dishes and we always have a bowl of mushrooms &amp; onions for gravys or omelettes but it hadn't occurred to me that a creamy mushroom soup was an easy fix. This was so easy, fast and, after 1 try is already on my go-to lunch list.\nI omitted the optional cinnamon and used mushroom broth instead of chicken. I had planned on running it through the blender before serving but hubby loved the mix of rough chopped mushrooms. \n\nI should note that I'm a lazy cook who needs a huge payoff for very little effort (luckily, hubby is an amazing cook) and this recipe checked all my boxes."

I doubled the recipe and was a little creative: more mushrooms, more flour for a more creamy consistence and I did use the cinnamon because my sis is partial to that spice and she was able to pick up its subtle flavor. \n\nI did not blend any of the mushrooms and she suggested next go round to do so. I'll blend the portobello but not the others.\n\nWill definitely make this over and over."

Not a huge shitake fan, but I would use crimini or portabello next time for a stonger mushroomy flavor. I also used an immersion blender and overdid it, I would keep more just chopped next time. Great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I truly enjoyed this! I stuck to the recipe the best I could. I didn't have shallots, so I just used a sweet yellow onion. No Shiitake mushrooms, just 8 oz of baby bellas, so that is what I used. I saw in some of the comments some pureed it but, I didn't and I'm glad. I like the texture differences that it had. I was a little skeptical of the cinnamon but, I always like to stick to the recipe the first time, so in my first bowl I put a dash. I liked the smell and comfort it gave but then on the 2nd bowl, I just ate plain and liked the true mushroom flavor coming through. So, try it either way. Make sure you do cook a couple of minutes after adding the flour just to cook off the flour taste, I always do. Even though I thought it was great, I think next time, I might just add a tad of Sherry or White wine, just to try with that extra layer of flavor."
