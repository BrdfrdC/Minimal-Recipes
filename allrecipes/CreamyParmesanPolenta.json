"reviewBody": "Keith! This was wow-good! And so easy!! Made as a side dish for baked shrimp. It did take closer to 10-12 min for the polenta to cook down and yes, I could have mashed perhaps either before to speed up the process or after to make sure the mixture was extra creamy but, like mashed potatoes? We don’t mind some lumps! I agree with BuckWheat Queen that smoked paprika is the bomb and I ended up adding 1/4 tsp. Will be a regular side for me from now on! Thank you!"

"reviewBody": "This creamy cheesy polenta is so delicious and rich. It's savory. I served it with filet mignon. It was the perfect complementary flavor profile. I used low sodium chicken broth because that's what I had available, and it was amazing! I would never use regular chicken broth for this recipe, since it tasted perfect! I also used a lot of paprika, not a dash. I highly recommend that you make this recipe, even if you don't have a fancy meal planned. You may want to eat it all. Remember you have to use a potato masher to break down the cubed polenta after removing the polenta from the heat (I think that's not written in the recipe). Enjoy!"

I also used vegetable broth in place of chicken brother to make it more vegetarian (not vegan, bc of the cheese!) I also added a tablespoon of butter. It worked wonderfully topped with the roasted zucchini, tomato, kale, peppers and onions!"

I put the cornmeal in the chicken stock, heated the milk till boiling, added the cornmeal mixture, lowered the heat and continually stirred. I added 5oz of cut-up white cheddar and 2 tablespoons of parmesan cheese. I finished with a small pat of salted butter. I omitted the salt listed in the recipe because this dish was salty enough with the stock, cheeses and butter. This cooked up so quickly. It was so tasty I kept eating it and forgot to take a picture for you guys! hahahahaha??"

I think the next time I make this recipe, I'll probably throw in more seasoning to kick up the flavor a notch."

To try and please everyone I added a 1/4 cup half and half, which was a good addition. Used Trader Joe's polenta with a potato masher. It was a quick and easy side dish. Will make again!"

I enjoyed the addition of paprika and added a bit more than a pinch once I tasted it. I used smoked paprika and it gave such a nice earthy flavour it was hard to stop at just a pinch. This is a wonderful compliment to baked chicken. Thank you keithahaney for sharing this recipe."
