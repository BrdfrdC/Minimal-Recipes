This was identical in taste to the Alton Brown's microwave fudge using pb, butter, &amp;powdered sugar. I think next time, I'll try 6 mins to see if I can get a bit creamier texture. Unless anybody has a diff suggestion."

No matter the humidity in the air, altitude or knowledge of the fudge maker, it doesn't fail as long as you stick strictly to the 7 minute rule. Please note, the 7 minute count down needs to begin when the mixture is at a full boil and not just bubbling a little. I've made this recipe countless times and it never fails to deliver perfectly creamy fudge with just the right amount of everything!!"

This gives the fudge a rich color and does not change the taste. I did appreciate the advice not to stir once the seven minute boiling stage begins. This year‘s Christmas batch was the best fudge I ever made and the best fudge I ever had."

"reviewBody": "I modified this recipe to use less sugar, substituting stevia for the white sugar but used only 1 cup stevia for the 4 c. of white sugar, but still used the 1 c. of brown sugar though, plus I used mini marshmallows instead of the marshmallow crème. Also added 1/2 c. of Baker's Cocoa, whisked in well before boiling the first batch of ingredients. After adding the marshmallows, peanut butter and vanilla extract, I added 1 cup of uncooked oats and 1 cup of rice krispies and divided the recipe into 2-8 inch square pans. I plan on using these bars as a substitute for breakfast bars. These are chilling at the moment and when pouring the final result into the pans the texture seemed thick enough to set up, yet nice had a fluffy, light texture, so I am anxious to try them after letting them chill a few hours."

"reviewBody": "Irritating that instructions don’t tell you not to stir during the 7 minute boil. First time fudge makers need to know this! I assumed it would burn if not stirred! Also, it doesn’t state how much peanut butter in cups if all you have is the huge jar. First batch crystally and doesn’t taste very peanut buttery. I’m going to make another batch once I buy the 16oz jar of peanut butter. I’ll be back to update."

It did not set well to form fudge it appeared greasy at the bottom and would not set at all. I feel like I did something wrong as the reviews were great. I did not stir it constantly I misread and thought it said occasionally lol! So any advice on how to get it to set would be amazing. The taste alone is worth several more tries."

I did this, exactly as it states. I followed everything to the T and I guess I still messed it up. Everything seemed fine until I added the peanut butter, and it immediately turned from liquid into crumbles. I'm not sure what I did wrong but I'm upset it wasn't as easy as everyone claimed it to be. I pressed it into the 9X13 since it wasn't spreadable."

I thought they would be since the amount of sugar is so much more than other fudge recipes on this site, but I needed to use up some evaporated milk so I gave it a shot. I do like the fact a thermometer does not need to be used, but like another reviewer said, it should be clear to bring the fudge ingredients to a full boil before timing for seven minutes. Other than these two issues, it would be a very good recipes. I won't make it again based on these assertions. However, I always appreciate members sharing their recipes."

I follow the recipe exactly and have never used a candy thermometer because I don't need to, just boil it for seven minutes. \n\nI've seen one review in particular that says the reviewer boils this for a total of 15 minutes. All I can say is I don't know how on earth she winds up with fudge, as that would make it extremely dry. \n\nOther reviews say to ignore the seven.minutes and use a candy thermometer.
