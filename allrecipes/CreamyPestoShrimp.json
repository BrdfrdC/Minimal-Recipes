So rich and creamy, all ingredients worked together like a symphony. Instead of shrimp, I used some red snapper that my husband had caught himself in the Gulf of Mexico--sauteed in olive oil and cut into chunks ahead of the rest of the meal, then reheated in the sauce shortly before serving. I'm willing to bet many types of fish could be used. The sauce is so simple to make and concocted in just a few minutes. This meal could easily be made on a work night. Keeping!"

I melted the butter, threw in garlic, cooked the shrimp, then put the milk and cheese and pesto in per recipes instructions. Green onions added some nice taste and color. I would make this again, but look for how to kick up the flavor. Maybe more pesto?"

I let it simmer for the allotted amount of time but the Parmesan never really melted completely. I picked out the shrimp which was ok since it was covered in sauce but I threw away the pasta. Thankfully I made salad and garlic bread with it so I had something else to eat. I will not be making this again."

"reviewBody": "I followed the idea, but I eyeballed this for the most part. I also added cherry tomatoes to this for the extra punch. I cooked my cherry tomatoes in a bit of Unsalted butter and olive oil until tender. I then removed the tomatoes and added more unsalted butter and shrimp. When the shrimp turned pink, I added about a table spoon or less of pesto, 10% cream, and parmesan. As soon as it it a decent thickness, I poured it over my 1/4 pound of cooked linguine and then added my tomatoes. It is awesome. I have made this numerous times and have added more tomatoes than my initial amount. \n\nAfter my water boiled, the 11 minutes it took for my linguine to cook us the time it took me to make my sauce. Totally restaurant quality."

Second time I made it I happened to have some red peppers, and mushrooms, that I needed to use. That just added a different level. Not saying better, but I have wasting food, l'm actjually a vegetarian lately so I just scoop the shrimp off my plate and the family gets to finish it. There are times I do eat fifsh, so I guess that makes me a pescatrian."

ALSO I cooked the shrimp in a separate pan with butter, olive oil, salt, pepper, and about a tablespoon of garlic. This added a lot more flavor to it rather than cooking it in the sauce."
