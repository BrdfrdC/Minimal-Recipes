One is not enough. \nAdded regular and smoked paprika.\nDidn't have any onions or shallots on hand so added onion powder. \nDidn't add the wine. Instead just used chicken stock in place of it. \nAdded alot more lemon juice. \nAdded half a cup of fresh parmesan. \nWith these changes it came out great."

I find its more flavorful than chicken stock.\n3. I added Black garlic sprinkle to my flour dredge.\n4. I added fresh chopped asparagus to the liquid (about 4-5 sprigs chopped)\n5. I added more cheese probably only because it wasnt looking like scampi but more like alfredo.\nI think that is the only changes I made. I smell and taste as I go. It was delicious, but didn't taste like scampi."

The shrimp had this beautiful four coating with a wonderful texture and I lost quite a few while I was making the sauce. To avoid soggy shrimp I did not add the shrimp to the sauce but instead warmed them in the oven then served them on top of the sauce topped with fresh parsley. Amazing! The sauce was delicious! To avoid the curdling the cream, lower the heat to low and add a little cream at a time, if the cream starts to curdle add in a little butter. The acid in the sauce may cause the cream to curdle but adding more fat will help. Thank you for the recipe will be making this again!"

It reheated wonderfully too.\n\nWhat I see happening a lot with reviews, people make a lot of changes to a recipe and then give a rating...How can you rate it good or bad when you're not following the original recipe? I don't think leaving out the shallots made too big of a difference in this recipe, but some of the changes I have seen made in other recipes are just crazy - then someone will give a review. How is that an accurate rating?"

I saut√© these in olive oil until onion is almost translucent. I then added the shrimp coated with the flour and salt and pepper and saut√© that with some additional olive oil and spices including the parsley. I added the chicken broth all at once. I don't know why they ask you to divide it. I then added one cup of cream and 3 tablespoons of lemon juice. I did not have white wine but it was perfectly fine without it. And I didn't see the need for the butter so I didn't add that either (it's a lot less fat anyway). I added my pasta and set it aside to settle for about 10-15 minutes."

Well crud, all this did was separate the butter and leave me with clumpy shrimp. So I seperarated the shrimp with the clumpy cream sauce, placed it into a new saucepan and added 1/4 cup of half and half. Good as new if not better! Added also a pinch of red pepper and it turned out exactly like my favorite expensive store bought scampi. Absolutely yummy and I'll make it again, possibly with the same cornstarch mistake ??"

When I served to my family (who were pretty excited that I was trying a new recipe, they quickly said it has NO flavor. So I added a lot of Italian Seasoning and \"Gourmet Garlic\" seasoning before I served myself. Mine was great. they added the same to theirs, but it was not mixed in as well, so a little disappointing. My daughter went back for leftovers and liked that much better since it had the seasoning."

My changes per time &amp; necessity: I doubled the shrimp; used green onions instead of shallots; used Pinot Grigio instead of Chardonnay; used 3 TBsp butter instead of 1/2 cup. Oh-My-Goodness. I think I could eat this every day if I didn't know it would kill me, and even then it might be worth it! I served over fettucine. Try topping it with a nice garlicky bruschetta, it's crazy good."

I also added a little more lemon at the very end for extra flavor and did zest from the lemon on top with fresh diced tomatoes. I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried and also added some dried basil to kick it up a bit. I reduced the butter to 4 tablespoons which was more than enough. Also used white cooking wine since i didn't have a white opened. Used diced onion instead of shallots since it was handy. Had parmesan cheese and that worked just fine. Served it classic with a salad and warm rolls."

As the sauce isn't thick. The rice will absorb the excess. Gonna have my leftovers with brown rice for lunch! I also used alot more garlic. Will definitely make it again!!"

I made two tiny changes, only used 1 tsp of lemon juice (not lemon lovers) and used 1/2 &amp; 1/2 instead of the cream. Otherwise, followed the recipe. Timing was perfect and adding back in the shrimp that was floured thickens up the sauce perfectly. I served it over angel hair pasta. Thank you for posting this great recipe."

The sauce was very flavourful and my kids ate it up and asked for seconds (ages 3 &amp; 18 months) I was hesitant to add the butter (too much fat) but I did it in the end and glad I did. I will make this again and think I might use it as my go-to recipe for company. Thanks for a wonderful, easy recipe."

I didn't bread shrimp b/c I forgot, so i added in a little corn starch at the end to thicken. Sauce was still runny, but if you like to sop it all up with bread it's perfect."

I used WAY more garlic than called for (we just love garlic around here) and I used fat-free half and half (thanks Linda) instead of cream. I stirred about a tablespoon of flour into the half and half and that was all I needed to thicken the sauce. The lemon seemed to disappear into the sauce, so I squeezed a bit more in at the end of cooking. I served this over whole grain linguine (which looked awful in the package, but came out okay). I took the leftovers to work for lunch. Very good recipe, DonnaT. Thank you."

Added just about 8-10 tiny cubes of mozzarella and about 2 tbs of crumbled Feta cheese just before serving. Substitutes were for on hand availability/savings. It was absolutely fantastic. I approximated all measures and adjusted for taste, I ended up adding more half and half to reduce the excessive lemon juice I had over squeezed from a half of lemon. I hope I can duplicate it next time, All four of us really enjoyed it and I will do this again soon. My compliments to the contributor of this recipe. I also made a bruscietta brushed with EVOO, using some of the pan fried shrimp, mozzarella, sliced baked/dried tomato slices, red peppers and garlic to go along with it."
