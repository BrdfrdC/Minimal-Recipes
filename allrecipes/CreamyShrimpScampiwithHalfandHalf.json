Others had commented on there not being enough sauce, so I increased the half-n-half to 2/3 cup, used some olive oil with the 2 tbsp. butter to sauté and increased the wine to a little over 1/4 cup. Increased the Parmesan also, a few red pepper flakes too. Turned out perfect! Served with freshly grated pepper. Thank you so much for such a versatile recipe!"

I use frozen jumbo shrimp, thawed, and add it to the butter, lemon, garlic, wine sauté, being careful not to overcook the already cooked shrimp. Then I add the 1/2 &amp; 1/2, cheese, and plenty of cracked black pepper and let it heat through. Husband loves this recipe. Thanks so much!"

I have to say that shrimp without garlic just is a letdown. I love garlic so I used a whole garlic and I marinated the shrimp in garlic powder as well. Added about a tablespoon of red pepper flakes as well as 2 tablespoons of paprika. I also used olive oil along with the butter and used my homemade blueberry wine because it was all I had on hand. This one is my new go to. Thanks for the great recipe."
