Only substitution was half &amp; half for a creamier texture and I diced my potatoes so no need to blend any. I also cook it on the stove one day, and heat in my crockpot for serving the next. To me, this is more of a chowder than soup. Comfort food at it's best!"

"reviewBody": "This soup was okay, but didn't turn out at all like I expected! From the reviews and description I was expecting something creamier (don't know why I was with the small amount of milk called for but that is my own fault) and cheesier. This soup was neither. When I tasted the soup after adding the cheese it seems like the cheese was added as an afterthought, not a main flavor. If I have the time I MAY (and that's a big may) try this again. For a creamier soup maybe I'll use whole milk for all the liquid (I only had skim on hand) and use more chicken flavoring and omit the cheese entirely, making it more of a creamy vegetable soup. If I do that I think I'll replace some of the potatoes with a turnip to add some more flavor. The idea was good, but I personally think this recipe needs some work."

"reviewBody": "Very good. Used 5 cups chicken stock, I don't use bullion cubes...Cooked on high for 4 hours then crockpot turned automatically to warm :) I used an immersion blender on the entire contents of slow cooker before adding the milk &amp; cheese (3 cups of grated cheese please), this made a nice silky textured soup. I then added diced, cooked red potatoes w/skin on (about 5 small). It was only 20 min extra work to cut &amp; boil them. I added 3 chopped green onions after adding the red potato and bacon. Oh, and it definitely needs more bacon!! I used 10 pieces. The next day for leftovers, I had to add a couple tablespoons chicken stock to each serving to thin it out. Probably not the most heart-healthy recipe but I will definitely make again-my way. Serve with a green salad to feel less guilty ;)"

This made it really thick so I stirred in more milk (about a cup) and let it sit a while cooling from the crock pot. I also added extra sharp cheddar, green onions, and bacon to the top at the end. It was great! I only give it 4 stars because my husband said it was a little bland. Maybe some other spicce (besides salt) could improve it more."

I would not do this recipe on high( hello glue). This recipe screams skip the bacon add a butcher smoked ham hock. Took me 20 minutes before I went to work and ten minutes to finish(less with a smoked ham hock). Variation substute a leek for the onion. Other halve thought the same thing. I also cut all the quantites by 1/4 to get the serving size done to 4. Will absolutly do again"

"reviewBody": "I took this recipe and made it a little healthier/lighter. Just by looking at the recipe before I made it, four cups liquid would not be enough for five pounds of potatoes. I used organic red potatoes and instead of chicken soup base and plain water, I used organic chicken broth (about six cups). I didn't need the flour (I've had some experiance cooking potato soup--flour is not really needed as the potato starch thickens the soup well enough) so I cut back on the butter just a bit and sauteed the onion, carrots, celery and a mess of minced fresh garlic all together before adding it to the crockpot with the potatoes and broth. I did add a few more spices (dried chives, onion powder, garlic powder, Beau Monde seasoning). After the potatoes had cooked in the crockpot, I mushed them with my potato masher only slightly for a chunkier soup, then added the milk (I used fat free evaporated milk for a creamier texture--I didn't need the full cup). When this was all said and done, this is a fair soup that was bendable to make my own and worked well to stretch what I had for a cheap lunch this week. I think this would be a good soup to substitute in cauliflower for low-carbers, too."

"reviewBody": "Nice concept, but rather bland. I would up the seasonings and be sure to add Garlic and more red pepper. A whole jalapeno would also be nice. (Dont cut it up, just pierce down the legnth 4 or 5 times and put in the pot whole so you can fish out later). I also wish the instrucitons had said to add the milk at the end, because mine curdled and look AWFUL. I dont htink my family would have eaten it, except I managed to salvage it by pureeing half and adding some instant potato flakes to tighten the whole thing up a bunch. Even before my salvage steps, it had a grainy consistency and wasnt particularly creamy feeling on the tongue. Over all disappointing. I'll try snother recipe next time."

There wasn't a lot of flavor, besides the potatoes and carrots. My husband thought there should have been some ham in this. Or at least more bacon. At the end I added some garlic and herb seasoning and that improved the flavor. I'm giving it 4 stars because overall it is a good recipe that I would make again."

"reviewBody": "You can play around with this recipe a lot. Firstly, I didn't measure the liquid. If I felt it was getting too thick, I just added more. Didn't use water or base; only chicken broth and fat free half and half. Hubby smoked a pork tenderloin, so I added that in lieu of the bacon. Sprinkled in more seasonings (garlic and onion powders, dry mustard and dried parsley) and used three leftover baked potatoes from Sunday dinner. I ran the potatoes thru the food processor before I began so I didn't need to puree. Lastly, I felt this needed more cheese than stated. In addition to the horseradish cheddar I used, I also threw in some parm. Didn't feel the need to use my slow cooker for this; worked well on top of the stove. This was a great place to start Kathy; just made it my own. Thanks so much as this turned out absolutely delicious!"

Instead of taking some out and blending it and then adding back in, I just put my hand mixer in the pot and blended until I got it the way I wanted it. I added minced fresh garlic and instead of 2 TBS chicken soup base, I just used a can of chicken broth because that's what I had on hand. I will definitely make this one again, but I also might try some of the other recipes for this sort of soup. Thanks!"
