I think the cream sauce could benefit from some additional spices, like pepper, red pepper flakes, and more garlic. But overall it was very tasty and an easy dish to clean out the fridge and freezer with. I found myself not measuring the salmon and veggies because a little extra can't hurt, right?"

I did not add the cheese, but the recipe called for adding cheese at the end anyways. I tasted the sauce and found that other reviewers had gotten it right. There was something missing. I tried upping garlic, which I used fresh. I tried adding Italian seasoning, some rosemary, even cayenne to give it that oomph it was missing. I did add salt to up flavor and some pepper. Even with the addition of salmon into the sauce, there was still something missing (no, not the cheese!). One reviewer equated this recipe as turning out like a tuna casserole. I concur...it was very thick and seemed too heavy for a pasta \"sauce\"....it was edible but not worth the trouble of repeating....."

For milk I use soy milk, at first it was bit sweet but ad little bit salt and spices to adjust the taste and it turn out delicious. \nOver all I love this recipe, so going to save and use is in the future. 5 star! \nTips: Taste much better once it's cool down."

It was pretty good, but it didn't knock my socks off. I would rate it somewhere between 3-4 stars. Instead of onion, garlic powder, and canned mushrooms, I used shallots, minced garlic, and fresh mushrooms ... those changes should have been an improvement, but I still thought it needed some tweaking. For one thing, the sauce seemed too cheesy (rather than creamy), so if I make it again I might cut back on the cheese. Good concept, though!"

Added a dash of white wine and used tortiglioni because I did not have penne. It won thumbs up from the family! Will make it again!"

I added white wine, to deglaze the pan a bit, then the milk, however I added half FF milk, and heavy cream. I grated the cheese right into the pan, and made sure it was well salted. The Salmon was added last after the pasta was added to the pan and mixed in, making sure not to fall apart."

Over time I have adapted it to suit my tastes...I always use fresh ingredients when I cook and substitute fresh onion, garlic, and mushrooms. I have found that sautéed vegetables make an excellent addition to this recipe. Tonight I used carrots, kale, red bell pepper, and mushrooms sautéed with olive oil then added when it asks to add the mushrooms. I also found out recently I can't tolerate gluten, and used brown rice pasta and gluten free baking flour as substitutions and it turned out awesome!"

Instead of garlic powder I crushed 2 cloves of garlic; instead of measuring the exact amount of milk, I just slowly added it to the onions and butter, and then a bit more when I added in the cheese. Instead of Romano cheese I used mozzarella (delicious). Instead of peas and mushrooms, I used broccoli (our family wanted to use broccoli instead). And I added lots of fresh ground pepper as I was cooking the sauce.\nThis meal was delicious and had great flavour! I highly recommend it."

I didn't follow the recipe exactly- I used rotinipasta, which is what I had on hand, substituted spinach for mushrooms, and added about a tablespoon of lemon juice to thin out the sauce at the end. I would skip the onions and peas the next time as I did not care for their texture, and I would recommend using lemon juice if your sauce becomes too thick- I think it complemented the dish quite nicely."

I made the sauce with less butter and added 1 cup of fat free half &amp; half and used 1 cup of skim milk. I also used a mixture of parmesan, romano and asiago cheese and that added alot of flavor. I added corn and doubled the amount of mushrooms (because I love 'em). The biggest difference was that I used mushroom-stuffed ravioli instead of penne pasta, and I think that added alot of flavor to the dish. Not the best thing I have ever made, but it was pretty darn good. The smoked salmon added a nice smokey taste that I wasn't expecting."
