"reviewBody": "I enjoyed this recipe. I prepared exactly as directed and wished it had a bit more flavor, but overall it was a nice, comforting dish. Next time, I would add more cheese and maybe a little red pepper flake for some heat. I needed to add quite a bit of salt to add flavor. Perhaps I will try the recommendation of cooking the grits in chicken stock next time to see if that adds more flavor."

"reviewBody": "Just tried it. If you're not a fan of goat cheese you'll need to omit it from the recipe as it will overpower everything else in the dish. I doubled the shrimp since 1/6 pound/person seemed a little light. Might go 2 1/2 pounds next time.\n\nWith the exception of the shrimp, the proportions of the ingredients where great. Nice consistency, good presentation and very filling. Ours was served with a side of chilled asparagus."
