Great for large gatherings, keeps better than French fries and other potatoes on a buffet and everyone loved it. Some preferred it to be spicier and grabbed my cajun seasoning to top it and others preferred sriracha. It's easy to \"top\" with bacon, extra cheese or chives and feeds a crowd. I'm asked for it at every gathering now! THnk you!"

I used what we had and eat instead of going out and buying ingredients that we might not use. picture us before baked will upload after vsked. I also did not mix the tots in the mixture I layered the tots on the bottom and then put the mixture on top then layered tots on the mixture agsin. I did brush the 1/2 butter on the tots and sprinkled parmensan cheese. once cooked I layered shredded cheese on top to melt."

I was surprised that there was no actual meat in the recipe so I boiled 2 large chicken breasts and shredded them up to add with the tots. I also sauteed the onion and added cayenne instead of paprika since my husband likes things spicy. He loves it, and the spice is not too bad for me (I'm a wimp). I topped it off with more grated cheese that hubby brought home, threw it under the broiler, and huzzah! Totally making this again. It's really good, I like it with a bit of ketchup, and I would probably add some bacon and call it a breakfast casserole :)"

You can cut the amount of softened butter to the potato mixture in half but putting all the melted butter into the corn flakes is important, they crisp up so good !! I made all of the potatoes but there is a ton so I filled up the baking dish and freezer saved the rest of the potato mixture for a later time. The recipe as written does make a ton. Make this and you will have a great side dish, I made them with grilled soy sauce turkey tenderloin on the grill and veggies. You will love this recipe."

I left out the butter and corn flakes and added the cheese 20 mins before the hour was up and cooked uncovered.. Everyone loved it. Thanks 4 this great recipe. Its a keeper. Jan"

I did add some diced ham to mine, used reduced fat cream of chicken, light sour cream and I left the corn flake topping off, we aren't fans of crumb toppings on potato dishes most of the time. I also reduced the butter down to 2 tablespoons total... the three of us alone could eat that whole dish in one sitting so I just couldn't justify using the full amount. It still tasted good with less butter and it wasn't greasy either. I wasn't sure about using cream of chicken vs cream of mushroom soup but it turned out very good &amp; id make it this way again if we were out of cream of mushroom soup and were craving some tater tot casserole."

"reviewBody": "This is a wonderful dish! Here are a few tips to save a lot of calories and not alter the flavor: 1.) Don't use any butter. It's just not necessary. I do spray a little PAM over the corn flakes so they brown. 2.) Don't bother with the parmesan. This dish has plenty of flavor without it. 3.) Add uncooked diced chicken breast. It cooks perfectly in the time called for in the recipe and makes this side dish into a main dish! Some similar recipes call for breakfast sausage or ground meat and I was afraid that would change up the dish too much so I experimented with chicken and you hardly know it's there! I cook a lot and this is one of my all time favorites."

"reviewBody": "Good recipe. I skipped the butter (it doesn't need all that extra fat). I didn't have any sour cream unfortunately although I know that would have been awesome. I used bread crumbs instead of corn flakes because I just like bread crumbs better and I reserved some of the cheese for the top. I also used cream of celery soup instead of chicken because that's what I had. I was also lazy and used onion powder instead of real onion only because I was making this for myself only. I still used one can of soup and enough tater tots for me only. Makes it a little more creamy. If I were making this recipe for 8 I'd probably use 2 or 3 cans of soup. I can see it being a little dry. Just a tip, microwave your tater tots for a few minutes to thaw them before putting them in the oven. It helps lower the cooking time. I also found I could cook this at 375 instead of 350 without a problem (at least in my oven)."

We only make it once in a while (it's ok to have junk food occasionally)."
