Can you believe my family &amp; I had never even tried a white-chicken-chili?? (LOL yes, apprehensive, late arrivals.) I made a triple batch the 1st time on stovetop &amp; used 1 lb. dry beans, to feed my family of 5. This time, made it in crockpot with 3 cans beans, and a small fraction of the black pepper. (Hubby tried to get me to double my triple batch lol, but crockpot was filled it to the brim). I always read reviews &amp; take heed to repeated ones. I add cream &amp; sour cream at the end, and if it's too soupy before doing that, I mix 2-4 TB of cornstarch with water or some of the soup or even the cream, then mix it in. EVERY drop of leftovers, even a few days out, gets eaten. THANK YOU for sharing!!"

I didn't add sour cream or cream, but did use 32 oz swanson chkn stock, 2 cans of great northern beans and 1 can of cannellini beans. Thickened with 2 Tbsp flour/butter paste/ roux and added chicken at the end for only about 5 minutes since it was small. Used a lg serving spoon of whipped cream cheese at the end for creaminess. We really liked it, but also didn't use the green chillies, black pepper or cayenne, instead used white pepper, onion powder, goya adobo, celery salt, Italian seasoning, oregano, and a little TJ's mushroom powder. I also added 1 lg chopped carrot. So basically it's a totally different recipe, but again this recipe was a good starting point."

For example, I only use 2 cup of chicken broth made with Better Than Bouillion, 1/2 an onion, extra garlic and 1 can of green chiles. I never add the cumin (we don't care for it). I also increase the whipping cream to 3/4 cup and only use a dollop of sour cream. A roasted Anaheim pepper goes great in this as well."

It was ok, but I probably won't make it again."

The additional chicken and corn made it nice and hearty. Once I turned the heat off, I added the whipping cream and sour cream marking sure it sat for 5-10 minutes so the flavours absorbed nicely.

The only reason for having leftovers in my household is because it was just my wife and I eating but otherwise I just can't imagine having any left over when served to a larger family. Absolutely an outstanding tasting chili. Follow the directions and you'll think so too."

I certainly don’t mind but if you’re looking for something the consistency of normal chili, this is not the recipe. Instead of heavy cream, I used oat creamer and only used 3/4 of the sour cream to try and cut back on the dairy. It was still great. If anything, I think I will add another can of beans next time and maybe try chicken thighs!"

It’s also on the spicy side - which I personally love, but may not be for everyone. I made it “as-is” and I’m basing my review on such. It was better after adding the roux and thickening it up. I do believe that 1/2 ground chicken would help with this dish."
