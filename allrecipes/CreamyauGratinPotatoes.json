Then I added salt, pepper, 1 cup of cheddar and 1 cup of Swiss cheese. I layered the thinly-sliced potatoes in a buttered casserole and poured the sauce on top. I used a fork to lift the top potatoes so that the sauce covered all layers. Then I topped it with more grated cheddar. I baked it with the casserole lid on for the first 50 minutes and then removed the lid and baked it for another 20 minutes. Absolutely delicious!"

I sliced and boiled/cooked my potatoes 1st. Minced my onions instead of slicing them, used less onions. Wanted to make sure it was not too much.. Followed the other parts of recipe as stated. Placed in oven at 400 for 40-45 min to allow onion and cheese to do its thing. Came out great. Will make again for sure."

"reviewBody": "This dish turned out exactly the way I was hoping for. I read several Au Gratin recipes and chose this one for its simplicity. I used Russet potatoes and changed the 2 cups of milk to 1/2 &amp; 1/2 milk plus 1/4 cup whole milk. I changed the flour to 1/3 level cup. I wanted to be sure there was plenty of Bechamel to make the potatoes extra creamy. I buttered the baking dish and put 1/2 cup Bechamel on the bottom of the pan. Then I put in a layer of 1/8\" sliced potatoes, a layer of onions thinly sliced and roughly chopped onions and 1/4 cup shredded Mexican blend cheese (that's all I had on hand). Start each layer with Bechamel. I made 3 layers all together and topped it all with the remaining Bechamel and 1/2 cup cheese. Bake at 400 on middle rack for 30 minutes then turn it around so it will cook evenly, and cook for another 30 minutes, remove the foil, and bake another 20 minutes. It was divine!"

They give the perfect flavor but blend into the potato texture so you don't even realize they're there (good if you have picky kids). Also, definitely recommend cooking uncovered for the last 30 mins to brown the top nicely. I cooked mine at 425¬∞ for 1.5 hours but i also used a deeper dish and had 4 or 5 layers (onions sprinkled between each layer)."

Since I had 7 people, I just kept slicing potatoes on my mandoline until I had enough for 3 layers. Minced onion super fine and spread over first 2 layers. I doubled sauce recipe and used a combo of whole milk and cream as well as a combo of Swiss and Cheddar. Also, I baked it the night before and just warmed up in over for about 20 minutes to get top nice and brown and bubbly. Excellent potato dish, but it won't help you lose any weight! :-)"

My upgrades: caramelized the onions... added chopped cooked bacon... seasoned potatoes with salt, garlic granules, black pepper... last 20 mins uncovered and topped with a breadcrumb, garlic, and parmesan mixture... finished baking until topping was browned... turned out delish! P.S. \"sliced thin\" means thin... based on any au gratin I've ever had, I would never go thicker than 1/8 of an inch! If you don't have a fancy gadget, the best option outside of using a nice sharp knife is the \"slicing\" side of a cheese grater... works great! For a richer roux, I slightly brown it before adding liquid!"

"reviewBody": "I liked this basic recipe. Some comments that it was flavorless depends on your tastes IMO. So, I added a dusting of garlic powder, onion powder, Hungarian paprika, and a small amount of chili powder to the potatoes before adding the sauce. Sprinkling this preparation on each level of the build. Then, after cooking let it rest overnight before reheating and serving the next day. My one critic of this recipe is the covering of the potatoes does not allow browning, even in a 400 degree oven for 1.5 hours. So when I reheated, I left the foil off. Absolutely creamy and delicious."

After reading comments I did something I usually don't do and made changes to the original recipe on my 1st try. Sorry! I know I don't like it when others rate a recipe based on a bunch of changes but it was a good base! I used sharp cheddar (reserving some to add on top at end of cooking), added 1/2 tsp of ground dry mustard, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and pepper to taste to the salt that was whisked into the flour/butter mixture. Used heavy cream instead of milk (bc I needed to use it up). I used my food processor to slice the potatoes thin and fast! Chopped the onions and caramelized. Chopped bacon and cooked it and sprinkled it on top at end for garnish with dried chives. Removed from oven at 1 hr and 15 min. Added reserved cheese and broiled a tad. The edges browned quite a bit. Maybe bc of the cream but it was a good cheesy browned. Will make like this again but use milk."

I used a combination of Jarlsberg and some local ‚ÄúAsiago‚Äù (which is nothing like actual Asiago, but still a nice cheese). I sliced the potatoes and shallot pretty thin with a mandoline. After an hour at 400 the potatoes were done, and I cooked it another 10 minutes with the lid off. I probably shouldn‚Äôt have, it did come out a little bit dry. But still rich and cheesy. I‚Äôd thought about adding some nutmeg or mustard, but I‚Äôm actually glad I didn‚Äôt. Though it‚Äôs kind of simple, the flavors of the potatoes, cheese and milk is really good. I think I‚Äôll cook it at 350-375 next time, it got kind of crusty on the bottom and sides."

This turned out technically correct, but was a big disappointment. Look for a receipe that doesn't need to base it on a rue and that is more rich in butter, cream, and a better cheese. 25 years of culinary experience, and I'm really disappointed in myself foe trying this receipe."

I also sprinkled Lawry's total seasoning and crushed pepper on both layers of potatoes. In my dad's words it was \"really scrumptious\". I also used half'n'half instead of the milk. This is my current favorite side dish."

"reviewBody": "Pretty good overall, but if I make it again I‚Äôll definitely make some changes. It‚Äôs lacking flavor in my opinion, and I think the onion would be much better if it were diced. I didn‚Äôt like the large pieces of onion at all. I also think it needs garlic, maybe minced in between the potato slices or added to the sauce. The sauce was okay, but it needs way more butter in my opinion. I sliced the potatoes as thin as I could (maybe 1/8 in.) and they turned out perfectly cooked. Overall I did like them, but I think they could be better. I definitely want to try these again!"

For our family, the changes made all the difference. But you will love the recipe 'as is'"

No alterations to recipe, and baked as instructed. However, refrigerated it when cooled and did not serve it til a day later, when I reheated it for close to an hour (covered with foil) but at 350¬∞ since it was already baked. Potatoes cooked perfectly, sauce creamy and cheesy, mild flavor but great with Easter ham. Will make it again, perhaps w/ added bacon if it‚Äôs served with beef."

I cut it that thing because I wanted to try it the way the recipe said but in tasting it they just seem to be a little thick for what I expect an au gratin potato to be. However the flavor is very good. The recipe is easy to follow and that's great for any kind of a recipe. I think that in the future I would slice the potatoes thinner. It's definitely a good one to customize. I added in some powdered mustard and a little bit of fresh ground nutmeg just because I like those flavors in cheese"

I don't use as many onions as the recipe calls for. Also slice the onions very thin. They'll melt into the sauce and potatoes. One more thing, if your review states the recipe is bland it's the cheese you're using. Try sharp or extra sharp cheddar. If you use a mild cheese, your dish will be bland. This recipe is a keeper."

I used 1 C milk and 1/3 C chicken broth; total 1 1/3C. I, also, lightly topped the casserole with a mixture of bread crumbs, panko, and grated cheese. You could use any one of these ingredients or all three! I found a 350¬∞ oven was perfect and baked it for 50 minutes with foil and 10 minutes with no foil to form a crust ontop. Do check your potatoes for doneness with a knife; you may need to leave it in a little longer depending on your oven. Let it sit a while before you dive in because it is piping hot and so delicious you don't want to burn your mouth like I did the first time! Winner winner! Really good!!"

I was overwhelmed by the rich thick creamy sauce. I will lighten it up if I make it again. I would use a sharper cheese but less of it since it will have more flavor.

Done when tender.\n\n200 grams of gouda make the best you've ever had, 300 grams is even better.\n\nI've also made it with Monterrey Jack, yellow cheddar, and white cheddar. Pick your cheese.
