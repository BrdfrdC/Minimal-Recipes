I followed the recipe to a T, except for the ramekins as I did not have any on hand and placed the whole thing in a small baking dish instead. Total cooking time for me was 1 hr until I was satisfied with how it 'set', let it cool, and refrigerated overnight. (The 4-6 hour mark didn't quite set it completely for my liking). I'm glad it did set properly eventually and has a very nice creamy texture to it."

I made it last night and let it chill over night. The custard is nice and stiff, but still perfectly creamy. I baked mine at 300 degrees for 35 minutes. The tops stayed uncracked and the taste and texture are spot on. (Unlike the pumpkin which took longer to cook and was still a little loose) I also like that you don't need a ton of egg yolks to get that texture. 3 works just fine and you don't get that \"eggy\" taste you do with some other bain marie custards that call for more yolks. (I try to tell my self this makes this recipe a little \"light\" LOL!)\nI did heat my cream with a vanilla bean thrown in, just because I love vanilla. I didn't scrape the seeds, but did also add the extract. I don't know if this made it more vanilla-y, but I'd like to think it did.\nThis recipe is definitely a keeper! Thanks for posting it!"

I used the larger shallow ramekins so i was surprised at how long it took.\n\nAlso, invest in a torch. The broiler can take too long and wind up leaving the custard a little soupy and warm. Better to just \"candy\" the top and have the custard itself still be cold from the fridge.\n\nGreat recipe!!"

"reviewBody": "Recipe needs a few adjustments. I agree with the folks who say add one more egg yolk. Also, the cooking time is WAY off. I'd say I ended up leaving them for about 50 minutes before they were set. All in all, though, it was delicious. UPDATE: I’ve made this recipe roughly a dozen times with very good results, though I stand by it needing a longer cooking time. I recently made it with the quantities verbatim, for my husband’s colleagues. It was so good, one man ate FOUR servings. I think all the hubbub about egg yolks is due to large eggs vs. not-large eggs. Probably 9 times it turned out fine with three yolks. After switching to organic eggs, though, I found out they are not consistently sized the way other eggs are. It would be nice to come up with a weight for the yolks to take away the guesswork, but I’ll probably go with 4-5 yolks in the future. Just one more update: I've now made this at least 20-30 times and, tail between my legs, I now say that the quantities, cooking time, and technique are PERFECT AS IS. One thing I've noted over time is that you have to let the cream get hot enough - just as the recipe states, let it heat up until small bubbles begin to form. When you stir it, a generous amount of steam should rise up. The one and only OPTIONAL modification I make is to use a 4-inch segment of vanilla bean, adding the scraped insides to the yolks and letting the husk steep with the cream. I still add a dash of vanilla from a bottle. Kudos to whomever originated this"

It did eventually set and was tasty, but getting it there required removing the foil (using it is pointless) and an additional 45 mins in the oven. Creme brulee can almost always be saved, but save yourself the aggravation and choose a different recipe."

I also added fresh raspberries from our garden into the liquid just before pouring into ramekins. They seemed set when I took them out of the oven, but weren't set when I went to eat one with my hubby for dessert. I don't know if the raspberries extra water content did that, but if I could do it over I would serve the fruit on top instead. My husband and I love creme brulee and have eaten it many times at nice restaurants around Portland...the flavor seemed a little off for us."

I did notice that the mixture was really foamy when I poured them into my ramekins and that overall it was really pale yellow. However, IMO this creme brulee is just right! Not overly sweet, and light &amp; creamy. I didn't have any problems with it setting; it's definitely not thick like pudding but it's not watery either. I waited until they cooled to about room temperature, covered with foil and placed in the fridge. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!"

Oh and be sure to put a thin layer of sugar on top (I didn't use a full tbsp) because if it's too thick of a layer of sugar, it's a little harder to torch without it burning by the time it's all caramelized."

I was attracted to this creme brule version because it uses few eggs / serving that others I have tried, but I had the same problems that many others had unless I increased the # of eggs and cooking time. What good is a recipe as simple as this one that isn't bulletproof? Creme brule isn't complicated to make, and this low egg / short cooking time version has frustrated countless reviewers ... if you like creme brule, fine. But don't rate this recipe highly if it is unreliable!"

Then, let it cool to room temperature before cooling. You can put it into the freezer for 45 mins to speed up the process or do the 4-6 hours in the fridge. After I made these adjustments, I have to say that it did turn out perfect and delicious. Hope this helps save someone else a headache!"

The second time I put the pan with the wet towel in the oven while it preheated. This heats up the wet towel so when you put in the ramekins and add the boiling water it starts cooking immediately. It then will only take the 25 to 30 minutes instead of 1 to 1/2 hours. Huge difference! Oh, and you do need to add the extra egg! It's incredibly delicious!"

I also used 4 egg yolks in this recipe and it turned out just great. I used 1/2 of a vanilla bean and just a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract. The only problem I had was that the it took alot more time to bake than 25 to 30 minutes, but that was no big deal especially after tasting it. I mixed together 4 teaspoons of white sugar and 4 teaspoons of brown sugar for the brulee sugar and topped each one with 2 teaspoons of the sugar combo then broiled them. My parents 19th aniversery is tomorrow so I was planning on serving them this, but I made the creme brulee today since I have school tomorrow and it looked so good and nobody could wait so we ate them today!"
