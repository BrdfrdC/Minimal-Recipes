I quadrupled the recipe off the hop and glad I did as I'll use a lot of this."

One suggestion, once everything is mixed whirl it in a coffee grinder or food processor to evenly blend it together. Another idea, when using this, season in layers, a little when you sweat the vegetables, a little more when adding other ingedients, a little more when adding liquids, and so on."

"reviewBody": "I seasoned halibut steak with this blend and it turned out tasty. I made 1/3 of the recipe (tsp instead of tbsp) to start just to make sure I really like it to make a large batch. Cooking for 2 people, I only used very little to season the fish. There is still quite a bit left and I kept it in a jar. I used 2 tsp salt instead of 3. I think oregano was a little too overpowering. And we love spicy food. So next time I'll used 1.5 tsp oregano, 1.5 tsp cayenne, and no salt. It should be good for different meat in many recipes including soups and stocks. Thanks for the recipe! It saved me money attempting to buy Emeryl's seasoning."

It’s the base seasoning for just about everything now. Guests have loved the flavor. A pinch of sugar when cooking adds a little something too. I make my base with half the white pepper because it was too spicy for some. Then I just sprinkle some white pepper if making something for adults who like spicy.

Used: 4-tbsp Garlic Powder, 1.5-tbsp Oregano, 1.5-tbsp Basil, 3/4-tsp Black Pepper, 1-tsp Cayenne, 4-tbsp Paprika, 2-tbsp Salt. Great seasoning. Used over my tilapia for my Garlic Alfredo Tilapia tonight - yum!"

I waited until I had it all at a full boil before adding the rice (2c) brought that down to a low simmer, covered and let cook 20 minutes. I didn't have cayenne pepper or white pepper so I kept the full amount of black pepper. I added some sliced precooked sausages. My son says it's the best Jambalaya I ve ever made."

The opportunities are endless from veggies, fish, potatoes, smoke rub and so much more. I made"

I have a 9, 10, and 12 year old--two of which added more of Tony's Cajun seasoning to spice it up. I will add more cayenne next time I mix it up. And I will be using it again. Just know that you will have to play with the peppers to find the amount of heat that your family prefers."

I would recommend adding additional amounts of this seasoning blend as needed, per your taste. Start with the amount called for in a recipe and add more as needed. Also, I'll probably leave out the salt next time. It wasn't too salty at all for us, but I find it easier to add salt as needed in the cooking process. Will be making a larger batch to readily keep on hand! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"

This Creole seasoning blend is absolutely perfect! You don't need more than a very light coating; just a few pinches on each side for a very light dusting on the two chicken breasts I made! Scrumptious flavor and I am thinking it would also be awesome on BBQ'd back ribs! This is a keeper for sure and it keeps in an air tight container too! I will use it again soon!"

I left the salt out because I was brining the turkey and it would have been too salty with extra salt. The paprika I did 5:1. I wanted the flavor to be able to permiate deep into the meat so, I put all of the ingredients into my blendtec blender and turned it into a fine powder. The turkey turned out perfect and all of my co-workers raved about it. There was nothing left of the turkey! Because it's now a powder I may need to add some to keep it from clumping."
