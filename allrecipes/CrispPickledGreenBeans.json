"reviewBody": "I‚Äôm no math whiz and measurements give me the creeps, but after having just pickled a bunch of cucumbers I knew at first glance these measurements are off and wouldn‚Äôt fill 6+ pint jars. That being said, I tweaked and personalized accordingly, and holy crud these are absolutely delicious. Here are the measurements I used to fill exactly 6 pint jars (with about 1/4 cup leftover). For the brine I used 5 cups white vinegar, 4 cups cold water, 4.5 Tbsp pickling salt, 2.5 Tbsp mustard seed, 3.5 Tbsp peppercorns, and 2.5 Tbsp pickling spice. I‚Äôm Italian and can‚Äôt make anything with ‚Äò1‚Äô garlic clove lol, so I added 3-4 crushed cloves to every jar and a few slices of shallot, along with the dill. I also used closer to 1 tsp of red pepper flakes in each jar. Be sure you use a spoon or other device to push everything down and remove any air bubbles before putting lid on. One jar didn‚Äôt seal so I cheated and tasted this morning, and the flavor is flippin delicious and will only get better as it marinates. If I liked Bloody Mary‚Äôs these would be perfect in one. Or on a salad. Or a charcuterie tray. Or anywhere else that doesn‚Äôt hate fun. ‚úåüèºü§§"

From the pictures others seem not wrinkled? Any idea why?\nI did try cucumbers, zucchini, and snap peas as well. We will see if they taste good....

I didn't weigh my green beans - just used what I had harvested. I definitely didn't have over 2-2.5 pounds though and they filled 5 pint jars. Since the amount I filled was nearly twice the listed jars I doubled the brine. Sadly, I needed only half of the brine and wasted the rest. Someone needs to update this recipe."

I just rinse them, add water, boil, discard the water and repeat several times depending on how salty they might be. Usually 2-3 times, and serve. They are delicious!! \nThe only change that I have ever made to the recipe is to add a clove or 2 of Garlic to each bottle. They are awesome as a Pickle but, you really should try them this way at least once!"

I had a few straggling carrots in the garden that I peeled and cut into green bean sized sticks and through a few in each jar, yum! I like the bite of pepper, but not the burn, so I added a scant 1/8 tsp of red pepper flakes (an out a 1/16 tsp I suppose) and then a 1/8 tsp of green and pink pepper corns to each jar. They turned out lovely and I'm beaming with pride. Chrisp, Dilly &amp; Delish. :)"

"reviewBody": "For people who thought these were too salty, maybe you are not using kosher salt. 1/4 cup of kosher salt weighs 60 grams, and 1/4 cup of table salt weights 75 grams. That is significantly more. The recipe should have specified the type of salt for those who do not know you should not use iodized table salt in canning recipes. Anyway, I made these because my family and I LOVE pickles, and it's fun to pickle different vegetables. I used this recipe to pickle green beans, kirby cucumbers, cauliflower and even some broccoli stems. (Most people throw those away, but they make delicious crunchy pickles.)In fairness I did not have quiet enough white vinegar so I had to substitute some apple cider vinegar...actually almost half. Still so delicious, crisp and craveable. They did not last long in our house! I will make definitely make these again and again!"

I save the brine and pickle store bought fresh green beans in the fridge. I actually prefer these after about a week of sitting post canning. The green beans are crisp and definite flavor. I'm a tee-totaller, but I can imagine these would make an excellent martini addition. We prefer to eat ours plain with Cabot White Sharp Cheddar or on sandwiches. EXCELLENT RECIPE."

You have to cook what's in the jars to make it safe, even if it is pickled. \n\nThat said, the recipie itself is very good and even with the extra cooking, mine turn out crisp and delicious. I like them better with a small garlic clove added to each jar rather than just cooked in the brine. I also like to add about 1/2 tsp granulated sugar to each jar, it mellows the flavor without making them sweet."

I got 5 heaping pints and had to make a bit more brine using, this using 2-1/2 lbs of green beans from our garden. Can't wait to try them!

I also ran out of brine, so had to make more during the process. The jars in the picture are pts not half pints. This is a great recipe.

They really are very crisp, as much as a fresh bean. I added carrots for color, and the carrots were very good, too. I'm going to make more next time.
