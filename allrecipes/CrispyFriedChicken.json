There are about 25 more chickens in the freezer that I just harvested and now they’re all waiting to plop in the pan."

I cooked between a temp of 350 to 375 to start and then turned heat to low for the 30 minute cook. Then back up to finish the cooking like it says in the instructions. It was crispy! But tasted like nothing, as I’m sure the crust being overcooked just obliterated all the spices I put in the flour. The meat was SO tough and overcooked! This was bad! And a waste of time/oil... Fried chicken is definitely an art. You either have it or you don’t I guess."

I like my chicken crispy and this was crispy. The most tender fried chicken I’ve ever had. The only things I did different were to add some old bay seasoning and some garlic salt. I used an electric skillet and browned the chicken on high then reduced heat to 300 and fried for 24 minutes covered, turning the chicken half way through. Then I cranked it back on high to make crispy. I also placed on a cooling rack when done versus laying in paper towels. Awesome method for fabulous fried chicken!"

Pretty good chicken for my first time!"

We fried them for 5 minutes and flipped them once. We started to check each drum stick at 2 minutes with a meat thermometer. Depending on the size of the drum stick it would take up to 5 minutes to reach 165 degrees all the way through. The chicken was tender and delicious."

This recipe is easy, has an awesome foundation that will give great results every time, but it also leaves room for experimentation which I love. I added 1 tsp. Onion powder, 1 tsp. Garlic powder and 1 tsp. Chili powder to the flour mixture and my family really enjoyed it. It was crispy but also very juicy. I served this Fried Chicken with Red Beans and Rice and Corn on the Cobb. But any side would work with this dish. Thank you for submitting this recipe it’s going in my cookbook for sure! :) \n\nP.S. Chefs be sure to watch your chicken carefully as it fries so not to burn it."

I sliced the turkey breasts into nuggets and marinated them in seasoned buttermilk for a couple of hours and then tossed the nuggets in my seasoned flour in a ziplock bag. Followed instructions until I achieved the paste consistency and then fried them up in a cast iron pot. Since they were smaller nuggets, total cook time was less than 5 minutes. Will definitely be making these nuggets again. So good!!!"

Electric: Started at 375 until a bead of water danced. Turn, Turn after a light brown, I watched at this point! Then I changed dial to 300* &amp; put lid on for 10 min/flipped-reset timer/flipped to = 30 min. Cranked to 375 &amp; quickly flipped. Than tree in last two drumsticks on 350* &amp; watched"

"reviewBody": "The method seemed fine, and I put on my own spices into the flour mix to get the flavor that I wanted. My biggest problem with this recipe is that there's no specificity or even ballpark figures. She says that the oil needs to get hot, but how hot? Should be bubbling? Should it be smoking? And then when she says to put the chicken in the flour and then let it rest until the flower gets to a paste-like consistency, how long should that take? Approximately how long should that take? I know that it probably can change depending upon how much flour you put on it, if you double battered it, or other factors, but for someone who's trying this recipe for the very first time, are we talking about something that should take 5 minutes, or 2 hours? I have no idea, and I felt that the recipe was riddled with non specific things that assume you're already a fried chicken expert before you try this recipe."

"reviewBody": "Ok so this technique worked perfectly (with some changes mostly because I was using boneless skinless chicken breast). I had been using another recipe that was far more complicated (involving triple dipping) but the problem with it was that the coating, while delicious, wasn't sticking to the chicken! Kind of a problem. My chicken breast recipe calls for the chicken to be marinated overnight in the buttermilk, and spices, so this was PERFECT. I pulled it out of the bag that it was marinating in, dipped it in the flour/seasoning bag (I only seasoned a bit because there's quite a bit of seasoning in my marinade) and WAITED for the paste like consistency. It took about an hour and 25 minutes just fyi. We then cooked it at 350 (the whole time because it wasn't whole pieces) for about 6 to 7 minutes I want to say (until it was crispy and brown) and it was PERFECT. And the coating STUCK!!!! And it was easier. So thank you!!"

"reviewBody": "I have finally made a fried chicken that my husband would eat! I basically did everything described. I used smoked paprika and garlic pepper with he salt. I didn’t let the chicken sit long enough to get gooey. I will be sure I do that next time. I used the kernel of popcorn method to get my oil hot enough to brown the chicken. I then reduced the heat to medium low and covered my cast iron. I set a timer for 30 minutes and waited it kind of close. After 30 minutes, I removed the lid, increased the heat to just above medium (electric stove) and it took 10-15 minutes for the chicken to crisp. I turned halfway through the cooking time for browning and crisping. Our chicken looked like grandma’s fried chicken and had good flavor. We like plain spices, so I didn’t add hot pepper flakes or anything like that. I filled my cast iron skillet (with high sides) about 1/3 full. I hope my review is helpful to inexperienced cooks."

"reviewBody": "First time making fried chicken here.. roughly used Food Network's recipe, but followed this technique, since reviews said the recipe was bland. And i believe it, bc the recipe i used was a tad step up but i wasn't excited about the flavor, and it's a bit too salty. I had 5 chicken legs (not quite 2#) brined overnight, rinsed and let it drain and warm with ambient temperature. I substitute buttermilk, 1/8C almond milk to 3/8C to make 1/2C \"buttermilk\" substitute; for the mix i used: 1.5C flour, 1T salt (plan to cut to 2tsp next time!), 1T black pepper, 1/2T garlic, 1/4T onion, 1/2tsp paprika, 1/2tsp red(cayenne) pepper; I used my carbon steel wok and had it filled with just enough oil to submerge half the chicken. Fried the first side for 15min before flipping to other side for 10min to try to mitigate overfrying. I ended up overfrying and inside was maybe just a smidge undercooked? just nuked in microwave for 1min to be on safer side. I did not do the cook through with lid cover...so will do that next time (I was afraid of losing crispiness after already overfried the outside)! Still had at least half of the flour-mixture remain - so it's a good amount."

"reviewBody": "I'm rating 5 stars because I KNOW this is a great recipe. But it didn't turn out as good as I hoped (there was still none left, mind you). I'm going to do it again now that I know the following:\n\n1. After reading MANY reviews I finally found one reviewer (AFTER I cooked it) who revealed the flour can take 30 minutes to reach that \"pasty\" consistency, which is critical to this working. The recipe doesn't give you an idea how long it takes, so if you've never done it you really don't know how long you should expect it to take. That may explain people jumping the gun on this step (like I did).\n\n2. I think real Buttermilk (not a substitute like I used) is a critical component to getting that paste. I could be wrong here but I'll use the real stuff next time.\n\n3. Mine was a little bland, like many others. But I think that's because if you're someone who likes to taste a lot of seasoning it takes a lot more than the recipe calls for to cut through 2 cups of flour. I could taste it a little but I'll add quite a bit more next time.\n\n4. I used one of these counter-top electric fryer-type things, so I was able to dial in the temp to 375. But my chicken got more brown than I wanted it to, and it got there pretty quickly. Even without fully reaching the pasty phase though, I could tell the skin was definitely different.\n\nNext time I'll either cook it at a lower temp or omit the Paprika, since it's a browning agent.\n\nOther things were a little unclear because the instructions differe"

"reviewBody": "I made this yesterday and I couldn't agree more with the comments. This recipe works because of the technique**.\nThe choice of seasoning and quantities is up to you! But do make sure that after you dip (or marinate) in buttermilk you toss the chicken in a bag with the flour mixture (in batches) and let it sit**** for at least 30 minutes!!!. Also I did follow instructions and covered the chicken while it was sitting in the flour mixture, I think this helps keep the coating wet. I used my cold oven to house the cookie sheets with the covered chicken. 20 min after I started heating up the oil in a cast iron dutch oven and by the time 30-35min passed the oil was hot and ready. The chicken is going to have a sticky paste coating when ready. One more thing, make sure your oil is hot and stays hot. Between 350*F to 375*F. I made chicken wings and boneless strips so I didn't have to cover and let cook for 30 min. 10-12 min is all my chicken needed. I gave the recipe 4 stars because it's pretty vague so you need to have some cooking experience to get a successful batch but the technique is the key**"

"reviewBody": "This turned out great. Perfect crunch, but next time I'll add more salt to the flour mix. I used my cast iron skillet, a thermometer to monitor oil heat and checked the chicken temp, removing at 160 degrees. I had a small issue keeping the oil temp at 375, but once I got it to stay there, the chicken fried perfectly. I fried in batches and kept the other chicken warm in a 250 degree oven. New and experienced cooks can learn from the video. I don't fry foods too often, so it was a real help."
