For a quick dinner, slice lengthwise in thirds, wrap in paper towels, top with heavy pan or pot to press out liquid. Do this twice before frying in light olive oil and sprinkle with soy etc sauces -- some like a sprinkle of sesame oil, giner, etc. -- until golden brown. Enjoy with rice and veggies."
