I baked it about 30 min at 350 after pan frying on both sides cause my pieces were bigger. EXCELLENT! Super tender."

I was in a hurry and only seasoned the egg with Onion Powder, Garlic Powder and Seasoning Salt. It's a keeper for sure. Also, side note...these 3 seasonings are great alone on a saut√©ed chicken breast as well!"

"reviewBody": "Great meal! I took the advice of the other poster(s) and seasoned the chicken with the spices &amp; sprinkled with flour BEFORE dipping in egg and breading. I made twice the amount of spices as called for in recipe as I wanted to have a lot of spices for both sides. In hindsight, it ended up being a little too salty so next time I will cut the salt but still make double amount of other spices. It was very flavorful and every one of my family loved the dish, even my picky kids (which, literally, NEVER HAPPENS) I cooked on the skillet for a little longer as we liked the breading extra crispy. I paired this with the roasted potatoes &amp; Rosemary (also on this site) and steamed broccoli. A easy weekday meal that made every one happy :) I will be saving this recipe for future use"
