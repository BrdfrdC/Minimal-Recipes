The only change I made was use white onions in the gravy as I did not have any green and it was still great. I forgot the Worcestershire sauce but no matter. I boiled some baby potatoes and poured the sauce over that too. Added some steamed spinach on the side. I am so glad I made two so I can have one tomorrow as well. I'll be dreaming of that crispy cutlet tonight."

The other review that left out the jalapeños and pickles seems misguided, since otherwise your “gravy” is just milk.

My family says this goes in the rotation, and they kept talking about what else we’d use this gravy on. \n\nOnly changes: cooked the pork first, emptied the pan of fat, then proceeded with the gravy. No need to dirty another pan. And we left out the pickles. Sorry pickles. And didn’t have panko, so plain bread crumbs were used. \n\nI don’t know why or how but the pork got as crispy and gorgeous as anything I’ve ever pan fried. It was perfection."

Boy are we glad we tried this one! Everyone in our family loved it.... including our super picky 12-year-old. All three of our children already asked if we can add this one as a meal we cook regularly. The gravy tastes a little weird on its own, but when you put it on the pork cutlets (and mashed potatoes like we did) it transforms into something truly unique and delicious. Two thumbs way up!"

Along with the salt and pepper the pork was also seasoned with granulated onion, garlic and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Substituted Wickles pickles for the dill (it's what I had). This was being served with smashed red potatoes, so I quadrupled the gravy (along with the scallions and jalapeño). After tasting the gravy added a splash more of Worcestershire sauce to offset the pickles"

"reviewBody": "While I usually love Chef John..this recipe was lacking. So much that I've had this account somewhere in the area of early 2000s that I am leaving my first review. I felt the gravy for this had too much milk and thus made it bland. I added in some pickle juice, garlic, doubled the Worcestershire sauce and salt and it was better but nothing to write home about. The lack of seasoning on the actual pork chops themselves was sad so I added in garlic to the mix. My modifications (though small) improved the recipe but I hate following a recipe only to change it. If you do decide to make this...taste before things are done (within reason, don't go for raw pork now) and make it to your own liking. I felt overall it lacked seasoning."

Next time I will simplify the veg so I don't feel hot and bothered by the time I sit down!"

It was a little time intensive with all the breading and frying, but it was worth it! The only thing I changed was due to not having the ingredient. I used a half of a dehydrated habanaro pepper in the gravy, (then picked out the pieces after) and also a teaspoon of A1 Steak Sauce since I didn't have Worcestershire sauce. I really liked the \"zing\" of the sauce with the pickles in there and the spice. I'd make it again. My mouth is still tingling from the pepper, but at least it wasn't a boring dinner. Served with rice and broccali."

But this is my year, 2018, I'm tired of cooking boring foods for the past two years of marriage. (Who came up with this institution? But that's another discussion.) An entire bunch of green onions, he didn't have a clue to any of the ingredients and LOVED this gravy. He did ask what the green stuff was (lol, everything) and I mumbled nothingness, and I'm pretty sure I heard him say the word \"hide\" to which I said nothing. I love to laugh. Even if it's on the inside! Will be making this often, and yes, with chicken, etc, and I think it would be great with Cod. Thank you John! What a kick! In more ways than one! Delicious!"

Since I was cooking for tender tastebuds I substituted red bell pepper for the jalapeno, next time I make it I will do it with the extra spice. I highly recommend, watching the video, there are a few subtle things that have changed the way I handle the flour/egg/breading steps."

He almost didn't try the gravy because of the pickles, but he tried it on a little corner of the cutlet, then on most of the rest. Left a little corner for A1 because that's how he usually eats it. Thank you for a great recipe"

Example: Both boys had already had dinner Wednesday night. I made this for my wife and myself but cooked two extra cutlets for the next day's lunches. The boys smelled the cutlets and gravy cooking and asked if they could have some as well. No cutlets for lunch, but won the nickle bet with my wife. Really, the sauce is the maker for this dish and teaches everyone how easy it can be to make a delicious gravy. Panko crumbs are not necessary, regular ones work fine, but the Panko adds extra crunch."
