"reviewBody": "I’ve cooked chicken wings for 30 plus years and was never happy with them. Everybody else scarfed them up. It was never a problem with my flavoring.. I just never like the texture of the skin as in not being crispy enough. The quest ended tonight! I followed the frying instructions and the texture was ourstanding. I kept a timer on them during each stage in the oil..I added a couple minutes as I don’t have a commercial deep fryer so the temp can be all over the place... I have the typical lp gas cooker (outside of course) I also kept a grease thermometer in the oil monitoring the temp. Outstanding result. I didn’t do the seasoning only because I have my own.. I’m sure its very good.. Thanks again.."

"reviewBody": "Yes I altered it.. I used all the seasonings from this recipe except.. I mix it with 3 tbs flour then mixed the wings in a ziplock bag in the fridge for a few hours.. and I only fried them once. These were the best wings I ever made.. without sauce or with or without blue cheese or with is a completely different experience. This is how I will make wings from now on.. and i will try the original recipe just for kicks"

"reviewBody": "I made this rub for some wings that I baked for the Super Bowl. I know it always bothers me when people post a review on your recipes and change the recipe but there were a few ingredients I didn't have on hand so I did have to make some minor changes. For instance I didn't have mustard powder so I omitted that. And I had only ancho chili powder which gave it a nice smoky flavor. Also I only had half of the Cayanne pepper so I added some ghost pepper seasoning mix I had on hand. But only a small amount of the ghost pepper seasoning because that's pretty spicy. I added a little bit of flour to the rub mix so it would stick to the wings. I totally recommend draining and drying the chicken wings before applying the rub. I like my chicken wings really saucy so after they were baked we tossed them in a traditional buffalo sauce. But I think it's the rub that made them such a hit because it added another layer of flavor. So while I didn't follow this recipe to the letter, I believe it's a great rub recipe. Next time when I plan ahead I will get all of the ingredients and follow the recipe more precisely. Last year we purchased wings from our favorite local wing shop and this year my friends couldn't believe that I cooked them, pretty proud!"
