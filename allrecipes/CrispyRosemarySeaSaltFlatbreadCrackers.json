I rolled it exceedingly thin and the middles still were softish so I turned down the oven 10 degrees and cooked them abt 17m, picked off the edges and then 2 more minutes. Then they were delightful. Next time I am putting everything bagel topping on them. I'll be making them a lot... because I am the slacker who likes a good cracker!"

"reviewBody": "Love the recipe but made a few changes. To prevent toughness, I added a ½ teaspoon of baking soda and a ¼ teaspoon of distilled white vinegar. I mix everyting only until thoroughly combined and do not knead it at all because kneading will create a tougher cracker. To eliminate having the transfer the sticky dough, I placed half of the dough onto a silicone mat (Silpat), covered the dough with a sheet of parchment paper and pressed out the dough, followed by rolling the dough the rest of the way until it it was very thin. Baked as recommended. The baking soda is just enough to keep it crispy but not tough and rolling them out on a silicone mat eliminate the need for any additional flour because your not having to transfer the sticky dough."

Since then I have made this recipe many times, in many variations. I have replaced the rosemary with chives, oregano, everything bagel seasoning, and garlic. (All yummy, surprisingly chives were the favorite) I have also tried different cheeses and oils. Also good if you do one tablespoon herbs with a tablespoon of sesame or flax seeds. As others have said, the main key is rolling out thin."

"reviewBody": "Great crackers. They don't need the extra salt sprinkled on top, as that was too much. I look forward to changing up the seasonings as the possibilities are endless. A pasta maker greatly eases rolling out thin dough. I rolled it to the \"5\" setting which yielded a thin, crisp cracker that was still sturdy enough to spread cheese on. Cut the crackers after you've put the dough on the cookie sheet to save time. They don't spread so you can pop them in the oven after cutting without separating them. Yummy!"

I think they’ll be just fine for a soft, yet sturdy, cheese."

I followed some other reviewers' tips including rolling the dough thinly and watching them carefully as they bake. You must let them bake until they turn golden to get the nice crunch. Instead of rosemary I used basil and oregano and also recommend cutting back on the salt as mine turned out a little too salty. If you use plenty of flour when rolling out the dough you shouldn't have trouble with it sticking or becoming misshapen."

We are trying to reduce waste by buying less processed stuff and cooking at home, so this is my first attempt at making crackers from scratch. This is surprisingly simple and they taste way better than store-bought. It is challenging to get the thickness and shape consistent, so I will say that just adds to the richness of home-cooked food!"

I used my KitchenAid pasta roller starting with #1 setting and stopping after #3. This made the rolled out dough consultant in thickness and baking. I didn’t have parmesan so I used old cheddar with a fine grater and mixed in the flour as I grated to avoid lumps. The first time I used Rosemary but found it a bit intense for my taste so I used a half teaspoon of garlic powder and a teaspoon on basil for the second batch. And will stick with that.\n\nThis is the best cracker recipe I‘Ve tried. Easy to make but... they don’t last long. It’s hard to go wrong with a Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "Certainly the key here is roll them out thinly but you've got to be careful about over-baking. The taste isn't pleasant. In the video, Chef John returns half the tray to the oven to get the remaining pieces equally brown. I did that with a few but in the end, I prefer the look of the variation in colour . They look very presentable in the serving bowl and all the crackers are quite crispy. I had only half the amount of fresh Rosemary and though I'm not so keen on a strong Rosemary taste, these do need the full amount. Also, I think next time I might pulse the salt a bit to make the bits smaller - to make for a lighter and more even distribution of the salt. Lastly, these can be placed very close to each other on the baking tray - they don't expand."

I followed the basic recipe, including parmesan, but did not have rosemary or any other fresh herbs so I used dried dill. Tasted great! Also, first batch wasn't quite thin enough - they're still tasty and somewhat crunchy, but I wanted more snap - so I made sure to roll second batch thinner. This will be my go to recipe, trying new flavors always, and will probably never get store bought again. PS Loved the video! :-)"

I was concerned because my dough wasn't particularly sticky - moderately stiff and elastic - but, although it was difficult to roll out they turned out just fine. I did use about half of the salt in the dough since I felt the additional salt on top would make them salty enough. I poked holes in half the recipe, but didn't dock the other half and could see no difference. I baked them for about 15 minutes, removing the ones that were done earlier and putting the others back until all were a nice golden brown. They were excellent accompanying the Sun-Dried Tomato Tapenade from Alexis May Tanner (itself an awesome recipe that I might now have to review!)"
