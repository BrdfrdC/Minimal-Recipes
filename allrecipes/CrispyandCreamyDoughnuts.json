"reviewBody": "This recipe is incredible! I read all of the comments first and tweaked the recipe accordingly. I ended up blooming the yeast first in the 1/4 cup of warm water with a tsp of the sugar required for the dough. Next, I added all of the ingredients into the bowl of my kitchenaid mixer with paddle attachment. I cut the shortening into tiny cubes and made sure all of my ingredients were room temp. I used half cake flour and half all purpose, roughly 5 3/4 cups. After the first 2 cups, I switches to the dough hook. The dough was STILL a little wet and sticky by the end, but I let it rise anyways and it turned out fine. The dough had an incredible light and fluffy texture and was perfect. I made my donuts with maple glaze, chocolate frosting, cinnamon sugar and powdered with jelly filling. 10/10 would recommend!"

These donuts came out light, fluffy and oh so delicious you couldn't just eat one. I made chocolate glazed ones, pineapple glazed ones and cinnamon and brown sugar ones. This recipe is a keeper, and I will be making it again."

Are used confectioner sugar and cream to make the icing, which turned out perfect. I feel the donuts themselves could have tasted a little sweeter. Iâ€™ll probably make again, but add a little more sugar this time."

The only thing I changed was to use cake flour for half of the flour as I wanted to use it up, and I also had to add an extra cup of flour to get just the right consistency for the dough. I believe that was due to the very humid day we had when I made them. They turn out amazing. Melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I did find that I had to turn down the heat on my gas stove as they were getting too dark too fast. When reading the other reviews, I had to laugh at the ones where they said their family said they tasted just like KK. But when my husband said the same thing I couldn't stop laughing. Thanks for such a great recipe."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is very good for turning out beautiful, light and crispy donuts, but other reviewers are right. They're not sweet enough. They basically taste like glazed bread, albeit light and fluffy bread. Besides more sugar, there's some other integral ingredient missing, maybe nutmeg or vanilla. I'll have to do some research to figure it out. But it's a very good starting point for light and crispy donuts. I halved the recipe and still got 15 donuts and 20+ donut holes. I made it in my bread machine, very easy. Lastly, I used Splenda instead of sugar and that worked out fine."

The donut itself was good but a bit denser then i thought it would be... i wanted like a french crueller texture but it was like a regular donut.\nIt was like the store, again first time so only comparison is store bought but everyone enjoyed."

The only thing I will change in the future is using the Earth Balance in the glaze, the fake butter flavor was a little overwhelming in that context. I think next time I will do a simple glaze with oat milk or perhaps go for a lemon glaze."

"reviewBody": "Straightforward, easy recipe. I don't keep shortening on hand, so I subbed in butter with no problem. My dough was a bit sticky after the initial knead and rise, but using plenty of flour while rolling and cutting took care of it. The donuts puffed up nice and light while frying, and only the very last (overworked) bits of dough ended up a bit dense. I filled some with pastry cream and chose to top all of them with chocolate ganache instead of glaze."

"reviewBody": "I made these for the first time, first time making donuts at all actually, and I was very pleased. First off, follow the recipe precisely, there really isn't any need to adjust. I most definitely have Sweet tooth but those that say it isn't sweet enough are crazy, once you glaze them they are more than enough sweet. If you want them sweeter than just double glaze them I guess.\n\nHere are some tips you might find helpful:\n\n1. Depending on the yeast you use you may have to add a 1/4 tsp of sugar to the yeast mixture to get it active and foaming. If it just looks milky after five minutes throw it out and add sugar to the next batch. Temperature matters tremendously with yeast so use a thermometer to make sure the water is around 110Â°F.\n\n2. I set my oven to \"warm\" which is under 200Â°F and placed the covered dough in the oven to rise, again, temperature matters with yeast. It took about 45-60 minutes to rise enough in that warm environment, so if you leave it at room temp it could take longer. Don't rush it though, make sure the dough doubles in size.\n\n3. I cooked the oil to 350Â°F and that was more than hot enough. One thing I realized is that the doughnuts will continue to cook slightly even after you remove them from the oil, as they drain the hot oil will continue to brown them just a little. I would recommend taking them out before they are \"golden brown\" to compensate for that. You can practice with the donut holes as I did to get it right.\n\n4. Have fun, you're making donuts!"

Iâ€™m sure the oil version canâ€™t compare to the creaminess of the shortening version, but they were light, airy and delicious. The dough was stable enough to roll out a second time so I got more than 18 donuts. Will definitely save this recipe."

Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It delivered what it said. The glaze was amazing too. Thanks so much Kelly!\n\nBefore I made this, I read the reviews and paid extra attention to the yeast as adviced by others. Only when I am happy with the foamy yeast did I proceed with the dough. My dough was sticky even after adding all the allocated flour. I was worried at first and pretty sure it will turn out bad because of the weird stickiness. Against my conscience, I went kamikaze and proof it anyway (to double the size). Surprisingly after letting the dough rise, the texture is bouncy and not as sticky. So I can handle the dough more easily to roll and cut it into doughnut rings.\n\nAnyway my point is try to stick to recipe ok. It will be alright in the end."

Today I used the dough to make Boston Creme doughnuts! My family is in heaven. I used instant vanilla pudding mix (3/4 cup pudding mix, plus 3 cups of milk) and a chocolate doughnut glaze that is 1 cup chocolate chips, 4T butter, 1t vanilla, and 2.5T corn syrup all melted together. I cannot wait to try more variations. This is delish! Thank you so much for sharing!"
