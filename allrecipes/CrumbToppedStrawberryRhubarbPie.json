It was superb on the first day, and not quite as delicious on Day 2, so I recommend baking it when you have friends or family to enjoy it Day 1. I made three changes: 1) Used a Pillsbury deep dish refrigerated crust, which tasted great. 2) Cut sugar for fruit to 1 cup. I used rhubarb and strawberries straight from my garden with great flavor. 3) Replaced white sugar in topping with light brown sugar. Next time (and there will be a next time—it’s a lifetime recipe!), I will reduce the topping by about 1/3 and try the original white sugar in it. SUPER RECIPE, THANKS!"

I would rather it taste a little more sour since that’s the point of using rhubarb. My final product turned out to be more of a crumble than a pie but I think that had something to do with my crust, which wouldn’t come off the bottom of the pan But that’s not the recipe's fault. I’m not very experienced making pie."

I doubled the rhubarb 16 oz by weight, left the strawberries the same 12 oz by weight, halved the sugar in the filling and used 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice for the nutmeg and cinnamon. I omitted the pecans and halved the topping portion. I baked on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet for 30 minutes at 400 then 350 for 30 minutes, it was perfect. Will defintely make this pie again!"

Strawberry rhubarb pie needs a level of tartness to it to balance out the sweetness and this pie doesn't deliver on that. It also didn't set up well. For those that are saying that there is too much crumb topping and they are not able to put all of it on the pie ...don't use a standard pie plate, this pie needs a deep dish pie plate. Loved the crumb topping!"

Better to have a bit more than too little. I also made a mini version with a Glueten free crust for a guest and she was blown away! I did use fresh frozen strawberries that I had picked in the summer along with fresh frozen rhubarb from last summer's garden and I can only imagine how much better it will be when I make it this summer with perfect ripe berries and fresh picked rhubarb!!"

It was super easy and it turned out so great! I got compliments all around! I had extra rhubarb so I made two more to freeze. The only thing I changed was I reduced the amount of sugar in the crumble in the second two because my husband thought the sweetness masked the taste of the rhubarb, and I made one of them raspberry rhubarb! I have to say I like the raspberry the best! I prefer the amount of sugar called for in the recipe though. Definitely will make again!"

Brown sugar, and 1/2 c. Flour - resulting in the best crumb topping I've ever made for pies!! Plus my hubby love it, which is a total plus in my book."

"reviewBody": "I grew up in the Midwest where rhubarb grows abundantly. When I moved to the South, I realized most people here have never tried rhubarb! I spied it in the grocery store recently and didn't care it cost WAY too much. My husband, born &amp; raised in the South, was skeptical, at best. I made this pie for him and he keeps asking when I'm going to make it again. Our daughter is flying down here tomorrow and she's bringing a pound of fresh rhubarb! This is a new favorite dessert...easy and reminds me of \"home.\""

Then I went searching for a recipe and found this one. It seemed very easy. I made it and we had it for dessert after dinner tonight and he loved it. Will make this one again. I may add a bit less sugar next time. SO TASTY!"

One of the best pies I have eaten and it surely surpasses any commercial or restaurant pie. This is a very adaptable recipe for any fresh fruit-- go slow on the sugar depending on the sweetness of the fruit used. CAUTION: use a baking sheet under the pie pan while baking and don't eat the entire pie in one sitting!"

Might use even less, maybe 3/4 cup, next time. Also, cut the crumb topping in half and it was the perfect amount. Very happy with the results and it was very quick and easy to make! Would definitely make again."

I used brown sugar instead of white in the topping and cut it down just a bit, maybe by about a quarter, and since I had room in the pan I just went for it and put it all on even though reviewers said it was quite a bit even when cut down. But who doesn't love crumb topping, right?? It was lovely, I wouldn't do it any other way. The cinnamon, nutmeg, and pecans add such a nice, rich flavor to the rhubarb and strawberries. I am going to make this again VERY soon!"

Thanks for the wonderful recipe."

I put all the topping on, which was a mistake, I'd cut it back by at least 1/3. The filling could use a little more flour so it doesn't run when you cut a piece. Overall result it tasted more like a tart cherry pie than strawberry rhubarb to us."

"reviewBody": "This was a great recipe. I did cut the sugar in the filling down to just under a cup, and could almost cut it to 3/4 of a cup, for my taste. I also cut down on the topping, as another reviewer said it made too much. Even after cutting it by about 1/4, I still ended up with about twice as much as I actually used, so I am saving the rest for future use on muffins or something. I also omitted the pecans as I didn't have any, and really don't like them much anyway. I will definitely be using this recipe again."

The filling was more than adequate to fill the pie and the crumb topping did not all fit on. Next time, I would cut down a bit on the sugar in the filling, but there are no other changes I would make. The cinnamon and nutmeg are nice in the filling. Put the pie on a cookie or abking sheet, as the filling drips out a bit. I would definitely make this again. Thank you!"
