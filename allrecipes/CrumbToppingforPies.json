This topping tasted delicious but it was too fine which went on very even, and resulted in a homogeneous coating that you could lift up in sheets, for lack of a better term. My husband loved it but he thought it was coffee cake. It’s important that the butter be cold to stay in large pieces and I would even add some rolled oats."

I followed the simple recipe but with these modifications:\n1.Halved the recipe because I was topping 12 small pastries so \n1/2 c. brown sugar\n1/2 c. flour\n2-3 tbsp. butter\n\nBUT I used Splenda brown sugar blend and reduced to 1/3 because its so much sweeter than regular brown sugar\nAnd I increased the butter back up to 1/4 cup and used the advice to pop it in the micro for 20 seconds to soften but not melt. \n\nIT WAS AWESOME !! Thank you! Simple and duplicatable.\n\nMichele"

I've used this recipe for many years &amp; it's good, but decided to read a few of the \n recommendations from others before making this time. \n\nI made a few changes based on the suggestions of others. I made 2 pies- the first, I added 2 extra TBSP of butter. This pie came out looking like it had a hard candy crust &amp; there was actually a bit of butter sitting on the top of the pie that I had to soak up with a paper towel. The second pie (and MY recommendation for this recipe to be 5-stars) I still used the 2 extra TBSP of butter, but I cut the brown sugar down to 3/4 cup. I was concerned because the mix looked EXTREMELY dry while I was putting it on the pie, but it baked BEAUTIFULLY &amp; looks amazing!! Will definitely be making it this was for future!"

I use unsalted butter, so I sprinkle a little salt into the flour, and then I shake in a little cinnamon. I decrease the brown sugar to 3/4 cup, and cut in the room temperature butter with a pastry blender. I have used this recipe for several years, and it is quick to make and tasty to eat. I use this topping to cover the 5 pies I make from the 40 serving apple pie filling recipe on this site."

"reviewBody": "I like this topping well enough, but found it way too much for a single pie. (I put it on a Mrs. Smith's frozen Cherry Pie) I halved all three ingredients. I tried mixing the cold diced butter into the brown sugar/flour mixture by hand with a fork as suggested in the recipe, but it wouldn't combine. After softening the butter (in the bowl with the brown sugar &amp; flour) for 20 secs in the microwave, it combined just fine, using a a hand mixer. Tastes really good!"

But the muffins were so delicious, I just sealed the rest in a baggie and will use it again soon!"
