They were coming out way too big so I measured out 2 TBS and seemed small but adequate. This is a good basic recipe I can have fun experimenting &amp; substituting with in the future."

I like using the mini chocolate chips- easier to roll. Also have added other nuts instead- walnuts, almonds or pecans, as well as coconut and flax seed meal."
