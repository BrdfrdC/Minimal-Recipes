My sauce was Rao's and a can of Manzo tomatoes with Italian seasoning added. What I did add were mushrooms and diced chicken on each layer. This is actually an over the top dish. Most everyone in the family does not like eggplant but this dish is the exception. I also did not think it took that long to make even with cooking the chicken breast."

I also left the skin on and washed it. I used this as an appetizer and it was nice and crunchy. I stopped after baking it and did not add any marinara sauce or cheese and served it with ranch dressing; however it would be good dipped in Marinara sauce without the mozzarella cheese. I will try the recipe as Eggplant Parmesan next time."

Any hint of nutrient is being sweated, baked, broiled, and baked again until this recipe no longer qualifies to be listed under the \"healthy\" section. For the sauce I put it in dollops on top of the eggplant to not loose the crunch. For easier serving, layer the eggplant in stacks. Took us 3.5 hours. So tasty I give it an A+."

Following AhhhJDew's advice not to do the initial bake first, but to dip in flour, egg wash and then panko and bake for 15-20 minutes. When I saw the eggplant after the panko bake I coated the one side with a small about of spaghetti sauce, topped with a Italian blend of shredded cheese and returned to the oven until cheese melited. The results gave a tasty eggplant appetizer. When the weather is cooler I will do the casserole part. But, many thanks for the recipe - with out it I would not have gotten the appetizer. I do plan on doing the casserole version when the weather becomes cooler."

"reviewBody": "The first time we made this I followed the receipt as written (except for the precooking). It was good, however in our opinion the eggplant was too soft and lost its crunch.\nEver since then we ,like most reviewers made additional changes. We grow Ichiban eggplant which is long and skinny. The skin is thin and tender (no peeling required) and the seeds are small. \nMy step 4 included coating them in whole wheat flour seasoned with pepper, dipped in the beaten eggs, then panko crumbs mixed with Italian seasoning and grated parmasean cheese.\nI followed the broiling instructions (step 6). My step 7 was placing the cooked eggplant (somewhat overlapping) into a small casserole dish or small cast iron skillet coated lightly with cooking spray. I moderatly spooned homemade chunky marinara sauce on top and sprinkled with grated mozzarella cheese. Placed it in a 350 degree oven and baked until the cheese melted.\nThe eggplant retained its crunchiness and was delicious. I have made this several times and its perfect every time.\nIf we have too much eggplant, after its broiled and cooled I place some of it in the icebox and bake it later in the week. It keeps for serval days, I'll try freezing it next time."

I made a simple sauce by sweating the onion and garlic in a little olive oil then adding a cup of Passata. Let it simmer for about ten minutes. It was ready for the recipe. Once he coated the eggplant with the bread crumbs (he used crushed corn flakes) he put the tray in the refrigerator for about an hour before cooking. We have found this helps to get the egg and breadcrumbs to really stick. A great recipe. Can't wait to make it again."

Next time I'll take others suggestions and prep the extra egg plant (bake 15 minutes, then dip in egg and breading) and freeze, for a quicker dinner option when time is limited."

My tweaks: I added chopped fresh tomatoes to the pasta sauce as they are coming in from the garden now. For the cheeses I used equal parts parmesan, fontina and fresh mozzarella. My three medium sized eggplants were picked yesterday so I did not peel. The perfect early harvest recipe. Thank you"

I followed the instructions exactly and was delighted with the outcome! The kids and hubby all gobbled it up! It did soak up a lot of the sauce, but also remained crunchy. I used jarred Mario Batali's Marinara and it was perfect! I also think this can be served as an appetizer If you stop at the step just after broiling. Just serve the baked crispy eggplant with some warm marinara for dipping! Yum!"

I had beautiful crispy eggplant rounds after the breading &amp; broiling, so I was careful not to smother them in too much sauce, which I did the first time I made this, allowing their sides to remain exposed and crunchy. The result was amazing! The dish tasted like veal parmesan that I remember from my childhood."

Lastly I pre-baked the eggplant on each side 10 minutes and only cooked it with the sauce and cheese for 10 mins. It turned out beautiful, crispy and delicious!"

Now I can just bake them up the next time we want them. I also didn't bake them with the sauce. I just kept the broiler on and melted some parmesean on each slice, plated them and topped with hot tomato sauce. This way they stayed super crunchy.

I guess I don't see the point in doing all the steps to ensure a crispy breading when you are just going to cover it all in sauce and cheese. It had a good taste overall but no one noticed that the eggplant or breading tasted any different than how I would usually make it. I did brown up some mild Italian sausage and added it to the sauce which added a lot of additional flavor."

"reviewBody": "This recipe could achieve true greatness with a few IMPORTANT adjustments: 1) DO NOT cook the eggplant slices before coating in egg and breadcrumbs. 2) Dip in seasoned flour FIRST as follows: After sweating the eggplant slices, dip in seasoned flour on both sides, and THEN dip in egg, and THEN in breadcrumbs. Continue as directed. Now, the key to any Italian red sauce recipe is the red sauce. You need a solid marinara to make this perfect, not a crummy jarred sauce. You're gonna go through all this work only to smother your delicious, crunchy eggplant with a jar of Ragu??? No way. Master a basic marinara and you can have it ready while the eggplant is sweating."
