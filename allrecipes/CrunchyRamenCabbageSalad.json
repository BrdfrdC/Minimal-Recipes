We’re not into too much sweetness these days, so I cut the sugar back a bit, and then the dressing was just about perfect for our taste. I used black sesame seeds to give this a little more eye appeal, and you really could see them. I will use one tablespoon of sesame seeds next time instead of two, but this was a very nice side dish to sous vide teriyaki london broil and chili-glazed grilled fresh pineapple."

Then I added shredded chicken breast , coated with some of the extra dressing, to make it a lunch salad. YUM!\nUpdate - I had the leftovers of this salad for lunch the next day and it was dry. Ramen noodles absorbed all of the dressing. So eat this the day you make it or be prepared to add more dressing."

Using canola oil and subbing toasted almond slices for the sesame seeds, I found the dressing needed MUCH more rice wine vinegar to suit my tastes. An easy fix, however. I also didn't notice any flavor from the ramen seasoning packet in the dressing (I used the oriental flavor) and was a tad disappointed by that. I toasted the ramen noodles along with the sliced almonds, which was a nice suggestion by another reviewer. All in all, I will definitely make this again (for myself) and tweak it slightly to please my palate."

Also, it's too sweet.\" Recipe doesn't indicate what flavor ramen to use so w/ my pantry choices of Oriental (tried and true packet of blue, college memories of Veg-all cans mixing w/ you) or Chicken (ahh, good ol' orange's always good, for cheap college late-night food), I went w/ Oriental, and that seasoning seemed to jive well w/ this recipe. Also made this even easier by using a bag of coleslaw mix, but OHNO, this was cloyingly sweet w/ 2 TB sugar and we had a tough time eating it, and even more disappointing to throw so many leftovers away. If I made this again, I would drop the sugar entirely!"

I did need to add a bit more rice vinegar and I used 1 tsp of sesame oil, to have enough dressing to coat the amount of cabbage that I had (I didn't really measure my cabbage though, just used 1/2 of a small head that I had in my frig to use up). I also added a few green onions cut on the diagonal, just for an added touch of color). Will make again."

Everyone loves it &amp; it's not as salty or high in sugar as several other recipes for this salad. Cheaper too w/o the cashews. I bought the sesame oil, pre-toasted sesame seeds &amp; rice vinegar for 1/2 of the cost of my grocery store, by going to a local asian market."

I had cooked broccoli and didn't know what to do with it, so I searched for a sesame dressing to eat it with. However, after making this dressing and trying it, I realised that I'd much rather have my brocolli in a vinaigrette - 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 to 1.5 tbsp balsamic vinegar, 1 to 1.5 tsp soy sauce."

"reviewBody": "I have made this recipe several times and it is always a hit.\n\nI use less margarine to brown the noodles and then I drain them on a few paper towels. That process absorbs quite a bit of the fat and also makes for crispier noodles. I've also used plain white vinegar if that's all I have and the dressing still taste great.\n\nLike some other reviewers, I keep the dressing, noodle mix and cabbage separate until ready to serve."

I threw in a little bottled sesame salad dressing and it turned out okay. Not fabulous. I will try again with the sesame oil and hope it turns out better."

It tasted even better the next day, but the ramen noodles were a little soft. You might want to try making this early in the day to marinate and then add the noodles just before serving."
