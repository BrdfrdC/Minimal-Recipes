"reviewBody": "This is excellent. It seems some people think sugar free means you should use natural sweeteners such as honey. NO! Honey is high in sugar, sugar free means using as little or no sugar. Diabetics aren't supposed to consume sugar regardless if it is honey, agave, or any form of carbs. Some amount is unavoidable,but the goal is to sweeten with as little as sugar as possible."
