Made pretty much as the recipe calls for except I used 2 1/2 cups of the cheese and added 1/2 red bell pepper as someone else said in their comment. Baked for the 30 minutes, let it sit for 10 minutes and it was really good! Not dry, a little greasy from the cheese. Leftovers for bfast the next morning. Yum! Will make again with some bacon."

It's so easy to prepare, can be made ahead, reheats nicely, stays warm easily. The only thing difficult is finding Muenster cheese in a block rather than in slices. But this year I found exactly what I needed at Smart n Final. This recipe works beautifully with any green vegetable, so if you lack spinach, try leftover green beans, artichoke hearts, asparagus or broccoli and feel free to substitute caramelized leeks or shallots for the onions.

As someone else suggested, I doubled the recipe and poured it into a 9 x 13 pan. I only used 4 cups of cheese in the doubled recipe--that was plenty. And I used 5 eggs and 7 egg whites to lower the calorie count. I used fresh spinach, cheddar cheese and some leftover mushrooms. I also took another's suggestion about sprinkling a bit of Parmesan on top before baking.\n\nMy only problem with this recipe is keeping the finished product around. Everyone gobbles it up! Bottom line is if you follow the basic recipe here, you can make a LOT of switches (type of cheese, veggies used, etc.) each time you make it."

Also used what ever cheese I had so it end d up as a combination of Parmesan, provolone and something else that I don‚Äôt recall. I also added a touch of nutmeg to the spinach as it was saut√©ing.

"reviewBody": "I think I followed the recipe exactly the first time and quite enjoyed it. Now I make it about once a week and mix it up a bit. I use additional frozen vegetables sometimes, depending on what's in the freezer. So far I've always included some spinach but sometimes reduce the spinach a bit and add in broccoli or brussel sprouts (no doubt other things will work their way in depending on what's in the fridge/freezer). I mostly thaw the other vegetables, then chop them up fairly small so there are not big chunks and add them to the frying pan after the onion's cooked a bit but before adding the spinach, to soften up a bit. I usually use old cheddar as we usually have that in the house and it's cheaper than Muenster, although the Muenster is delicious too. I also realized I've been using about 2 cups rather than 3 of cheese for the last while. It seems to be plenty (and I love cheese). This recipe is a good way to get me to eat and enjoy green vegetables, which are not my favourite by themselves, and it's been really handy to have in the fridge for a quick bite when we're in a rush. I like that we have all the ingredients on hand and can throw it together quickly and easily at a moment's notice."

"reviewBody": "I fall back on this recipe often; it is so versatile and you can change it up any way you want, for any meal of the day! It is even good cold (provided you have any leftovers!!) I generally use 2 packages of spinach, or sometimes chopped frozen kale or a mixture of the two. I let the onions brown just a little before adding the greens; if you squeeze the greens out well in a colander, they don't retain much water to cook away. Although it's one of my husband's favorites, muenster cheese always seems a bit bland to me, so I have used all different types of cheese. But, I do want spinach to be the star and some cheeses overpower it, so I've settled on 1/2 swiss and 1/2 fontina as my favorite. Also, I add some freshly grated nutmeg to the spinach/cheese/egg mixture because nutmeg and spinach seem made for each other. Try the finished product with a little salsa on top--yum!! I am very grateful to ANY14TNS for giving us such a great basic recipe--happy eating!!"
