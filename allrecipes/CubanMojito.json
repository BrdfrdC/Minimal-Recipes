"reviewBody": "I just made these and man, they were so good! Another person complained that they weren't sweet enough so i added a little more sugar. I used a mortar and pestle to grind up the sugar, lime wedge, and mint leaves and then i put it into the glass, added the rum and the soda water. The store didnt have club soda, but they had seltzer water, no problem with that. I crushed up my ice in a blender. I only had dark rum, so i used that, no problem. Just taste it as you go, to see if you have enough lime or sugar or mint leaves, to your liking. I added an additional mint leaf to each drink. Amazon has all those mortar and pestle grinders or wooden muddlers for stuff like this. You do have to use something to grind the mint leaves and lime wedges up, though. A spoon doesn't do the trick. You have to make these!!. Excellent!"
