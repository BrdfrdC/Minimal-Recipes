After peeling the cucumber, I scored lengthwise with a fork then cut lengthwise 4 times to slice quarters. Be sure to rip, not chop, the cilantro to preserve the beautiful leaves. And, I am a Spice Girl, so I added a variety of spices to my taste. Served in a glass bowl to show it off and it was a hit! I look forward to making it again as I want to experiment with variations.
