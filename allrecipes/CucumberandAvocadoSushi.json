Instead, I used regular white rice and white vinegar and the sushi rolls turned out just fine; I loved them. I will make these again! I'm a vegetarian, my parents aren't so I did add imitation crab to half of my sushi batch for my parents. I also noticed that I didn't have enough rice cooked for 4 sheets of nori to be filled and the last one wasn't fully stuffed like the others. Next time, I'll make more rice! Overall, I love this so so much!!"

We also did 2 rolls with fresh Yellowfin Tuna from the fish dept. of our food store. This tuna was so fresh and mild...tasted like butter. Excellent! The tuna rolls we also added the cukes and avacado. We found our Nori seaweed in the Asian section of our food store....no problem. Served with wasabi and low sodium soy. Also made Japanese Soup with Tofu and Mushooms from this site and Vegetarian Dumplings from Alton Brown on Food Network for a complete meal. Thanks!"

I have not been able to eat my favorite spicy tuna sushi for 5 months despite craving for it. I'm very happy that this dish hit the spot! (Be forewarned that if you're used to eating spicy tuna, volcano rolls etc. that this recipe will probably taste a bit bland to you.) It's a very basic recipe. CHANGES: Made 2 cups of Cal Rose rice then mixed in 2 tablespoons of Nakano seasoned rice vinegar and 1 tsp of sesame oil. Just add crab meat to the cucumber, avocado and you've got a California roll! Other great ideas to add into the sushi is shrimp tempura and use eel sauce from this site (don't worry there's no eel in the sauce) or maybe even some salmon roe."

Regardless of your comfort level trying homemade maki, this recipe hits the spot - fast, easy, versatile and delicious. I made mine with rinsed Spanish med grain rice, carrot, steamed asparagus and fake crab. This is maki for beginners so it's a simplified version. Once you are comfortable with this one, learn the traditional way to make sushi rice for an even better maki roll. Thanks for the recipe!"

However, he's right-- Don't use sticky/glutinous rice. It's not the same thing as sushi rice, and it makes the nori taste fishy, along with giving the whole roll a sickly squishy feel. Instead, use normal asian short grain rice, or \"sushi rice\". Otherwise, I found it nice, simple, and quite accessible."

"reviewBody": "I agree with sushiichii; one uses a good quality short grain rice--a Cal rose variety is often preferred (Nishiki brand in my neck of the woods) to make sushi, not glutinous rice which is for desserts, mochi cake, etc. \n\n I guess no one fans the rice after adding the vinegar, to cool the rice quickly (it won't be mushy, either) and give it a nice sheen like my auntie Kimiko taught me over forty years ago. I haven't seen that instruction given in any of the recipes I've seen here. \n\nOne might try different brands of rice vinegar; personally, I prefer a nice mild seasoned one. In a pinch, one can use white vinegar with sugar added--use far less than you would rice vinegar, add a little and sample the rice while cooling, adding more as necessary, flipping/folding delicately with your rice paddle. \n\nAll in all, this is a decent and simple recipe."

Although we didn't have cucumber and avocado sushi, I am giving this recipe a 5 because we wouldn't have otherwise made it without this recipe inspiring confidence (this is a VERY easy dish). We used things we had in the fridge to make our own \"unique\" sushi rolls. They included (1) Pepperoni Pizza Sushi Roll: Use several pepperoni to make a line on the rice, add some mozzarella, a line of spagetti or tomato sauce (we used tomato basil sauce we had left over), sprinkle with crushed red pepper and garlic salt; (2) Roast Beef Sushi Roll: a line of roast beef (we used sandwich meat) on the sushi roll, a line of cream cheese, and a line of red bell pepper; (3) Turkey Sushi Roll: a line of sandwich turkey, line of avacado, line of wasabi sauce, line of cream cheese. We also had several dipping sauces on hand, eg soy sauce, wasabi sauce, and spicy ranch (we couldn't find sushi mayo). It was delicious, we are making more this week for a dinner party. My boyfriend and his best friend stopped by during our meal and also LOVED the sushi!"
