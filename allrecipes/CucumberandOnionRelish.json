Looking forward to cheese and bickies topped with this relish. Oh not to mention the glass of wine that is a necessary accompaniment."

But it really was delectable, sweet, sour, slightly spicy, with a nice little crunch. I was looking for a recipe to use one of those rogue cucumbers from the garden that grew about 20 inches long. This filled the bill nicely. Can't wait to slap some on a burger, hot dog, or grilled chicken breast. I think it would go very nicely with ribs or roasted anything too. I put some on a leftover baked potato and it really was nice. Thank you for the recipe!"
