Mayo instead of 4 Tbsps., 1 spring onion, 1 squirt lemon juice and 1/4 tsp. dill with lemon seasoning. I didn't have dill pickles so I added some sweet relish instead. I will definitely make this recipe again next summer."

I didn't think it sounded that great but tried it anyway and I'm glad I did. It was very light tasting, not too eggy and a really nice cool salad for a BBQ. I ended up adding another scoop of mayo and some paprika since I felt it was kind of bland at first. I also patted the cucumber and pickles dry since others said it was coming out runny and it turned out fine. This is a recipe you could play with too by adding more or less of the ingredients you want. I think it would also be good with some green onions or maybe even some shredded carrot. Definitely give this one a try!"

Add pickles to the smell of it and we're really walking on thin shells. I survived the undertaking and got more adventurous, tossing in some finely chopped green olives, an inner rib of celery, a teaspoon of dijon mustard, and a pinch of freshly cracked pepper. Thanks for the recipe, and grazie for the starting line. Simple, versatile egg salad with a twist or two. Enjoy!"
