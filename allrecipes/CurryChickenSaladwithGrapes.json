I will also substitute l cup Greek yogurt for one cup of the mayo to make it healthier. Although I like garlic, I would also reduce the amount next time, as there is plenty of flavour from the curry powder. Overall though a good recipe."

"reviewBody": "No matter how you tweak it it seems to work. i like a drenched mixture if you dont then cut back on the mayo. i substituted half the mayo with yogurt. I think the curry powder varies in potency so the first time i made this i doubled it and it still seemed weak. this time i quadroupled it. I sunbstituted crasins and apple for grapes. I also cut the butter in half. I think you can omit without noticing a big diff, especially if you are tryung to make a healthier version. I added a sprinkle of cayenne, not enough to really nitice spice but to round out the curry a bit more. As i mentiined mine is kind of muted flavor. I love making this out of my chicken roast leftovers."

I actually rinsed it out so I wouldn't lose all my chicken. I'd been especially intrigued because I too had had a place I used to buy curry chicken salad from but I moved and never thought of and regretted not asking before I moved for the recipe. Without the butter, it would have been good, though nothing out of the ordinary."

At first I wondered what was going on, as it asked for butter, then melt the butter, etc. But man, it was excellent. I substituted cilantro for parsley, as I don't like the taste of parsley. Turned out amazing! My husband loved it."

I don't consider this a healthy salad due to the mayo but it is nice for a special event since it is so flavorful."

"reviewBody": "Great salad! I did make a few adjustments. I used half the butter, and for the other half I used coconut oil. I didn't replace all the butter because you really need some of the butter flavor. I used half the mayo and subbed plain yogurt for the other half. I also more than doubled the curry, and used about 2/3 the garlic. I also added about a tsp of salt. I don't like drenched salad so after making the dressing up I gradually added dressing to the chicken and grapes until it hit the right mix. I saved the rest of the dressing to use on sandwiches. It's too good to waste! Lastly I recommend at least 8 hours in the fridge before serving for the flavors to really develop. The salad was a hit at a potluck and I will definitely make again....in fact I think this will become my signature potluck dish - doubling the recipe of course!"

I used garlic powder because I just do not care to bite into garlic in a salad and then I found someone had eaten the grapes I was hoarding to make this so I added a handful of raisins (dried grapes, right?). I also added some green onions that needed to be used. I chilled this for an hour as stated, but next time, when I actually have grapes, I will make the salad either in the morning or night before. This only gets better. Thanks for a great chicken salad."
