In the oven @ 10:45am &amp; done @ 3:45 . Perfecto! It was so tender &amp; fell off the bone . To all those people who posts that they made someones recipe but has the odacity to then say in their review that they changed this or that , SHAME ON YOU ! How can you fairly write a review if you don’t make the recipe as it is written. Try it exactly as the recipe says then review it."

The drippings in the pan were a fair amount of olive oil and dried on meat juices. I put the olive oil in a saucepan, put water in the drippings and boiled it until they came loose. After making a roux with the olive oil and a couple of large spoons of flour, I adding the drippings and water as needed to make a delicious gravy."

I tripled this recipe and placed some horizontally under the skin, some into the cavity where the bone had been, some into deep cuts in the meat, and the rest rubbed all around the outside. I let it marinate 2 days. It was the most flavorful pork I have had, and I have been making a fresh ham for 30 years. This is now my Christmas recipe."

I also used an oven bag filled with a can of beer. \n\n*If you ever want to just let it cook without worrying about burning it get an oven bag"
