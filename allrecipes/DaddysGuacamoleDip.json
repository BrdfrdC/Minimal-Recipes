Please people do NOT mash up with avocados or blend this in any way - you want and need body for really good guac. I personally like and use purple onion and for sure you have to add some chopped cilantro."

The cottage cheese helps it keep longer and I for one like the texture. Only reason it get 4 stars instead of 5 is the slight lack of avocado taste. I use 3 rather than 2. I also use minced garlic over the powder."

Since hubby and I don't really like cottage cheese, I knew I'd have to take the suggestion of another reviewer and blend it in the magic bullet first. This was an excellent idea! I blended the cottage cheese and half the avocodo with the lemon juice and added real minced garlic. I then mashed up the other half of the avocado and added the onion and tomato for texture. We really enjoyed this recipe. I too added hot sauce, cumin and juice from the jar of jalapenos for extra flavor."

Not too much, just enough to give it some texture. I think this worked very well with the cottage cheese. I Love the creamy-yet-firm texture that resulted. Will definately make again and often!"

If you want to disguise the cottage cheese you can use blender. The cottage cheese gets milage out of the avacado, stretching it without sacrificing taste. Really wonderful, thanks again."

"reviewBody": "Almost perfect! Next time I would add an extra avocado and leave it a bit chunky to help the avocado flavor come thru more. I left the cottage cheese ‘whole’ (as directed), to help give this texture and am glad I did. By not pureeing, I saved time and extra dishwashing. I also used fresh garlic rather than powdered. The only other change I would make next time is to add more jalapeño – but that is just a personal spiciness choice.\nP.S. to this original review: I made this for a party and it was placed right next to a bowl of regular Guacamole. The regular bowl was empty and my bowl (this recipe) was still full by the time the party ended. I feel it was because the cottage cheese dilutes the avocado flavor and it's not the most attractive dish. On the upside, the LOWFAT cottage cheese also dilutes the fat calories. Had to change my rating from 4 to 3 stars."

I still didn't like them... until I made this dip that is. It is phenomenal! I blended everything up in the food processor and left out the sweet onion. I also used real garlic instead of garlic powder. It is absolutely delicious. Thank you very much for this recipe!"

My daughters &amp; I added minced garlic, (I did not use garlic powder) and several drops of red hot sauce to give it some pizazz after leaving it to refrigerate overnight. I would agree with the suggesstion that a whiz of the cottage cheese a couple of times in the processor just to get the large lumps smlaler would be a good idea."
