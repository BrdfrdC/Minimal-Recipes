"reviewBody": "This was sooooo good so easy. I was given a bag of popcorn kernels from a local food bank and was unsure how to use it without the tools or butters. Never made it on the stovetop. Then I found this recipe!! I made this in a rice pot being that's what I had on hand with a lid and hey, It worked!!! So the recipe says we can season to our liking so I'll say my ONLY changes was adding creole seasoning (instead of seasoning salt) and Garlic salt with parsley to the butter oil mixture as well as sprinkling ontop. The whole family couldn't leave this delicious snack alone. Will make again, and again, and again... right now its 7:55am... is it too early to make another batch lol\nDelicious and Super Easy Recipe!!! Thanks\n#ThoseGilligansApprove"

Mine browned a bit (not necessarily a bad thing) before I added the test kernels and the rest. I used the brown bag trick, tossed it in there with a tiny bit of salt. Less greasy than microwaved bags and MUCH tastier. I used 2T. Oil and 2T butter. Just a wonderful recipe and brought back memories of my grandma and grandpa popping corn - in this same pot, as it would happen. Thank you so much, John Gawecki!"

"reviewBody": "My pot is cheap, old and not a brand name, so while the kernels were popping, I thought for sure I was going to get some burnt ones, especially since I couldn't shake it much without the lid sliding off. As soon as there was a couple seconds pause with the next pop, I took it off the heat, thinking I'd have a lot of unpopped kernels. Not only did nothing burn, but there were only a few unpopped kernels. I usually get a lot of unpopped kernals in the microwave-version, plus some burnt ones because I often try to get as much kernels to pop. Not only is this so much more economical, but really doesn't take much extra time then the microwave-version. Just, instead of standing by, listening and watching the microwave, just need to shake it a little. And it's better for the environment too, if you just stir it all up in a large bowl rather than a paper bag."

I added regular salt to the butter and oil and popped the corn. Didn't have to add any additional. I sprinkled some butter flavored seasoning once popped and shook to distribute. Tasted buttery and pretty close to movie theatre popcorn. Now I know the secret to good flavored stovetop popcorn. Excellent recipe and no more microwave popcorn. I even bought the store brand corn and I only had 3 unpopped kernels. Not bad. One poster bought expensive Orville Reddenbocher corn. Not necessary, Great Value from Walmart worked just fine. Like I said, 3 unpopped kernels. Now I will start eating more popcorn. Thank you"

While that popcorn was always tasty, this is absolutely delicious. I use even amounts of oil and margarine, and I add a little salt while the two are melting together just before adding the popcorn.

I made it a few times now and find it still works best to put it all in the pot at once and just keep shaking to keep from burning. Go light on the season salt and just cover the bottom of you pot with the vegetable oil. I tried the few kernels until the popped but when I dumped the rest in the oil splattered really bad all over the place, so be careful with that."

The 2-qt. pot size in this recipe is wrong; I used a 3-qt. and 1/2 cup of popcorn still lifted the lid. Although the popcorn was relatively tough, it did have a good flavor. I plan to try adding butter to my cooking oil next time I use my big pot."

This ration burned the bottom of my pan black and created a huge amount of smoke and of course blackened the popcorn. After experimenting I found the correct ratio to be 4 T Canola Oil/ 4 T Smart Balance to one half cup of kernels. Popped to that ration the popcorn was excellent....."

The first time I tried cooking it, I ended up with complete disaster--burnt popcorn and a house full of smoke, so the second time I took a more patient approach and turned the heat down to medium high. The result was fantastic, and I'm not even a popcorn lover! (my husband and two-year-old are) We tend to like things on the salty side, so we added a little extra regular salt. I can see that there's definitely a little skill involved in making popcorn, so I'm glad I tried twice. Thanks!"

DON'T FEAR BUTTER!!\nBUTTER IS OUR FRIEND, MARGARINE IS \"NOT\" OUR FRIEND, BUTTER IS NATURAL, MARGARINE IS NOT. \nUSE BUTTER INSTEAD OF MARGARINE, IN MODERATION...ENJOY!!"

My family feels that Corn oil gives a better taste than canoloa oil. And the author is correct, cheap popcorn tastes poorly. The higher quality popcorn does taste better. Depending on the thickness of the pan, you may need to turn the heat down towards the end of popping."
