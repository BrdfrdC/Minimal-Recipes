"reviewBody": "Consider adding a sour element (lemon/lime juice) And a savory element (ketchup/BBQ/tomato base/condensed stock) Dry smoke in addition to liquid is a nice flavor explosion, and if your making numerous batches; experiment with salt level. If you’re trying to make low-salt jerky that’s one thing(use high spice, an excessive level of onion condensed soup stock; with a good amount of garlic), but for full-salt jerky, a slightly excessive amount of salt can enhance certain aspects of flavor(this can be done without damaging flavor profile in most cases by increasing the soy sauce level). additional notes: Consider trying different cuts and sizes, while cutting your meat: leave a few pieces bigger and smaller; these are good for testing, and new ways of experiencing your marinade. Remember when tasting: your marinade should be to excess; it should be balanced(sweet, sour, overly salty, slightly bitter, and savory; with a hint of heat), but extreme… almost to the edge of tolerable. If your recipe is getting boring: consider adding new types of peppers (even switching from a black to a white pepper can make a difference), if your adding actual peppers: control the heat level with the amount of seeds and released pepper oil added to the marinade. After the Jerky is finished drying, and slightly cured; consider putting it in a cold environment for a few hours before eating."

Decrease onion powder and garlic powder and hot sauce to 1/2 teaspoon. Add 1/2 bottle of a good beer, such as a bock."

Perhaps some all-spice?\" I marinated several chicken tenderloins in this for a little over a day, and it was quite tasty. I know that the intention of the recipe was for a beef jerky, and not \"Jerk\" as in \"Jamaican Jerk\", but I'm still thinking if I used this marinade again, I would add 1/2 tsp. all-spice, and maybe fresh green onion and minced garlic, instead of the powders. I served the chicken perched atop fluffy coconut rice w/ green peas and lime wedges for a tropical flair in the midst of a chilly winter's night."
