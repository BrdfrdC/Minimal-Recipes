"reviewBody": "Family adores Marie Calendar‚Äôs Turkey Pot Pies - this was so much better! I used the same quantities of ingredients but replaced the green beans with diced potatoes that I boiled with the celery, carrots and peas. I have this yummy spice blend from Trader Joe‚Äôs called Everything But the Leftovers so I replaced the celery seed, onion powder and Italian seasoning with like amounts of that. Butter was salted so I omitted that. I doubled the black pepper cause we like it that way. For turkey I cut up one of those whole turkey breasts from Costco. Into bite sized cubes. My daughter made her first butter crust using a food processor recipe. We replaced a tablespoon of the water with vodka. As you can see, tender flaky crust and a solid filling! I might double the sauce next time to have extra to pour over. This amount completely filled my deep dish Pyrex and required two crusts. I also added 15 minutes covered at 375 to the cooking time cause it wasn‚Äôt bubbling - well, it‚Äôs fairly solid so that‚Äôs probably why. It didn‚Äôt seem to suffer for the extra time."

I made the crust linked in the recipe and it was flaky and buttery, following the careful instructions to not over mix. I did not use green beans. I added potatoes because I had some leftover baked ones in the fridge. I also added poultry seasoning in the filling. This recipe is a keeper."

"reviewBody": "This is a really good base recipe. There is a tad too much pepper in my opinion since that was the most forward flavor while eating it, but otherwise, all of the quantities were right on. I didn't need quick so I used fresh carrots, broccoli, potatoes, celery, (all diced pretty small) and onion, and frozen peas. I sauteed the onion and boiled the rest for about 8 minutes as directed, but added the peas to the mixture at the very end. It worked out great. I did add all of the spices to the butter and onion (along with five cloves of minced garlic) as they cooked to pull their flavors out. I cooked the butter and flour mixture for about five minutes to develop some flavor and then I added cream instead of milk along with about a tablespoon of lemon juice to brighten up the heaviness a bit. I made them in individual pot pie dishes 1.25 cups of mixture per pie with a homemade buttery crust and it was incredible and super filling. The filling gave enough for four more individual pies so that's in the freezer for next time. I am so happy with the quantities in this recipe. The balance of sauce to meat and veg was really perfect."

"reviewBody": "Fabulous. Made it a couple times and of course have modified it. Use canned green beans instead of frozen because I like the flavor better. Hot tip from another cook is using the broth to defrost the frozen stuff, don't really cook much it as it will cook in the pie. I also saute the fresh celery with the onion like I'm making soup. Take your time and thicken it properly, I've rushed and the pie comes out a bit runny, which should not have been a surprise. next I will try the poultry seasoning rather than Italian as recommended elsewhere."

The recipe was modified with respect to those who do not like frozen green beans or peas of any kind, so potatoes were substituted for those; the recipe doubled well and we ended up with 3 double crust and 2 single crust pies. The seasonings and liquid to solid proportions were perfect and considering the two cooks were not experienced with pot pies, this recipe earns five stars."

Like a few other reviewers I made some changes, mainly swapping out some of the vegetables since I didn't have green beans. I added diced potato and some canned corn to up the starch a little since I didn't use a bottom crust. That would have made it very rich for our family. The main attraction is the sauce and the seasonings though. The only change I made was adding a half tsp of garlic powder. I will say there is a drawback in that it is a little time consuming, but worth it in the end."

I didn't have the Italian seasoning but it worked out wonderfully still! Also, I cooked the carrots, celery, onion, and garlic all in the butter until soft, then I threw in some white wine (about 1/2 cup) and let it evaporate. I then added the flour and let it cook for a minute or two. After putting the broth (I did 2 cups) and milk in, I added some finely grated parmesan (around 1/3 cup) for more flavor and to thicken the mixture more since I used extra broth, and it turned out amazing! I love that this recipe is versatile and can be made with just about anything you have on hand! Will definitely be used again!"

It actually still needed salt! Just make sure to taste as you go. I simmered all the veggies together in oil (with all the seasoning) - boiling and straining just seems like a hassle. Then I dumped the turkey, cream of chicken, some water, and flour into the mix, simmered a bit more, then baked it in the premade crusts. Wowza! Super simple, quick, and seriously delicious!"
