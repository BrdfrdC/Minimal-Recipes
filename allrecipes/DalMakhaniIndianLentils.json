"reviewBody": "Warning that \"chili powder\" should be the Indian red chili (hot or the mild kashmiri) not the average American chili powder which is a spice blend. I recommend substituting cayenne and/or paprika for the Indian chili powder. \"Bay leaves\" are different among different cultures. These should be tej patta (Indian Bay leaf) not the average American laurel leaves. Also saying \"Kasuri methi (fenugreek leaves) is almost impossible to find in the U.S., even in NYC\" is ignorant and lazy. If you can't get to an Indian grocery store, then order online. Tons of Indian restaurants and millions of Indian people need ingredients in the U.S. and don't have difficulty finding them, especially the NYC metro area."

I also took the lazy way out and used jarred spices (horrors!) but it was still amazing. I used a curry blend and graham masala blend to get cloves, coriander, cinnamon etc. and fried up onions + garlic instead of the raw spices in the butter. Skipped all oil. 2 cups of lentils and 4 tbsp butter, half a package (4 oz) of cream cheese added at the very end was just enough to give a creamy consistency."

I used real Indian chili powder from the Indian market (something like cayenne pepper rather than Western-style chili powder) and reduced the amount to 1 teaspoon (not 1 tablespoon of chili powder as stated in the recipe). I used coconut milk instead of cream (so yummy). Thank you SOGOLONDJATA for sharing your recipe."

I'm also giving it 4 stars because the recipe doesn't tell you to remove the cinnamon stick, cardamom pods or other whole spices. This was problematic when I took a giant bit of cinnamon stick. ?? More seasoned cooks would have remembered/known to do this, but the written reminder would make this a 5 star recipe. The flavors were SO rich and full. I'd also strongly recommend adding cream, or even milk if you can handle being less-than-authentic. Served over boiled potatoes and was sucked down by the whole family--picky 2 and 4 year olds included."

"reviewBody": "This was delicious! So flavorful! I tasted the beans before adding the spices to see if the dry kidney beans were soft yet and it was like taking a drink from the ocean! Had to pour the beans through a colander, put back in pot, and add water then continue. I should have read the comments haha, easy on that salt! Vegan butter worked like a charm. Throughly enjoyed this, thank you!"

"reviewBody": "My husband and I have made many different types of dal over the years, that were all great, but we will be making this dal makhani for now on. It's absolutely delicious!!! In fact my husband loved it so much he had leftover dal and brown rice for breakfast this morning, lol!\nI did make some minor changes to the recipe. Instead of 2 Tbsp salt, I only added 1 tsp of salt and it was plenty enough, I may consider adding even less the next time I make it. Also, in place of the butter and heavy cream, I used 2 Tbsp trans-fat free margarine and fat-free half and half. And lastly, SOGOLONDJATA is right, fenugreek leaves are close to impossible to find state side. I added 1 Tbsp fenugreek seeds in place of the leaves; the flavor is much more intense in the seeds, but they are much easier to find in an Indian spice market. \nBe sure to remove the bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon (I left it whole; its easier to fetch out) and black cardamom before eating, especially if your serving to children. Another thought ~ after toasting the spices, it would be fairly easy to wrap them in cheese cloth.\nThank you so very much for posting this recipe."

"reviewBody": "I also cut the salt - 2tsp works great. I have most of these spices in my cupboard, but I was missing a few - didn't matter. I also used ghee instead of butter, which is the magic answer for me. Get it at Indian grocers, Trader Joe's, or make some clarified butter yourself. It's worth it. Very rich and warm - and delicious with basmati rice. Note: I removed the bay leaves before eating."

"reviewBody": "Warning to anyone who wants to try this recipe: use 2 TEASPOONS salt - or even less and add as needed. The dish smelled and looked amazing and was absolutely delicious except for the extreme saltiness. Unfortunately, I couldn't fix the doubled recipe and decided to dump the entire thing out. Will definitely try again some time soon, with MUCH less salt - and will probably use kosher instead or regular salt. I had read the previous reviews and reduced the amount of salt but didn't realize by how much I should have reduced it by. I'm sure my next attempt will turn out great!!!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe was tried by my family during Phase 1 of South Beach. We did not use any of the optional ingredients and omitted the butter. We did add some butter flavor. We salt our meals at the table, so I cannot remember how much salt we added. This is authentic Indian food with the raw form of spices. Chew carefully to keep from biting a clove etc."

"reviewBody": "I have to agree with cengelberg, the recipe shown is far too salty. I made the recipe for 6 people and it called for 2 tablespoons of salt, but change that to 2 teaspoons and you'll be fine. I also used canned kidney beans instead of dry, so if you go my way be sure to drain the excess water after cooking the lentils and beans or you'll end up with dal makhani soup."

Tried to reduce salt by adding potatoes with minimal results. I would recommend at least halving the salt content and work up from there."
