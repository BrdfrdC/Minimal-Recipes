Homemade whipped topping is great, but it tends to liquefy quicker. https://www.errenskitchen.com/how-to-make-whipped-cream-that-holds-its-shape-for-days/ I am going to try to make for a Nursing Home strawberry recipe contest for the residents to judge. I may just try Cool Whip, though I do love homemade whipped cream!"

My favorite way to do it is to decorate the top all over with fresh strawberries and place a sprig of fresh mint in the middle. So yummy! I am seriously debating trying this with other fruits, like blueberries for instance. Will return to let you know how it works out!"
