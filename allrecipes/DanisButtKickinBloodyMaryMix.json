Everything else added was just right. We couldn't wait to let the mix meld for 8 hours in the fridge and still it was delicious. Next batch is in the fridge."

Don't forget the garnish of 2 olives and a stalk of celery and a strip of crispy bacon. Yum\nBTW. Freeze some of the mix and use it for ice cubes. It keeps the drink from watering down"

Just half the \"hot sauce\" and MAYBE the horse radish (depending on brand/type you use)... its easy to ADD this back in of you want it hotter, not so easy to take it out. Other than that great recipe, well done! Love the flavor better than any bar recipe I have had."

Last night I made a Bloody Mary using Sriracha vodka, garnished with celery, pickle, and teriyaki beef stick, and it was as good as any restaurant/bar Bloody Mary... BETTER even. I used Cholula's Chili Garlic Hot Sauce and Low Sodium V8. I used beef base (less than called for) last night, and tonight I just added a couple fl.oz. beef broth. Sweet Goodness, I'm dying over how good this is!"
