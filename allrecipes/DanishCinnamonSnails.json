The dough was nice and moist. I ended up adding approximately one additional cup of flour to the dough. Used my Kitchen Aid mixer, which may be part of the reason for that. Baked in a 9x13 pan. (Cut them to make 12 rolls.) Although I could have easily cut them smaller. Yes, I will make these again. Might just use my usual filling for cinnamon rolls next time. May also add slightly more cardamom, as the taste was not noticeable."

I wanted to try these for so long, and they are amazing. Next time I will double the filling and bake them in round pans instead of on cookie sheets so they don't flatten out too much and all the gooey yumminess stays in the pan. I drizzled a glaze of orange juice and powdered sugar over the top. Delicious. My daughter had fun using a thread to cut the rolls. These are definitely going to be one of our house specialties. I used just one package of regular yeast and they turned out fine."

Great taste and the cardamom was a nice twist. Will probably use this more often since the rising times are not as long and the snails puff just fine."

"reviewBody": "Mine didn't come out quite so pretty, since I had a bit of trouble layering the two sheets of dough. Perhaps next time I'll simply roll them each on their own to get prettier results. The taste was great! It was fun making them, and they made the kitchen smell divine. Thanks for sharing this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe is a keeper. The cardamom is there but subtle; there's not an overwhelming sweetness but a great balance of sweet combined with the softness of the breading/dough. \n\nUsing cake yeast is a bit expensive (first time I've purchased it) but well worth it; it makes the dough's texture distinct when biting into it. \n\nI've never bought a cinnamon roll/snail this good. Really."

"reviewBody": "Instead of making rolls for this recipe, I decided to save a little time by rolling out the dough, adding the filling inside, and then braiding the bread by cutting the sides of the dough a third of the way in on each side and alternately folding each side to the middle. I also drizzled an orange glaze over the top of the bread after it was done baking: 2 Tbls 1/2 &amp; 1/2, 2 Tbls orange juice, zest from 1 orange, and powdered sugar until desired consistency. The result is a blend of cardamom and orange heaven and a beautifully browned loaf that is sure to impress."

"reviewBody": "Don't shy away from cardamom!!!! it's your friend. Not many people know its in the ginger family, it's strong! and earthy, and slightly citrus in taste. That 1/2 tea. really make these pop! Make sure you butter and eggs are at room temperature. Forgot to take them out of the fridge? Just pop them on top of a pre-heating oven for 30 min. \n\nActive dry yeast works just great if you don't have cake yeast. Made this spur of the moment when I just wanted to bake something quick and easy. \nAlso: I will always substitute a light brown sugar for white granulated sugar in regards to dough . But thats just me."

Added sugar glaze when the rolls were cool. Next time will try spreading on the butter and sprinkle on the sugar and cinnamon."
