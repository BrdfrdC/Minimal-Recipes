Also, for those who are not sure of the bread to go with it, I used sour dough. The dish was a hit at home and at a house warming!"

Depending on my guests palettes, I may add chopped sautéed mushrooms, spinach, or even finely chopped ( NOT GROUND) walnuts. Like several others, I always finely chop my artichoke hearts first. Regardless of the additions, I am asked over and again to bring this dip to any gathering, and I always serve it with a crusty garlic rubbed baguette."

I did add cream cheese though like someone recommended (1/2cup). I did use red onions and I found it to add a really nice taste to this dip. I realized too late that I forgot to put the lemon juice in it but it didn't seem to be a problem. \nAlso I left the dip a little longer in the oven to give it a nice golden look. \n\nNext time maybe I will try adding some spinach. \n\nThanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "**Post Script: I notice that many people complain about a tart taste. I think that mine didn't have that problem because I rinsed the artichokes before adding them. That may be the trick.** I made this once about a year ago, and it was THE hit of a big, fancy party! Some people didn't even have a chance to try it. I didn't go exact on the measurements, sort of ended up doubling up the recipe--perhaps more extra parmesan than anything else. But you really can't go wrong with these ingrediants. The lemon seems to make a big difference. Oh, and I used light sour cream and light mayo. Highly recommended."

The flavor was great, but the texture was very off. I added a package of cream cheese, added 1/2 cup of shredded parmesan cheese and just a little bit of garlic. The texture of this dip reminded me of warmed up marshmellows. I will not be making this version again."

You can use fresh or powdered garlic, not too much so the it doesn't overpower. It's pretty salty, I didn't add salt. Might need to bake another 5-10 min. Check at 20 min.I only found 13&amp; 3/4 oz. If doubled put in a little less mayo and s. cream. I used quarted artichokes and chopped them just a little and mixed every thing at the same time. It's a keeper"
