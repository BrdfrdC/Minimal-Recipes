My son was not a fan of the cream cheese and suggested I could leave it out completely. When I said that they may be too dry, he said he would add a salsa or guacamole of his choice. Hey, it's worth trying, right? I doubled the recipe and had a ton left, which I rolled into tortillas and froze for future lunches."

I'll cut back to 1 oz next time - it goes further than I thought when melted.\n\n This will definitely go into my rotation. YUM!"

It is a very simple recipe to make, and FULL of flavour! We added rice for the kids because their little taste buds couldn’t handle it. This significantly reduced the flavour for them. Perfect for a family of 4 with some leftovers!"

"reviewBody": "I made this with a can of chicken breast, Rio Tel Diced Tomatoes and Green Chilis, as well as Bush's Black Bean Fiesta. In addition, my family likes a lot of garlic powder. I love herbs/spices so I added Italian Seasoning, Dill Weed, Cilantro, Chives, and Tumeric. I have a bottle mixture of Smoked Paprika with garlic, chilis, and something else (can't remember it right now). So all this had the nice spicy but not burn down your throat spicy. I also already had Walmart's brand of organic salsa which I just poured out of the bottle and fiesta five cheese and of course the black olives. This will be a good meal for my elderly mother and I for now on. It's also very easy to make and time saving when I get off work after working a 10 hour shift. I had left over which I took for my lunch the next day. Two co-workers really liked it and I told them about the recipe. I sent pictures and texted the recipe to my sister who plans on making this as well."

I usually add roasted tomatoes, cumin, chili powder, corn &amp; cheese (when assembling or melt on top) to the recipe, and swap out the jalapeño peppers with green chili peppers because 2 of my kids don't like spicy food. For those of us who like things a bit more spicey, we add salsa."

This recipe made 4-5 burritos (enough for 4 people). I also only used about 2 oz of cream cheese. It added a really nice creamy touch and we did not need to use sour cream with the burritos. I served it with Spanish Brown Rice from this website. Very good and will make it again."

I doubled the black beans, red bell pepper, used partially yellow onion &amp; partially green onions as I didnt have any jalapenos. I also used 1 can green chilies ( enough heat) about 1-1/2 tsp cumin, and about the same in salt - should've cut back the salt a little more. Used 2 cloves garlic and each serving we lined with Mexican shredded cheeese &amp; salsa before rolling. Everyone liked them. We used the soft taco size and each ate 2 - (4 of us)!! Served with homemade coleslaw - it was a good meal - definitely fix again."
