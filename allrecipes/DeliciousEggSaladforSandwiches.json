I grew up with using miracle whip instead of mayonnaise and there was always a bit of Celery for the little extra taste and crunch. So now that I'm a mother of 4 grown children and \"13\" Grandchildren and at the age of \"60\" üòä I feel blessed that I can keep this recipe going and that all the children LOVE it. So hats off to you and My Grandmother üòâüíúüíôüíú for this recipe. Keep up the great work posting your recipes. Oh and there was nothing else added to your recipe other than the mayo and Celery and the love I put into it üòÅ‚ù§"

"reviewBody": "To cook the eggs, I use a different method: First, I bring the water to a boil (with the eggs in it) then simmer for about 20 minutes. You can check when an egg is done by spinning it evenly on the kitchen counter top (away from the edge of course). If it spins freely, it is done. If it just rolls around, it is not. When the eggs are done, I immediately submerse all the eggs completely in cold water. This causes the outer shell to separate from the egg white for easy peeling and allows the hydrogen sulfide gasses to escape, which would otherwise cause a nasty looking green discoloration in the yolk. After the eggs have cooled, I drain the water, peel the eggs, and they are ready to use."

Also, I added a pinch of both garlic powder &amp; garlic salt and I added a little Tabasco sauce which added some great flavor. Try the Tabaco sauce on you egg sald sandwich and you'll likely add more to the egg salad bowl. Lastly, I added slices of avocado for some protein &amp; healthy fat."

My family isn't too crazy about a lot of mayo, so I started with 2 tablespoons my first time, then added a tablespoon at a time until I liked the consistency. Also, for those watching their sodium levels, I didn't add any and it still tasted great. I served this on toasted brioche bread. I've made this recipe twice now, and this time around, I tripled the ingredients of the recipe for those who asked for seconds. Thank you for posting and sharing !"

"reviewBody": "Superb. Since the best place to start improvising is with something that's perfect, I used this as a base recipe, and added my own little touches. I substituted chives for the green onion, simply because I have an abundance of it in my garden, and used curry powder in place of the paprika, because my family prefers it. Served on whole wheat bulkie rolls and a few fresh spinach leaves, this recipe was a hit with the fam!\n\nI will definitely make this again, with a few other improvs, like adding crumbled bacon to the mix, or putting a slice of smoked salmon in the sandwich, then piling the eggy goodness on top."
