"reviewBody": "This recipe is very similar to another baked ziti recipe that I make, but this one has the addition of the spinach, mushrooms and goat cheese. I only used about 3/4 container of the ricotta, which was plenty enough. I also just eye-balled the red sauce, until it looked like enough (probably a bit more than 14 oz, as my jar of marinara was 24 oz). A good, quick and easy weeknight meal. I divided it into two containers, so I could share with a neighbor."
