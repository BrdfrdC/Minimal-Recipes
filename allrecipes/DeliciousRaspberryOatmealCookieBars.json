"reviewBody": "These are so simple and were a hit with my son and friends (not to mention me!). I used lightly sweetened strawberry freezer jam (I made it when I had too many strawberries). We don't actually used jellies or jams normally so I was excited to make use of it. I'm actually making two more batches right now. This time I'm issuing my homemade apple sauce for one and the other will be my homemade cranberry sauce left over from the holidays. Both were in my freezer so I figured why not. I did make two alterations. I added some yummy Saigon cinnamon and I cut the butter in half and added avacado oil. I couldn't tell the difference. This time I'm going to use half coconut oil and half avocado oil. I wouldn't attempt the coconut oil if I didn't already know my family doesn't mind the slight flavor."

Today, I decided to use a jar of lingonberries that's been on my shelf for a long time. I've never tried it previously, so I tasted a little bit before using on the cookies. It was fabulous! A little tart and a bit more assertive in taste than the other jams. Definitely my favorite of all flavors I've tried. I'm told you can get it Ikea, although I think I bought it from Vitacost on a whim."

Using a pastry blender is the way. It was accidentally made with strawberry jam once and it was not the same. Another time I had someone make it for me and they used less jam and it was not as good. The recipe is a NO CHANGE!"

This recipe was, however, the perfect setting for the changes I made . I made my own raspberry pie filling and added a bit of cinnamon and crushed up pecans to the topping . Used a 1/2 sheet baking pan and voila, perfection! Thank you for sharing this recipe!"

My family eats dairy free and soy free for allergies and I subbed Kite Hill brand DF/SF butter for real butter and it worked perfectly. I will sub the raspberry filling for peach today. I use the organic variety from Trader Joes and read the ingredients carefully for mostly fruit not mostly sugar. The healthier ones are called \"spread\" not jam or preserves. I love simple recipes that are easy and kind of healthy too."

I added nutmeg, thinking I should add some vanilla extract next time or even almonds, there's so many possibilities for these. It's not as sweet as a chocolate chip cookie or anything so if you're looking for something especially sweet this probably isn't the recipe for you but that's what I like so much about it - the fact that it ISN'T overly sweet, as so many desserts are. My kids think they're getting a treat without being overloaded with sugar"
