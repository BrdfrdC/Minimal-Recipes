"reviewBody": "I have to admit that I was nervous to try this recipe b/c it really didn't seem like something that I would like, but my little guy asked if we could try it, so I said ok. The kids LOVED it and I thought it was good. Hubby liked it, but said it was 'weird', whatever that means, lol. I did omit the ground beef only b/c it's Friday during lent and we don't eat meat on these days. This was very easy to make and baked up and cut beautifully. I didn't use the whole 8oz. of spaghetti b/c it seemed to be too much for the dough. I would make this again for the kids! Thanks for sharing. :)"
