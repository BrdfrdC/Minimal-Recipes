"reviewBody": "I agree that it needs more 'devilish' ingredients. More mustard and cayenne or red pepper flakes or hot sauce. Also, I have recently discovered that steaming eggs is the best way to hard-cook them. I let the eggs sit out for an hour or more, or I put the eggs into warm water to take the chill off. Then I steam them for 12-13 minutes immediately put them into cold water for a few minutes."

"reviewBody": "This was DELICIOUS! In researching egg salads in general, one hint I can pass along is to use eggs close to the expiration date (so buy them well ahead of time) because \"fresh\" eggs are harder to peel. I'm not saying to use spoiled eggs! Just make sure they sink to the bottom when you put them in the water. Bad eggs will float to the top. Good eggs will sink to the bottom of the pot."
