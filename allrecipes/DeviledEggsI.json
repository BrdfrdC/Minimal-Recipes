I'll try using vinegar to help with the creaminess next time."

Are the eggs to boil for 10 to 15 minutes or is the water cold when you start and then bring to a boil? Total time 10 to 15 minutes. Do I shell the eggs or cut the eggs with the shells on? One more thing as per recipes instructions say to place mixture back into the SHELL of the egg! I have tryed I can't cut the egg shell in half without destroying it and the thought of eating the shell is not very pleasant."

And, then I sprinkle the paprika on top for color with a very light dusting on each egg. It is not an actual measurement. I do not put any in the actual mashed yolks though. The ingredients really are simple, but this is the classic method in my opinion. I would just adjust all the ingredients to taste. Deviled eggs are not an exact science. And, a little salt wouldn't hurt."

"reviewBody": "I was looking for a basic recipe that I could tweak and this is it! I found the best way to hard boil eggs (as another reviewer suggested) is to cover eggs with water and bring to a boil on high heat. Once the water is boiling, cover the eggs and turn the burner to simmer. Cook for 15 minutes. Generously adding salt to the water in the beginning makes them easier to peel. I used miracle whip, regular mustard, salt &amp; pepper, and a dollop of sweet pickle relish. Also used paprika as a garnish rather than in the recipe."

I did a few of my own tweaks -- I added a little bit more mayo than asked, I sprinkled paprika over them at the end instead of in the middle, put a dash of pepper and a splash of white vinegar as well. Topped it all off with a sliced olive..Came out great, I put the mixture in a ziploc back and cut the tip off and it was so easy to fill the halves. Definately a hit, will be making them again. My husband is not a fan of deviled eggs but he wolfed these down. Thanks for a great recipe!"

Regarding the review above; the tint of the yolk mixture doesn't matter so much if you sprinkle more paprika over the eggs when finished, like the picture above."

I used all the 'suggestions' including using ice water to cool them more quickly AND added the tsp of vinegar to give it a little \"kick\". They were a huge hit but the best suggestion was to put the filling in the sandwich bag and squeeze it into the halves...I know it seems simple but to a beginner like me, it saved me a HUGE mess! I also impressed my guests with such a great idea! Also, I didn't follow the instructions by measurement, I did all ingredients by taste. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I personally like mine with a little spicy kick - I guess horseradish is where I would have gotten that but didn't have any on hand. They really did turn out terrific, made 36 deviled egg halves, all were devoured within 30 mins... I'd say they were a hit!"

So I cut it (literally) and added a bit of sweet pickle juice from gherkin jar and a dab of honey. People raved at the company potluck and all wanted recipe (even though there were 4 other deviled egg bringers). I wish I knew the exact measure of ingredients, but I just \"winged it\", LOL! I told them it was a family secret, hehe. Doubt I could ever reproduce the exact taste."

I dont think he's ever told me that so they must have been.
