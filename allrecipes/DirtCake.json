I did that and it didn’t thicken. All was not lost. The cool whip seemed to rise to the top, so I used that in the cake. I had some extra pudding mixes and made them with 25% less milk than required, then combined that with a block of cream cheese that I whipped with 1/4 c of milk. It turned out well. Since he’s 21 and no longer obsessed with gummy worms I used OMG’s in the layers and on top. YUM! Also, 1 family pack of Oreos was plenty for my needs."

I did not add butter i don't see the reason it doesn't add anything to it. With the pudding mix i add one vanilla and one chocolate. My family thinks it tastes better that way and we have tried with just vanilla and just chocolate. I think adding one of each taste better."

"reviewBody": "I made this for a friend of mine who said she had never heard of dirt cake or tried it. \n\nI didn’t care for this recipe because it wasn’t really specific. For instance, the 32oz of sandwich cookies. Does that mean I need to buy 2 packages of the double stuf Oreos since 1 family pack is only 22.4oz? Also, I was always taught that if you’re going to add a whipped topping, that is your last step before putting it together so you don’t lose the fluffiness when you fold it in. Meaning you would have to add the cream cheese mixture to the pudding, mix it well, then fold in the cool whip. Also, it doesn’t look talk about all the substitutions you could do with this recipe. I made mine with sugar free chocolate fudge and cheesecake pudding mixes, with skim milk. Making one layer white and the other layer brown. And I simply just split the cream cheese mixture and cool whip in half for each pudding. I also just used 1 package of the double stuf Oreos, the majority I crushed in the food processor, but left 7-8 which I hand chopped on a cutting board to make it look like potting soil. It came out tasting great."

Way too rich, way too fatty, way too sweet. Please, do your internal organs a favor and don't make this recipe. The same idea can be executed without making the creamy layers so fatty. The kids just want the gummy worms anyways."

I didn't have any cream cheese on hand so I used vanilla pudding on it's own. I added 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the crushed cream filled cookies, which made it even more delicious!! Then, I added crumbled pieces of angel food cake to crumbled chocolate fudge (Made with a box cake mix.) cake so the mix would look more like potting soil. I added coconut flakes colored with green food coloring on top to look like grass and sprinkled chopped walnuts on top to look like rocks. My daughter loved it for her 10th birthday!!"

I used my nutribullet to process them and if I didn’t remove the filling the cookies would stick together and not crumble. \n2. The sugar is not necessary the pudding and cool whip is really sweet already. \n3. Buy INSTANT pudding and make that first before mixing other ingredients. \n4. Thaw out cool whip and cream cheese. I put them both in hot water containers to thaw out I used my mixer to mix all ingredients together. \n5. I didn’t use butter and followed the other users tip by adding 2Tbs of milk to substitute and I didn’t miss it. \n6. I used green food coloring and shredded coconut to make grass."

You can use tin foil to line the pot or in this case I use a Crockpot Liner. To keep it from sliding I lined the edge up around the pot so it would overhang too much and a few strips of two sided sticking tape. You can get a beach shovel, a plastic flower, and gummy worms from the dollar store, I stuck the flower in between the liner and the pot so it could stay in place during the serving of it. Big winner and will make again."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe. I took some advice from previous reviews and made just a few changes. \nI let the cream cheese sit out to soften a bit and then mixed the milk in really well with a handheld mixer. I then added the 2-boxes of instant pudding and mixed again. I set that aside and worked on the whip cream. \nI’m not a fan of cool whip so I put a tablespoon of powdered sugar into 16-oz heavy whipping cream and mixed that until stiff. I then folded the pudding/cream cheese/ milk combo into the heavy whipping cream and let that hang out in the fridge until we I had the Oreos ready to go. \nI used regular Oreos vs double stuff so I’d get more of a dirt effect. I did the food processor method and then layered as suggested and placed gummy worms intermittently. We have a flower pot we use each time we make this and finish it off with fake flowers saved for this too."

Instead of store bought \"READY WHIP\" I used homemade, hand whipped, heavy whipping cream *I found the recipie at allrecipes.com. I split this whipped cream between both a milk chocolate, and a dark chocolate pudding. I also split the cream cheese and butter mixture between the two pudding flavors. This added a few extra steps but well worth the effort for real whipped cream and the effect of layering the two chocolates. This is all I changed otherwise I followed the directions indicated in this recipe. \nI Garnished it with sour gummie worms and a pretty purple silk flower.\nIt was a hit and everyone requested i make it again soon"

"reviewBody": "Upon careful consideration of the comments , and after struggling to understand why this recipe \"needs\" butter...I took a chance and omitted the butter completely. Reason being, the cream cheese was already adding fat and smoothness, not to mention the fat from the milk? I also was concerned that it might be, not just sweet, but too sweet because I' m kind of sensitive to that. But cream cheese by itself is NOT sweet. So I added 1/4 c of powdered sugar rather than the full amount. I used Truwhip (no hydrogenation, natural ingedients) instead of CoolWhip but I believe the sweetness is the same?The end result was a little sweet-without the cookie crumbs, so I knew WITH the cookie crumbs it was going to taste great. And it did! Thanks!"

I mixed chocolate and French vanilla for a more \"muddy\" look that also tastes better than plain vanilla. As for the amount of cookies, I probably could have used more, though this could be due to one or both of the following: 1) the batter was too rich so thicker layers of cookie crumbs would have served to break up the lard consistency of the batter. 2) I manually crushed the Oreos, so they may not have been as fine as they would be had I used a food professor."

"reviewBody": "We tweaked it a bit and eliminated the butter. It is always a huge hit. A couple of tips: Add a half teaspoon of mint extract, mint oreos and some green food coloring for a great mint dirt cake. (about 60 drops of green food coloring = the color of the mint oreo filling. Still experimenting and haven't converted that to a measurement yet.) Another tip is don't use anything fat free. I tried it with fat free cream cheese and it did not set up. The silver lining, though, was that in the freezer it froze to about the consistency of a low fat ice cream cake. My wife said, for a summer treat, this might actually be better than a traditional dirt cake! Oh well, back to the lab (kitchen) for more experiments!"

Why add those extra calories when it tastes great without it? I used one package of oreos (14 oz.) and that was plenty. Also, I think the recipe should only call for an 8 oz. tub of cool whip; I used 12 oz. and it made way too much pudding mixture. I couldn't fit it all in the pot.
