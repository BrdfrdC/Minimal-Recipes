"reviewBody": "Well I'm not a bartender like many of the reviewers are but I do drink my share of....well, everything!! I like a great dirty martini from time to time and almost always get them when I'm out at a restaurant. I decided to try one at home but checked online first to see what people had to say about making them. After several searches, this recipe seemed to be the best to me. I made it as stated in the recipe. After reading the reviews I opted to use the brine from my favorite olives since I'm addicted to them versus using the brine from quality olive jars. I use Goya brand olives with minced anchovies in a can from my local store. I like the saltiness and there is NO fishiness with these olives. The brine makes a fantastic mixer for this recipe. It may be because I'm now on round two but this is probably the smoothest dirty martini i've ever had. It is very important to use a high quality vodka and vermouth!! I do use a piece of cooked bacon as my swizzle stick (see photos) to increase the interest in this drink but I'm not sure that's necessary. The next time I make this, which will probably be over the weekend, I will be sure to get blue cheese stuffed olives with the bacon swizzle stick and the Goya brine. Happy sipping!!!!"

"reviewBody": "Whoa, 6 ounces of vodka. Where do you find a glass that big? I have what I thought was a big martini glass, and it only holds 4 ounces. I love vodka martinis and have made them with many kinds of vodka and many kinds of olives. If you want a simple, but potent, vodka martini, stick a bottle of Belvedere in the freezer for at least a couple of hours, or if you're on a budget use Stolichnaya (Stoli) - yes, I know Stoli isn't cheap. When you put the vodka in the freezer, stick a couple of martini glasses in there as well. To make the martini, place a few Manzanilla olives on a skewer in the frozen glass, add about a 1/2 teaspoon of olive juice, and fill the glass with the vodka from the freezer. It goes without saying, you need to like vodka to enjoy this drink, but if you do - this is one sweet way to drink it. BTW, since there is no ice to melt and water down the vodka, a couple of these goes along way. Before everyone says, why not just fill a glass with vodka and drink it? Well, that would make it a vodka shot, which is also good!"

"reviewBody": "This is my favorite mixed drink, but I recommend that people try a wet gin version (4 oz gin, 2 oz vermouth) instead of a vodka martini. IMHO, vermouth doesn't pair well with vodka, which is why the \"vodka martini\" gets closer to a glass ov vodka every year, but vermouth tastes great with gin."

I used a shot glass and a half of dirty sue martini mix (in substitute of the olive juice), I used a cold martini glass, coated the glass with dry vermouth, combined the dirty sue and 6 ounzes of vodka ( I prefer Kettle One or Grey Goose for martinis) in a cocktail shaker with ice then poured it into the coated cold martini glass along with 3 big stuffed olives! Delicious and very potent!"

"reviewBody": "I'd never had a \"dirty\" martini until this past week and really enjoyed it..so much so, I went looking for this recipe on-line and this is great! To the \"seasoned bartender\" who gave the advice about coating the glass with the vermouth and discarding excess -- thank you!! While the vermouth does lend a definite layer of flavour,I have had other martinis where the vermouth was just too overpowering (and am actually never sure what a \"dash\" constitutes in ANY recipe!) Wonderful tip! As for the olive brine debate, I think if you use the brine from olives you enjoy for yourself and are pleased to set out for company on a tray -- that's perfectly fine -- it's all about personal tastebuds, right? The described portion was a bit much for me so I halved it -- but this will definitely become a regular before-Sunday-night-dinner-drink (as I relax in-between cooking and serving Sunday night dinner! LOL)"

However, this past weekend I went to a Martini Bar where they had a \"dirty kick Martini\". The kick was two drops of Tabasco! It was just enough of a kick to make you notice the tang. Give it a try!

We kicked it up a notch making the Dirty Gunslinger by using Gunslinger Olives and brine (Jalepeno stuffed Olives)...makes for a wonderful, possibly too wonderful, martini."

For you sissies that say it may be too hot, give it a try, it's not as hot as you may think but gives a nice little bite and a kick of flavor. And you can always yank the jalapenos from the olives too."

"reviewBody": "a few pointers from a seasoned bartender: most bottled olive brine has a strange artificial taste. i recommend using straight olive juice from a jar of quality olives. the difference between a top shelf vodka or gin and a low end is enormous when drinking a martini. save the cheap stuff for mixed drinks! start with a chilled martini glass, pepto it with vermouth, pour out excess, and mix your liquor and olive juice in a cocktail shaker of ice until ice forms on the outside. strain, garnish, and enjoy. the perfect martin!"
