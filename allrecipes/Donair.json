"reviewBody": "This is a great recipe! The sauce had too much vinegar for my preference. Add a little vinegar at a time, to taste. I used 80/20 ground beef and it only took 1 hour to bake. I cooled the meatloaf 1 hour, then chilled it in the freezer for an hour or so. It was easy to get thin slices with a large sharp chef's knife. I sauteed the sliced meat on a large pancake griddle. The fat content of the beef made it cook up like bacon. I normally would not buy 80/20 beef but it worked great in this recipe since you can drain most of the fat when it comes out of the oven. Thank you for sharing this recipe."

"reviewBody": "My husband lived near Hallifax for 10 years and introduced me to Donair when we were visiting friends. This recipe is GREAT, but does need oregano, as noted by other reviewers. One note on the preparation of the meat: in order to get the firm consistency needed, I mix everything together, then pick up the whole ball of meat and kind of throw it down into the bowl repeatedly until it becomes very dense and all the fibers of the meat are sort of squished together. Otherwise, the finished loaf will be crumbly and won't really resemble donair meat."

"reviewBody": "Wow - something totally new, but yet similar to a gyro. We loved this recipe. I made the meat portion of this recipe using 3/4 a pound of ground beef - and added 1/2 t. oregano &amp; 1/2 t. Italian seasoning. I also opted to use the cayenne pepper. I mix the meat by hand for about 5 minutes to really have the spices mixed in and to have the meat form without falling apart. Since I used a lot less meat, I formed into a rectangle and baked at 300Â° for 45 minutes in a toaster oven. Once the meat cooled I refrigerated it all day. I then proceeded with the recipe in the evening. I purchased homemade pitas from our favorite Greek restaurant to serve this on. I made 'Maritime Donair Sauce' from AR for the topping. My family loved the taste of this meat and this meal. It was so simple to make and I like that you need to make it ahead of time so that the meat will slice in thin pieces. We topped with fresh tomatoes, fresh onion slices and grilled onions. DS also topped his with some feta cheese and thin slices of lettuce. 'Cranberry Coleslaw' from AR was our side dish tonight. Thanks, SABMAN for sharing your recipe. I cannot wait to make this again for my entire family. I know they are all going to love it!"

"reviewBody": "Alternate sauce recipe: Use a can of sweetened condensed milk, grate 1-2 cloves of garlic into a fine paste and wisk it in. Add 1/4 C of white vinegar and wisk it quickly, but not too much (10-12 strokes is perfect). let it set in the fridge for 10-15 minutes, and voila... Donair sauce that you can literally stand a spoon in. This sauce keeps longer than the standard, and will not separate like the regular sauce. Enjoy!! A very important step in the meat prep is to run it through a food processor or grinder three times. This makes a more homogeneous loaf, that's easier to slice. More pepper is a good idea as well (up to twice as much.)"

"reviewBody": "Good Recipe. As someone who has grown up in Halifax, enjoying this amazing treat, I agree that it needs a little oregano. It is a strong herb, but gives you that authentic taste. The only suggestion I want to make is about the sauce. If you are like me, you don't want to wait for the sauce, or when I order out, they never give you enough. Instead of the evap. milk and sugar, use a can of sweetened condensed milk. Add the 1/3 cup of vinegar, and a pinch of garlic powder. Whisk it all together and put in the fridge until ready to eat. DO NOT skip the step of browning the meat in a skillet, it adds so much to the overal taste. If you've never had this before, try it, it will become a family favourite."

The sauce seems particularly odd to me, the taste just didn't sit well with me and I tried everything to make it taste better! I think plain yogurt or taziki would be better. The meat needs alot more spice and herbs. However, this recipe gave me the new idea to make my own 'lunch meat' with homemade meatloaf that I can freeze in individual slices, Thanks!"

This recipe is good, but try this for improvement; for the meat add a teaspoon of oregano, for the sauce use 2 tablespoons of vinegar and also add 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder. Don't use a jar...add the vinegar last and quickly and don't stir too much, this will make it thicker.\r\nNo this is not pizza corner, but my is it a good fix :)"

I'll keep trying though because you can't beat a great donair!"
