Paired it with a great Zin (Marietta Roman 2016) that ended up perfect together!! We did add a splash of cinnamon post-cooking because it needed some depth. Next time we will add to the cooking portion. I also used only 1/2 c of butter vs. 1 c due to dietary reasons but not sure that wouldve given the depth or richness we needed. LOVE THIS RECIPE! Thank you so much!"

"reviewBody": "Amazing! Seriously so so good. I used 1/2 cup of berbere because it was all I had, and it was plenty spicy. I also used chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts. I did have to simmer the sauce for about 55 rather than 45 minutes, as it didn’t reduce that quickly. Also, there was some oil separation on top that I spooned off. Made the dish with some rice because I’m not quite expert enough to try cooking injera. maybe next time!"

"reviewBody": "This was amazing! Came out tasting just like the Ethiopian restaurant we love. I used chicken thighs, doubled the recipe but used half the butter - so a quarter of the butter it called for. I found Berbere on amazon and glad I read the reviews because I only used two tablespoons (in a double batch) and it was the perfect amount of spicy. Also glad someone recommended patience with the cooking. I simmered first 1.5 hours and it was worth it. Also, I made this a day in advance and it really made it wonderful letting the flavors blend and improve overnight (in the fridge, of course). I served with cilantro and some authentic injira I bought from an Ethiopian market. Perfection!"

"reviewBody": "Holy cow. I love spicy food and couldn’t eat this even after adding a pint of sour cream and adding noodles!!! Flavor is awesome though. I, too, am guessing that the amount of Berbere is WAY off or that there’s a lot of difference between brands. I suggest you make the recipe and add this spice last. Start with a tablespoon and move up until you get it the way you like. I used 2/3 cup and that was definitely too much. I’m glad I did a trial run before my party. I’m still going to make this but using my suggestion to add the Berbere last, little by little."

I subbed 1 cup chicken broth for the water and only used 1 stick of butter. That seems to be enough. I've never had Ethiopian food except for what I've made off of All Recipes. I got the berbere spice off of Amazon. Thank You! Will definitely make again!"

"reviewBody": "I absolutely love Ethiopian food - so much so I was nervous about making it because I didn't want to muck it up. This recipe did not disappoint! My only change was using fresh chopped tomatoes rather than the paste. I had to let it simmer a bit longer before and after adding the chicken to get the consistency I wanted but it was so worth it. They key here is patience, let things just barely simmer slowly and taste as you go. I made it with the recommended cabbage/potato dish (also posted by the user Twin Cities) and enjoyed with injera. Everyone went back for seconds and mopped up the sauce with the bread. Thanks for posting - I'm adding this to my \"show-off\" recipe box for sure! Of note: I've seen this served with a lightly dressed green salad or collard greens if you want to simplify the side dish."
