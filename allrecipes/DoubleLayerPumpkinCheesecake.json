I also add lots more cinnamon cloves and nutmeg as I found the first time I made it, the flavor was lacking. I don't measure the spices, but I guesstimate is is about 3x's the amount listed in the recipe. I also refrigerate overnight to let the flavors meld together. Top with some whipped cream and you are ready to go!"

"reviewBody": "I first made this for my husband's birthday two years ago and he loved it so much that I make it every year for his birthday. He can't have much sugar so I sub it here for stevia packets, each packet replaces 2 tsp of sugar. We don't like super sweet so 8 packets are enough. Also, I used a couple good shakes of pumpkin pie spice in place of the separate spices. I used neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese to reduce the fat. Remember to leave it out to reach room temperature because I didn't recently and the mixture was not pourable. Next time I might try whipped cream cheese or whip the cream cheese longer because I prefer a not-so-dense cheesecake."

The filling literally tastes like I took a spoon and ate straight out of the cream cheese chunk wrapped in foil. Which would be fine if I wanted to just eat a chuck of cream cheese. I can hardly taste the pumpkin at all. So grab some cinnamon grahams and a spoon. Use them to dip cream cheese straight out of the foil and there you have it. Way cheaper and tastes the same."

The pumpkin flavor is barely noticeable (which, honestly, is a win in my book! Haha), but I definitely think it could use a little more cinnamon and cloves.\nI'll definitely be coming back to this recipe year after year."

I made my own real whip cream to put on top. Yum!"

If you love spices, you might want to increase the amount of spices, but it also tastes amazing just the way it is. I will definitely make this recipe again!"

The changes that I've made to it are: doubling the recipe so I can use a whole can of pumpkin, instead of a regular graham cracker crust, I use 2 pre-made chocolate graham cracker crusts (this goes so well together, I'll never use a regular graham cracker crust with this recipe again!), adding extra vanilla, extra spices, and pumpkin pie spice as well. I add the spices to the cream cheese before dividing it for the two layers so each layer has some spices in it. I also substitute monk fruit sugar which tastes just like real sugar and even bakes the same, just zero calories. So good!"

It seemed like it set pretty well but when I went to serve it, it wasn’t very solid under the skin even after being chilled for 2 days. I would’ve liked it to be more solid rather than semisolid. A cold can of frosting has more density."

I have skipped the cloves and whipped cream both times I made the recipe ( I didn't have cloves on hand and the cheesecake is sweet enough without the whipped cream). After adding the 1/2 cup pumpkin and mixing it in, I will toss in a few small spoonfulls of pumpkin and it is amazing!\nIt is so creamy, just rich enough and is the perfect fall flavor. Highly recommend waiting for this beaut overnight- worth the wait!"
