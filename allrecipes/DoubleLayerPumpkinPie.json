The only change I make is to add a smidge more spices than the recipe calls for. Note: The filling is enough to actually to fill a Keebler Extra Serving pie crust. Also, the pumpkin cream layer can be made a day in advance in order to allow the flavors some time to meld."

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe and the flavor is fabulous. I changed only one thing- I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned. So if you plan on doing the same, there's one thing you need to know. Fresh pumpkin has much more liquid in it than canned. Which will make the second layer of this pie not firm up. You'll have pumpkin soup instead of pie. So it's easy enough to buy a couple slightly larger boxes of instant pudding. Opt for the 5 ounce size instead of the 3 ounce one."

This time I did not add 1 1/2 cups of whipped topping to the cream cheese mixture. Instead I only mixed the cream cheese, sugar, and milk together, placed it in the crust, and spread a thin layer of whipped topping over that. I put that in the freezer for a few hours, then mixed the pumpkin with the remaining ingredients and spread it over all. I refrigerated that until time to eat, and then added the whipped topping on the individual slices. It worked much better this way."

"reviewBody": "I have made this pie for 15+ years. I don't even remember where I found the recipe. I found that taking the time to make my own whipped cream, instead of using Cool Whip or other prepared cream, makes it the best. I've never had a problem with the layers mixing - the worst that happens is that sometimes the milk is TOO cold and it makes it hard to whisk the lumps out of the pudding. Also don't cut corners on softening the cream cheese, and whipped cream cheese won't work."

I sprinkled some chopped pecans with cinnamon &amp; sugar and toasted them in the oven for 15 min at 325, then sprinkled some on top of crust before adding cream cheese layer. Then I chilled that for 30 min before adding pumpkin layer, and sprinkled more pecans on top. Refrigerated overnight and it was totally awesome!!"

Chilled the store bought crust, then put the first layer in then put the pie in the freezer while fixing the second layer. The second layer I started with half of the pumpkin and half and half - not milk, then played to get a good texture.... ended up with 3/4 can pumpkin, the 2 packages of vanilla pudding, 1 tsp vanilla, a 1/2 to 2/3 cup of half and half, 2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2-3/4 tsp nutmeg, plus a couple of globs of whipped cream topping. This made a nice spreadable but thick layer with a spicy pumpkin taste. Brought it to the office, told folks it was in the fridge, and I have been stopped repeatedly with compliments. I have been told I have to make it again for Christmas... :) Not really cheesecake, not pudding, I called it pumpkin cream pie."

My husband loves it and I am sure I will be making it again. The fact that is is a no bake pie and can be made in advance with no worries, even better. I did bake the crust for 8 minutes just to firm it up. I have had them crumble and fall apart in the past."

Great tips on here in the reviews....my tip is that I use \"french Vanilla\" flavored pudding, adds a little extra yumminess to it &amp; I also always get the graham cracker crust that says \"2 extra servings\", it gives the pie fillings a little extra room to settle into! I also add a little nutmeg to the spices, but shhh, don't tell anyone!!;)"

"reviewBody": "Have been using this recipe for many, many years! Agree that once the cream cheese and whipping cream base is mixed that you refrigerate it for at least an hour prior to adding the pumpkin layer. Also will add -- 3.25% homogenized milk and 1 3/4 cups of pumpkin filling works well in this recipe which will give you more than enough if using a pre-made 9\" graham cracker pie shell. As you will have excess filling left over use it to make at least ten to twelve small pastry tarts. \nTarts: Bake first and let cool. As you will need extra cream cheese filling; cut ingredients in half and prepare the same way as you did for the pie. Line baked tarts with the mixture and refrigerate. Add excess pumpkin layer on top. Refrigerate as well until use."

I used sweat potatoe pie filling instead of pumpkin. By using sweat potatoe pie filling I didn't need to add the rest of the spices because it was already in there. Instead of boring old graham crackers for the crust I used a whole pack of sandies cookies ( shortbread) and crushed it then added half stick of butter and firmly pressed it on a 9x13 pan. I will be making this again!"

I used 1 tbsp of chilled evaporated milk in addition to the 1 tbsp of half and half (instead of the called for milk) in the bottom layer to make it more solid. I also substituted half and half for the called for regular milk in the top pumpkin layer. Next time I'll probably use a little evaporated milk in the top layer, too, to make it a bit more dense. I also made my own graham cracker crust - which I think is much tastier than the store bought. This pie will be a new favorite at holiday dinners... we loved it!!"

I think I will try reducing the milk to 3/4 cup so it sets firmer. I also took the 4 oz of cream cheese and beat it together with 1/2 C confect sugar then in another bowl I beat 1/2 cup heavy cream to a whipped cream consistency. Then folded that into the cream cheese mixture . spread it into the pie shell and chilled it first before adding the pumpkin filling mixture."

Put 3/4 cup cold evaporated milk. and 1 and 2/3 packages of vanilla pudding mix. Then mix it together until smooth. Then put 3/4 of the 15 oz can of pumpkin in it(not cup the can). Put 1/4-1/2 t pumpkin pie spice. and 1/4-1/2 t cinnamon. Do this and your pie will be perfect. Not runny or too sweet, not too much filling and will taste pretty much like pumpkin pie. For the rest of the pudding mix and canned pumpkin you probably could make a mouse out of it but haven't tried it. Just saying."

Besides that mistake, the only thing I did differently was making my own graham cracker crust because it's so easy (you just melt some butter, mix it with graham cracker crumbs, and bake for a few minutes), and I find that most of the premade crusts taste like cardboard."

Instead of mixing the milk, pudding, pumpkin and spices together all at once my version calls for mixing the milk and pudding together first. Beat with wire wisk for 2 minutes. Then let it stand for 3 minutes. Now add the pumkin and spices, mixing well. I've never had a problem with my pie being runny as some other reviewers complained about. Changing this step may solve that problem."
