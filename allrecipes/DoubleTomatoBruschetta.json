Mmmmm...\nI tried a reduced amount of olive oil, but then had to drain it out. Since sun-dried tomatoes are packed in oil, why add more? I added some oregano and small amount of Italian seasoning, plus I increased garlic to about 4-5 cloves. \nGreat recipe! Thanks."

Make sure to use a good quality balsamic vinegar and EVOO and also I would avoid “spooning on” any liquid as it will cook out of the tomatoes and there will be plenty without doing that. I used fresh SLICED MOZZARELLA and it was heavenly - no cheese slippage and held everything together. The slices were approximately 1/8 - 1/4 inches thick. \n\nAlso, it seems a lot of people are having trouble finding sun dried tomatoes in oil. They’re usually located in the PRODUCE SECTION of the grocery store near the tomatoes. ;)\n\nENJOY!!!"

When we have leftovers, I toss it with pasta and add some cheese on top for a light pasta dinner."

It was almost all gone before I got to put the cheese it ( I didn’t have mozzarella so I used fresh parmigiana). I took the advise of others and doubled the garlic and a little less olive oil. I also rubbed the bread with some garlic before toasting it in the oven which gives it a little something extra. I will be making this again because it’s already gone. Thanks for the great recipe!"

Luck was on my side as everyone thought it was very good. Maybe next time I will get it right or sprinkle a little of the Parmesan sugar mix on after it has been in the oven 3 minutes."

Now I always use the Campari. Be sure to deseed the tomatoes, otherwise there will too much moisture (and will be a little bitter). After many trials, we now brush the sides of the bread with garlic infused olive oil before broiling, then melt the cheese on one side. This keeps the bread crisp, and the cheese acts as a barrier for the bruschetta. Always use fresh basil, it just isn't the same without it."

I made a double batch and like another reviewer I toasted the bread separately and guests put the tomato mixture on the bread as a topping. It's easier that way."

The garlic brought it up a notch from others I have tried, but I do not understand the mozzarella instead of fresh parm. I always use fresh parm and fresh basil (the SO thinks I am becoming a food snob...lol) in bruschetta."

I would not suggest 6x the garlic but would definitely recommend doubling the garlic if your family loves garlic as much as mine does. Second time I made it I also put in more garlic, and used a multigrain baguette - YUM!"

I like to add a bit of fresh oregano with it. It also helps to brush the bread with a bit of olive oil before broiling. I find it takes a tad longer than 1-2 minutes. You want to be sure the bread is golden crispy before putting the tomato on. I've made this several times. It's a perfect appetizer."

In the future,I may fancy-up the bread a little (broil both sides, brush with evoo/garlic) but it was so good as written. If you don't already use parchment paper, run out and buy some. It will improve your life (cleanup) tremendously, including while broiling this recipe."
