We're making a second batch today and I've cut back on the cider and will keep an eye on it for the first hour or so. We were very pleased with this recipe and agree with many of the reviewers that homemade is so much tastier than commercially processed! We plan on freezing a few containers out of today's batch. Thank you for posting this recipe."

"reviewBody": "This tastes soooo good that I'm NEVER buying store bought applesauce ever again! I had made some apple cider with ground cloves, brown sugar, cinnamon sticks, and Orange peels that had simmered in my crock pot for 48 hrs prior to making this recipe. I saved about a cup and half of the cider &amp; from there, I sliced up 8 medium honey crisp apples then just added them to my crock pot. Cooked on low for 4.5 hours. Then \"keep warm\" for 5 hours. I let the apples just sit there so the juices could meld &amp; omg, u gotta try it this way! One bite tastes like the perfect fall pick me up. I drained my apples &amp; whisked them with a little more brown sugar (to taste). I like a chunky style but this could be whisked to a smoother consistency. If you like sweet applesauce, use honey crisp apples for this recipe. You will not regret this!!"

"reviewBody": "I loved this applesauce and I made 3 crockpots full with the apples I had. Went to my local farm and asked if they had \"seconds\" of their apples from their orchard. They came back with a huge bag of \"seconds\" which were just slightly bruised or just not pretty enough to sell. I tell you I had at least 40-50 apples of quite a few varieties and there was nothing wrong with them....AND the best part is that is was only $10 for the bag! I did reduce the brown sugar to 1/4c and the cider to 3/4 c. I did jar and process the applesauce as I wanted to keep it in my pantry and gift it to others. Thank you for an awesome recipe as I have never used brown sugar and cider before in applesauce. Way better than white sugar and water. Thanks!"

I did not have apple cider (wrong season-Spring). I used Macintosh apples, brown sugar, a dash of nutmeg, and an ingredient I forgot I had. Cane syrup. That really stepped up the flavor a notch! I read in one of the other reviews that someone used an immersion blender. i used that and it worked wonderfully!! My grandmother's applesauce was always pink, so I did not peel the apples. Love this basic recipe!"

I use a little less lemon juice than called for. This is THE recipe for us. \nI simply quarter the apples (no peeling or coring), cook till soft (takes longer than 20 min.), cool in fridge, then send through food strainer/food mill. Yum!"

So far I filled up a big crock pot 3 times and plan to make more. THIS IS THE BEST APPLE SAUCE I EVER TASTED. USE WHATEVER SPICES SUIT YOUR TASTE."

I also cut the sugar by using a couple of tablespoons of honey, and just a tablespoon of brown sugar. Even with this change it was still nice and sweet. Next time no need for the brown sugar at all. Good sauce!"

So other than using apple juice in place of cider and leaving out the sugar entirely, I made this as written using Gala apples. FAN-FREAKIN-TASTIC applesauce. I also made a plain batch w/o cinnamon but with the apple/lemon juice and it's just as good. Great recipe - you won't be disappointed."
