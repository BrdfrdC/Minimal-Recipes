However, I do clean again for myself. Remember it is not who cooked them, but rather who cleaned them. Recipe is good, I do add a large potato which cuts down on the smell considerably. Cooking in a quick pot also cut down on the smell."

The only change I made was to just smash garlic cloves and quarter the onion so that I had the flavor but didn't have those small bits to contend with. I also made sure to THOROUGHLY clean, rinse and repeat until the water was clear. The smell (and you know that smell) was significantly lessened. While I don't eat chitterlings more that a few times a year, this recipe is a keeper."

"reviewBody": "Excellent recipe. I love Chitterlings. But I don't trust just anyone cooking them for me. I was rise by my great grandmother ( a southerner ) and at an early age she taught my sisters and I how to properly clean and cook them. If cleaned properly there is no need for multiple rinses. Yes it is a very long process. But well worth the time if you know what you're doing. I use all ingredients listed plus I add Sazo'n Goya seasoning (must try) puts a spin on em and gives a little more flavor. Seeing how I'm the only one in my household that eats them I only use a 10 pound bucket (more than enough for me). I'm in hog heaven right now. Thanks for the share. And Happy Holidays!"

Chitterlings should NOT smell while they are cooking. If they do, they are not clean and if grease settles in them, they still are not clean. The juice from the chittlerlings should GEL up, not GREASE up. Grab the hotsauce and enjoy1"

"reviewBody": "This was my favorite chitts recipe from reading the narrative. I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving and would like to suggest what tastes best for my family. They prefer only a small amount of onion, not a whole onion; cleaning well is the first step, but it is not necessary to pour off the water several times once the chitts begin to cook; once is enough.\nFinally, for seasonings the tried and true salt, a little red pepper and maybe white pepper, and a small amount (very small) amount of vinegar...1 teaspoon will do.\nIn terms of the smell; the true chittlin lover absolutely loves the smell of chitts cooking. That is part and parcel of the enjoyment.\nSo, try them; experiment with flavors, but just give me salt, red pepper and a touch of vinegar...that will do. And, please cook them for more than 4 hours. It is not a matter of tenderness; it is a matter of doneness. Cook them from 8 to 12 hours and they will be tender...and done!"

If you clean them correctly, there's no need to par boil, you take away the flavor. Another tip, you can purchase cleaned chitterlins, 5 lb. bags each. They may need to be split open. I still check to make sure they are fully cleaned. Saves a lot of time, but oh so delicious."
