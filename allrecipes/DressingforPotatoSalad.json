One was just the dressing over a variety of small potatoes (red, gold, white and the purple fingerlings), the other was over cubed russets with celery, pickles, and hard-boiled eggs. The dressing worked beautifully over both."

This dressing really absorbed into the potatoes and the salad was dry and tasteless the next day. Be sure to save some dressing to add the next day. I may try it again using a double batch. Tasted the best after only marinating 4-6 hours."

I did not have green onions so used yellow. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Oh, and it does only make dressing enough for 3 large potatoes. Will probably make this again but next time substitute plain yogurt in lieu of sour cream for a healthier version. Can't wait to try on macaroni salad with grape tomatoes."

I doubled (and then some) the recipe to make enough for a 5lb bag of potatoes, 8 eggs, half a cup of small diced dill pickles. I also added dried minced onion to the dressing because I didn't have any fresh on hand. I let the potatoes cool before adding the dressing and made the day before so I'm sure it's going to soak up all the goodness overnight."

"reviewBody": "I made this for my family, as a side for a barbecue dinner we were making. We love potato salad, and usually I just use ranch dressing over the potatoes, making it an easy prep. I had some time so I decided to make a dressing. I found this recipe and we all loved it. I did make a couple of additions...I added sugar and I did add the optional onions. I used all mayo since I didn't have sour cream on hand, and I sprinkled the salad with smoked paprika. It was good the day of and is good on the second day as well. I had enough for about 1.5 lbs of potatoes and 3 hard boiled eggs, I also added some chopped pickles to my salad. I usually cut the potatoes on the large side and we don't like really \"goopy\" dressing, so this was just enough."

It would have been nice to know that a double batch was needed for a 5# bag of potatoes, and if you like \"plain\" potato salad, this is fine, but I like mine with some kick, so I need to find some things to spice it up a bit."

The leftovers the next day were just as good or better than the first day. Thank you for saving us from dry and boring potato salad...I will be making your recipe from now on."

The potato sald tasted fine right after mixing it all together but the next day was another story. My usual potato salad tastes better the longer it sits. If anything, this got worse. The leftovers the next day almost tasted like there was NO dressing on them at all."

(At first it seemed I had a little extra dressing left over, but the potatoes soon absorbed the dressing I mixed with them, so I added in the \"extra\" dressing so the potato salad would be creamy. You might want to double the recipe if you're making a large batch of potato salad."
