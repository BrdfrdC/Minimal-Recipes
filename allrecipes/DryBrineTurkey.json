"reviewBody": "This worked perfectly. I admit I was a little worried because I have always done Alton Brown's wonderful brined turkey but it's a lot of work and it's messy and not inexpensive. Now that we are empty nesters I thought maybe it's time to give myself a break - this is it! It's easy, cheap and the results are spectacular. I started with a fresh 13.6 lb turkey and followed the directions exactly. The meat was extraordinarily moist and flavorful. I am not a big celery fan and was really hoping it wouldn't be too strong - it wasn't at all; it was just juicy and delicious. Will definitely do again."

I made up for it by using the \"make ahead\" turkey gravy on this site, all over it. Definitely worth a try, but I think I like the wet brining better."

"reviewBody": "This method keeps your turkey from tasting watered down because the meat has no extra water to soak up. The brining will happen faster if salt is rubbed under the skin. Other dry brine recipes always say to rinse excess salt before roasting. This really is the best way to brine ! :-)"

"reviewBody": "This turkey was so moist and flavorful! Not to mention that it's so much easier than traditional wet brining. My turkey was a little bigger so I used 4 tablespoons of kosher salt and added 3 tablespoons of dark brown sugar and about a teaspoon of freshly ground pepper. After the dry brining process was complete ( I did two days instead of three), I let the turkey rest at room temperature for an hour and then rubbed softened butter and bacon grease on and under the skin and inside the cavity. Then I used some mesquite dry rub and followed the recipe directions for roasting. Seriously AMAZING! Thank you for sharing!"
