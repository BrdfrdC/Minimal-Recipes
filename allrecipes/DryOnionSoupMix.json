This is an ideal substitute. I also didn't have beef boullion but didn't need it for the recipe I had. However for french onion soup and others that need salt, make sure to add it. I couldn't find beef granules and just chopped up a cube of beef boullion. Worked fine. Definitely a keeper!"

I am posting for those who, like me, cannot have processed soup mix because they contain glutamate (MSG, MAG, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, etc.) and cause migraines and other health problems in people who are sensitive to it. This recipe calls for dried bouillon granules. I was unable to find such a thing without glutamate in any store."

I am thrilled how this recipe tasted and I actually had to add salt to my meal. Great authentic flavor and I will be using this from now on. Thank you for sharing this recipe!"

Still looking, but very happy to have a recipe when I find it."
