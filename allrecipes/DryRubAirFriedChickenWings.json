"reviewBody": "Fantastic! Made these with what i had, no poultry seasoning so i used Chicken broth and a tbl. of Liquid smoke and threw 12 wings in a Ziplock bag and coated them. Are AF seems to be a little hotter( a bit over cooked) so i am going to try 300 degrees next time i make them. Will no longer need to buy pre-made chicken wings again. Want them with heat? Add Cayenne (dry) or wet (hot sauce) to kick it up a heat notch! Thank you for sharing this excellent recipe!"

My hubby is hyper critical of food and he only likes dry rubbed wings, he doesn’t like them saucy, so I tried these and they turned out perfectly! I followed the recipe exactly except I couldn’t find sweet paprika so I used regular and the flavor was outstanding. Saving this one and will use it every time I make wings. Air fryer made it even healthier. Perfect recipe"
