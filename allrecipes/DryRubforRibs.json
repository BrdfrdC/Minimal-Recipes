And the heat is amazing - not burning your tongue, but rather smooth and comfortable heat at the back of your throat. I did cut all the spices to 1 tablespoon though, but that's for my taste. Mmm, that crust from the brown sugar... This will be my go to spice for ribs from now on!"

"reviewBody": "This is a fantastic recipe! I love the simplicity of the ingredients... all of which I had on hand. Very flavorful without any one ingredient overpowering the next. \n\nI did slightly pull back the salt content by about 20% based upon some of the reviews and did not find it to be overly salty. I also added about 20% extra brown sugar. That said, I'm not certain that either of those adjustments was necessary.\n\nI actually cut the recipe in half, and it was the perfect amount for a single 3 lb. rack of baby back pork ribs. After mixing the ingredients, I set aside about 1 1/2 tablespoons for final crusting, then evenly coated the ribs with the remaining rub. Once coated I double wrapped them in foil and refrigerated them for about 2 hours.\n \nTo cook, I placed the ribs (still wrapped in foil) on a sheet pan in the center of the oven at 250°F for 2 hours, turning them over once after 1 hour. After pulling them from the oven I then removed the foil and reserved the juices, which I combined with 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar for later basting. Next, I crusted the topside of the rack with the rub I had set aside and placed them on an outdoor grill at low temp, crust side up, cooking them for an additional hour or so and basting them along the way with the reserved juice and vinegar mixture. During the last 15 minutes I basted them a couple of times with a modest amount of bbq sauce (maybe 1/4 cup total). I used Famous Dave's Devil's Spit, but I think any decent sauce would do. In fact"

I will never buy baby back ribs at a BBQ restaurant again. \nI can't believe such simple ingredients could yield such mouthwatering results!\nEven made KETO style with substituting \"brown sugar SWERVE\" for regular brown sugar. I chose not to add salt until I broiled them at the end with BBQ sauce on top. \nI did read all the other reviews and chose to shake some Liquid Smoke over the bare pork before doing the rub the night before. \nAlso, as per one reader's suggestion, added some dry mustard to the mix. \nThis is going to be my new fav meat entree - sooo easy. \nThank you for submitting this recipe."

For short times, we'll probably cut back on the pepper, but for 8hrs to 16 hr marinating, it's great the way it is. We ate ribs for three days and it was delicious !

The only thing missing is a hearty dash of cayenne pepper- which I added. I also used Kosher salt vs regular salt and Smoked Paprika vs regular. I let these sit with the rub for 6 hrs, then baked the baby back ribs at 275 for 2.5 hrs. After baking, grilled them for just a few minutes more after slathering with BBQ sauce. Best homemade ribs I've ever made!"

I cooked on the grill for about 1 1/2 hours on indirect heat. They were wonderful. Very flavorful and tender. The best time wise recipe ever!"

They turn out so tender and delicious! Put on the grill or in the broiler with Bar b que sauce for 5 min. Or so to brown. They fall off the bone. I use St. Louis ribs because they are more meaty."

"reviewBody": "Used this rub on a pork shoulder that I then smoked for about 12 hours. It came out great with a lovely smokey flavor that was complimented by the sugar and salt in the rub. It was also very juicy and tender, thanks to the large fat-cap on the top that basically acted like an auto baster for the meat. I did smoke it in a foil pan to prevent the juices from escaping the meat, as well. Wood chips were only used during the first hour of cooking, then the vents were closed and it was allowed to slow-cook the rest of the 12 hours until it hit 180 IT. Unfortunately, I didn't get a picture before we'd already devoured half of it. The rest will be for some delicious pulled-pork sandwiches."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is superb!!!! There is a guy (McCoys BBQ) who has a smoker set up on the weekends on RT 3 headed to Culpeper, VA, from Spottsylvania. He has, hands-down, the best ribs we've ever eaten. Outside of the tenderness and texture, the rub is the best! It's worth the one hour drive to get this guy's ribs...and I've been trying to figure out exactly what makes up the rub he puts on them.\n\nI made ribs today with THIS recipe and so far this is the closest I've found, yet, to McCoy's ribs. I gave a rack of ribs to my next door neighbor and told him he might want to put some sauce on them....15 minutes later he was telling me how incredible the ribs were and he didn't think they needed any sauce at all. \n\nThe only change I had...small one, is that I have a bag of smoked salt which I used instead of the regular salt."

I didn't marinade the ribs or anything, just followed advice on here to apply the rub just before cooking. I also used liquid smoke before using the rub. At the end I did a honey brown sugar glaze and the ribs were fantastic. Thanks!! Planning on making a huge jar to keep on hand."

Would be great on other meats also."
