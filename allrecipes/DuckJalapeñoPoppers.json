"reviewBody": "Made as written and this was one of the better wild duck recipes I have made. It's time consuming but worth it so plan ahead. Anyone that cooks wild duck knows you have to keep it pretty rare if you don't want it taking on a liver taste. I was really worried about the cook time on this one and was preparing for the worst. Turns out, there was barley if any liver taste at all. Excellent recipe!"
