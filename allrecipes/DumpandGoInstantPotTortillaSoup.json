"reviewBody": "I don’t care for canned chicken, so I buy a rotisserie chicken every time I go to Sam’s. I then remove the meat from the bones, bag it, and freeze it for recipes like this. I also make bone broth from the carcass. That’s what I used instead of canned chicken broth. I’m so glad fabeveryday included spices in this recipe. They really help to add more flavor! I topped my soup with homemade tortilla chips, cheese, and sour cream."
