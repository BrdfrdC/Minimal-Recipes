So I bake this crust beforehand, put my apples in, and top with the streusel. I only cook long enough to brown the streusel and it's perfect! They are a marvelous, tart apple. So good!"

The lemon zest gives it an extra something.\n\nThat said, I had the same issue with the filling being kind of a soup. Some of that may be user error, I could have drained off a little more of the apple juice, but I didn't want to lose too much of the yummy spice mixture.\n\nWith a couple adjustments, this could be a permanent favorite."

We used a store bought pie crust and as was also suggested by other reviewers, baked the crust for 5 mins after brushing with egg whites. The bottom crust was cooked perfectly. My husband and I have decided that we will never buy an apple pie from the store again. This pie was just too easy to make."

"reviewBody": "I have an apple tree. It is an heirloom tree known as \"Early Strawberry\" and the apples are ready in mid July. They are tart and tasty for baking except that they are not crispy and soften too fast. The tree was renowned for applesauce and that's mostly what I do because they cook up so fast they usually have applesauce texture in a pie. But I found that if I cook the bottom crust first, put the apples in, and put a Dutch apple streusel top and only bake it long enough to brown the top, it's really good. I used this recipe and it was wonderful. I'm always on a diet, so I used white whole wheat flour, truvia, and splenda brown sugar blend as well as cutting the butter in the topping to 1/4 cup and not putting any in with the apples. It may have been more crumbly than designed, but it tasted great. My husband, who is not dieting, thought so too."

"reviewBody": "I used this with Butter Flaky Pie Crust recipe. (Surprisingly, I baked a Sweet Potato Pie I recipe, and that crust turned out horribly, LOL!) I was actually surprised that I actually like the finished pie. First, the crust did not have the consistency of beef jerky (yay!). I used 2 granny smiths, 2 golden delicious, and 1 gala apple. I had 2 galas, but while I love eating them, after tasting the slices alongside the GS and GD, they didn't have much to offer with regard to taste. The streusel topping mixed up quite well, though I had to add an extra tablespoon or so of butter so the crumbs were big and moistly packed instead of small, loose and dusty-like. I added chopped walnuts. The only thing I wish I added was about 1/2 teaspoon or so of salt to either the filling mix or the crumble. Maybe because I substituted the allspice with cloves/ginger, I thought the flavor lacked in depth. It was sufficiently sweet (I use 1/3 cup white and 1/3 cup brown), but it wasn't really flavorful in an exciting kind of way. I was expecting the tartness of the GS (and lemon bath) to balance out the sugar, so while I wanted to add a pinch of salt, I decided against it. Nevertheless, I actually baked this for a love interest who's suddenly disappeared himself. So it'll be flavored with PURE SPITE, and I will enjoy eating every last piece by myself. For whatever it lacked, this pie is still too good for him. And so am I!"

I cooked it a wee bit differently - placed oven rack on lowest position, preheated to 425, did not freeze the crust, skipped the foil-covered pre-bake and put the streusel-topped pie in the 425 preheated oven and immediately turned heat down to 350 and baked for 1 hour. It's spectacular."

After reading other's reviews, I used 3 tbsps flour in apple mixture. I also brushed crust with egg white before adding apples. I didn't put crust in freezer and I used a store bought crust. Absolutely the best. Will make many times over. Oh and I also let it rest an hour before slicing just to help it settle a bit and not have liquids run."

The juices mix well with ice cream, and my husband made me promise to make this recipe \"forever\". I bet the juices will solidify a bit overnight, or I could tweak the recipe a bit, but honestly, it tastes AMAZING the way it is. YUM!!!"

"reviewBody": "I loved it. I pre baked the pastry until it was brown before filling. I always do this and find the crust doesn't get soggy. My family wanted more apple so I will increase the Apple by 1 cup next time. I found the recipe didn't require any other thickener but the flour. I was careful to mix the apples and flour until they were completely combined before adding to the crust.. I think how much apple or thickener needed depends on how much the apple you're using cooks down while baking. This pie was a cross between a pie and a crisp. I found I had to explain this to my family."

However, I was still able to put it on top. It hardened while it baked and still turned out awesome. Two other things i changed were: I let my pie crust thaw out before baking and I also baked my pie for 45-50 mins. Not 35. But this recipe is on point! So yummy!"

I used instant apple cranberry oatmeal which gives it a slight tang and emphasizes the apple flavor in the topping. Also try the filling with a touch of ground cloves. I also did not freeze the crust and increased the initial cooking time mixture to about 12 minutes. Lastly, I sliced the apples thinly and layered them evenly in the plate to make sure they evenly cooked through."
