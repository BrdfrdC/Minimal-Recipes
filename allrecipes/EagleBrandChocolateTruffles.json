When I do make the chocolate truffles I prefer dark chocolate chips and roll them in sweetened dark chocolate cocoa powder. It is all about your preference. You could even use caramel chips or butterscotch chips to change it up. The recipe is very versatile. Just experiment with things you like. I simple follow the recipe except for using different chips."

I left them in the fridge overnight because I was busy and then discovered it was to hard to make into balls even leaving it out to soften for hours. So I cut it up into squares and now have truffle fudge! Delicious! The orange flavor is the best."

"reviewBody": "I've made this several times although I call it truffle fudge as real truffles don't have any sugar in them as they are supposed to be semi-sweet and use cream.\nOne thing I have done in this and in the truffles I make is to put it into three different bowls and in one bowl add rum or brandy. In other I put 1 to 1/2 tsp cinnamon and that one roll the balls in either cocoa powder with cinnamon mixed or sometimes powdered sugar with cinnamon mixed in it. Third whatever flavored oil I want, peppermint, more vanilla, lemon, whatever appeals to me or to match the season."

"reviewBody": "I use this exact recipe to make fudge. The only difference is I use half semi sweet chips and half dRk chocolate with a pinch of salt. I have used sea salt before and called it dark chocolate sea salt fudge The sea salt is coarser and doesn't mix in as easily as regular so you get a tad bit more of the saltines. Everyone loves my fudge because it's not hard and dry like some are. This time I am going to make a few into truffles and see what I think"

We didn't try cinnamon, but after we had finished baking my mother gasped and said, \"We should've used cinnamon!\"\nI hope you find that helpful! :)"

We roll the truffles in three coatings, sweetened coconut, unsweetened cocoa and finely chopped hazelnuts. Our family loves this recipe and so will yours."

"reviewBody": "These turned out great. I made the recipe exact except I refrigerated them for 3 hours. By the time I took them out they were rock hard! Impossible to roll. But after I let them sit out for 2hrs or so they softend up perfect for me to roll them into tablespoon sized balls. Rolled in powdered sugar and sprinkles. Will definitely make again for Christmas. Only problem I had with these is that they are incredibly sweet. I couldn't even finish one without being extremely thirsty. Next time I will use this recipe to make fudge instead. Rolling into bite size balls doesn't seem to work since the richness is overwhelming. Very easy recipe tho!"

I also made a batch with peppermint extract and coated with crushed candy canes. They tasted quite rich and made very cute Christmas gifts!"
