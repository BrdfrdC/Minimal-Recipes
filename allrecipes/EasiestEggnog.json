The alternative milk flavor came through way too strong so for my second batch I used some of the ideas in the comments. The second time I put two whole eggs in a bowl, whipped those lightly, added one cup of creamy oatmilk and one cup of heavy whipping cream, 3 tablespoons of sugar, 1 teaspoon baking vanilla, a dash of salt, and a generous sprinkling of cinnamon. I blended it with a stick blender for one minute. It turned out great."

I put all ingredients in my Ninja and hit the blend button - easy peasy, perfect (does need to settle a bit if you don't want a lot of foam)."

"reviewBody": "It was easy to make and tasted ok. The nutmeg really makes a difference so use slightly more than a dash imo. My main issue is it wasn't thick enough. My father used to make it for me, and it was thick and not watery at all. And unlike \"thedailygourmet\" recommendation to use sweet condensed milk to thicken it, my father didn't use anything other than regular milk and eggs. I have never had egg nog that wasn't thick. Other people I know have made it thick, and the supermarket-bought stuff is thick as well. This is the first time I have had egg nog that wasn't thick. So I suppose the next time I make this, I'm going to adjust the eggs and milk to find the balance I desire."

I used 2 cups of 2% milk, 1/4 cup white sugar, and cut down on the vanilla as I have very pure extract."

Although these additions helped to thicken it a bit, It was still on the thinner side, With a \"few\" dashes of nutmeg and cinnamon to taste. I got it to the point that i really liked the flavor. Next, I will put it in the freezer and re-blend to see how thick that makes it."

Beat the eggs first, and completely smooth with an electric beater with a whisk attachment or the regular beaters, or make sure you beat it completely smooth by hand with a whisk.\n2. Add in the sugar to the eggs and mix it well for about a minute.\n3. Add everything else and it's super smooth with no egg chunks!(: \n\nThank you for this recipe! Simple and yummy!"

My favorite part was the bubbly milk mustache...yep, when I'm alone, I still do it. I think she added just a touch more sugar. To me this tastes a lot like a melted McDonald's vanilla shake...but oh so good."

I made mine with almost-flavorless neutral-tasting unsweetened dairy-free SO DELICIOUS ® coconut-milk beverage (instead of regular diary milk), and substituted the sugar with honey. I tried to reduce the sweetener, as is my habit, but found that I needed the full amount for a good-tasting egg nog. Thank you sal for sharing your recipe."

"reviewBody": "Very quick recipe with good flavor &amp; consistency. If you want a thicker eggnog, separate the eggs. Beat the whites until they have peaks. Beat the egg yolks until they are light yellow. Then blend the two together slowly and carefully. You will not have problems with \"egg chunks\" if you use fresher eggs. Because this is a raw product, I personally recommend organically certified eggs. The eggsafety.org can help you source fresh, safe eggs."

"reviewBody": "I read some reviews before making this, which led me to taking some extra steps, then I personalized it a little bit. For a 5 minute egg nog, not bad!\n\nSince I only had imitation vanilla on hand, I ended up using 1 TBS. I only drink non-fat milk, which was too thin here, so I took someone's advice and added ice cubes. I also whisked the eggs very well before adding them to the blender. Used 1/2 sucralose 1/2 sugar.\n\nI taste-tested, and found that a pinch of nutmeg didn't make a dent, and nutmeg alone, for me, doesn't work. So I added 1/8 tsp each of nutmeg, cinnamon, ground cloves, ginger and allspice, a/k/a pumpkin spices or molasses cookie spices. They are my favorites, always have them. I could've put more in, but subtle's okay tonight."
