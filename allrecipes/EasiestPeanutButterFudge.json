I figured it would be after reading the recipe so I added salty, toasted, crushed peanuts to contrast a bit and cut back on the confectioners sugar by a cup but it made no difference. I don't usually comment on recipes but would like to save you some time and money. My family will eat just about anything sweet but they won't eat this. Save the calories for something yummy."

This recipe took all the sugar cooking science out of it and made perfect fudge for first time fudge makers. Thank you!"

"reviewBody": "This is my go-to fudge recipe. It’s delicious! The first time I made this, I made as-is and would call it a 4-star recipe as is. A bit sweet for my liking but fantastic nonetheless! \n\nHowever, I’ve made it COUNTLESS times since then. To make it truly 5-star and beyond, I followed the advice to cut powdered sugar to 3 cups, brown sugar to 2, and increase PB to one cup. It’s the best fudge I’ve ever had and always get requests for the recipe! I also have tried it with Earth Balance Coconut flavored peanut butter and it’s to die for! \n\nA few tips based on other reviews and my own trial and error:\n\n- get everything ready beforehand. Sift your powdered sugar, spray your pan, and have your mixers ready to go (I use hand mixer for this) \n\n- per a tip on here, I start the timer right when little bubbles start to form on the corners, not when it reaches a full rolling boil. This makes for the creamiest fudge. The one time I waited for a full rolling boil, it was crumbly and dry.\n\n- mix with a hand mixer until it’s super smooth and the fudge begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl. \n\n- have this link ready to share, bc you WILL get asked for it! \n\nThanks for the great recipe!!"

"reviewBody": "Absolutely outstanding. I'm not even a peanut butter fudge person but a friend requested some after I made the brown sugar fudge (modified with a half cup of cocoa). I adjust the recipe as per the comments (2c Brown Sugar, 3c powdered, and a little more than 1c peanut butter). I also boiled gently for 10 minutes instead of 2 which may have produced the mess that DEBMILLIKAN describes (beaded up and butter separated when mixing in the powdered sugar). Quick google provide the solution: add one tp at a time (up to 6) until it blends smooth. Was gorgeous even in the bowl. Best fudge result I have achieved so far and by far the best peanut butter fudge I've ever had."

I then used a mixer and mixed it on high and was pleasantly surprised to have it turn out creamy and smooth. Don’t know what I did to get the pebbly, buttery mess but happy I found a solution."

I put the Powdered Sugar in my big KitchAid mixer and added the butter, Brown Sugar, vanilla, peanut butter mixture to that. Only took a very little time to mix it together where it was pulling off the bowl.. I did add 1/3 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips to this mixture while mixing it up."

I did this instead of what the recipe calls for and it turned out PERFECT! 1/2 cup butter, 2 cups brown sugar, 1/2 cup milk, 1 cup peanut butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 2 cups of the powdered sugar. It was nice and soft but not to soft to where it breaks off into your hand. I will be making this again."

I may have boiled for too long as my mixture turned to little \"pebbles\" as described by another reviewer once I poured it over sugar and beat it. I have never had a boil too long problem with my chocolate fudge. I'll check out some other recipes but possible try this again and pay closer attention to that boil."

"reviewBody": "This fudge, with adjustments that other commenters have made, is incredible! It is so easy to make and has a dry sort of feel to it, but it is so smooth and creamy. I thought I botched it when I started mixing it with my hand mixer because it looked real crumbly and dry, almost like a cookie dough, but when I used my spatula and pressed it it was so smooth. The taste is great and it really is so easy to make. I put 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup of milk in the pan and melted it on medium low, then added brown sugar and increased the heat to 200°f (about medium heat but I used an induction burner ) until it started boiling. I set the timer for 2 minutes, kept stirring and when the 2 minutes was done I removed from heat, added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 cup of peanut butter. I mixed it until all of the peanut butter was melted and mixed in. I had 3 cups of powdered sugar in a large mixing bowl and I poured the peanut butter mixture over it and mixed it with my hand mixer until it was all incorporated. This is the point I kinda panicked because it looked really grainy but don't worry, it's just the fudge playing tricks with you. It actually has a smooth texture. I then pressed it into an 8x8 glass pan. Let set for about an hour or until cool. Definitely worth the 15 minutes it takes to make."

The chocolate chip one was better IMO."

No surprise it being my first time but considering I did literally everything right.. it shouldn't be grainy and falling apart after sitting for 4 hours. 10/10 don't recommend if this is your first time. If you just need a reminder on ingredients or a crash course explanation to rejog your memory then you found the recipe for you"

"reviewBody": "This makes a really good tasting fudge. The only issues I have with it are in the instructions. Once the liquid from the pan is introduced to the powdered sugar, there is no \"beating\" or \"pouring\". It is so thick that you will be folding it and it will come out into your pan in kind of a big lump that you will have to press down into the pan so that it takes the pans shape. Taste and texture are both great, so I will be making it again. Just be warned not to expect a pourable produce at the end."

I put everything from the 8in pan back into my sauce pan, put it to low- medium heat and let it start to remelt, then started adding very small amts of milk and kept stirring until it smoothed out. It took maybe a total of 2 Tbsp of additional milk. I did not bring it back to a hard boil, only to the point of being smooth. It fixed the problem and I was able to pour it back into the pan."
