Can do this in a pressure cooker but I've still been playing with times. I recommend adding a bay leaf or two. And I also use Lipton Beefy onion packet with french onion soup and can of beef consomme. But if never made,then follow instructions first then play with recipe. Longer in slow cooker better it gets l. Stagger potato and carrot. Carrot last or get mushy."

Sear any meat with salt pepper garlic just to brown outside. Then put in with veggies and just a touch of water. When done you will have a beautiful broth. Red wine is also good but you add it towards the end."

Added 3 cups of bone beef broth and the boullion with the water. Browning first does take away from being easy, but it's a step I've learned to take for best flavor, especially with a leaner cut of meat. The seasonings are an easy add in. And, we like a lot of gravy, so added extra liquid. Cooked on high for 3 hours, low for another 3. Yum!"

The flavor was definitely lacking, even though I tweaked it and added my own seasonings as I had no bullion cubes. I substituted the water for beef broth. I'd give it 5 stars just because of how divine the meat came out, I've tried other recipes and have always had a problem with the meat being overdone. Not this one. Will make again and keep experimenting with the spices."

"reviewBody": "I'm giving this a 5 because I love how it is both a simple and effective recipe. It is easy to modify to your taste (and worth modifying to add some taste).\n\nI used a 2.5 lb roast. I cooked it on high for 4 hours using slow cooker mode in an instant pot (I was in a pinch). \n\nIt turned out great, though the meat was a bit tough due to my very short cooking time; same thing for the vegetables. \n\nI used the instant pot high pressure for 5 minutes more - this solved the overly firm vegetable problem.\n\nAfter shredding the meat I added it back to the pot to hang in the juices, the meat was amazing after that!... still recommending a longer cook time if possible though.\n\nThe recipe lacks flavor, and I think that is pretty obvious in the ingredient list... To give this more of a german flare, I added mustard and sliced up some small whole dill pickles. I highly recommend this! However, if you season with just salt and pepper, I'm sure that will satisfy those with a simple palate."

The meat (a chuck roast) was burned from not sitting all the way into the broth (I guess) and most of the potatoes were done, but the carrots and some of the celery weren't. I didn't know about the carrots &amp; celery until I took all the veggies out of the crockpot to make gravy. I ended up wasting a check roast! I can salvage the veggies but will have to eat them for dinner several nights in a row, since I live alone or make some soup. My crockpot is fairly new but this is the second time I've put a roast in it and had it burn. I hate to give bad reviews, but if I try it again, I'll get a new crockpot first!"

"reviewBody": "Ok, this is one of my favorite wintertime meals. It turns out so good that I usually eat until I hurt. I have a few changes to my potroast reciepe. First I use either a london broil top round roast or a boneless sirloin tip roast both around 2.5 pounds each. By the way, I do 2 of them in seperate crock pots because 1 is never enough lol. In each crock pot along with the meat goes 3 pounds of carrotts, not baby carrotts, peeled and sliced in 1 inch pieces, and half a 5 pound bag of sweet onions, peeled and quartered. The onions and carrotts make the meal. Also add one packet of lipton beefy onion soup. Just put in a bowl with hot water to mix it up and dump it on top. Add enough beef broth or beef bouillon mixed with hot water to cover the roast in the crock pot. If only using bouillon, usually 3 cubes will do it. Put the roast on top of a layer of carrotts and onions, add all ingredients, salt and pepper the roast and cook on low for 9 hours. The meat will melt in your mouth and the carrotts and onions are incredible. Make some garlic mashed potatoes along with the meal and don't forget to save the broth and leftover carrotts and onions for making egg noodles."

I omitted the potatoes in the crock pot and made mashed potatoes at the end. I rubbed in salt, pepper and sprinkled some flour on the roast and seared it for about 4 min. on each side. I wanted to make gravy and thought the flour on the roast would make it a little thicker before I I also used the corn starch and water after I poured out the liquid . I deglazed the pan with red wine and pored that in the crockpot. I had a 3 lb. roast and slow cooked it for approx. 6 hrs. Even though I made those changes it was the best roast ever. Thank you for a great recipe."

"reviewBody": "I tried this recipe having used my slow cooker a few times already. After about 3 hours on high my 2.5lb roast was almost over cooked and the veggies were still kind of raw (edible but crunchy). I ended up taking the meat out and leaving the veggies in on low for another hour or so and they turned out okay. Not sure if I did something wrong or if the recipe needs tweaking. Will probably try again."

Thank you for sharing, maybe next time I'll do it as some of the reviewers suggested, you know, to mix things up :P"

Made again with some easy changes and thought it was much better. As others suggested, used a fair amount of salt, pepper, garlic powder on meat as well as a bay leaf and minced garlic with the beef broth. Didn't use the potatoes because I made mashed potatoes and used the juice to make a gravy, but if I didn't have time for that would definitely throw them in with the veggies. A few simple changes made a huge difference and my family loved it. Hard to find an easy pot roast recipe that doesn't use packets for seasoning."

Then season with salt and pepper. You can also add garlic and other herbs you like. I prefer to use tyme.\n If you like more salt and seasoning, I add an onion soup mix poured over the roast. The bigger your roast, the more seasoning it needs.\n Finally on the cooking time, the longer it cooks the more it will pull apart and shred. If you prefer to slice it, you can remove it when still firm to touch. \n We always let ours cook slowly and for a long time. Pull it apart and lightly chop. Then back in crock pot with all the veggies and juices. \n\nThanks and good luck!"

I usually use beef broth instead of bouillon cubes. The juices make an excellent gravy. What really bothers me on these roast beef recipes is it is rarely mentioned which cut of beef is used. I stick with a chuck roast as I can depend on it being fall apart tender and having a rich flavor. I've never had much luck with rump roasts (not sure what they call them today) and don't know how that would work in a recipe like this even though it's in slow cooker."

I used 6 large red potatoes, 3 small-medium onions, some celery for flavor, a few more carrots, and floured and browned the roast. After placing the vegetables and roast in the crockpot I covered the meat with Montreal seasoning and Lipton's onion soup mix. After pouring in the beef broth, I then placed the crock in the refrigerator. At 5:45 a.m. I turned the crockpot on high for 3 1/2 hours then turned it to low when I walked out the door. Returning home at 12:45, I put a bag of frozen peas in a casserole dish and microwaved it for 8-10 minutes. Dinner is served! The key to a tender roast is choosing one with lots of marbling. Cooking it on low for 8 hours would have been my preference but I was a bit short on time. Thanks to all who made suggestions so I could adapt the basic recipe using a few things already in the cupboard. I have made this before with the original recipe and found it tasty and tender as well."
