"reviewBody": "We make this way about six times a year. Never use bay leaf but will try in the next few weeks. The type of kielbasa sausage is most important. Want made with pork and garlic and maybe a little beef. Forget if made with Turkey. Will make \"pour it down the drain Borscht.\" The ratio of 3 cups water to 1# sausage is perfect. We stir in an egg couple of minutes at the end."

I followed the recipe except I doubled the garlic and didn't have any dill. I expect that would make it even better. But oh my - this is my new favorite."
