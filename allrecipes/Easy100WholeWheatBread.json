Will increase yeast to a full tsp to see if that makes a difference. Other than that, it was a yummy loaf and will definitely make again. I used the King Arthur whole wheat flour."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is good and everything works perfectly except the prove time the author has provided. At first, I proved my bread for 1 hour as they had stated but the bread didn't rise at all. I checked my yeast and the temperature of the water (between 105 and 110°F) and it was all perfect. I kept my bread for an additional 1 hour and it rose to the top but still not beyond the bread mold. Also greasing the pan with butter works perfectly fine if you don't want to put parchment paper. These are the changes that I made. Otherwise it was perfect and tasted awesome!\nP.S: I recommend shrink wrapping the bread for proving."

It's fluffy enough to be good on its own, but dense enough to hold up to sandwiches and spreads. Not grainy like a lot of whole wheat breads either. \nTwo minor adjustments that I make: I use corse sea salt and double the amount, and I usually do an hour rise before shaping it and letting it rise in the pan."

I also wonder how the bread was measured, because when I did it as the bakers do, it was more of a batter than a dough. I had to add an additional 1/2 C of flour to make it work. And it's fairly flavorless. In all of my years of baking bread, this was my first fail."
