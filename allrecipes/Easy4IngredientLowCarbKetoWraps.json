"reviewBody": "It was way too runny - I don't think I needed 6 eggs and all that milk, but I was following the recipe exactly, and it made way too much, and then it was so thin it was like a crepe. So I added more coconut flour to thicken it and it worked but it doesn't taste like a wrap. I will use the huge amount it made to make pancakes instead. I would not recommend this recipe unless you can get the consistency better."

"reviewBody": "This was really good and the best GF wraps I've tried so far. I substituted brown rice flour for coconut flour and it was fine. The consistency was quite thin though (followed all directions). So thin that there were holes in the tortilla so I added more flour, to a pancake consistency, which helped. They were nice and pliable for fajitas but still thin. \n\nI left some of the batter to finish after dinner and they made the thickest, best tortillas. I think having it sit for 30 mins or so, not just the 5, might really help. As a plus, I stored the extras in the fridge with paper towels around them in a zipper bag and they've kept really well for a week. This is my tortilla recipe thus far. Thanks! (3 photos show straight recipe, then added more flour, then had batter sit - best)"
