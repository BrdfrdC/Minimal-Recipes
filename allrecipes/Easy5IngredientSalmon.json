I read a lot of the reviews and opted to use 1/4t salt, replaced basil w Italian seasoning and added some lemon pepper and Parmesan. I also followed someone else by cooking 4 min on each side and then moving to the broiler for a few minutes w some Panko. Everyone loved it! Served over some rice w vegetables."

It was like being in my own restaurant."

For me it was, that it was a very simple and quick way to make a great healthy dinner for my son and I. Steamed broccoli, an roasted baby red potatoes and I was in heaven, lol. \nSome lemon wedges on the plate for either the broccoli or salmon, and easy peasy. Ty for submitting"

The next time I make it I will cut back a bit on the garlic powder."
