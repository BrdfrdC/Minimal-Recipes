I upped the temp to 385 as I had 4 pieces of pork in my air fryer. 6 minutes on each side, and I did a final cook at 400 for 3 minutes to brown the top. It was perfectly cooked and the husband raved about it!"

Cooking for only two so cut the amounts in half. Don't have a air fryer so used my toaster convection oven and because our chops were considerably larger added some time and upped temp to 400 as someone suggested. This will be our go to when we can't grill! Thank you!"

Airfry about 15 minutes then flip over and cook about 15 more minutes mine turned out excellent."

"reviewBody": "I made it tonight In The air fryer. They were really good. I added about 1/4 tsp more of paprika. I used smoked paprika. I would reduce the kosher salt by just a little bit next time. I don’t use salt when I cook so it was slightly saltier than I’m use to but not bad at all. My husband enjoyed it very much. We had it with roasted red skin potatoes and onions and whole sautéed green beans. The cheese gets the air fryer a little messy so be prepared to clean the basket in between portions. Overall, good recipe and I would cook it again with just some very minor tweaks."

"reviewBody": "So, this is my first review and I have tried 100's of recipes from this site. Yes, I need to review more because I have loved many! This is by far my favorite pork chop recipe I have ever made. I had almost given up on making pork chops because I always felt they are too dry and really not that flavorful no matter how I make them. This, however, was to moist and so much flavor. It was up there with a really good steak. I made it just as is, maybe I made a tad bit more of the mixture to make sure the pork chops were fully covered. I also did use \"pork ribeye\" cut. I did not know the difference between that cut and center cut but the butcher said the the ribeye cut of the pork is supposed to be more tender. I will be making this at least once a month if not more. Thank you for the recipe and I highly recommend it."
