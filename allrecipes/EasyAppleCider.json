Quick, easy &amp; delicious. My entire family loved it , kids included (ages 4 &amp; 5), as we took our hot mugs and sat by our outside fire pit. I even added a half shot of rum to my husbands which was out of this world yummy!!! I made the recipe exactly as written. No changes needed. Thank you!"

"reviewBody": "First time I've ever tried making apple cider, and what a HIT!! Whata super base recipe. Everybody really enjoyed it, and there were no leftovers between 5 people :o . The only slight changes I made was using about 3/4 tsp of nutmeg because I didn't have allspice, and I didn't have cheesecloth either, so I put spices in a coffee filter, and tied it up. By the reviews, I added far less brown sugar (less than a 1/4 cup). Also, I added a little bit of orange peel to the cider directly, and served with a slice of orange. Delicious!! I don't like to rate a recipe after making lots of changes, but I really believe most of these spices are quite interchangeable, and the sugar can be added according to personal tastes, without affecting this base of a recipe. Will definitely make again!"

I also used two 50 oz jars of cider, which seemed good in proportion to the amount of syrup. It was sweet and delicious but not overly sweet. It was so perfect having it in the crockpot where it could stay warm for hours and was easily accessible. I will definitely make this again."

"reviewBody": "This is a great recipe, I have been making my apple cider this way for years! It has always been a success. The recipe I use calls for 1/4 to 1/2 cup brown sugar so I've usually stuck with the 1/3 cup measurement. While I think it's just perfect, we all have different tastes so start with a smaller amount of sugar first, you can always add more later. My favorite way to make this is in the slow cooker... it keeps for hours and the whole house smells amazing!! If there are any leftovers, I just let them cool to room temperature and then pour it into a pitcher and store in the fridge. Just heat up mugs of cider individually and it tastes just as good... and fyi, it even tastes good cold!"

Iâ€™ve traveled 130+ miles with the ingredients and what a hit this was with the family. This recipe is easy, travels well and scrumptious. Happy Cooking &amp; Baking!"

Also, I used ground allspice instead of the whole just because it is what I had bought. I still added a just one teaspoon of the ground allspice. Came out perfect!"

"reviewBody": "This was very good! When my parents came home from work they said that the house smelled so good! Even my brother liked it, and he hardly ever likes anything that I make. But I had to alter the measurements because of the amount of cider that I used; I had 33 fluid ounces instead of 64, so I used 3/4 tsp of groud cinnamon, 2/3 tsp of ground allspice, 2/3 tsp of ground cloves and 1 tbsp of brown sugar. I put the allspice and cloves into a coffe filter tied with string, just as another reviewer suggested."

I use a loose leaf tea strainer ball to put the small spices in, and just let the cinammon sticks float. Cook on low all day - sugar and spices can be adjusted for personal taste. Enjoy!"

"reviewBody": "Wow! Great cider (and so easy!!!). Made this tonight to go with the pumpkin pie I served for dessert at my family's \"after Thanksgiving\" dinner. This tastes just like apple pie. It IS sweet, so, if you do not care for sweet cider, this is not for you. My batch was EXTRA sweet because I decided to also add a 1/4 cup of honey (purchased in Antigua - West Indies good stuff!) and 1/2 t of vanilla extract (thanks Cher B for the great idea!). I was craving a sweet drink, not tart (like most traditional ciders are). My bf described this as \"sweeter than apple juice\"!!! My parents loved it. Altough I usually prepare a different cider recipe, I'll keep this one in my recipe file as well because it is quick to prepare, uses minimal ingredients and has that \"apple pie\" flavor that I love (my cider recipe does not - and takes much more effort to prepare). Thanks so much for sharing! I am drinking a mug of this right now : )"
