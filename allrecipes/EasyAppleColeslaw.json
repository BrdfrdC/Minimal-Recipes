Next time I will only use 1/2 of the bell pepper, cut back on the brown sugar (maybe 1/4 cup), and use salt to get some of the water out of the veggies before assembling the slaw as it did get rather watery the day after I made it. This is a good base recipe to start and I will just play with the dressing to make it more to my liking."

Given that brown sugar has its own assertive flavor on top of the sweetness, I believe the amount of sugar called for in the recipe would really overwhelm the salad to the point of ruin. I would like to rate this recipe higher: it was actually a nice side dish when made with significantly less sugar than called for. If I have reason to make it again, I'll probably go with just one tablespoon of sugar."

"reviewBody": "Very good! Changed the preparation steps as follows: Made dressing first in a measuring cup for easy measuring, less cleanup, and so sugar could dissolve while preparing the rest of the salad; chopped apples and tossed in 2 Tbs. of lemon juice in large bowl; then chopped and added rest of vegetables to bowl and tossed with the dressing. Added 1 Tbs. of apple cider vinegar to dressing in addition to the 1 Tbs. of lemon juice called for, but will use white wine vinegar next time. Will also use granulated sugar next time. While this was a colorful, tasty salad, I felt the brownness from the dressing gave it an unappetizing look and detracted from its beautiful color. The white sugar and clear vinegar will solve this problem next time. Will make again. Prepared with coleslaw mix to make it easy."

With these few changes the recipe reminded me of my mothers back in the day. Alhamdullilah It was a big hit with my wonderful husband! MashaAllah!"

People have different preferences regarding the sweetness so add a little brown sugar at a time to the dressing and get it to your taste. The only thing I did differently was - I sprinkled the chopped apples with \"Fruit Fresh\" so they were sure not to turn brown. (This is in addition to the lemon juice). Even better the second day!!"

"reviewBody": "This was excellent. I've now made it twice in the past two weeks. I followed the recipe, only omitting the peppers because of an allergy. I used two honeycrisp apples, because those are my favorite and always on hand. I wanted to stick to the recipe as much as possible to judge for myself on any changes, but based on reviews and not being a fan of too sweet, I just used a light hand on the brown sugar and a heavy hand on the mayo. I also squeezed lemon juice on the vegetables before tossing, then also added the lemon juice to the dressing the first time. I was out of lemons and low on juice the second time. I have to say, I preferred it with the extra lemon juice. Excellent. As a non-meat eater with lots of food allergies, this will be a keeper for me. Thank you!"
