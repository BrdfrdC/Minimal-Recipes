My son had won a raffle came home bag of goodies and this was in it. So, long story short looked it up ended up on my Allrecipe site so decided give it a whirl an all. All I can say is I love from scratch but for quick pain free easy clean up and quick Nummy it was worth the easy way out. Having with vanilla ice cream just made it even better. Not sure be any left for Daddy when he comes home from work. All I can say Round 2 30 minutes out of my day big smiles from my son made it taste even better. Great after lunch treat.\nTHANKS Allrecipes for another great easy make yummy!!"

And added more cinnamon and nutmeg than the recipe calls for, plus added a little to the dough. It made enough dough for 2 crisps (my dish is a 7 or 8 inch oval and is smaller than the recipe calls for). I used the whole can of apple pie filling, but wrapped and froze half of the dough. Then with another can of pie filling made the 2nd one the next week. Excellent with vanilla ice cream. Great recipe! Thanks! Note: consider removing the photos that show oatmeal covered crisps."

The ideal topping is: 1/2 c. flour, 3/4 c. oats, 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/3 c. chopped walnuts. We'd prepared it according to Jen Marshall's review and it was far too much topping for our liking. Lesson learned: If it looks like too much topping, don't add it! :) I used her ratios for these suggestions, but she was certainly right in adding the oats, it would just have a strange cakey topping. We made it with peach pie filling and it turned out wonderfully. I'm sure you could use any pie filling available. Thanks Sarena!"

I used 4 fresh sliced Granny Smith apples, teaspoon of cinnamon &amp; all spice, teaspoon brown sugar and a couple of cap fulls of dark rum. \r\nWas perfectly cooked after 45mins. Very yummy served with vanilla ice-cream."
