Made it today for pi-day (3.14) As many others recommend, I add 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 2 tbsp flour and 1 tsp vanilla extract, and mix it together in a measuring cup with the butter, sugar and cinnamon, then pour it into the cut apples and mix until well coated. Then pour into the crust and don’t spend a lot of time layering the slices, just spread around until level. I prefer a lattice top with egg wash. After 10 minutes at 450, reduced to 350 for another 45 minutes. Perfection"

I didn't need as many apple as I didn't want to create a mountain of apples at the center. I used 4 large organic Granny Smith apples. I reviewed the comments below and made a few adjustments: 1) brushed the rim of the bottom crust with egg, 2) create vents (or holes for ventilation), 3) brushed the top crust with a bit of egg and (almond) milk. Everyone loved it! Even one of the kids said it's better (in taste and smell) than store bought."

Before putting on the top crust I sprinkle some lemon juice over the apples so they are a little tart, and dot the top with butter."

I stirred @ 1/3 of the apples in the mixture and coated well and placed in the pie shell and repeated with the remaining 2/3 of the apples. \n\nWith just a few ingredients, this was a quick and easy pie that was very tasty."

He brought over two bags large of sliced apples and I happily took them knowing that my kids likes apples. There were just too many for us to eat and i flat out REFUSE to waste food especially in these trying times so i started a searchin.. Found this simple to follow recipe and had enough apple slices to make two pies! I read all the reviews and saw ppl adding all sorts of additional ingredients. I naturally follow those addition but was very disappointing with the addition of the nutmeg. Just a 1/4 tsp completely overwhelmed the normal natural flavors. I also disagree with swapping out Brown sugar for white. It just doesn't work with that change AND the addition of nutmeg. I gave one pie to my brother and we all enjoyed the 2nd pie last night. the Vanilla ice cream helped kill the overbearing nutmeg a little.. Im sure this recipe it perfectly fine without all the tweaking..."

I'm not sure I've ever followed the directions to cook the pie on the bottom rack, but now I realize that's why most of my previous pies have had mushy bottom crusts. This one was perfect."

They are essentially the same (6 c apples/cinnamon/nutmeg/flour/sugar but I just combined my apples/sugar/flour and tossed them into my waiting unbaked pie crust. I liked the baking instructions and I did use nutmeg just like Grandma."

Therefore I didnt need to add any flour to the recipe- it was perfect!\nI did, however, use only about a third to half of the sugar. Served it with vanilla frozen yogurt. It got rave reviews at our game night gathering!"

"reviewBody": "This apple pie was AMAZING! it was my first time ever making a pie from scratch and it was surprisingly pretty easy. After reading the reviews, I decided to add 2 tbsp of flour to the apples to thicken up the mixture (I cut the recipe in half). I also had to bake it for 15 minutes longer at 350 degrees F since the crust on the bottom was under cooked. Other than that, the apples tasted amazing (I used about 6 small green apples) and after dividing the recipe in half, I didn't add any extra sugar (even though I used green apples) since I'm not a fan of overly sweet things."

I mixed the 2/4 of white sugar with one 1/4 cup brown sugar and I also mixed some egg to brush the top of the pie with. After that, I sprinkled some of the sugar/cinnamon mix on it. It looks absolutely stunning, and tasted perfect! I used Ambrosia apples, but they're not too mushy at all :)"

It took an extra 15-20 minutes in the oven to start to bubble, so I covered loosely with foil to keep the crust from burning. We thought it was delicious, served it warm with vanilla ice cream and it didn't last long. Next time I will probably mix the sugar/cinnamon mixture with the sliced apples and dump it all in just to make it a little easier."

I mixed everything thing in a bowl and then tossed with the apples to get them evenly coated. I use half Granny Smith and half Johnathon apples. It makes a great flavor. I would also cover your crust with a pie crust shield and remove it the last 15-20 minutes."
