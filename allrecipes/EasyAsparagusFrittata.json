Brought to med, added remaining butter, and egg mixture: 6 duck eggs 7 tbsp milk and cheese mix (2/3 grated Romano and 1/3 Gouda), dill, parsley, salt, pepper. At 14 min was too runny in center, so covered and let sit on hot burner. Delicious!"

I will make this again and the next time will use less salt for our taste and also cut the recipe in half or use two frying pans, as the one I nave may not be large enough. I found it very difficult to get the top cooked without searing the bottom. Loved it!"
