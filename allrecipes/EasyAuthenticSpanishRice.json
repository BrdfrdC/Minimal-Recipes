Next time I think I will forget the jalapeño, little spicy for us old folks. I will used grated cheddar and sour cream when I serve it today. Ohh, I had to add about 3/4 cup water, one reason my chili tomatoes was only a 10 1/2 ounce can. It makes too much for us . I think I will half the recipe next time.. only three of us."

(For folks with 'heat' issues, Ro-tel comes in Mild, medium and hot around here.) \n\n I use this basic recipe, but add browned ground beef for a full meal. Just cooking for Hubby and I, so I use 1 can Ro-Tel, chicken stock, onion, and ground beef for us. Put a lid on the pan, and use a good lid. Extra water shouldn't be necessary. Also, make sure you are using INSTANT rice for this recipe, or cook your rice ahead of time. Been doing this recipe for nearly 40 years, gradually getting more heat since we moved to Texas. For NO heat, use regular diced tomatoes and add a little Taco seasoning or chili powder."

It is beautiful in the bowl and moist and flavorful without being too spicy. I did not add the cheese or sour cream as it really did not need it.\nThis will be my go to Spanish Rice from now on. I also did not add any additional salt as the tomatoes had plenty of sodium in them."

Therefore, I didn't use the optional jalapeno peppers. I did use Megan's suggestion (in the recipe notes) to add additional water to the rice (I added between 1/2 to 1 cup). We topped the rice off with shredded Mexican blend cheese and sour cream. Great recipe...thanks for sharing!"

I ended up having to add about 1.5 cups of water total throughout the cooking process since it was taking longer than expected for the rice to cook, and to make up for the reduced liquid from the smaller cans of tomatoes. The rice had a good amount of heat to it. If you don't like things spicy, definitely omit the jalapeños. It was perfect for me and hubby though. I highly recommend the Mexican Lime &amp; Cilantro flavored tomatoes. They lend a great flavor to the overall dish. Make sure you eat it with sour cream and cheese. SO SO good! Also keep an eye on this once the water gets low because it burns easily! This one's a keeper!"

It added flavor, a creaminess, and took away from a tad of the heat. I made only 1/2 recipe and found at 20 minutes on low it started to near burn on the bottom.

My family LOVED this spanish rice. Out of that whole pot, we ate every bite........and both my husband and oldest son were bummed there wasn't any more. For us, this recipe served four."

"reviewBody": "This recipe IS really easy. Even though it seems like the amount of butter, onions and tomatoes are excessive, keep to those proportions. If you don't want it too hot, then definitely scale back on the jalapenos. I didn't have any Mexican tomatoes on hand, so I used the same amount of canned plain, diced tomatoes and added some garlic powder, chili powder and a little cumin to taste.\n\nDon't miss down in the footnotes that water may needed to be added. I missed that and ended up adding water after it had already been cooking for 45 minutes. Mine took about 1 1/2 cups of water ( I was making a double recipe) and took about 70 minutes or so to cook. It probably wouldn't have taken that long to cook if I had added the water at the beginning. It would be nice for the water to be in the recipe rather than in the footnotes.\n\nIt might seem like I barely followed the recipe, but when I added my spices, I was just trying to guess what Mexican tomatoes had in it. I must've guessed pretty close, because it really was good! Thanks for the submission :-)"
