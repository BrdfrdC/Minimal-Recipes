Omitted onions and parmesan and used a little more Swiss cheese, used real bacon bits and added thawed frozen spinach after wringing it in paper towels to get all the liquid out. So many possibilities for this recipe like chorizo, cheddar and jalapeños or Italian sausage, mozzarella and basil. Thanks for a quick and good basic recipe."

Swiss cheese will cook into an excellent crust-like base. I usually use ham or bacon, and toss in a lot of veggies to make it healthier. I use onions, tomatoes (especially with bacon) and sweet red peppers normally. I have used cooked chicken on occasion. omitted the meat for a vegetarian meal, used almost any kind of cheese. I usually use 2% milk. Start here and then, if you like, expand to make it your way."

I will definitely make it again with all milk and see if it makes a lot of difference. I will also cut up the ham to tinier pieces too. Bacon bits make this SO easy to do!"

Was too much for one pie crust but not enough for the second, one reason for the 7th egg. Just added a little more milk and another egg."
