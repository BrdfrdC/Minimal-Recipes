"reviewBody": "Easy and delicious! This is the only beef brisket recipe I have ever made, and it comes out really well every time. My family devours this brisket! After making it exactly as written several times, I have tweaked it a bit to my personal taste. I can't have spicy food, so I use less than half the cayenne pepper, and add a teaspoon of smoked paprika to the salt and pepper mix. I season the meat the night before, rather than 8-12 hours before, just because it's more convenient, and I figure it can't hurt to sit longer. I have also made it in a pinch without seasoning ahead of time, but it really comes out better and with a greater depth of flavor if you remember to do that step. Lastly, if the apple juice or cider is really sweet, I add a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar to the braising liquid to cut the sweetness. I also don't find that we need all that gravy, so instead of blending the juice with the onions, I strain the drippings/liquid and discard the solids. I then boil down the liquid to about half and serve it as kind of a \"jus\" with the meat. Fantastic!"

I did not use rosemary because I'm not a fan, no cayenne and I used beef broth instead of apple juice. It cooked about 2 1/2 hours at 250 degrees and was so tender. I pureed the braising liquid and added a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch to thicken it a little. The liquid was so savory and delicious, the seasoning was perfect. I was serving this to a native Texan so any brisket not good would have been heresy. He really liked it too."

However next time I would reduce the cayenne by half or more as I found it quite hot - especially the gravy. I also had to make a lot more rub to have enough for the cut. I also reduced the salt by half and even then it was a little salty. I would definitely make this again tho!"

I added celery, carrots and pearl onions on the bottom on the pan so the brisket sat on that and not on the pan. My dad always said it helped the meat cook better. I then took that and blended it with the leftover onion/applesauce, blended it and marinated the meat. Literally melted in your mouth. Thanks for such a great recipe!!"

"reviewBody": "I've making this for the third time today. The first time I used blade chuck because I couldn't find actual brisket; the second time I used actual brisket. There was very little difference, but I think I actually liked the blade chuck better because the fat pad seemed just right. You do want one, for sure, but the one on the brisket was *too* thick. I leave out the rosemary because my wife doesn't like it, and the cayenne as well. Number three is rubbed and ready, using smoked paprika instead. I also like using sweet onions, though I'm not sure it makes a difference for this.\n\nThis is by far the best recipe I've found for this kind of thing. Sliders made with the leftovers are even better than the original dinner IMO. Honestly haven't had much use for the juice or gravy, but that's OK because the meat itself is *so* good."

"reviewBody": "This is an amazing recipe! I'd never made brisket before, and after the sticker shock experienced when buying a 5.5 pound hunk of meat, I really didn't want to mess it up. I used a dry rub that I had on hand (instead of just the salt and pepper) which helped flavor the gravy because I didn't have any rosemary. I also used a blender to get that gravy to the proper texture. That step is really worth the effort. With such a big piece of meat, of course there were leftovers of this melt in your mouth tender beef -so it was dinner on night #2 (and hopefully #3!) and it was so easy to heat up the meat in that gravy. For tonight, I'm going to use it to make shredded beef burritos. It also makes for scrumptious sandwiches with just the meat and gravy on a burger bun... all around approvals from the Picky Eater Family!"

"reviewBody": "I was very disappointed but maybe it wasn’t the recipe. The finished meat didn’t break apart like it did in the video. Although I asked for the correct cut, and paid $28, it was very tough. I don’t think I did anything wrong so I’m blaming it on the butcher. Looked more like pot roast. \nI found the cayenne a bit too hot and would cut back."

Results were great!! My hubby loves it!!!\nI think it could use less pepper as too spicy hot for me, but will definitely make again\n\nP.S. couldn’t find Chef John’s recipe Video for mash potato pancakes"

I also cooked it for 2 hours at 360F and then for 2 hours at 275F because I put a casserole in the oven with it for the last 2 hours. It cooked perfectly and everyone loved the gravy. I definitely love this recipe!"
