When I make this again, I'll use larger chicken breasts, since my husband wanted to know if there was more"

We were out of bread crumbs but had oat bran (I have no idea why we had oat bran, but it seemed like a good idea. Healthier anyway, right?). So, I mixed 1 cup of oat bran with 2 Tablespoons of Italian seasoning and used it as a substitute. I might actually do that from now on when a recipe calls for bread crumbs!"

The pounded chicken is sticky enough to cause the bread crumbs (Panko) to stick. After lightly browning in 3 Tbsp of oil, I placed the rolls in an oven proof dish, added the sauce and baked for 30 minutes at 350F. Delicious and tender. Great Recipe."

Mine were on the smaller size which made fitting everything difficult. I also made the sauce from another recipe as suggested by some others who complained about it being dry. I didn't find it to be dry at all but did enjoy the sauce. However, I didn't feel like it added that much so I probably won't make it again. Overall, I really enjoyed this recipe. I've always loved chicken cordon bleu and was really happy wth this easy take on it!"

(I'm not a chef and don't really enjoy cooking as much as I love eating). We love eating the melty cheese that oozes out of the chicken, be sure to line your pan with tin foil.- To that point- you can half the cheese sticks, that way, there isn't so much oozing out of the ends. Also, since it is kind of messy to make, I usually make up two batches and freeze one. Frozen chicken cooks up quick and easy on a busy weeknight. :)"

(The mix is strong out of the package and I felt one side coated was enough.) I sprinkled what was left of the mix between the breast chicken and poured the rest of the butter into the bottom of the pan, Perfect sauce on the bottom(butter and onion soup mix) and still crispy on the top,"

I only give it 4 because I'd probably want some sort of sauce for the next time I make it. Having said that, the cheese and ham kept the chicken from drying out. We served with mashed potatoes so the sauce wouldn't been great to smoosh all together. If you did make a sauce, you wouldn't need much! Thanks for helping to make my hubby feel like a pro!"

I dipped the chicken in egg (based on a review for a similar recipe) and then assembled and rolled in crumbs. Added melted butter, drizzled over the top about halfway thru baking. I do think 40 minutes is a bit long...maybe I just pounded the chicken too thin or something."

"reviewBody": "I think this recipe is great, and I made it exactly as posted the first time, but I revised it a little my second time around and ended up liking it better. I used sharp cheddar cut off of a block instead of mozzarella because I find that you can taste it more, I dipped the chicken in olive oil after I had rolled it, instead of butter to make it a little healthier, I used whole wheat italian bread crumbs which have a great flavor to them. I saved the best ingredient for last: after I dipped them in the olive oil, and before I breaded them, I sprinkled both sides of the chicken with Adobo seasoning. Just that sprinkling gave it such an amazingly different flavor and I highly recommend trying it for yourself. I hope this helps someone. Enjoy!!!"

I also baked for 30 minutes instead of 40. The chicken was done but very juicy. I prepared some chicken gravy, just in case (as some others have suggested), but found that with the chicken being so juicy, the gravy wasn't really needed. Delicious!"

I am glad she was gone too because she would never have let me roll the chicken in melted butter preferring milk or something less fattening. I followed your recipe to the letter and found it quite delicious. Next time I will add a few herbs and spices just to make this recipe my own. I'm tossing my old recipe because it was more labor intensive and doesn't come out noticeably better.\nThanks for a relatively easy and yummy recipe."
