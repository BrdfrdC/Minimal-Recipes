The first night, I tried the blender, but that didn't work very well. The second night I just mashed the chickpeas with a fork and minced the other ingredients. I flattened mine to fit better in the pita. I made the yogurt sauce also."

Worked out well.\nI also didn't make up the accompanying yogurt sauce as I didn't have fresh cucumber nor plain yogurt, so instead made a sauce of four parts sour cream and one part (leftover) Alabama White BBQ Sauce. It went well with the Falafel."

"reviewBody": "This is a tasty recipe. I may have made the balls too large because when I sprayed and flipped them, three of them broke apart. I. will try to mold them as patties next t time to see if that fixes the crumbling. I also will try adding some toasted sesame seeds to the mix next time. I was missing the Tahini taste, but not the calories. These taste just fine as is and I love the lemony flavor in them."

I didn’t make the yogurt sauce because I had my own Tzatziki recipe. Judging by the measurements in this recipe, make more, you can never have enough yogurt sauce."
