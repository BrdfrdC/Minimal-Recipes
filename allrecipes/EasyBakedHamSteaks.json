I did make an adjustment and that was thickening the liquid to make a glaze to pour over the steaks when they were done.\nBut I forgot I had to cook uncured ham steaks longer. After trying to chew them, my kids and I gave up and back in the oven they went. I did add a little more brown sugar to the liquid. Since they were uncured ham steaks I baked them an hour and a half longer at 325. When I took them out, my 6 year old wouldn't leave them alone!"

I covered the pan with foil and had no trouble with dryness. We will do this again!"

I will probably end up fixing this again."

I've baked as recipe states and I've baked it low and longer when I have to run out but want dinner ready when I get back."

"reviewBody": "This just looked like a decent start so I had to attempt.....with a few modifications of course, the original recipe just seemed to be missing a few flavor opportunities. First off.....water was replaced with no sodium chicken stock (ham or veggie stock would be great also) and a splash of bourbon. I then added a few (10) whole black peppercorns, a bay leaf, 1t. salt (on ham only), and the brown sugar I used I smoked to give it that outdoor grill taste. I also added a pinch of crushed red pepper for a little heat. Then tossed into a 425° oven ( i run all my ovens @425) for 25 min. or so until tasty hot. Not to bad for a first run, now to fine tune this and see where it takes me."

The reason why it gets three stars is because the flavors were simply too muted to really taste past the ham. If I made this again, I would use way less water-- just enough to cover the bottom of the pan, not enough to cover the ham itself-- to see if I could bring the other ingredients to the forefront. Otherwise, a very easy, straightforward recipe for dinner."

"reviewBody": "It smelled sooooo good cooking and I wanted to love it, but alas, it didn't work for me. I used the smallest bake dish the ham would fit into so I wouldn't have to dilute the flavors with lots of additional water needed to cover the ham, but the flavors (although good) were still muted. As the ham baked, it curled up above the cooking liquid. I flipped it over while cooking, but it still turned out dry. Perhaps covering the bake dish with foil would prevent the ham from drying out, or double the initial brown sugar/Worcestershire/clove mix."
