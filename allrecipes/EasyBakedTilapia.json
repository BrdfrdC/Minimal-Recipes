I couldn't find the veggie blend recommended, so I used a California medley (broccoli, cauliflower and carrots) instead. I had to cook the fish for 10 mins longer than recommended. 4 starts because it turned out well and I'd make it again but it's just a pretty basic meal, not blow your socks off good. It's easy to put together and makes for a good weeknight meal."

Even using a whole lemon isn't to much like I thought it might be, use it all for 4 tilapia."

"reviewBody": "Good, but I will modify a bit next time. I used foil &amp; Pam for the pan instead of grease, and didn't add butter. I will add just a dash of cayenne, 1/8 tsp pepper, 1/8 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp garlic powder instead of salt, and only a splash of lemon juice. I will also try with fresh vegetables instead of partially thawed frozen veggies. I will stick to veggies on the sides of the fish or in a separate pan because veggies on the top made the fish not cook as quickly. I will cover the pan and cook for 15-20 minutes, then add Parmesan and bread crumbs and cook for 15-20 minutes more with no cover."

I seasoned the filets with Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning, dried parsley and garlic powder, and placed a pat of butter and sliced lemon on each filet. I also threw some raw asparagus in the baking dish as well. For the last 10 min of baking (out of 25) I sprinkled breadcrumbs on top of the filets.\n\nNote: I used fresh veggies. I've tried based on the directions with frozen veggies but the fish didn't cook well, you should defrost beforehand."

Great dish that I will make again and again!??"
