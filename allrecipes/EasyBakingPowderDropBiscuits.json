I also didn't use quite as much milk as allowed in the recipe but stopped when it got good and sticky. The biscuits rose beautifully and were nice and soft on the inside and held together well."

Also a 1/2 teaspoon of Lemon Juice or any acid it interacts with the Baking Powder to make them rise a little more per biscuit.As for Baking Powder 1/4 teaspoon per biscuit.Any seasoning to taste like salt,Garlic Powder,Italian Seasoning,Cinnamon etc.If I use Cinnamon I like adding Raisins &amp; drizzling with a icing glaze which you can make with Powdered Sugar &amp; Milk or water or Orange Juice. I bake &amp; cook alot."

"reviewBody": "The salt/baking powder ratio is off, the sugar makes it taste weird and 450 degrees is too hot so it burns the bottoms. I adjusted the recipe and tried a second time. Increase salt to 1 tsp, omit the sugar and bake 12-14 minutes at 375 degrees. Now it is a good base that tastes like a nice light baking powder biscuit. Stands on its own or you can add garlic powder, parsley and shredded cheddar cheese to make cheddar biscuits."

It still looked too wet but I went with it and my biscuits were flat because they didn't have enough flour. They actually tasted not half bad so I gave this recipe 2 stars. I have never had a lot of success following other peoples recipes and having it turn out right so I think I will continue to use my own from now on."

"reviewBody": "I agree with most that this recipe seems runny. What I actually do is use a small Pyrex and coat it generously with Pam. Then I drop the biscuits and spray one at a time with more Pam. Yes they touch but the Pam later in between actually separates them in the oven. Then I do one last little spray of Pam on top before oven. It bakes for about 20-25 minutes and they turn out with nice crispy edges and a bit square. Which I prefer for my sausage gravy. Of course you can drop them into a cookie sheet and keep separate but I’d still add some Pam on top for that amazing golden crisp!"

I followed the recipe to the T. It was so runny that I thought oh boy I will just taste it first. I had to go ahead an make it because I could not waste my product without being sure. When I tell you I fell in love and so did my whole family. It was like something had just took our tongue on a ride. The only recipe I will use from this day forward."
