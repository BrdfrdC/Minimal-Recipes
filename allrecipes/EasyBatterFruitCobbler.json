They cook in half the time. Mine was ready at 25 minutes but I let it alone for 30 just to get it extra crunchy and golden brown. It was really good and I think I will use just this recipe from here on out. Don't mind the missing corner. Quality control had to approve it. 😆"

"reviewBody": "I made a blackberry cobbler a couple of nights ago and it was delicious. I used this recipe as a framework, not following it exactly. I used two 6 oz. packages of berries. I mixed about 1/3 cup of the sugar in with the berries and let them sit for a half hour or so. I used Bisquick instead of the flour and left out the baking powder and salt. I used another 1/3 cup of sugar in the batter. I browned the butter a bit first. I have read quite a number of cobbler recipes and it seems about half call for the fruit to go in first and half call for the batter first. I had made a blueberry cobbler the week before with the berries on top so decided to switch it up for this cobbler. I really could not see any difference as it was going into the oven. I cooked it for about 45 minutes and then put some sanding sugar on top for the last 10 minutes. It was delicious. Thanks for sharing such an EZ and tasty recipe!"

As always when I use fresh fruit in a recipe, I toss gently with a little bit of flour or cornstarch to no only thicken, but prevent the fruit from all sinking to the bottom. I thought the 55-60 cook time sounded long ang was proved right - mine only took 35-40 minutes. I can't wait to try this with other fruits I have on hand, as well as with apples in the fall. Oh, and a must have with vanilla ice cream for us - Thank you!"

"reviewBody": "I had never tasted a fruit cobbler before this one, but it was a good first experience. I followed the recipe exactly and used both blackberries and raspberries for mine. There were many in my family who had had cobbler before and they said it was delish. It was mushy, but not in a bad way. It was not super sweet, but not NOT sweet: it was just right with the sugar. My crust got a little too crispy in some areas, but otherwise it was a very satisfying desert. It was also super easy to make. I thought cobblers would be more complicated, like a pie, and was relieved to find I was wrong. This fruit cobbler is a delicious and easy to make dessert that I highly recommend for any bakers, beginner or otherwise."

Next time I make it, I am going to sprinkle a cinnamon/sugar/nutmeg mix on top instead of just sugar. Thanks for this! I will be making this more in the future."

Today I didn’t have milk, so used oat milk. I cut on sugar to 1/4 of cup. I used Costco frozen berries and sometimes add some frozen cherries.

I always add cinnamon to it, otherwise it's perfect."

"reviewBody": "Our family really enjoyed this very easy dessert last night! I ended up using frozen berries. I bought a 3 lb bag of triple berry mix (blueberries, blackberries and raspberries). After looking at reviews I added more fruit. I used 15 oz. instead of 12 oz. It was the perfect amount! The extra frozen berries will come in handy for other recipes or to make this again! On a whim I decided to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the batter too. I can see us having this dessert throughout the summer! Thanks!"

I put the dish back it and cooked for another 10 minutes and it didn't firm up. I have made a blueberry cobbler, with a similar batter, and it turned out wonderful. I think I will try substituting strawberries with that recipe. I hope others have better success with this recipe than I have."

Only change i've madd was i did not pour the batter on top of the melted butter. When i did that all the butter went to the edges and which ended up burning. The next time..i gently poured it in so the butter did not retreat as easily. No more burnt edges!"
