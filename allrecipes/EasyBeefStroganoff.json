I put the mushrooms in the food processor and coarsely chopped them, so they looked like the ground beef (shhh, my husband hates mushrooms). I then cooked the onion and mushrooms along with the ground beef and added garlic cloves. Then I continued with the recipe as written. This is a very flavorful main dish and is worthy of serving to company."

Of course, she won't be putting on the pounds that I will. :-) \nI was so excited that I had all the ingredients - which made it go smoothly. I used the Large Egg -no yoke -noodles for the first day and white rice later. Both were delicious! Oops! I forgot to take a picture - it was appetizing with noodles or rice.\nThanks so much for this recipe - it's a keeper. \nRobbie C. \nMeadows Place, TX"

I served with some diced raw onion and bread/butter. You will prob have to doctor it up more too. Hubby said it was good but he won't complain since he didn't cook unless it was really bad. It's a good base recipe to start with then add your special touches/flavors to your liking."

I think fresh mushrooms would have been better."

It seems like they actually wants you to keep the grease and thicken with flour, but not only is it horrible for you, it's going to make a very bland, greasy dish. I drained the beef, but didn't compensate for the liquid lost, so it came out thicker. Next time I will drain and add another cup of broth."

I sauteed everything in coconut oil(the unflavored/unscented variety) and used up leftovers in the fridge.....leftover steak and leftover rice, and added a couple of shakes of Worchestershire sauce. What a delicious dinner. My son loved it, as did I. Normally he won't touch mushrooms, but he gobbled this up. This one is a keeper for the next time we have uneaten cooked steak we need to use up. Great job, thanks for the recipe!!!!!!"
