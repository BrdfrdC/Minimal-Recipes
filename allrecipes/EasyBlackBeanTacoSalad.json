"reviewBody": "Very good. I've been making an almost identical taco salad for years that I had adapted from the taco salad that uses Catalina dressing and Doritios. I usually use a homemade taco seasoning for this. We layer the tortilla chips on first, crunch them down with our hands, and add whatever toppings we desire-I serve them separately. We like the black beans better than kidney beans, and I usually have some I've cooked from dried in the freezer. A nice quick, relatively cool, easy meal during the summer."

"reviewBody": "After traveling a good part of the day to get to Naples, I wanted neither restaurant food nor a make- at- home dinner that required a good deal of time (hey, I got up at 3:00 this morning!). Cruising the website while at 37,000 feet led me to this recipe. A quick stop at the grocery store for just a few things and less than a half hour in the kitchen, and a very good and satisfying dinner was served. I wasn't fond of the layering instructions, so I just put all the goodies out for Hubs and me to build our own - this way everyone has it \"their way.\" Served with an ice cold margarita, this really hit the spot."

I used lean ground beef and \"Taco Seasoning II\" from this site and didn't bother with the water, just seasoned the beef and browned it. I de-seeded a few plum tomatoes before dicing and used a light Mexican blend cheese. I added some chopped black olives and green onion for a better presentation and cut back on the sour cream and chips using just enough for each salad. To lighten it up a bit I used light sour cream and baked chips..."

Makes for a nice fast dinner."
