"reviewBody": "Awful! Whoever decided to add all of that melted butter was off, in my opinion. Way too much butter. Needs at least 1 tsp of baking powder. Needs a pinch of salt if you unsalted butter. Mine was swimming in butter around the edges and stuck all over the pan despite the pan being prepared. The rest of it tried to fall apart… not in crumbles… in gooey chunks. I don’t think anyone that claims that they made this by following the recipe listed and says that it is wonderful or fantastic is being honest because this recipe just doesn’t work as written and needs to be reviewed and revised. The recipe, is glue paste baked in fruit and butter that turns to jam thanks to all of that sugar. If you want to try to make it… it can be easy, but the butter needs to be decreased and the baking soda needs to be added. Too much milk."

I think we made more peach cobblers than blueberry, because canned peaches in heavy syrup were less expensive. Mine is in the oven still, so the pic is a while cooking shot, not a finished shot."

"reviewBody": "I was looking for a recipe to replicate one that won a 'picnic' throwdown, and she said it was her grandmother's recipe, with simple ingredients, flour, milk, sugar, baking powder, and blueberries. This was the closest recipe I could find to that description. Her edges were carmelized, and when asked about that, she said she sprinkled some sugar on top. I did read many reviews, which said to reduce the butter, but I love butter, and thought that might be key to the caramelization of the batter portion, so I went with the full stick. She also said that no matter what kind of fruit you use, it will turn out great, so I used fruit I had on hand, blueberries, cherries, apricots, and mangoes. I definitely got the caramelization, but I had to bake it an hour and a half. Hers had showing on top 50/50 fruit and chewy dough, mine mostly fruit, so next time I will pour in batter, some fruit, and some batter on top. I can see where someone said the 1/2 cup butter made it goopy, which it did at the one hour mark, hence adding 10 minutes 3 times to total 90 minutes to get past goopy. I got what I wanted though, slightly chewy caramely edges and to die for fruity cobbler."

I used salted butter and 3/4c sugar instead of my usual full sugar amount and a pinch of salt. Sweetness is just right! I used buttermilk left over from making banana bread and 1/4c more four. Also added cinnamon and a tiny bit of vanilla. It’s VERY GOOD!!! I took the pic after I cut it though. Boo. Happy baking!"

I caught him up in the middle of the night snacking on it. Lol The second one I realized I was out of a few ingredients when it was too late. I decided to use strawberries this time since I had some that needed to be used. I was out of self rising flour so used regular flour and added salt and baking powder. Out of white sugar so substituted with equal measure of brown sugar. I'm thinking ok good I have everything else...until I opened the fridge to take the milk out and its empty. So, I throw in a half teaspoon of vanilla, an egg &amp; half a can of sweetened condensed milk. Then a half a cup of water to thin out the canned milk and followed the rest of the recipe. It came out fantastic. You can literally change up everything and it's still delicious!"

Since I don't keep self-rising flour at home, I added 1 tsp baking soda and 1/4 tsp salt as recommended by a Google search. Besides that I followed the recipe as written. Turned out very spongy, rubbery, and flat with WAY too many blueberries. I then read all the reviews and found that those who liked it used 1.5 tsp of flour and 1/2 tsp of salt if they didn't have self-rising flour and used less butter and added vanilla and cinnamon. Soooo, the second time I decreased the butter to 5 Tbls, upped my baking soda and salt, and put in less blueberries. As it was baking it looked SO much better and was rising nicely. But when it was done, it had fallen and, even though it was a little better as far as cake to fruit ratio, it was still spongy and rubbery. I gave it two stars because it wasn't so awful my co-workers didn't eat it, but it certainly isn't worth making again, unless you like flat spongy cake. Then it's just OK. Sorry. This one needs to go back to the drawing board."

"reviewBody": "I REALLY wanted to like this. I even made it twice to be fair. The first time was a flop. Since I don't keep self-rising flour at home, I added 1 tsp baking soda and 1/4 tsp salt as recommended by a Google search. Besides that I followed the recipe as written. Turned out very spongy, rubbery, and flat with WAY too many blueberries. I then read all the reviews and found that those who liked it used 1.5 tsp of flour and 1/2 tsp of salt if they didn't have self-rising flour and used less butter and added vanilla and cinnamon. Soooo, the second time I decreased the butter to 5 Tbls, upped my baking soda and salt, and put in less blueberries. As it was baking it looked SO much better and was rising nicely. But when it was done, it had fallen and, even though it was a little better as far as cake to fruit ratio, it was still spongy and rubbery. I gave it two stars because it wasn't so awful my co-workers didn't eat it, but it certainly isn't worth making again, unless you like flat spongy cake. Then it's just OK. Sorry. This one needs to go back to the drawing board."

I thought it was delicious! I can't imagine using all the butter as the original recipe states. The next time I will cut sugar just a bit not because the dish was too sweet, just to not use so much sugar."

Thought I'd fill you in on mine so you don't make them too. \n\nFirst of all I only had all purpose flour. I guess you absolutely need self rising. I didn't notice that before filling or I would have added baking powder or soda (which ever helps as a leavening ingredient) My dough just stuck to the bottom of the pan all gooey. My fault.\n\nI used almond milk since I can't have dairy and vegan butter. I know the almond milk would have been fine but not so sure about the butter. That was a lot of butter for an 8\" dessert! So I don't know if the butter messed up the pastry or if it was the all purpose flour. \n\nThe berries tasted delicious but again very buttery. Maybe because of the dough but I am not too sure that is just too much butter. \n\nTakes a lot of berries so it is a bit expensive. We will scoop out the berries and use them on ice cream so they are not wasted."

I would consider myself a moderately good baker, and this really leaves something to be desired. First of all, it uses WAY too much butter, and I love butter. I cut the butter amount to 5 TB, and that was still plenty, if not too much. It definately needed vanilla, so I added some of that. The texture was just off, not like a cobbler. It was overly sticky and greasy, which I think affected the overall texture. I really can't put my finger on it. It wasn't bad, just not what I was going for. Overall, I may need to keep searching for a good cobbler recipe! This just wasn't it for me."
