I added 1TB Mrs Dash, salt and fresh ground pepper. I followed the measurements with my substitutes. They turned out perfect, and tastey. I sure if you made it to your tastes you will very happy with it."

She loved them (middle schooler); and it occurred to me how great these would be for kids AND adults on the run. I put leftovers in a ziplock bag in the refrigerator. They rewarm in the microwave wonderfully. \nThink is a keeper."
