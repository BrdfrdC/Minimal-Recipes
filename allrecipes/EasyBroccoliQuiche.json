This just didn’t work at all for me. It was so liquidy and didn’t cook fully (I exceeded the cooking time after it didn’t set at 45 minutes). I see a lot of comments now about major tweaks made. I went on the ratings themselves and should have dug deeper. Read up on basic guidelines to creating a good quiche and skip this one."

I had 1/2 of an onion in the frig so I used that. If I had mozz cheese I might have used it but didn't so used 2 slices of havarti and 2 slices of provolone. Bake time was about 50 minutes. This made a nice 9\" pie. I'll keep this recipe. I made my own crust---Perfect Pie Crust recipe."

Still didn't turn out too bad.\n100% agree, never use frozen broccoli ladies and gentlemen!\n\nAs in every recipe I've ever made for quiche, way too much egg/milk mixture! I would do as another reviewer said, use 5 eggs and at the most 1 cup of milk...even 4 eggs and 1 cup milk would work I'm sure.\nI used a half a sweet onion. 1 whole cooking onion would be too strong imho.\nI also added more garlic and next time I will use far more broccoli. It tends to shrink a little when you cook it in the pan and I'd want it to come right up to the tip top of my crust! \nThe nice thing is, you can adapt this and add ham, mushrooms or whatever you like."

After my first attempt, I learnt to use half the ingredients for a good quiche. I love veggies, so I add zucchini in addition to the broccoli and the result is amazing! I'm also not a big fan of cheese, so end up using less than half the amount recommended, but I'm yet to get a bad review on the quiche. It's wholesome and so yummy, guests always come back for seconds and go looking for third helpings. I cut a star only because my first attempt got burned due to all the extra filling. Try this recipe, you won't regret it!"

Overall, I thought it turned out pretty good, but I would make a few adjustments next time....LESS onion (1/4-1/2 an onion), less milk! It was completely overflowing my deep dish pie crust and took 45 minutes to bake, and even then, I think it could have been in a bit longer. I took the advice of another and put some cheese on the bottom and sides of the crust to help not get soggy - which I would recommend everyone does. I also wouldn't cheat this with frozen broccoli, I used fresh and it was moist, so can't imagine with frozen. Enjoy!"

I steamed my broccoli under plastic wrap in my microwave and used the entire head, so I added an egg to the wet mix. I was able to make four of the dishes, baked 2 at a time, and then 6 cupcakes lined with 2 wonton wrappers each...so this made 5 meals for me (froze the cupcakes)! I let the edges get to the point of almost burnt to be sure the bottoms were done and I had put a layer of shredded cheese in the bottom to try and keep it from getting soggy. Plus more cheese on top of course (mozz and cheddar)"

"reviewBody": "With any recipe on ALLRECIPES, I always read thru many reviews. I don't want to waste time making a dish that doesn't taste good to my liking or is a complete flop. So, sometimes I'll tweak it based upon other's experiences to avoid this.\n\nWHAT I LIKED: This quiche is simple, easy, and can be used as a good \"base\" to switch out the veggies/meat/cheese type. For this, I used broccoli, onion, both cheddar &amp; Italian blend shredded cheese.\n\nWHAT I CHANGED: I didn't use melted butter. I used 1 cup fat free half/half. I used 1/4 large white onion. I used 6 large eggs. \n\nPREPARATION: I did what other reviewers suggested, I baked cheese in the bottom of piecrust (frozen crust shell) to keep the bottom firm. I cooked the onion, veggies, butter, garlic in pot until soft. In the other bowl I beat the eggs very fluffy, added garlic salt, dash of salt/pepper, bacon crumbles, and cheese. Then I combined the veggies to the egg mixture and stirred. I noticed the batter was nice &amp; thick, so didn't worry about cooked consistency. I filled the pie shell to top. Placed on cookie sheet just in case it dripped over.\n\nCOOK TIME: I baked at 350 for 45 mins. Let completely cool on stovetop. Placed onto cake plates to serve.\n\nREVIEW: This quiche turned our perfect! It's fluffy, flavorful and looks good. I'll be using this exact method next time alternating the veggies!"

I cooked it for 60 minutes and the top browned, but as the image shows, when I removed 4 pieces, enough liquid remained to fill in the missing places 1\" deep. Several guests refused to eat it, but I made my boys eat it. The taste is fine, but 1 onion is pretty strong."

I also added about 1/4 cup or less of crumbled turkey sausage (cooked) for a heartier dish. I baked it for 40 min, but had to pop it back in the oven for an additional 10 min because it was really runny. I will still make this in the future and it was still delicious, but even after a total of 50 min, the bottom was very watery. Thanks for sharing a delicious recipe overall!"

No issue with wetness as the fresh broccoli was cooked in a wok under high heat (which tends to dry it out). We also used the bacon grease instead of butter. Lovely bacon flavor throughout. And we carmelized the onions under low heat before adding the broccoli. This mellowed the onions and added some sweetness to the dish. Net (for the whole pie) 1760 calories of which 920 were from fat."
