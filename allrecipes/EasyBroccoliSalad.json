To make the dressing, we whirled everything in the food processor and only used enough olive oil to make it 'creamy'. I think 1/3C of oil would be too much."

As far as taste, texture and calories, I didn't mind the amount of olive oil called for, but I do agree with everyone that it can be reduced, especially if you're in diet mode. Jillian gave us a great suggestion to try fresh green beans or brussel sprouts &amp; Nana Deb added cauliflower. Their ideas inspired me to go crazy with it and try a medley - smaller cuts of broccoli, cauliflower, quartered brussel sprouts, green beans, carrots, button mushrooms and fresh chopped parsley. My crew thought it was tasty. I've also made the dressing as a salmon marinade with addition of dried dill &amp; tarragon (I loved it but got mixed reviews from the crew). I'm taking the medley version to a bbq tomorrow so I thought I'd share my thoughts and let all of you know how much I appreciate and inspired by your ideas.

Needless to say it was quite oily and the flavor was lost. I tried adding more of the other ingredients and I added way too much lemon, that of course was my fault. I'm sure I will get a chance to try it again because I like other ways to eat broccoli other than just steamed."

Follow Chef John's video.\nI just have to add to my review: we have made this several times since my last rating and I LOVE this stuff!! I follow the video exactly for cutting it and putting it in cold water to stop the cooking. I do cut the oil though, because it would be way too oily if we did not. When I make it now I have to make extra we love it so much. I have never been a fan of broccoli in the past and do not really care for it raw. But I have become a fan of broccoli because of this recipe. It is simple to make and the red pepper flakes give it a nice appearance and pizzazz if making it for company."

"reviewBody": "Great, simple recipe! I had a package with both broccoli and cauliflower combined, so I added both to this recipe, and it was delicious. I also added a bit of sweet to the vinegarette to balance the flavor a bit (agave syrup). I wanted to also comment on Chef John's video presentation. He has a wonderful down-to-earth way about him and I picked up a lot of good tips about broccoli preparation in general from this video. Thanks for the recipe, Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "Who knew something so simple could be so good? This has such a fresh clean taste. The dressing is a bit more acidic than I like but that's just me. I added about 1/2 tsp honey to balance it out. We'll have this often! I bet this would be great with asparagus, too. Tomorrow night!"
