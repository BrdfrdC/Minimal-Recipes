Rubbing the garlic on the bread is a little time consuming and it also makes it very powerful. Save some time and put just a little into the tomato mixture. I agree with the others, add some cheese and, I used fresh basil like it called for but I think dried basil would have been fine. All in all, worked out all right for the party."

"reviewBody": "I absolutely love bruschetta, and this recipe is authentic and very close to the recipe that I use, so I'm reviewing this one to put in a good word for it. The only things that I do differently are to brush the bread with a little olive oil before toasting, and to leave out the onion and instead add shredded mozzerella cheese to the mixture. Cooks, be sure to use Roma plum tomatoes; it's the only way to make bruschetta. I'd also caution people to be careful not to rub too much garlic on the bread; it will overpower the tomato mixture and ruin the recipe! Which would be really, really tragic."

Rubbing the garlic directly on the bread may make it strong -- but it IS the authentic method -- it's how they did it while I was in Italy. One good suggestion is to drizzle olive oil over the top of the tomatoes. FRESH basil is NECESSARY for this recipe!! Great, Authentic Recipe!!\r\ndeb"

The basic recipe just seems way too bland. Even with these modifications, I would probably make it stronger tasting next time. Overall, this is a great recipe...just needs some spicing up.
