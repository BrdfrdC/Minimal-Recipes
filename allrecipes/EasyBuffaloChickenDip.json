"reviewBody": "I kind of used this as a starter recipe which made it easy and took into account some of the reviews! It didn’t seem to have enough sauce for our taste so I basically tripled it! I used almost two full 16 oz bottles of buffalo sauce, 2 packets of Ranch dressing (daughter hates blue cheese), 1 package 8 oz softened cream cheese, about 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheese and 3 large chicken breasts shredded. I mixed it all leaving 1/2 cup shredded cheese for topping. Put it all in the dish and baked at 375 for 25 min and it was AMAZING!"

I baked bone-in skin-on chicken breasts seasoned with Papa's Seasoning blend from this site and then shredded the meat (makes gloriously tasty moist chicken). I couldn't find the Marzetti brand of blue cheese dressing so used a different brand. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Be sure to warn people who can't handle spicy heat very well because it is spicy. But oh-so-delicious! Winner!"

"reviewBody": "Fantastic yet simple recipe. Aside from the shredding of the chicken, this was as simple as dumping the ingredients into a bowl, then baking. If you are reading this, give this a try.\n\nONE WARNING: Warn your guests that this dip is hot. Spicy hot (and maybe temp hot, too). We had a guest load up their tortilla chips with the dip expecting cheesy and was taken back by the heat. It is a wonderful flavor, sure to please, but make sure your guests know what they are getting.\n\nWill make this again and again. Perfect dip for those who like buffalo chicken! Only comment on the recipe is \"3 chicken breasts\" is too vague for me. We have 1lb breasts and 3lbs of chicken would be a bit too much. Wished it was stated in cups or better yet ounces."

"reviewBody": "This was a big hit. My brother even asked for the recipe, and I don't think he's ever done that before. We live in the Buffalo area, so the bleu cheese in the recipe resonated with me. So many wing-dip recipes call for ranch dressing. I used Frank's Hot Sauce for that authentic Buffalo wing taste. I found that it needed to cook just a bit longer or at a slightly higher temperature to get it nice and hot all the way through. 15-20 minutes was not long enough."
