I substituted Stevia for the sugar and Bragg's Liquid Aminos for soy sauce to improve the health of this dish. I also substituted crushed red pepper for the Korean pepper flakes because I didn't have those on hand. Super easy recipe and turns out amazing. Make sure to use fresh ginger and garlic. Using fresh is always way better than using powdered. My husband loved this dish and even my picky teen son gobbled it up."

I have a more involved one but this recipe is by far very good for an easy version. I have used top of the round that I find already sliced thin in the grocery store and use a pair of shears to slice it. The marinade tenderizes it nicely. I like to take the meat and cut it up and guests can take a lettuce leaf, some rice and meat and a sliver of garlic and pop it in your mouth. It is delicious and the traditional way to serve it. I would recommend this recipe."

I bought some Asian sauces for dipping as well. As a note, I did drizzle honey on the beef as I cooked it and it was good! Subtle -- you couldn't even tell it was there. I highly recommend this recipe. Use a good cut of beef!"

I did add a dab of hot spicy sauce and some ground cayenne, but next time I'll use something like Korean red pepper flakes as in the recipe, because the visual appeal of those little red flecks in the sauce is important to stimulate the appetite. \nThe meat was a little tough, so next time I'll either tenderize the meat with a mallet or use a more tender cut. \nIn spite of the problems, which were my doing, it was delicious, so I give it 5 stars."

My family enjoyed it, however I expected the tastes to be much bolder; it was rather mild though I've never had bulgogi before so perhaps that's how it's supposed to taste. It didn't knock my socks off as awesome, but we all liked it and it was a good starter recipe for a Korean food newbie like me. I will make it again if my husband requests it but probably won't think of it myself."

I only had time to marinate 15 minutes, but that did not detract from the flavor or tenderness. In addition, I did not have honey (one of the few times in my household I did not have it!) so substituted about a teaspoon of brown sugar. Served over basmati rice, with juicy sliced oranges on the side, it was wonderful. I think using FRESH ginger makes a big difference. I absolutely plan to make this again."

Served it with steamed rice, stir fry, cucumber salad, and kimchi. I used London Broil and it came out amazing, so tender and no chunks of fat or gristle to eat around. The trick is to pay attention, turn the meat onto the sauce that's burning so it stops burning and won't be wasted and turn bitter."
