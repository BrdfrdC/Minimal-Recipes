"reviewBody": "I could not give it a 5 because I didn't have all the ingredients. I didn't have cabbage, so i steamed up a bunch of brussel sprouts and chopped them up, added 1 tbsp unsalted butter to them, two medium grated carrots, 1 small bag of frozen corn. ( I wanted peas, but I was out.) I mixed together 1 lb of ground chorizo, 1 lb ground turkey, 1 lb ground beef, and cooked the mix slowly with no added oils or butter or anything in a large cast iron skillet while I attended to the prep of the vegies. when the meat was almost done, I added two tsp of fresh ground black pepper and 1 tsp cayenne pepper and four tbsp of dried minced onion, and worked it into the meat. \nAfter the meat was done cooking, I drained it in a colander, then added it to the corned beef hash (I picked up a can of this on purpose for t his dish) waiting in a mixing bowl, where I mixed them all thoroughly. \nno need to add salt to this dish.. Vegie mix tossed in, and mixed in as thoroughly as possible.\n1 can of grands buttermilk biscuits, I manually spread out each one at a time as far as I could without rendering them useless, then spread a couple small slices of gouda, tbsp shredded medium cheddar, tbsp shredded mozzarella, then two tbsp of the filling on top of that, pressed down firmly to encourage it to stay, then a tsp of alfredo sauce over that, then I folded the biscuit down and pulled the lower part up and overlapped in the middle. the sides, I pulled up, and pressed to the top of the package...."

Germans selling these in stands, along with giant pretzels and bakery goods at markets. \nI learned how to make these a while back ago but very rarely find recipes online. They are very delicious. Easy to make. And my girls love it."
