Freezing the cabbage makes the leaves so tender and easy to roll up when they defrost. I quadruple the sauce to have enough for the mashed potatoes to go with the rolls. My Polish husband says these are better than his Polish mom's recipe. I can't think of a better compliment than that! Definitely a keeper."

"reviewBody": "It's a good tasting recipe, but I prefer to make it the way my mother made it. It was a bit sweet for my taste, using the Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar. I think it should be more savory with the a bit of the sugars developing from the onions being sweated. The cabbage is also sweet if a bit of the blanching water is added to the tomato sauce. Then salt, PAPRIKA, and some lite sprinkling of fresh herbs...even a little Italian seasoning works, or terragon and oregano. I'm not used to the lemon, but the acid does help to develop sugars when there is not sugar added. This recipe is good in a pinch."

I thought this would be a drag but it was quite easy! Definitely will make again."

"reviewBody": "This is a really good recipe. I like the flexibility of making this dish using the crockpot. I did make a few minor changes just based on my family's preferences. To the meat mixture, I added 1/2 lb of ground pork to the ground beef, 2 cloves of minced garlic, and reduced the black pepper to 1/2 teaspoon. The sauce is great as is, but I did double the recipe which was the perfect amount for us. Like others, I cored the cabbage head then dropped the whole thing in boiling water. The leaves cook a couple minutes, then fall off the head. Take them out as they cook and seperate from the head. I cut some of the thickness off the center spine of the leaf to make it easier to roll. Use about 1/4 cup of the meat mixture per leaf and roll them up. (To roll up, place the 1/4 cup of meat near the bottom of the leaf by the large spine. Roll the bottom of the leave over the meat, fold in the leaf on each side, then roll the whole thing over to the end of the leaf) By the time you're done with the first few leaves, the next couple will be ready. Keep rolling a few at a time and you're done before you know it. This time I even stuffed the small leaves which are the perfect size for our little ones to try. Use the rest of the small pieces to sprinkle over the top of the dish. Pour over all the sauce and let it cook in the crockpot for 9 hours. Thanks for a great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I loved the taste and the ease of this recipe. However, I did not have time to use the slow cooker, so I simply cooked it in the oven. I had a small cabbage from our garden that had very tight leaves, so I cut out the core and boiled it whole until I could peel the leaves apart. Then I boiled all the leaves a little longer. The small inside leaves I used too, by cutting them up and placing them in the bottom of the pan to help prevent any sticking or burning (as suggested in another review). I will use this recipe again as it turned out so well, even the rice worked out! This recipe \"uncomplicated\" making Cabbage rolls and would recommend it to anyone who has had difficulty before or making them for the first time."

Then modify it to your taste each time thereafter.\n\nFor myself, I found the meat to be drier than I prefer. So I switched to 80/20 ground beef and used uncooked rice which absorbed the juice. You can also use a ground beef/ground pork combination for even more flavor. I reduced the pepper to 1/2 tsp instead of 1 1/4 tsp. There wasn't enough sauce to cover all the cabbage rolls in the CrockPot. So I doubled all the ingredients for the sauce. It was the perfect amt the second time around."

"reviewBody": "I've long wanted to recreate this family favorite that my Polish Grandmother used to prepare, but unfortunately never wrote down. After considering all of the suggestions and testing more than a few, I settled on the following, which produced a dish that closely mirrored that which I remembered and received a unanimous thumbs-up from the family! (My apologies to those from whom I borrowed ideas without proper credit.) \n\n#1 Instead of boiling peeled leaves, I recommend that you, â€œGet a very large pot of water and bring up to a small boil; as you're waiting for the water to boil core the cabbage head with a fairly wide margin at the top and take off the outer leaves that are dirty. Once the water is hot, place the cabbage head into the boiling water. Once the outside leaves start to separate from the head, remove to a dish or bowl and check that the stem area is soft and pliable. Depending on the cabbage, you may need to help the peeling process along. â€œ\n\n#2 I cooked the rice in water with 2 beef bouillon cubes added to it. (don't add extra salt to the meat mixture though.) To the meat, I added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and increased the onion to a whole medium. (My family are big onion fans.) This increase turned out well and didn't overwhelm.\n\n#3 I replaced the 8 ounces of tomato sauce with two 29-ounce cans of No Salt Added, Crushed Tomatoes and doubled the remainder of the sauce ingredients."

There was way too much sauce this way and we ended up throwing most of it away after dinner."
