Because my 83 year old mother doesn't eat onions, peppers or spicy seasonings, I cut the onion and bell pepper in quarters so it would be easy to pick out of her meal but the taste would still be there! I also omitted the cayenne pepper and hot sauce and used shrimp instead of chicken. The taste was still absolutely delicious!!!"

Excellent recipe for a Cajun inspired tomatoless Jambalaya. I seasoned it with Greek Seasoning, Secret Aardvark Serrabanero, and added butter. Really nice recipe to use with leftover proteins like we did. Used leftover chicken breast, chicken sausages, and ground turkey patties."

I made the Cajun seasoning I found on the board, but its so yummy... Thank you for sharing this recipe!"

Our first addition was adding Portuguese linguisa with the rest of the meat. We then added a can of diced tomatoes after the veggies and seasoning. We allowed the onions to translucent before adding rice and chicken stock with bay leaves like stated but added the chicken stock slowly as the the rice cooked in the remaining grease from meat! We cooked shrimp in a different pot with other hot spices and vinegar to add to the main dish for those who like it spicy."

I also cooked the rice separately. Each recipe I’ve tried prior is a bit different in ingredients and taste but I must say, this is as good as any jambalaya I ate when vacationing in New Orleans! I will definitely be using this easy recipe again!"

Oh....and I also added shrimp. Next time I will try to add spinach as well."

The changes I made: I used Hillshire Farms smoked andouille sausage instead of kielbasa. It has a mild heat. I added two tablespoons of tomato paste to give it more of the red color. At the end of the cooking, I added a pound of shrimp and continued to cook it until the shrimp were just opaque. I served it with a baguette and a side of sour cream (especially for my daughter-in-law who cannot take very much heat in her food). I found the heat to be very acceptable and this is now one of my favorite recipes which I plan on making again."

The rice cooked fine, just was much more than my family likes. And we Like rice.\nI didn't add the hot sauce (cause I don't do spicy at all). But without that \"something\" I found it bland. So maybe next time I'll get some mild chilies to put in it."

I did less hot sauce than it called for because of the kids and then my husband and I put extra on ours on our plates. I love how easy this was. Especially since I already had diced peppers and onions in the freezer from a meal the week before. I also used plain rice that was left over from a meal a few days before. I cut down the chicken broth by about 1 1/2 cups because of it. Easy and tasty! Thanks for the great recipe!"
