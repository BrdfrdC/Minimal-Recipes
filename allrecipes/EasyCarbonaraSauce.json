"reviewBody": "This was a great base recipe for carbonara! All I did different was use Oscar Meyer Turkey bacon ( it's the best) because I can't eat pork, added 2 cups peas to the sauce and used 1/2 cup dry white white instead of water. I honestly didn't think it was going to come out as good as it did was pleasantly surprised. I only had the small rigatoni past, not spaghetti, and my husband and I actually preferred it as the sauce has somewhere to ooze out out of. Lol. He loved it. This was so easy it will definitely be a staple for us!"

I was concerned about the lack of seasonings, but due to the saltiness from the bacon, and the seasonings from the jar of sauce, it didn't need a single adjustment, and my kids ate two servings. We served this with thin whole wheat spaghetti and it paired beautifully."
