A package of cream cheese is 8 ounces not 3. So I went with my gut and used 4 ounces for my half recipe. This yield 9 cup cakes. I baked them for 40 mins. The cake was moist and texture ratio was perfect. The frosting was easy and turned out silky and smooth. Very delicious!!! My son approved. Thank you"

I may try the modification of baking powder like others say they did and I might use 1/4 less oil just to see if those modifications make it better. But we LOVED it as is and happy to keep it just the way it is written here. I made the frosting just as written and will be using it as my go to cream cheese frosting from now on. For just once a year it is worth all the decadence this cake has to offer."

I took it out of the oven much earlier and it was still not as moist as I was hoping, but that easily couldâ€™ve been some incorrect measurement, etc. I also added little embellishments with white chocolate and walnuts, (mainly to cover up my terrible frosting job). Iâ€™d definitely go for twice the frosting. I made a layer cake with only two layers and I had to make a second batch of frosting to cover it all. Although, I think that anyone only doing 1 layer will be fine if youâ€™re not too generous. Otherwise, I absolutely loved it, and so did my extended family. Additionally, that frosting is TO DIE FOR."

"reviewBody": "I normally use the Sam's Famous Carrot cake recipe on here (if you haven't tried it, you must!) but I didn't have any pineapple and was in a pinch so I tried this one as a back up. I would say it's \"Just ok\". I wish I would have read the other reviews so I would have known to add baking powder and reduce the oil, because it really did need it. It came out dense and oily. I don't mind dense carrot cake per say, in fact the Sam's one is pretty dense, but this one just didn't have the flavor I was looking for. I would say this is a good stand by easy recipe though if you just want to make something quick. I would say, add the baking powder, reduce the oil, and add more cinnamon than recipe calls for. I also did not use the frosting recipe and used the Cream Cheese icing II one (it really is the best)."

Baking Soda.\nAdded 1 tsp ground Nutmeg.\nAdded 1 tsp ground Cardamom.\nFrosting:\nI used a version of the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe but changed the ratios to:\n5/8 cup Cream Cheese.\n3 Tbsp. Butter.\n1 Cup Confectioners Sugar.\n1 tsp vanilla extract.\nThis was enough to fully cover the top and sides of the cake baked in a 9\" Bundt pan.\nNext time I will try it with a jar of carrot baby food."

They swapped sun-maid Raisins for the walnuts and did have the carrots in a Parmesan grater making more of a mush than strings. Well after they completed it and iced it I have to say this is truly a very moist cake and probably the best carrot cake I can remember eating! We will make this again! Note we did use a convection oven set for baking."
