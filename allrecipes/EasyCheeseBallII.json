I followed other reviewers advice right off that bat because it sounded like it would fit our tastes a little better. I only used 3/4pk of dry Ranch dressing mix and rolled the chilled cheese ball in real bacon bits vs nuts (because everything's better w/bacon right?). Everyone was impressed and I've been writing down the four ingredient recipe and handing it out left and right. This will definitely be on the appetizer table this Thanksgiving (w/Ritz crackers) and many get togethers to come. Thanks!"

I tasted it right after I made it and wow.... All I tasted was the Ranch seasoning mix. Bleh. However, I made it a day before my party and its amazing how much better it tasted the next day. The seasoning mix disappaited and was absorbed into the cream cheese so it was much milder. My party guests really enjoyed it!"

"reviewBody": "This simple cheese ball is a party favorite in my family. I combine the cheeses/ranch mix the day before and let it rest in the refrigerator overnight. The next day, I roast the chopped pecans (makes a huge difference in the flavor profile) and roll the cheese ball in the nuts shortly before serving. (This way, the flavors of the cheese ball have a chance to meld, but the nuts stay crunchy and crisp.) Hint: Bring your cheese ball to room temperature before you roll it in the nuts (the cheese will become a little tacky and help the nuts stick to the ball)."

What I noticed that I should have definitely done was mix the cream cheese till it got to a whipped texture and then add the ranch dressing , I just dumped the package on top of the cream cheese and then started stirring and it did not mix well. Then I noticed that i should shredded my own cheese and not used the pre shredded kind it does not mix well."

I add smoked paprika to give the base cheese a smokey flavor... then remove 1/2 of the mixture set aside. To the remaining 1/2 I add jalapeños, banana peppers, cayenne, chipotle in adobe, habaneros... whatever pepper you like - my friends like it hot. \n\nTo the original batch I add additional smoked paprika to the nuts (and I usually use smoked almonds because I buy them in bulk)... for the Hot pepper version I add chipotle chili powder to the nut mixture. YUM!!!\n\nI also form more of a log so you get more nuts/smokey flavor in each bite."

I divided the rest into smaller balls with crispy bacon bits (the real thing). The bacon version flew off the table and I had to replace with another ball after only 20 minutes! Some of my guests were also spreading this on celery sticks from my veggie tray. I'm glad I made extra!\n\nGreat recipe as is and is a fantastic base recipe for additional ingredients. I plan to experiment with fillings and coatings. Thanks!"
