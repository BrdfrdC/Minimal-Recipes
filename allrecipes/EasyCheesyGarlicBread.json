They are a little under baked on the inside so when you put it in your oven the outside is nice and crunchy but the inside has that touch of softness to it. This recipe has become a staple at my house, thanks amberfoy1!!"

I would make again in a heart beat but I agree that two tablespoons might be a little over the top in powdered form - and I love garlic!"
