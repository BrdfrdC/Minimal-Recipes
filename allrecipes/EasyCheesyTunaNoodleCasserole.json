"reviewBody": "Wonderful casserole! I made quiet a few changes. Didn't have any egg noodles so used Rotini. I added Dijon mustard, 1/2 cup of milk, sun dried tomatoes, roasted red peppers, canned mushrooms, onion powder, and garlic powder. Instead of putting cheese on the top, I used bread crumbs with melted butter. I know it sounds like a lot of changes! I've been very sick for 2 years and in a wheelchair. Cooking was the one thing I could do. Became fascinated with spice."

"reviewBody": "I did not like the taste of this recipe nor the texture. The other reviews were correct about this recipe making a LOT of tuna casserole. I think the recipe relies too much on the creamed soups and salt to provide flavor, and not enough on actually adding flavor with herbs and spices."

The recipe as is simply is overloaded with sodium. And be sure to rinse the tuna because it too contains a huge amount of salt."
