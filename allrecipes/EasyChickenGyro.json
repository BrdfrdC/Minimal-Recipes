I used a store-bought tzatziki sauce which was very good and saved time. I heated the pita bread, wrapped in paper towels, in the microwave. Personal preference, I skipped the lettuce but did add thinly sliced English cucumber along with the tomatoes and onions. Thanks for this delicious and healthy recipe!"

"reviewBody": "6-30-2019 ~In all the years I’ve been a member of Allrecipes, I’ve never come across this recipe. Poor me. Thanks to my daughter, a young mother of three hard-to-please little kids, I have now prepared and enjoyed something new for us which I know will be on our table frequently. Hubs, who is as similarly hard-to-please as those kids, will ensure that! Daughter raved about this, so I was anxious to give it a try. Oregano is a strong-flavored herb that is not generally a favorite of mine so to be on the safe side I reduced it to about 2 tsp., which turned out to be just right for us. I marinated the chicken for not one hour, but four. I’m not sure how much of a difference that made one way or another but judging by the outcome I’ll do it the same way next time. Hubs quickly grilled it outside in a cast iron skillet. I took the easy way out, I admit, and used a commercial tzatziki sauce from Costco (which Hubs has quickly become a huge fan of). I thinly sliced both the red onion and tomato, and included some thinly sliced English cucumber as well - very nice addition! Warming the pitas (also from Costco) in a pan with olive oil didn’t appeal to me, so I simply warmed them in the microwave between paper towels. This ultimately was not just easy to prepare and fun to eat, it was simply “D” good. Hubs, who is not a leftovers kind of guy, requested a repeat for tonight’s supper. High praise indeed. I will have to see what else my daughter has in her main dish treasure tr"

"reviewBody": "This was a fun unique meal we have never done. We also bought the frozen lamb meat in the freezer section at Sams club. The 5 kids ate only the shaved gyro meat and didn't even try the chicken. I have to agree the gyro meat was a little better but more fattening of course. We cooked the chicken on the frying pan which we thought was great. I also purchased some tzatziki sauce at Sams club. But I made this written one too. I made the HUGE mistake of not draining any of the generic brand Greek yogurt. Next time I will buy the more expensive brand yogurt because it does make a difference. It was way too soupy so I drained the finished product which helped a little. I then added some of it to the package sauce I bought and it was better. I liked the fresh cucumber taste of this recipe that the package sauce didn't have. I also would have liked some chunks of fresh cucumber in it. I will for sure make this again. The pita bread was amazing after toasting it on the frying pan."

"reviewBody": "Delicious!! Having just returned home from Greece in the last two weeks, we were all hungry for authentic Greek chicken gyros. I searched for a recipe and found this one to be very close to the real thing! I cut the garlic in half because the garlic flavor should not overwhelm the other flavors. Also used an oregano spice grinder which added a fresher flavor. Did not make the Tzatzeki sauce, used store bought instead. I’m looking forward to trying the sauce the next time I make this recipe, but will not be putting it into the blender, as authentic sauce is usually thicker with small cuts of cucumber in it. Don’t forget to toast your bread, and also remember to add a few french fries!! Most of the chicken gyros that we had in Santorini had french fries on them!"

She focused on the sauce, while I worked on the marinade and chicken prep. We broiled the chicken. The chicken turned out alright, but we ended up with too much sauce. \n\nThe second time, I prepared the marinade and then grilled the chicken strips outside on a propane Weber. The chicken turned out great as evidenced by both my wife and daughter eating all of the chicken while I was out cycling. Both my wife and daughter informed me that this recipe is a keeper and they asked me to prepare it again. Nice job and thank you!"

Unfortunately, the tzatziki sauce I made got really runny and it kinda ruined the texture of the whole dish. I skimmed some other recipes online, and some of them say you should salt your cucumbers and get them dry before adding them to the blender. If you want good tzatziki sauce, I recommend checking out these other recipes."

This gave it the perfect amount of flavors. Make sure you squeeze the cucumbers prior to adding the to your sauce or your sauce will end up watery. We had a lot of sauce and chicken so we made wraps for lunch the next day, delicious!!!"

Next time, I would marinate the chicken breast whole (with a lot less oregano), grill it, rest it, and slice it before serving it. And I would use a completely different sauce recipe with a better depth of flavor and a lot less acid."

"reviewBody": "After reading the comments on this recipe I decided to take some creative liberties. First, for the tzatziki I used a food processor for the cucumber only. Seeded and finely minced cucumber squeezed through a tea towel to get rid of the excess moisture. Then I mixed the rest of the sauce ingredients by hand. Secondly I used fresh dill in the tzatziki. For the marinade I used chicken thighs for more of a flavor. In addition to the ingredients listed for the marinade I added about 2 tsp of dried parsley and ~1 tsp of ground thyme, ~1 tsp dried basil, and about 1 1/2 tsp of dill weed. You can even add rosemary, marjoram, nutmeg and cinnamon if you like those flavors to get a great greek seasoning. I will update my review once we taste it tonight! Currently marinating the chicken thighs and letting the tzatziki flavors marinate in the fridge too!\n\nHere's the recipe I used to inspire my marinade: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/231228/greek-seasoning-blend/"

The chicken Took more time in the broiler than the recipe stated. I used sour cream for the sauce because that's what I had on hand. \n\nWARNING! Do not follow these directions for making the sauce. The 1st batch of it I made tasted amazing but had the consistency of a glass of milk. My 2nd try I squeeze dried the cucumber before chopping it in my magic bullet. After blending it I blotted it on paper towels and hand mixed the sauce. This time it was awesome! I'm sharing this recipe with family and friends asap!"

I only with the tzatziki has more garlic...will definitely try again with the sauce recipe. Served on oven-warm naan bread. Wrapped the bottom in tinfoil to keep the insides in. Delicious!"
