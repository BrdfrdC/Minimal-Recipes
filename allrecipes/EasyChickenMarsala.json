After about 5 min I put chicken back in pan and let it sautee covered for about 10 min, then uncovered another 10. Added a bit of cream which evened out &amp; enriched the flavors, making enough for the linguine side dish. Served up with fresh chopped parsely which added freshness and appeal, all so good."

I also added thyme while everything was cooking together. I do the same recipe with pork tenderloin cutlets. Awesome dish ! Ohhh. If ya want you can use marshal and Madeira wine together. A little extra sweetness."

"reviewBody": "I make this often using canola oil or peanut oil. I like conola as it is heart healthy too. It is ez to change this rescipe adding other vegetables like frozen baby peas to it ar last minute to heat thru. Will try using bacon will be good too. Dredging chicken in flour garlic and salt n pepper is good as it will thicken the sauce a little for gravy but it is optional. Making sure chicken pieces are the same size saves on pounding them to make cooking uniform. I have added fresh basil, thyme and each is really good in this rescipe."

"reviewBody": "An easy and delicious meal. I grabbed sweet Marsala wine AFTER reading the recipie &amp; thought I'd screw this up, but it worked out just as well, if not better. Did not use sherry, or cream or milk either. The sauce came out excellent, and I read lots of other recipies from other sites before attempting this. I made Chicken Marsala a long time ago, and for the life of me could not remember what I did, but it did turn out great. I used 2 cans of mushrooms, drained, and also two tablespoons of bottled minced garlic, plus I diced a medium onion and sautéed all of it in the same pan after doing the chicken. DO NOT OMIT flouring and frying the chicken--I feel this is key. I also seasoned the flour with dried Italian seasonings that you can pick up at any grocery store, along with salt and pepper. DId not season the chicken, since I seasoned the flour, and the whole meal came out excellent. I served it over spaghetti, and you want to make sure you have enough sauce. I ended up using the ENTIRE bottle of Marsala wine for 6 chicken breasts, along with a can of chicken broth. Again, I omitted the cream and milk and sherry and it was restaurant quality."

Here's what I did: I cooked the chicken first and set it aside (I didn't want to over cook it); I doubled the sauce (heavy cream, wine, and milk); added a few dashes of oregano, and added a few teaspoons of grated parmesan cheese. Once the 'shrooms and green onions were cooked and the sauce was reduced a bit I added the chicken back to the pan. Great recipe. Thanks!"

Used chopped yellow onions and sautéed it in half olive oil and couple of tablespoons of butter, then added sliced mushrooms and a little dried oregano, s&amp;p. Used 1/2C of Marsala wine, cooked &amp; reduced for about 4 min, and then added the 1/3C heavy cream and 1/8C 1% milk, and simmered for 5 min. Definitely will make again!"

You will have to spot. I suggest mixing the milk and cream together and only putting half in at a time. I serve this with pasta (plenty of gravy) and veggies. It was a delight."

I added garlic powder to the chicken before sautéing for some added flavor while also seasoning it with additional salt and pepper. The only change I would make is to I up the portions for the sauce just a bit. I served this over pasta and the recipe didn't yield quite enough sauce to coat the pasta. Otherwise, great recipe and I'll cook it again."

"reviewBody": "Is it impossible to make an easy gourmet dinner in a flash during the weekday? Not with this recipe!!! Wow! That is all I have to say. Again, I am a purist and usually do the recipes as they are written the first time around. The recipe was definitely very good as is and deserves all the stars. If and only if you decide to “augment” it, here are my suggestions:\n1- Lightly dredge the chicken in flour before sautéing it. It gives it a little crust which I like.\n2- Remove the chicken from the skillet and reserve in a plate before step #2, and only put back the chicken after adding the cream in step #3. This will ensure that the chicken is still tender.\n3- Triple the sauce (i.e. 1 cup of Marsala and 1 cup of cream)!!! It is the best attribute of the recipe! Since there will already be a lot of cream, you don’t need the milk. I just omit it now.\n4- Make sure you take the time to cook down the Marsala wine, which is why it should be boiled for 2 to 4 minutes as per step #3. Marsala is a nice fortified wine but can be a little overpowering for kids and people that don’t especially appreciate alcohol.\nThat being said, I’ve served this over pasta, rice, and mashed vegetables and I’ve only had rave reviews.\nThanks Sal!"

This recipe was far too sweet for my likes and lacked flavor and I was disappointed in it. My modifications would be to add fresh garlic cloves and to lower the sweetness somehow...?adding chicken broth and balance out some of the sweetness from the marsala or the milk."
