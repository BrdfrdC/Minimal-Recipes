If it's too lemony for you, don't use as much. I feel the author of this recipe is a cook. They understand how cooking works. The people who critique it too much and give their revisions are not cooks. I think this is the perfect starting point for someone with common sense who wants to make chicken piccata. I appreciate everyone's opinions but let's please remember that a lot of people are new to cooking, are young, or work outside of their house but still want to be able to cook a great meal. So, kudos to the author!"

"reviewBody": "This chicken picatta tasted as good or better than other recipes that I have tried in the past. With just four ingredients, it was so simple to make. My son eats gluten-free so I dredged the chicken in gluten free baking flour and it still created a moderately thick lump free gravy that you want from chicken picatta. I did make some modest changes based on what I had in my cupboard and fridge. I used raw chicken tenders instead of breasts which I will do again next time. I used unsalted butter that I broke down into brown butter before adding the raw chicken. I didn‚Äôt have any white wine so I used low sodium chicken broth instead."

"reviewBody": "Ive been preparing Chicken Piccata for 40+ years and taught by the master, Jean Leon - La Scala, Beverly Hills. Basic recipe is ok re ingredients except no salt &amp; pepper. Pre pounding cut chicken breasts into pieces that will reduce in size when cooking. Pound thin as directed. Don‚Äôt break through the meat. Dust both sides with Wonder Flour - not heavy flour (shouldn‚Äôt be cake-y). I use whipped butter - lots of it. (It‚Äôs less dense than solid butter) start with well heated pan but before butter burns. Don‚Äôt over-brown the pieces. Four min may be too long if your pieces are thin enough. Turn the pieces when golden &amp; edges slightly browned. Don‚Äôt over cook. Lower heat. Add fresh lemon juice - ONLY ONE LEMON MAX for two portions- don‚Äôt use too much lemon!!! ADD DRY WHITE WINE next- generously - it will reduce and blend with the lemon. Add capers. Sometimes I add a few whole peppercorns to give it a kick. Not too many. Add more butter. REAL butter. Let it simmer but don‚Äôt do it too long as you want the sauce. DO NOT REMOVE CHICKEN until your ready to serve onto pre-heated plate. I serve with Petite Peas Spoon the sauce over the chicken and the peas. Toss a little salt or garlic salt on the peas - NOT on the chicken. This dish does not require seasoning the chicken if it‚Äôs done right. Serve immediately. I like having baguette slices to soak up the sauce. Serve with a preferably French Dry White or a Provence Ros√©, as is your preference. Maybe a light side salad too! Butter lettuce with avocado slices. Whip up Virgin Olive oil, touch of Dijon mustard, little lemon juice, lightly salted for salad dressing."
