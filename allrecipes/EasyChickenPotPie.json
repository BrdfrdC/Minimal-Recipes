I also used frozen vegetables and used salt , pepper, onion powder , garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. I did precooked my crust frozen for 10 minutes first. Then added all my ingredients. I saw alot of complaints but with any recipe you can tweek to your liking. My fiancé ate half of it by his self very yummy. Also used refrigerated pie crust on top and brushed with an egg wash."

I also used cream of mushroom with garlic soup, which is very flavorful. The top didn't look done at all after 25 minutes, so I upped the temp to 400 for another 20 minutes. I didn't add any additional spices or salt, though it could have used a teaspoon or so of salt. Overall, the pie is really good and we like it!"

Be sure to cover the edges of the crust while baking. Also, it’s really much better with seasoning. I add salt, pepper, onion powder, sage and a little bit of Beyond Bullion for depth of flavor."

"reviewBody": "Used this recipe for basics. Didn't want to use canned soup due to sodium. Used broth from bones from Costco rotisserie chicken. Not sure my sodium was less than 920. Thought gravy was too thin and added potatoe starch, then it got too gooey. Added liquid and it looked fine. Had way too much filling for standard pie crusts which were thawed. Ran to the store and bought deep dish crusts which were frozen. While the crusts were thawing, I noticed the filling looked rather thick. I thinned it out again and filled the pie crusts when I realized I forgot to preheat the oven. It was already close to 10 pm and the kids were hungry. I ordered pizza delivery. Kids were in bed and I thought about what went wrong. Then it came to me-- I didn't follow the recipe. Next time, I will."

We always keep pie crusts in our freezer for this easy meal. Hint: it is better leftover, as it cuts out more solidly when it is cold. We also use the mexican style stir fry veggies as the veggies, which is delish!"

Its important to saute onions and cook veggies and chicken separate. One trick I have learned is to under cook the pies crust and cover the edges with aluminum foil. Remove during last five minutes. I also found using Alfredo sauce for base with sherry or wine to taste. This adds a great favor."

Used a can of cream of celery in place of milk. Threw in some hot sauce which added a nice flavor (no spice at all) I also highly recommend putting the bottom crust in the oven for about ten minutes before filling just so it doesn't get soft and soggy!

I also use a 5.5 inch pie plate rather then the 9 inch. the 5.5 is better for a single serving .I rub some flour around the pie plate before putting in the pie crust. I cook it for 60 min. then let stand for 5 min. before serving. it's like the store bought has a small circle of doughy crust in the middle. no bigger then a quarter."

First, I use frozen mixed vegetables instead of canned as I'm just not a big fan of canned veggies. Second, I have found that adding a bit of chicken broth really makes it flavorful, plus most recipes I've tried tend to be a little dry. For my personal taste, I add between 1/4 and 1/2 have cup of chicken broth while mixing the other ingredients"

Finally, I baked the bottom shell for 10 minutes or so before filling, and baked the whole pie around 45 minutes. Very tasty, and satisfying with a salad on the side.

Then I mixed the veggies in frozen, not thawed, brushed the top with butter and cooked for 55 minutes at 350 degrees (just when it started bubbling on top). Top and bottom crusts cooked perfectly. Just a note; the added potatoes and canned soup make this one thick pie! Be prepared for leftovers!"

I followed the suggestions of others..used refridgerated ready made crust, baked the bottom crust 10 minutes before filling. I used 1 can cream of potato, one can cream of chicken and the milk. I boiled 2 split chicken breasts the day before and shredded/cubed it into the mix. I added pepper, salt and a couple shakes of garlic salt. It took longer than 30 minutes for the crust to brown. If you don't heap the filling you can get 2 small pies from 1 batch so you have more crust per serving, my husband likes the vegetables, so best to just heap it all in."

I made it exactly according to original instructions except for adding a few spices to the filling (per contributor Jaden: \"Also I added 1/2 teaspoon each of pepper, thyme and tarragon, and 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder to the entire mixture.\"). These spices made it very savory and yummy. I am fairly certain it would have been a bit bland without them. I let the pot pie sit for about 5-10 minutes after removing from the oven and the filling was just right, not dry or runny. An easy, tasty recipe I will certainly make again."
