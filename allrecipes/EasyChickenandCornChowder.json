My biggest revision to the recipe is to boil the potatoes on their own in the chicken stock for about 10 minutes, then add the rest. By doing this, it takes less time for them to soften after the half and half is added, which means less chance of the soup scorching."

Drained off rest of grease and added about 1/4 c butter. Used matchstix carrots and diced them as a time saver. Also partially cooked the potatoes in the microwave before dicing. Used 1/2 (white and dark meat) of a rotisserie chicken. Did not add any flour - it was thick and meaty. Very tasty."

I made this using leftover turkey from the holidays. Since I dodnt have chicken stock I boiled the skin and fat for 20 min in 6 cups of water and added onion powder ginger salt garlic a few shakes of each. I also threw in 2 tablespoons diced onions. Afte4 20 min removed skin and fat from broth about 4 cups left. I was short 1 potatoe and 1 cup of corn. To make up for it I added 2 extra carrots and 1 green pepper. at the end I realized I didn't have enough half n half so did 1 1/2 cups plus half cup skim milk and tablespoon of bacon bits. I followed the rest of the recipe except only other change was I blended 4 cups of finished soup until thick liquid and dumped back in just to thicken it up. Topped with green onions minced and shredded sharp cheddar salt n pepper. Its just perfect for cold winter day and my family just raved about it!"

My husband's reaction of \"Mmm!\" and going in for another taste test 100% confirms my opinion I will definitely add this to my meal rotation, especially when it starts getting colder. I made a couple of changes due to limitations of available groceries near me - i used 2 10 oz bags of frozen yellow corn instead of half white/half yellow, and i used milk instead of half and half and just added an extra 1/4 cup of sweet cream butter to make up for the creaminess of the half and half. I will definitely try adding bacon to it next time, as was recommended other reviews!"

I felt this extra step would help with how little seasoning was in the recipe. \n\nI also cooked my veggies a bit before adding the butter to the pan. I wanted them to be caramelize to for that extra flavor, and I seasoned them with Bell's and salt an pepper, again due to the lack of spicing. \n\nThese are the only modifications I used and I think it turned out better than the original recipe would, but I liked this recipe because it was an easy jump off point to make my own thing."

When it was time, I added the other ingredients except for the chicken. Ten minutes before I expected the potatoes to be done, I added the shredded rotisserie chicken breast. Delish! 03/26/2017"
