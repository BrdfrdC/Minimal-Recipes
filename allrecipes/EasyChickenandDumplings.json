"reviewBody": "This is a really good foundation recipe. I used about 1C ea. of carrot/celery/onion, sauted' for a few minutes before adding the broth. I made a large recipe, so I actually used three 32oz cartons of broth. I added 1/2lb of orzo pasta to the bubbling broth, and finished cooking the veggies with the orzo. When almost done, I added the cut up chicken, warmed through and brought back to a bubble. Added the golf ball-sized dumplings and cooked for 5 minutes covered. Rolled them over and cooked another 5 minutes, also covered. (Dumpling mixture rested for about 10-15 minutes before dropping into soup). Came out perfectly."

I tried to overcome this by cooking for longer but this only resulting in turning the broth into a gravy and burning the bottom of the pot. Swap out the dumplings with your own dumpling recipe and this dish will shine!"

Only thing I changed was using pop can biscuits instead of bisquick, and following a couple reviews I added 1 can cream of mushroom soup, about 1 1/2 cups frozen peas, rosemary, thyme and some garlic powder. Very tasty and filling! Even the 4 yr old granddaughter loved it!!! Will make again."

"reviewBody": "I added a package of chicken gravy mix, a large can of cream of chicken soup along with vegetable broth (it’s all I had, next time I’ll try chicken), bundle of poultry herbs, a lump of ginger root, more than doubled the amounts of carrots and celery, and tossed in some chopped potatoes, &amp; added some water. Also used Pillsbury Grands biscuits cut into fourths for dumplings, &amp; cooked those for 10 minutes covered with towel under lid, then 10 minutes uncovered. Made a huge pot and nothing left 2 days later. Curious what using crescent dough instead of biscuit dough would be like.\n**EDIT** I wont use crescent dough again. Slimy and thin. Stick with the biscuits :)"

Unfortunately my husband does not like dumplings or chicken soup, but he was on a soft diet at the time, and this recipe was perfect for his needs. Definitely comfort food for me. Quick, easy, and cooking the dumplings in the chicken stock also thickened the stock, making it more like a gravy. I'd like to experiment with this recipe by adding more fresh herbs- this is a great start. Silly husband."

I added hot pepper sauce to my bowl and it was Yummy! Will make this again."

"reviewBody": "I didn't really follow the recipe at all, I kind of jut used it as my base. However I didn't have any broth on hand so instead I opted to use water and butter (1 cup water = 1 tbsp butter). I also added onion powder and some natural blend spices you can find at a Walmart. I let that come to a boil. While that happened I did use about half an onion because most people don't eat onion in my family. I cut up some celery and some carrots (non peeled). I heated up a pan with some oil and I think it was herbed oil but I just used what was here. I put all three in pan and let them cook in the oil for about 7-8 minutes. I also cut up about 5 small potatoes but didn't put them in the oil. When the base was done I put in the cubed chicken (about 4 skinless boneless breast) and then added the veggies after adding some sea salt. Then added the potato, and added some more salt with a dash of pepper and let that come to a boil. I also used a different dumpling recipe that was similar to yours except i used flour, sugar, salt, butter, and baking soda. Then let it simmer for about 20 minutes and served with some rice. It was excellent. Will make it again soon c:"

I used the original style biscuits in a can. I flattened each biscuit and cut them into 6ths. For the shredded chicken, I used 4 frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts and boiled them for about 20 minutes. I used the broth from that to make the liquid to add the better than bouillon to. Would have been good with peas. Should have cut the biscuits into slightly smaller chunks and cooked a few minutes more."

Low and slow produces the best flavors! \nThis time around I used fresh peas and carrots, a bundle of celery stalks, 1/4 yellow onion (again to help soften the flavor), and one red potato (skin on). To tie the flavors together, I added a large de-stemmed spring of thyme to the veggie pot and simmered with fresh ground black pepper; (add salt to flavor if you prefer).\nBisquick can be your best friend or worst enemy if you've never used it in a dumpling recipe before. I find that about half way through the two pots simmering, I begin making the dough (since it's easy to whip up). \nOnce the chicken is no longer pink in the middle, I add it to the dutch oven with some of the onions...you can add some of the leftover chicken stalk from the pot for flavor since the fat has had time to be cooked down. After your chicken has been added (veggies should be ready after ~30 min.), slowly drop 1- 1 1/2 inch balls of dough into the simmering dutch oven. If you choose to make the dough balls any bigger, prepare to cook them for longer than the 20 minute suggested time. \n*If you are uncertain about how long to cook your dumplings, use a fork or toothpick to check the center*\nOnce the du"
