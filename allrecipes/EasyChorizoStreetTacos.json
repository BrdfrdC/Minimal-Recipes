I only make a couple of changes. We love things extra extra spicy, so I add 5 tablespoons of chipotle in adobo sauce. I also top the tacos with shredded mexican cheese, in addition to the cilantro and onion. And instead of frying up tortillas, I just use storebought hard taco shells, the nacho cheese flavored ones. Sooo good! The nacho cheese flavor blends so nicely with the spicy chorizo meat. There have been a few times I've made this that I haven't been able to find chorizo meat. It doesn't taste quite as good, but I've found that sweet italian sausage meat works well enough in a pinch."

To “mild” it down a little, took Mrs WyoFish tips on making a slaw; 1/4c lime juice, TBLS brown sugar, tsp Siracha, 1/4 tsp cumin, dash of garlic powder. Let sit in half bag pre-chopped slaw 20+ minutes before starting. Wish I had avocado! Would absolutely make again! Thank you!!"

I would only do 1/2 Tbsp if you want it mild. Cooking the tortillas in the leftover grease was a huge hit for the flavor! This made a lot of meat, enough for a family dinner and leftovers for the next day. Would definitely make this again!!"

It wasn't too spicy with the added hamburger, in fact I'd probably add less hamburger next time to keep it spicy. Really liked the tortillas fried in chorizo fat! Also added pepperjack cheese. Definitely will make it again."

Just like this, with cilantro, and onion, but they provided lime wedges as well and the hottest taco sauce I've ever witnessed. This recipe does not need more hot. Just dab a little Mexican crema (like a creme fraiche) over these tacos to take the heat down a bit if you want. Glorious."

"reviewBody": "These were AMAZE. I devoured them within minutes of plating them... But of course, me being me, I added my own touches: 1) I made a nice slaw to go with, for added color (as my plates are not as colorful as the ones in the main picture for this recipe) and honestly it goes well with any taco or tostada recipe... red cabbage, sliced radishes, cilantro + juice of 1 lime &amp; 1 tablespoon-ish brown sugar... usually I add siracha, 2 or so garlic cloves, cumin, coriander, etc to this slaw—but as the main dish was already anticipated to be pretty spicy, I stopped at the brown sugar. Serve on top of the tacos or on the side. 2) Lime-sour cream to top it all off. Again, this goes well with any taco recipe; simply take juice of 1 lime and add sour cream and fresh cracked pepper. Add as much as you want to get it to a consistency you like... this makes a really delightfully creamy appeal to counter the spiciness."
