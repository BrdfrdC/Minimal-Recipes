I'm pleased to say: in the battle of the pasta salads, mine was the only bowl that was completely empty at the end of the day! The fresh veggies make this an excellent and refreshing summer salad. I also added some fresh basil, some chunks of mozzarella cheese, and a little salt and pepper. Taste-wise, this is a 4-star dish, the quick &amp; easy factor makes it a 5. Thanks for a great recipe!\n\nA follow-up caution: Be sure to check the sodium content of your dressing before adding extra salt. I used a different Italian dressing the second time I made this dish and added salt, like I had done before. It turned out too salty because my dressing had way more sodium than the other."

However, What I'll say about the recipe is that it's easy to do. But the ratio to pasta is slightly off for me. I don't think using a 16oz bag of Gluten free rotini would make a lot of difference but it did. I had way way more pasta to then veggies. 10 cherry tomatoes doesn't cut it, so I had to increase the tomatoes &amp; cucumbers as well as olives. I did increase the salad dressing as well to accomendate the recipe and balance it out. However. Over all it's nice. The dressing was fat-free. So for making this recipe a healthier option, was really nice. Will make again. My girls really liked it."

"reviewBody": "we had a really bad storm last night and lost power right as I was preparing dinner. The only thing that was done was the angel hair pasta. So I went to the garden and got some cucumbers and tomatoes, fresh basil and thyme and a banana pepper. Mixed up this pasta salad recipe and it was delicious! Thank you!"

"reviewBody": "I don't normally like pasta salad, but after a couple of modifications this was quite pleasant. I took jennifermorse's suggestion of crumbling in some feta, but I'm not a big fan of red onions, so I added about 1.5T of fresh chives instead. Because of the intensity of the chives and feta flavors, I also cut the quantity of Italian salad dressing in half and added just a touch of olive oil. I also substituted penne for the rotini since it was on sale this week, but I'm not sure how much that actually affected the flavor/texture."
