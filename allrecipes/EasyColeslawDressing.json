For the last 50 years, I've only had Winco's deli coleslaw to go with their rotisserie chicken. I gambled on buying Walmart's packaged tri-color coleslaw with their grocery delivery &amp; chopped it in the blender. I dressed it with this recipe and my partner loved it. I didn't like it until it sat in the fridge for a day. It got even better the next few days. I'm so grateful to be able to have salads again &amp; will always have some of this on hand."
