It definitely needs the honey to offset all of the spiciness. I used a steamed, fresh ear of corn that equaled about the same amount in the can mentioned. The fresh cilantro from a plant I purchased recently worked nicely."

Enjoy!"

My only complaint is that I find this more a good 'base' recipe, than a complete recipe in an of itself. It's made infinitely better by the addition of some chopped avocado, a few dashes of hot sauce, and perhaps some black beans. You really could customize it however you like. Over all though, very good!"

I used a 16 oz bag of frozen white corn instead of the canned ones and just thawed before mixing everything together. I varied the serving to eight (to bring to the office potluck) and put in fresh juice of an entire lime. I like the spicy kick to it, the festive color, and crunchiness. I made it the evening before the lunch potluck and I think that helped seep the flavor. My co-workers enjoyed it a lot and asked for the recipe so I shared this! I am really happy and proud to have this recipe guidance and execute successfully. Very simple and easy!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe has just become part of a very tasty \"accidental\" meal. The story: It all started with some homemade coleslaw that I wanted to use up, so I planned to make pulled pork sandwiches. I put a boneless pork loin in the crock pot, sprinkled it with garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper,doused it with a cup of red wine vinegar and cooked it for 6 hours on high. I made some homemade bbq sauce, but the pork was sooooooo good without it, I decided to go a different route. I tossed a little of the crock pot juices in with the pork which I had shredded. I served it on top of some super easy cilantro-lime rice. It was really good, but it needed something. This salsa was the something it needed. It was very easy to throw together with on-hand ingredients. I happened to have some fresh lemons and strawberries so I made lemonade with mottled strawberries, which complemented this meal perfectly. When summer corn appears, I will try this recipe with some fresh corn, but it is surprisingly good with the canned stuff. The only thing better about going to Chipotle is they don't make me clean the kitchen!"
