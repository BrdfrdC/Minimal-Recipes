"reviewBody": "I hadn't cooked corned beef in years and was intrigued by the unique addition of sugar, vinegar and bay leaf in this recipe. This is very tasty. Made as written but used small unpeeled red potatoes and added half of a head of cabbage cut in chunks the last two hours. Rinsing the meat before adding to the crockpot helps decrease the saltiness. No more stove top corned beef for me!"

By the time I cut all the fat off, I had probably 1.5lb of meat instead of 3. I'm a potato lover so I would add more potatoes also. Will definitely be making this again with the right cut of corned beef."

Adding all ingredients at the same time meant I could get on with my day and I didn't need to go to the store for beer and mustard. It came out perfect! Hubby was delighted! The only thing I did different is I used baby potatoes which never need peeling. And they retain their shape better. I make small cut into each one so they can soak in the flavors."

Potatoes &amp; carrots were still hard ( we like them soft) &amp; brisket was tough after cooking in crockpot on low for 9 hours. Did steam cabbage separately as did not have room for it in crockpot. Will go back to our usual recipe next time we want corned beef."

I cooked it on slow for 12 hours, the meat melted in our mouths, even the fatty part tasted good! Will be forwarding this recipe to family and friends, can't wait to make it again!"
