Make sure to cut them up in small pieces or maybe even leave at room temp and stir it all together more."

Friends cleaned their plates, and said they were better than ones we get at our local Mexican restaurant!"

I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I used Chi-Chi’s taco seasoning to season my chicken, which I warmed up on the stove. I then added half a packet of traditional Ortega taco seasoning to my chicken and cheese mixture for added flavor. I used corn tortillas instead of flour - I’m a traditionalist when it comes to tortillas for enchiladas. I think the texture is better for being baked. Overall, it was a hit and I will be using this recipe from now on!"

Even though I hate it when the recipe is altered :o), I do add a couple of things to the chicken mixture that really add to the flavor... I stir in a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chilis and a can of well drained black beans. I spoon the mixture into the tortillas and follow the rest of the instructions for cooking."

"reviewBody": "Love this recipe! It was my first time to make enchiladas. I was cooking rice as a side. After I made the rice I mixed in some of the enchilada sauce. Then layered it on the bottom of my sprayed pan. Then I decided to add fresh chopped spinach to the chicken mixture bc I was trying to use up what I had before it went bad. I had extra filling left over so I put it on top with the enchilada sauce and cheese. It turned out great! My family loved it! I will be making this again in the future!"

I used hatch green enchilada sauce because I like it better with chicken than red sauce and I used corn tortillas because I like them better than flour tortillas. I had leftover baked chicken so I shredded it instead of buying a rotisserie chicken. Also, I didn't see the footnote about freezing the cream cheese so I melted it into my green sauce when I couldn't get it to cooperate - ha! I will definitely make this again!"

It is fast and easy and the kids, who are finicky enough, actually enjoy them and beg for more. I used Fronterra mild enchilada red sauce this time, but have used El Paso and Las Palmas and have found I prefer the Fronterra sauce the best. Add a little chopped onion, red and green peppers sprinkled with minced garlic and topped off with some some sour cream and you have a the makings of a delish Mexican dish!"

Delicious and beautiful on the table! Used taco seasoning instead of the fajita seasoning because it's what I had - added black beans with the chicken and a can of green chiles for some spice. Shout out to Selina, my sous-chef who assembled and baked these for us! :) The only hitch we had in the dish was forgetting to put sauce in the pan before the tortillas - the bottom layer was baked on pretty hard - still looked and tasted delicious and we will make again!"
