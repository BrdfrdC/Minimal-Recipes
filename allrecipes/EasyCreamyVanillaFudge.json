I was looking for something sweet to make, and not having alot of ingredients on hand at 5:00 AM, I looked up Vanilla Fudge because I thought I had enough ingredients for a simple, quick vanilla fudge. I made this one and it was easy, firmed up nicely .. and it tastes yummy. I put in the freezer for a little while and then in the fridge. I did add extra vanilla, but that is all extra. One thing I should say is that I used skim milk and it did not alter the recipe at all, although I do know whole milk or cream would have made it even better and creamier. I am just as happy with it like it is. I love it and would make it again. Thank you."

"reviewBody": "I think the problem people are having with the consistency has nothing to do with the recipe, but more to do with how long thei they're cooking it. The sugar needs tie to break down. I cooked mine on medium heat, stirring constantly until I saw steam. Then I turned it down to low and stirred it until the consistency seemed to be more runny than creamy. I walked away for a second to put a dish in the sink, when I came back, the top had slightly crusted. I to that as a cue it was ready. \n\nI poured the majority into a small pyrex pan, and used a red gel did coloring with the rest. I drizzled that over top, and used a skewer to swirl it a little and give it character. I piped it in the freezer and within an hour it had set! Definitely mite of a fudge consistency than I expected from the reviews.\n\nAll in all, it is pretty sweet, but if that's what you're looking for, this is great!\n\n***note: I used REAL pure vanilla, not extract**"

The fudge needs to be kept as frozen as possible prior to the chocolate covering it, or it's too soft to coat, but once hardened they are more like a vanilla soft centered chocolates... Pretty tasty :0)"

It was pretty quick and easy, and tasted okay to me. The vanilla flavor was fairly noticeable, and this was on the sweet side. I was a little surprised that the fudge had a slightly grainy texture to it (I guess the sugar transformed somehow). In little portions, it lasted me for over ten days. I probably won't make this again (I think I much prefer chocolate or even peanut butter fudge), but I can at least say this is worth a try."

"reviewBody": "The consistency was just fine. Take your time, cook slowly on low heat, and use real butter. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that if it looks thin you add a little more sugar too thick- add more cream/ milk. It does, however, need more flavor, and the color is bright-white, not like the picture. This is a great versatile base that allows you to add different flavors (peanut butter, coconut, brown sugar. maple, peppermint...). You can go wild with your own creativity."
