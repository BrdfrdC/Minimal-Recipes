Next time I will use more spices. As someone else mentioned, it is MUCH better the next day!! increase to 4 star."

I put 1 cup of Monkfruit. I put 1 cup of Monkfruit in, but it was a little too sweet. Next time I'll use 3/4 of a cup. I baked the pie for an additional 20 minutes. really like the recipe. It had the consistency of a thick custard. I thought I'd try it before Thanksgiving. I will definitely be doing this again for Thanksgiving."

"reviewBody": "Used 2 real eggs instead of egg substitute. Great recipe! Most pumpkin pie type recipes call for condensed milk. All condensed milk I know of contain the ingredient Carageenan in them &amp; we have severe issues mentally we can directly link to Carageenan &amp; also Annatto, and MSG (Google hidden MSG,too). Sweetened condensed milk has it in it, too. Google search Cornucopia Institute &amp; Carageenen in foods and you'll see products they know of that have it in it &amp; alternate products that don't have any to help you get started. (But no condensed or sweetened condensed milk.) It's one of the most inflammatory ingredients out there &amp; it's in grocery store items, but also rampant in health food stores. Labs give it to animals to put them into a highly inflammatory state in their bowels so they can do studies on them. No other ingredient puts their lab animals into such a highly inflammatory state so quickly than Carageenen does. Cut it out and see what happens in your house. After seeing the affects in my family, making the connections, removing it &amp; seeing the difference mentally / emotionally for us I consider it like poison. Anyway this recipe tastes great!"

"reviewBody": "This was okay, but more like a custard than a crustless pie(which I think of as having somewhat of a self-crusting property). It was a nice custard, but not very easy to get out of the pan nicely. I think the spices could use a little tweaking, maybe a little more cinnamon and a touch of cloves. I did use whole milk, real sugar, and real eggs. I will make this again, but will probably tweak it to fit my preferences. Thanks for posting a nice basic recipe."

Has more flavor than you would expect from the ingredients - tastes like cloves even though that's not in there. It is hard to serve up as a pie piece even after one day in fridge. Worked better the second time in individual serving ramekins. This recipe is so easy."
