"reviewBody": "This was a great excuse to eat Doritos! Since they are in a salad I didn't feel guilty eating them. I think this is a really fun salad for kids and it tasted great. Instead of using a packet of taco seasoning I made up my own seasoning: 1 tbls chilli powder, 1 tbls garlic, 1 tbls onion powder, 1 tbls cumin, 1 1/2 tsp paprika, and a tsp salt. Than instead of the suggested dressings I mixed sour cream with salsa for a dressing, a tip from another reviewer. Thanks for the quick, easy, kid friendly and adult friendly salad!"

"reviewBody": "I left the meat hot and assembled and served this straight away because we like the chips crunchy, the lettuce crisp, and the combo of warm beef/cold salad. I drizzled the dressings over rather than toss it all together. My husband did not like the Ranch Dressing and I thought the Italian gave this an odd twang. I would skip those next time and use a sour cream/salsa mix instead like I usually do. Sort of a southwest sour cream sauce. Quick and easy for a weeknight meal without heating up the whole kitchen. Thanks Jessica, we enjoyed our meal."

"reviewBody": "This was good! I wasn't sure if I was supposed to add the water called for on the taco seasoning pkg. b/c it's not specified in the recipe, but I did anyways. Also, I only used 1 cup of ranch and that was plenty for us, so maybe start w/ less and add as needed. I think next time I would cut back the Italian dressing a touch, but I did like the addition of it in the salad. To serve, I put a bed of lettuce on the plate, some chopped tomatoes, the ground beef mixture and then the crushed Doritos, and we just mixed them at the table. The little guy licked his plate clean! Hubby and I enjoyed this too, for a different spin on taco salad. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)"

"reviewBody": "This is one of my absolute favorite ways to make taco salad. When I make it, I use ground turkey and homemade taco seasoning. Though I've made it with ranch dressing or even catalina dressing, my family really prefers it with a \"dressing\" made from salsa and sour cream. You can easily make this into \"Walking Taco Salad\" by using the lunch-bag sized Doritos. You just crumble up the chips inside the bag, open it up and add your ingredients to the inside of the bag. All you need is a fork!"
