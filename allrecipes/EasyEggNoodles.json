I also add pepper into my mixture to give a little more flavor. It’s really a fool proof recipe. If it is too sticky, simply add a little flour at a time until you get the consistency you want and no stick."

"reviewBody": "My mother's family is from Germany and Ukraine, and we grew up eating these noodles for every family event. Fast forward 60 years and I'm teaching children in Guatemala how to make them. I like these especially since they don't turn to mush when cooked for a period of time -- like several hours -- and I can add flavors to them. Tonight they are cooked with roasted pork and have black pepper added. I like them with additional herbs in them as well. They are easy to make and take no time to cook. I don't ever roll them out. In our family they are cut into almost oblong strips on the palm of the hand directly into the water. I prefer mine very narrow, but bigger ones are incredible fried with bacon."

If your pasta is well floured (or use corn starch), allow it to fold onto itself so that the entire length occupies ~3-4\". Cut with a knife... dry and break up by hand... gives a great \"home made noodle\" look!"

"reviewBody": "Great tasting noodles. My Mom has used this recipe for years. To save time though, I suggest rolling the noodles out into desired thickness, and then rolling the dough into a log. Then starting at the end, slice the noodles into desired width. Afterwards, just toss them around until they are all uncurled into noodles. Will save you a ton of time from just slicing them while lying flat. Also keeps them more uniform in shape."

After the 10 minute rest, I cut my dough ball into 4 pieces and run the dough through the roller until I get to the 4 thickness. I use the Alfredo noodle attachment to cut the noodles. I usually get sheets roughly 2 feet long. I cut the noodles at desired length with kitchen scissors(knives make the noodles clump). One recipe usually yields me enough for 2 uses, one for now and one to freeze."

Next time, I think I'll make them 2 or 3\" long - they were a bit hefty for my chicken noodle soup. I dried them out for a few minutes in the oven at 175F. I just put them on a cookie sheet and they stuck a tiny bit. Next time, I'll probably use parchment paper or some other barrier. This recipe made a LOT of noodles. I put over half in my freezer for my next batch of soup :)"

The second time I added a third egg and an extra half cup of flour. was able to roll it thinner by breaking it into three separate balls thanks to someone else's feedback. I just throw the noodles into the pot with my chicken soup fixings and minutes later serve up a divine favorite."

"reviewBody": "Really good noodles. I like mine much thinner, so I use a apsta roller machine to roll them to 1/16th inch and then use the fetuccini attachment to cut perfect noodles.\nThey still swell up, so don't worry about them being too thin. If you only roll the dough to 1/4 inch thickness, they will be a half inch thick when they cook, and that's just a nasty globby wreck. My method makes really nice thick egg noodles that aren't grossly thick. I also had seasonings to my flour before rolling. Sage, rosemary, black pepper. You can use lemon pepper, turmeric, spinach powder...anything at all :)"

I cooked half directly in the crock pot (rolled to a 2, fettucini cut) and I froze the rest. Next time I will let the pasta sit a bit longer before portioning so it can fully hydrate. Per another reviewer, I added black pepper to the pasta as well as salt since it was going into strongly flavored soup. Kids both asked for seconds. Husband is extremely happy with the results, and I am ecstatic. This will be a go-to recipe. Almost foolproof!"

After cooking tasted like dough, not egg noodles"

Another reviewer talked about rolling the dough and cutting the rolls. This was easy but took some time to unravel. Next time I might try using a pizza cutter instead. My son was shocked that I made the noodles from scratch. My sister in-law said it made the soup and took it up a notch."

"reviewBody": "Reminiscent of my mom’s hand made egg noodles growing up in the Midwest I decided to try this recipe. I hand cut them and rolled them so they were thicker and they took quite a long time to cook in the turkey broth. I did a second batch using my pasta machine and they were much thinner in a fettuccine cut. I added those to broth and they cooked within the time on this recipe. I think the other trick is drying time. Drying for a couple of hours and then placing them in a Ziploc bag in the fridge will cook them faster then if you allowed them to dry overnight. The overnight drying of the hand cut created more of a dumpling texture rather than a soft noodle texture. Perfect for freezing so spend a Saturday morning having a noodle fest and you’ll enjoy the fruits of your labor for the winter months."
