After cooking the eggs, I mixed in Mexican cheese, cubed avocado, fried peppered bacon (I crumbled them) and Verde salsa. The flavor was quite delicious. will definitely make again. We also had leftover fritos scoops that we used to scoop the bowl."

I smeared the avocado-cream cheese on the bottom of our plates (gluten-free), poured salsa over it and used the eggs as a topping. It turned out great! I was worried about the avocado flavor being overpowering but it all blended together wonderfully."

Instead of smashing the avocado, I just cut it in really thin slices and I added some Worcester sauce to the eggs for some taste. Next time I will add some onions to the smashed egg and it should come out even better. We also did not have any bacon, sausage or ham but I am sure it would give a special taste as well. Served with salsa."

Basically mushy and flavorless, these would be so much better with some seasoning, some vegetables for color, flavor and texture, and even some meat - sausage, bacon or ham maybe? Didn't care for the addition of the cottage cheese at all, and the look and mouthfeel of this in general, as another reviewer put it, was simply offputting."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe, although I did not follow exactly. Was looking for a breakfast idea with avocado...so this came up and was the perfect starting point. I did my scramble the way I normally do (salt, pepper, and a random spice; essence or tumeric...anything that will give it a little extra something). Browned the tortillas, once on the second side I put goat cheeese and let it soften while browning the tortilla. Removed from heat, added thinly sliced avocado, then the scrambled eggs and that was it. Cottage cheese and ketchup did not seem right with this. But I didn't try it. Thanks for the idea, we really enjoyed this!!"

In addition to scrambled eggs, I would recommend using queso fresco (a mexican white cheese) which crumbles well instead of cottage cheese, salsa instead of ketchup, and add sliced avocado or guacamole. Can also add chopped tomato and use whole wheat tortillas for added nutrition. Makes a good quick meal anytime."
