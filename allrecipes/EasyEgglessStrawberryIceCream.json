I scaled the recipe to 6 servings as my 3 pint bowl machine was the only one frozen and ready to go. Super easy to combine ingredients. I did use frozen strawberries and defrosted them before chopping/mashing. Worked great! I also added two drops of red food coloring to give it a more pink color base. Plan on making more this weekend! Great summertime treat to beat the heat."

"reviewBody": "I've made this recipe several times now, and its a perfectly good starter recipe, but it's not without its flaws. Personally speaking, I like my ice cream smooth and creamy, and with fruit-based ice cream products, especially where the fruit itself is somewhat fibrous in nature (e.g. strawberry, cantaloupe, etc.), that's simply not going to happen, unless the fruit is first pre-cooked and poured through a sieve. Pureeing it in a food processor, and add it directly into the ice cream machine cannister, hoping that it will turn out smooth and creamy, is a fool's errand."

I cut the recipe back by 1/3 &amp; it fit in my Cuisinart with room to spare, so I'll use the full amount next time, even if I have to pour a bit out. It's completely worth it for that extra bit of ice cream! Oh yes, I forgot to mention I added some chopped fresh strawberries close to the end of the cycle."

Also used half &amp; half instead of whole milk (at the suggestion of reviewer naples34102) , though next time I would just use milk &amp; heavy cream since it is a bit heavy on the cream flavor (tastes more like \"Berries &amp; Cream\" ice cream than berry ice cream). Pretty good for quick and easy, egg-less and heat-less ice cream (so far - haven't yet eaten the frozen stuff, just the fresh-out-of-the-machine stuff).\n\nI also used my Blendtec blender to mix everything, which was a first for me. And I didn't bother with food coloring. The berries made it plenty pink without it!"

We used low fat milk instead of whole because that's what we had, and I only used one tsp of vanilla and didn't measure the salt, but used slightly less than the recipe called for. We didn't have food coloring, so we skipped that. It turned out PERFECT! This was our first time making ice cream, and we will definitely be using this recipe again. By the way, we used less salt and vanilla because it seemed like a lot, but after tasting the finished product, I feel like we could have used the amounts called for and it would have still been delish. Also, omit the strawberries, and this is a wonderful base to experiment with different flavors."
