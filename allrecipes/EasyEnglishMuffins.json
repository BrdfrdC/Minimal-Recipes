"reviewBody": "True to its name, this recipe was easy to make. However, it did dirty up lots of dishes for the yield of 6 English muffins. I started out frying the discs in a cast iron pan set on medium heat. The first ones came out well but started to burn. So I turned down the heat and the second batch burned. Also, bits of cornmeal burned in the bottom of the skillet. Then I switched to a teflon skillet, and those did well. If I make this again, I will try cooking them on a griddle. The muffins toast up crisp and delicious."

"reviewBody": "I kept the the ingredients the same, just changed the method a little. The dough is truely like glue and adding flour to my hands and work surface didn't help this at all. I ended up using a spoon to pour them pancake-style onto a generous amount of cornmeal (okay, I did use about a 1/4 cup) while using a second spoon to help it along. This worked very well. Despite not being able to hand-form them, they did become English muffins. After letting them rest for 90 minutes before cooking, they were dry on the outside and full of lovely air pockets, like I hoped. They were easy to handle with a spatula and came out crispy outside and the right texture and taste inside. Thank you for a baking success (rare for me)."

Cooking tip, i used a coal as well as a standard frying pan Both cast iron. But the frying pan cooked much nicer I start using the comal. I think that the comal is thinner so they browned way too fast and got a little burnt. So much better than store bought."
