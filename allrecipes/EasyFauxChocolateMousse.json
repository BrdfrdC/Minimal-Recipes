"reviewBody": "The mousse was delicious both times we made it. The mascarpone cheese makes it really rich and it had great flavor. Iâ€™m already planning on making it again. A very quick and tasty recipe. I made this recipe a couple of times and experimented with it. I used two different brands of mascarpone. One brand was on the runny side and the other brand was super thick. This affected the consistency of the mousse. Keep in mind that your brand of cheese will affect the consistency. I substituted milk for the heavy whipping cream. If you want it mousse consistency I would recommend using milk or heavy whipping in until you get the consistency you want. I also microwaved my chocolate chips. The key is getting the chocolate chips hot enough otherwise they instantly harden when you mix it into the mascarpone mixture. For my microwave 90 seconds was perfect."

Now I am tempted to try the same mousse idea with butterscotch or peanut butter flavored chips instead of chocolate"

I can see using this as a layer between cakes, on top of layered desserts, etc. Imagine this would also be wonderful with some prepared coffee and coffee liqueur. The possibilities are endless in terms of diversity. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!"

"reviewBody": "This is super yummy! I made with Ghirardelli 60% dark choco chips to keep it as low-carb as possible (used 40 chips). I also did not use the heavy cream. I used Rodelle gourmet vanilla. My thinking was to make a choco-type bread spread like Nutella to abate my morning sweet tooth, but this is worthy of eating by the spoonful. I put the mixture back into the 8 ounce cheese container and 1/16 of the container is 6.5 carbs. For those not counting carbs, this is still a wonderful tasting treat. Try it, you won't be disappointed."
