While I didn't try it, I think adding some melted butter or oil, as waffles have, would help this recipe tremendously. Using half &amp; half, this was three stars for flavor; but an additional star for ingenuity &amp; ease. :) Butter/oil would provide some needed crunch to these.

I had a problem with the pieces on the front of my waffle iron -- the lid didn't touch the top of the French toast when I closed the iron, so I just flipped the pieces when I put in the next batch (see pictures). That worked perfectly. I doubled the recipe to use up most of my loaf of French brioche bread, let the extra pieces cool, placed them in ziplock bags, and we'll pop them in the toaster later this week for a quick breakfast. Thank you for a great recipe!"

My original choice for bread is 1-2 day old baguette which is too hard for sandwiches, it really helps the egg absorption if its a bit dried out- but not rock solid which just makes a bloody mess when you cut it- in the requisite 3/4\" slices, fitting 2 together on each waffle section."

The ones made with Ezekiel bread, oddly enough, tasted best with syrup, but that defeats the use of the healthier Ezekiel bread in the first place, doesn't it?"

I will be using this method from now on for french toast. Also they freeze well this way to pop in the toaster for breakfast on another day."

"reviewBody": "This was good. Nice twist using the iron instead of a frying pan. I still prefer the nice thick, custard like slices but this was fun, too. Not sure if I would go through all the effort to use the iron again when it is easier to clean the skillet but who knows? It present nicely and it holds nice amounts of syrup in the little indentations."

"reviewBody": "Awesome!! Update 03/02/16. I have made this many different ways and just thought I'd let you know. This has become a staple food item in my house. I've tried half 'n half, heavy cream, and whole milk. Full heavy cream and half 'n half win for texture and creamy taste. Milk got a bit more soggy quickly but still delicious. I tried using honey instead of maple syrup and almost cried. It's just not the same without the maple. I've used regular sandwich bread and brioche bread (always gluten free, even for non-celieac family memebers) and brioche wins for taste. Adding a touch of cinnamon won't get you arrested and might even get you an extra kiss in the morning (not guaranteed). These freeze well, making your children super happy at midnight after cram sessions before exams and helping out on those mornings when you may have hit the snooze button one too many times. Thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Quick and easy, and seems to make FT better by resulting in a texture which is less custardy (gooey) than most versions.\n\nI did not cut all slices evenly, so the thinner ones were not as well cooked -- will be more careful next time.\n\nbtw, I believe that it is not necessary to grease a well tempered waffle iron. I use mine several times a month, and I cannot remember when I last bothered to grease it -- must have been at least 15 years ago. As long as it is hot enough, and the cooking is long enough, the waffles will come out clean."

The slices were just the right size, fitting 3 at a time in my Oster rotating waffle-maker. Yum Yum Yum! Next Time I will try sourdough, and maybe some Hawaiian bread also. Enjoy!"

I was unable to find brioche bread so I just used thick farmhouse bread out of the bread aisle. Added a sprinkle of powdered sugar at the end and viola! Perfection!"

"reviewBody": "I'm rating this highly because there's no question it's wonderful, but for me on a busy morning, thick slices of French bread dipped in egg substitute with no other ingredients at all (I avoid sugar) is also remarkably good from the waffle maker. Try it that way, if you just want to get out of the kitchen fast but like to make everybody happy. They can add the syrup and butter at the table. Have been doing this for several years!"
