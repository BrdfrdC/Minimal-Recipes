Then I set them aside, added more oil, and fried the rice. Once the rice was nice and \"crisp\" I removed it and stir fried some eggs that were seasoned with soy sauce and Gochujang. When the eggs were 1/2 cooked, I tossed the veggies and rice back in til heated through. Guess l got carried away but dang it was good and I thank you for inspiring it!"

I also used frozen carrots/peas mix that was slightly thawed. Don't be precious about cooking the eggs separately! Just throw them in like the recipe says and it's great. I used more than a tbsp of soy, pretty much like what the video shows. Finally, everyone is right about the sesame oil. You HAVE to have it for that flavor."

"reviewBody": "I haven't made the recipe yet, but as a former chef, I know that it's a pretty good recipe but, as others have said, rice should be a day old and cold. I agree that frying it first before adding liquids works better use with very little oil. To the person who asked what \"season to taste\" really means it is this. Professional cooks rarely just throw seasoning into a dish. They add a little, taste it, then decide whether or not to add more. That's how you season to taste. This is especially important with salt, pepper and/or garlic as too much of any of them can ruin a dish easily. Ignore the 5 stars. They made me rate it so I went with the most."

I'm so glad I tried this now that I know how easy and quick it is I'll be making it a lot more often. This time I made it with no shrimp or chicken in it but next time I'll add one of those. 😃"

Sautéed slightly onions and poblano pepper added cooked white rice and grated carrot. A dash of light soy and Ponzu citrus sauce. As I had them added chopped almonds. Went with Chinese Barbeque Pork (Chef John). As the pork had soy sauce that is why I went light on the fried rice. If you haven't discovered Ponzu sauce, do try. I often use half Ponzu and soy instead of all soy in a recipe."

Additions: when heating up the oil and before adding the carrots/peas, I cooked up a few cloves of crushed garlic and some red pepper flakes. When the garlic browned, added in the veggies. Also added some diced ham (leftovers from Christmas Eve ham). Finally, after all was mixed together, I added two scallions cut up into 1\" segments and cooked until just tender."

"reviewBody": "Great base! Definitely use cool/cold rice and more egg! I use grated carrot, frozen peas, and don't par-boil any veggies (also added onion and some Napa cabbage). Cook in order - meat (remove), egg (remove), veggies (remove). Fry rice and when fried/heated - add back in: meat (stir &amp;heat), egg (stir &amp; heat), veggies (stir &amp; heat)- but add peas at the very end so they don't get mushy. I also don't use any veg oil - just sesame oil. Love using the red and green canned curry to season meat and rice (just a tad) - but everyone has their own taste. Thanks for sharing!"

I chopped some fresh baby carrots and boiled them about 4 minutes, but I didn't have any peas, so I omitted those. The eggs scrambled up nicely in the wok, and the fridge-cold basmati rice and soy sauce blended in smoothly. The whole process only took about 15 minutes. I served it for lunch with some duck sauce, and it was great!"

"reviewBody": "First time making fried rice. I combed through everyone's tips and tricks before starting. Here's everything I did for an excellent outcome: \nI put 2 cups of enriched white rice in a pan and heated the dry rice until I could hear little popping noises (stirring as it heated). Then I poured in 4 cups of chicken broth and cooked as directed on the package. I let it cool in the pan for 15 or 20 minutes before putting it in the fridge to get cold overnight. The next day, I scrambled 3 eggs and set them aside. I heated about 1/3 cup of veg oil in a Wok and added 12 oz frozen peas and carrots, along with 1/3 cup chopped green onions. I heated those through then added the cold rice and mixed well. Then I added 1/3 cup soy sauce, 2 Tbsp oyster sauce, 1 Tbsp toasted sesame oil, 1 tsp ground ginger, and 1 tsp minced garlic. Mixed well. Added the scrambled eggs and mixed. I let everything heat up and Voila! Really good fried rice! Will definitely make again!"

This recipe was good with basmati rice. Next time I'll add in crab meat but it went good with Seapak butterfly shrimp."

That, of course, is a personal preference, but we opt for healthier when we can. Very easy and good though."
