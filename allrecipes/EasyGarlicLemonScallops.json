My wife and I both loved it and are adding it to our \"family recipe book\". (I did make one slight change - to thicken up the sauce, I added a little bit of corn starch.) Didn't need it, but I was so pumped from how good things came out, figured I'd be even more adventurous! LOL"

If you follow this recipe, a classic template, you will be left with heavenly scallops, both light and sea fresh in their texture, flesh, and coated in a near caramel glaze of garlicky, buttery goodness. Fresh lemon is a must."
