I subbed 3/4c monkfruit white sugar (instead of 1c white cane sugar), subbed half of the oil (used 1/2 c veg oil and 1 pre-measured unsweetened applesauce lunch pack “cup”), and added a decent “handful” of unsweetened coconut flakes (not shreds as i like the chewy surprises it makes in cakes) and otherwise kept it the same. (I will eventually try to modify to 100% unrefined sugar and no oil but for first time i just made those adjustments above). I also made a butter-free cream cheese frosting, to decrease the fat content more, and this cake is amazing! Thank you!"

It was a little thick that way and took a long time to cook. Next time I will keep it thinner as suggested with a single batch in a 9x13 cake pan. Adding the recipe to my GF cookbook. We used Bob's Redmill 1:1 GF flour."

I tried 3 different recipes and all of them came out like a thick dough batter. I know not to overstir, but it was not working out. Sooo many ingredients thrown out. But this recipe was PERFECT! Batter came out beautiful and cake turned out great! Thanks for sharing this recipe, Just perfect!"

It would have been fine without it, but I will say EVERYONE said it was the beat they ever had! This was big because 3 f the people have carrot cake as their favorite and they eat gluten! I also added 1 cup raisins and 1 cup walnuts."

Well, I tried it - I cooked it in about an 8\" x 11\" glass pan so it took a bit longer, I made my cream cheese frosting from my other recipe and wow - it came out GREAT. I used Cup 4 Cup. Only thing I changed was I added some ch. walnuts to the batter. When he bit into it -- he said it was \"stunning\".. :D and I have to agree. He must've raved about it 4 times since. He still doesn't even know it's gf, and he always can tell and asks. He didn't even ask!! And I didn't tell him! GREAT RECIPE, will make often."

I used cup 4 cup gluten free flour which I think is the best all around all purpose gluten free flour. The cake wasn't too heavy and was very moist, but, it was a little spongy. It is a pretty basic carrot cake for those that don't like additions like pineapple, coconut, or nuts. It is also not a thick cake. It is about the height you would get if you made a cake in a sheet pan."
