Should I have stirred the sauce even more to alleviate the grainy texture?"

Swiss cheese with jalapeno Monterey jackcheese. Proportions were perfect. If yours turned out soopy, you didn't thicken the sauce long enough on the stove top. Mine has a generous course ground black pepper on top."

"reviewBody": "My son was recently diagnosed with celiac‘s and I was searching for a mac &amp; cheese recipe to bring to a bbq. Luckily, I found this one! After reading the reviews mentioning the many dishes used I ended up using the pot I made the pasta in to melt the butter. Mixed the milk and cornstarch in another bowl and added to the pot. So I really only dirtied 2 dishes. Anyway I used 12 oz signature brand elbows from Safeway. Only boiled for about 5 min, so they were soft but still a bite to them. (They cook more in the oven.) Didn’t have mustard powder so I used garlic powder. 4 cups of milk was perfect. Used gluten-free breadcrumbs to sprinkle on top with a little paprika. Big hit and nobody could tell it was GF. Thank you for the recipe this one is definitely a keeper!"

I added garlic and onion powder based on other comments here, but it could use even more, imo.\n\nStill, great base recipe, and super easy to make."

Fortunately, my husband suggested I use a baster to siphon off the extra sauce, which I added to some pasta I had left over from chili I had made. \n I added sautéed onion and well-drained, diced, fire roasted tomatoes to the mac and cheese and it was a huge hit at the potluck I brought it to. I used Rotini corn and rice pasta and cooked it for 6 minutes instead of 8 and it held up beautifully through the baking process."

"reviewBody": "Excellent, easy recipe for someone that used to make the boxed stuff most of the time. From scratch was too long and too much. I halved this recipe (as the main dish for two servings) and it was so easy! I made it in my cast iron skillet... melted the butter, added the salt (omitted the mustard powder) and per other reviewers I reduced the milk to 1 1/2 cups from the listed two cups (half of the recipe.) Added 1 1/2 tablespoons of corn starch to the milk, whisked and poured in the skillet. Took less than a minute for it to thicken, probably because the skillet was already hot. Added some onion powder and paprika and 1 1/2 cups of sharp cheddar (saving the other 1/2 for the top.) Sprinkled with just a little bit of paprika and put in the oven. Took less than 8 minutes to get ready to go in the oven and only 20 minutes to bake (convection) so super quick! Didn't use any toppings other than the cheese, but I plan on making this for Thanksgiving in a bigger stainless steel skillet and I will put the cheese in the middle and surround that with crushed plain potato chips. Sure to be a hit!"

"reviewBody": "This is a nice mac'n cheese.I opted for the bread crumb/paprika addition and am glad I did. It really sets it apart from the regular taste. I was worried about cooking the pasta first and then baking it knowing that GF pasta tends to turn to mush after overcooking. It didn't. It held up and was whole when I put my fork into it. I did cook it al dente though, this is an important step. I felt 190°C was too high though. I turned it down to 180°C about 5 minutes into the baking process and left it in for the thirty minutes. It was nice and crunchy on top and oozy-gooey in the middle. I wouldn't call this super easy though. It dirties up a lot of dishes and requires more work than what I consider super easy. It is quite tasty though so it is definitely worth the effort. Thank you kokodiablo for the recipe."
