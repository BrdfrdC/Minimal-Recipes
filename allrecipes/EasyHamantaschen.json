Since many people commented on the corners falling apart, I was extra diligent about pinching as tight as I could, but they did flatten and puff up a little. I didn't lose any of the filling. They had a great taste! Still moist and delicious 3 days later. I did freeze 6 for another time, so will see how they do. I brought them to a supper where many people had not even heard of them, but everyone enjoyed them. Would definitely make again!"

I also substitute 1/2 a tsp of vanilla for almond extract. Also, it's important to chill the dough as per the note at the top. Otherwise, this recipe works great for me. Of course, you can use any spread in these cookies -- chocolate, apricot, raspberry, plum, whatever... Regarding comments of those substituting the oil for butter. That is ok if you are NOT Kosher. However, this turns the recipe into a DAIRY recipe meaning some Jewish families could not eat them after a meat meal. Just something to keep in mind."

"reviewBody": "I have never made such good hamantaschen. I adapted the recipe to make it gluten-free. My cup measures were a bit smaller than standard, but my eggs also weren‚Äôt big. I substituted fermented apple juice (diluted fifty percent, fermented with kefir grains adapted for the purpose: I always have some in the fridge) for orange juice and didn‚Äôt add any baking-powder. I doubled the amount of apple-juice. I substituted gluten-free bread flour for the regular flour in the recipe. The result was a very soft sticky dough. For each hamantasch, I took a spoonful of soft dough, rolled it in gluten-free flour and shaped it into a three-inch disk. After putting in the teaspoonful of sweet filling on each disk, I created the triangular pockets using a technique I read about elsewhere: getting the ‚Äúpinwheel effect‚Äù by ensuring that each side was folded over at the left-hand corner and under at the right-hand corner. That stopped the pastry cases from falling open in the oven. I baked them in a fan-heated electric oven on baking-paper, greased with rapeseed oil, at 170 degrees Centigrade for about twenty minutes. I didn‚Äôt bother with the wire rack but made sure they weren‚Äôt stuck and left them covered but with room to breathe while they cooled."

I didn't and I think that was a big part of why they flattened. Reduced sugar by a 1/4 cup and only used a tsp of filing. Will try with butter, milk and lemon in the dough next time. I tried a different recipe today and it didn't come out at all like this one. I will stick with this one next time."

I always remember my hamantaschen falling apart in the past, but these stuck together for the most part...and I didn't even use water or egg as a binder. I do tend to over-fill though, so a few of the jelly filled ones fell apart upon baking, but that's totally my fault. I made a delicious brownie-like chocolate filling for the others, and those all baked up perfectly. The only change I made to this recipe was adding a tiny bit of orange zest."

The taste was bland, overly floury, and they did not hold their shape at all. There are other recipes out there that call for nearly the same amount of all other ingredients but half the amount of flour. I tried one earlier in the week and it was significantly better. If you choose to follow this recipe cut the flour down to 2 1/2 cups."

I used only 3 cups of flour, as I only had a hand mixer and the motor was starting to burn up because the dough was just too thick (so best with a Kitchenaid mixer). I also refrigerated it for several hours. These came out beautifully, just like my mom used to make. This recipe (with adjustments on the flour) is a keeper!! Please note that I live in CO at an altitude of 7,500 ft above sea level. Not sure if this makes a difference, but baking at this altitude is always a challenge."

After doing a little research, I found the key to making this: oven has to be 400 degrees to get it a little toasty, roll dough to 1/8 in and roll again to stretch it after you \"cut into circles\", only 1 tsp of preserves, and instead of pinching corners, fold and tuck. Unfortunately, I figured this out on my very last cookie which came out beautiful and perfect. I will be starting over and making a new batch..."

They puff up quite a bit, so I suggest either making them a bit thinner or putting in about 1 tsp (instead of two) of fruit preserves, to prevent any running. It also was a bit bland, so I would add a bit of orange or lemon zest next time to bring out a different flavor. I also substituted margarine for 1/4 cup of the oil to give it a bit more body, and my dough rolled out beautifully after refrigerating overnight. I also had to bake about 20 minutes, but that just may be my oven. I want to use this recipe as another cookie base and can't wait to experiment!"

"reviewBody": "I also found the dough bland and hard to work with, but the latter may be my relative lack of experience with baking in general. Putting more than a teaspoon of jam is definitely a mistake and as another reviewer noted, jam is preferable to jelly as jelly will run. I would even go so far as to say that you want confiture or very thick jam for this. As evidenced by the photos, it isn't easy to make these cookies look good either. I know it's possible though, so I'm guessing experience counts. I will try a different recipe next time though as the dough really is bland. Had fun making and eating them with the kids nonetheless."

"reviewBody": "they came out great! everybody loved them! they taste like the real thing. I freezed half of the dough wrapped very well in saran wrap and the hamantaschen also came out great. I thawed the dough overnight in the fridge, but when I started to roll it it cracked a little bit. I let it sit in the counter for 15 minutes to get closer to room temperature and then it rolled out fine."

The biggest problem I had was that the sides of the cookie opened up while in the oven. Make sure that you pinch the corners well, and do not overload with preserves."

"reviewBody": "This was one of the easiest, tastiest cookie recipes I have used. I followed the recipe nearly to the letter, though I used only 5 cups of flour (plus more for rolling) and I chilled the dough for 2 hours, I think the chilling is a must, considering it needs to be rolled so thin. I also had to cook them about 15 minutes, but it all depends on your oven. What a great recipe though, I'll be making these for years to come! Thanks!"

"reviewBody": "Great recipe. Tips: use wax paper to roll it out, it can be a little sticky, but that's ok. I made my cookies too big and even though I keep adjusting after each batch I would of liked smaller cookies, so I suggest smaller cookies as they will swell a lot in the oven. Don't worry about putting them too close together on the cookie sheet because after you pinch them into eyes they have plenty of room next to each other. Make the most of your first rolling out because each subsequent rolling out will produce more inferior cookies than the last."

"reviewBody": "No mixer needed for this recipe!!! I substituted white whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour, added flour gradually. First I used a whisk, then a rubber scraper, and finally just my hand to get the last bit of flour mixed in. I rolled out the dough between two sheets of waxed paper without chilling it, and used an inverted drinking glass to cut the dough into circles. One tsp. of preserves was plenty. Make sure to pinch the sides closed very well so they don't flop open. I baked on parchment paper, for about 15 minutes. Got about 50 hamantaschen. they turned out great. Now I would like an easy recipe for the poppy seed filling!"

I'm going to try using brownie mix as the filling in my next batch (like in another recipe, Hamentashen w/ brownie filling, from this site). We liked the texture and taste of this batter, so I'm going to play with fillings. I used blueberry for some and raspberry for some so far. Thank you this is an easy recipe."

Also, 4 cups of flour was perfect, 5 1/2 would have been too much. I used both rasberry jam and plum/prune butter and baked for 15 minutes which was perfect. I will definately make this recipe again and next time I may take some of the dough and shape them into walnut size balls, put an indentation in this middle and fill with jam. Thank you for this versatile recipe."

The taste wasn't impacted, but they didn't hold their shape. The second batch turned out with a better triangle shape.\n\nWhen I make these again I won't add the flour all at once, seeing as I probably added another cup while I was rolling the dough."

"reviewBody": "Loved this recipe. I made it twice it was so yummy. I suggest holding back a little on the flour because by the time you flour the surface you use to roll the dough...you will have added quite a bit more flour to the recipe and it makes it more difficult for the edges to stay pinched together. I also wouldn't refigerate the dough...I don't think the piched corners would stay together as well."

"reviewBody": "Excellent cookie. Good texture, good shape hold, and without a bitter after taste that many hamantaschen recipes have.I would not recommend refridgerating the dough though. Dough should be used immediately after making. If one delays, some extra egg &amp; water solution should be used to seal seams before baking, as the seams will rupture and spill goo everywhere if they aren't sealed. Use good quality jam and avoid using jellies as they tend to leak more."
