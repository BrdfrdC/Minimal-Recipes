The only thing that would make this better for me would be the addition of some yogurt in place of half the milk. Otherwise, it was easy, and very much enjoyed! Thank you for the recipe!"

Do 3/4 C. oats and 1C. of milk, couple drips of vanilla, the Chia seeds, couple tsp. of Cinnamon grounded, handful of blueberries. place lid on shake and put in refrigerator. \n\nThe blueberries give just eight sweetness, to make it good."
