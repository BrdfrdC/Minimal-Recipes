I also used white and red onion (half of each). Substitute the water with beef broth and substitute the pinch of garlic powder with minced garlic. Of course don’t forget to add a teaspoon of cayenne pepper, diced bell pepper and a tablespoon of sugar. If you’re looking for the recipe for Wendy’s famous chili, follow my directions- THIS IS IT!"

"reviewBody": "We all have the types of chili that are our favorites but I like to try new things all the time (especially ones listed as \"easy!). As written, I did not care for this at all. First, the chili itself is too watery even after trying to cook it down, which negates the 15 minute simmer- this can easily be fixed by adding less water. The texture with the beans did not appeal to us because the beans are somewhat hard and we prefer softer ones (Campbell's Pork and Beans would be great). The most important aspect, of course, are the spices. This recipe says a \"pinch\" of chili powder and garlic powder- while I did notice on the direction line to season to taste, I shudder to think of all the new cooks who took the ingredient list literally and then couldn't figure out why it had no flavor. It would be far better if the larger amounts of spices required by chili were listed and then the cook could adjust them slightly in either direction as they made this. I didn't hate this recipe but it is one I won't repeat. Easy means not having to play and adjust everything in the recipe!"

Occasionally I will chop up a medium green bell pepper to add to the chili pot, and maybe chop a couple cloves of fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder. Still this is the simplest of my comfort food recipes."

Personally I add to above in the 2nd and 3rd step, can of black beans, can of pinto beans, jar of desired salsa (medium for me), can of corn, diced up green pepper, pinch of cumin, minced garlic instead of dry garlic, 1/2 or more can of tomato paste to thicken, and a pinch of cinnamon. Will make more servings than before. For extra fun and flavor, add tortilla chips (with a kick of lime) crushed up, cheese (cheddar, Mexican mix, etc. It’s cheese, how can you go wrong?), and a bit of sour cream."

I wish I had cooked the onions by themselves as I prefer a softer onion."
