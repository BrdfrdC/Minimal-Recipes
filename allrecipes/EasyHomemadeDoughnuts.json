"reviewBody": "This recipe lived up to its name- super easy! No yeast and no buttermilk. Had a craving for donuts around 5:40, my local shop closes at 6. By 7 I had dinner ready and a batch of beautiful donuts waiting to be fried. I read a lot of complaints about this recipe but made no alterations. I found the subtle sweetness of the dough was perfect and it rose better than I was expecting. Only thing I would do differently next time is to add a bit more vanilla, 2 capfuls or so. They will look flat before frying, don’t worry. The dough was sticky sure but not too difficult to work with if you know what you’re doing. The only thing that was a little tough was incorporating the dry ingredients while not over mixing to avoid overworking the dough. Have your sugar ready because they will need to be coated immediately after coming out of the oil for maximum coverage. Best way to serve and eat them is while they are still hot. Fantastic!!! Will make them again."

I've made bread and noodles quite often before, so once my anxiety went away, I figured I'd try. My 3YO daughter and I made these donuts. My family of 5 enjoyed them immensely. I thought, too, it wouldn't make enough, and it actually made extra. We were quite pleased with this easy recipe."

I ended up putting it into this donut press thing that my mom had and just plopped the dough straight into the oil that way, and they turned out great! I'm sure you'd be able to put it into a piping bag and pipe the donut shapes onto some parchment as well. I ended up making some cinnamon sugar to cover them in after and it tasted great"

I used 6 T. milk with the 2 T. vinegar and let it sit a good 5 min. before adding it. I did just roll the dough in balls. Very addicting."

"reviewBody": "This was a delicious recipe! I have made tried many donut recipes with similar ingredients but this one takes the cake! Easy and fast to make in comparison to yeast donuts. Half way through the using the dough we decided diced green apples would be yummy so we mixed them into the remaining dough. The outside was crispy and inside was fluffy. My 3 boys and invited the neighbors to come and eat them with us and their mom was in heaven-so good! The only thing I recommend is to skip donuts and make donut holes. I didn't want to add more flour to make it a consistency that I could roll out. I used a 2 Tbsp cookie scoop, and the dough expanded to double in size in the oil."

I made a double batch which made a dozen donuts and a few donut holes.\n\nWe made a basic glaze (not from this recipe) and then did lots of little variations. In total we did classic glaze, chocolate glaze, strawberry glaze, maple glaze, sprinkles, cinnamon &amp; sugar, and plain sugar.\n\nI didn't have a donut-shaped cutter, so we used a big and small heart-shaped cookie cutter. I also didn't have a mixer, so I did it all by hand. They still came out really good."

Next go round I'll add a pinch more salt to balance the sweetness of the heavy sugar/cinnamon I used to coat them with. They came out a tad dry/dense in the center compared with store bought. Not sure how to tweak it for a moister lighter center."

"reviewBody": "This is a good, basic doughnut recipe, with the exception that it calls for just a tad too much liquid. I made it as written except that I used real buttermilk instead of the milk/vinegar substitute, and only put in 1/3 cup. It rolled out perfectly. (A tip that my mother taught me: when rolling out sweet things use powdered sugar instead of flour, it will add a little sweetness, but won't make your baked good tougher!) I don't have a doughnut cutter, but I used a 3\" biscuit cutter and cut out the centers with one of my grandmother's cordial glasses and it worked perfectly. They fried easily. I thought they came out a little dense, but tasty. I did make a glaze of 1 C powdered sugar, 1/2 t vanilla and 2 T water to glaze the tops instead of dusting them with powdered sugar, but that's just my personal preference."

Instead of donuts, I made donut holes and just rolled the dough by hand into little balls (they will expand in the oil) and dropped them into the hot oil. They will cook fast, so watch them carefully. Others complained of sticky dough, but I just added flour a little at a time and rolled the dough until it had a firm consistency. These are simple to make and delicious to eat! My kind of recipe! My hubby loved them, so I will make them again in the future!"

I added vanilla and nutmeg for the old fashioned flavor. I always use lard for donuts it seems to have a better after effect and not so much grease absorption. I did do them as donuts in a donut dropper. I would definitely pass this recipe along for anybody trying donuts for the first time!"

While I was preparing to sour the milk I figured \"what the heck\" and grabbed whole milk farm fresh Kefir I,had on hand instead figuring it's cultured milk and the same concept. I used a scant 1/2 cup and added extra flour on the board before turning out the dough. After frying I coated them in cinnamon-sugar. The family loved them. Great recipe for deciding on a whim to make doughnuts before the sun set on doughnut day. Thank you."

I would say this recipe needs nearly four cups of flour or three cups of flour 1 cup of powdered buttermilk for it to be anywhere near rollable! I did not add that much additional flour , and just ended up putting the dough in my oil by dropping it in my clumps! They are ugly as sin but taste very yummy!

My family did not like this recipe because there was little flavor, even with the powdered sugar topping. Also, be sure you sift the flour or use bread flour. I think mine turned out a bit heavy because I wasn't careful of this."
