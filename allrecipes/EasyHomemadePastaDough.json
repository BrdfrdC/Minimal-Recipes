I paired it with the Alfredo Sauce recipe by Rebecca Swift here on AR and it was sooooo delicious and incredibly filling. I have a Kitchenaid with all three pasta rollers/cutters and it was a breeze to run them though..I even use the roller to knead the dough for me util it comes out smooth. A keeper because this is very easy to make in just a few minutes and doesn't produce five pound of pasta to be forgotten about later."

For those of you interested in trying homemade pasta but don’t have a pasta machine try pasta rustica. Just make the pasta door rolling out as flat as you can and then roll it up and cut it as thin as you can and then unroll the pieces and boil them. You will be amazed at the results and people will be very impressed."
