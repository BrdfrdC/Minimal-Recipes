I used a relatively lean 5 lb corned beef, and it seemed like it shrunk about 30-40% in the cooking process, so you might want to take that into account. The seasoning was perfect. I did not find it too peppery. It is a very easy recipe; it just takes a lot of time. St. Patrick's Day will probably end up being Pastrami on Rye from now on."

Removed it from the oven and let it sit for about 10 --15 minutes. Removed all the foil and placed it on a cutting board and sliced it. It sliced perfectly and it was great."

We are wimps when it comes to to much spicy food so it turned out perfect. Plus we put it on our Pit Boss to Smoke that baby up. If you can Highly Suggest smoking it for at least an hour."

The people who complained that this was a \"spicy roast beef\" or was \"brown inside, not like pastrami\" - my guess is they started with a beef brisket, rather than a 'corned' beef brisket. That's the only thing that makes sense, because this is absolutely fabulous pastrami. My only complaint was that I should have trimmed the fat cap on my beef, but easy to trim off after heating in the skillet."

I also didn't have smoked paprika or white pepper. I didn't miss it and if you don't have it, I wouldn't go out to buy it just for this recipe. I just increased the coriander and black pepper a bit. I made some homemade Russian dressing, and made the typical pastrami sandwich on rye with Swiss cheese and sauerkraut. Delicious! I can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow."

"reviewBody": "We followed the recipe to the letter. This is a very admirable attempt to create one of my favorite deli meats. And that's just what \"Chef John\" said, that it was a substitute not exactly. I find that to be true. The spice blend is good yet a tad overly peppery. With that said, the meat (inside) lacked some flavor that Pastrami usually has. I'm sure that would have to do with brining. So my conclusion would be... I will probably brine a brisket for a few days and then use this spice blend minus a bit of the pepper (not much though.) I might try smoking the meat as well. I know hard work was put into this. Thank-You"

But if you have never tried the process of making pastrami, try this one. It's a winner. Thank you Chef John for your wonderful recipes - I'm a FAN."

"reviewBody": "I made this yesterday and it turned out great. I had a 2.5 lb brisket, soaked it in the brine 8 hrs, cooked it for 3 1/2 hrs then wrapped it tightly in foil and refrigerated immediately. I let it set in the fridge overnight to \"rest\" before I sliced it. Wasn't dry at all and sure beats paying $11.99 lb. at the store! Everyone loves it and it is so fragrant! http://www.juiceblendz.com/"

I prefer strong a strong garlic taste and I found that cooking it for about 5-5.5 hours - instead of 6 - resulted in a more tender, rare pastrami. 5 stars!"

My only advise to others is to make at least two of these at a time because the finished product goes away much to fast and its just as easy to make two or three at a time as it is to only make one. The finished pastrami freezes well."

"reviewBody": "This was really, REALLY good. It was not hard at all, even though there were a lot of steps. Once I applied the rub, it was just a matter of triple-sealing the meat. The number of steps just looks intimidating. Mine came out a nice dark pink. I bought a rectangular shaped corned beef for even slices, which I recommend. My meat was also leaner than the meat in the video. I was able to trim most of the visisble fat."

Even though it came out delicious and everyone including the little grandchildren loved it and asked for more and more, it did not really come out like the one in Chef John's video.\n\nThe instructions were easy to follow. There was just one thing I did differently. I could not bring myself to use 1/4 cup of pepper for the rub and therefore I adjusted the measurements of the other rub ingredients accordingly.\n\nThe pastrami roast came out delicious and so tender. It was brown like a brisket, not red like a pastrami! That was not a problem for my family, but it made it a little difficult to review since it is supposed to be pastrami!"
