I think our \"all purpose flour\" is harder than in the U.S. Also the climate is very dry. When I make pie crust with lard I add much more water than the recipe says. A lady who makes pies for the farmers' market told me \"You'll think you've got it too wet.\" but after an hour in the fridge it is perfect. I'll try this next time I make this pie crust, and use 10 tbs. water rather than 7. Incidentally, I've wondered why, on the packet of \"all purpose flour\" they don't indicate what kind of wheat they are using. All purpose flour isn't the same in different parts of the continent."

I have reluctantly relied on commercial crusts and trying not to think about some of the ingredients they contain, in between attempts at home made. I stumbled upon this one today when using up some leftover turkey by making a pot pie and needing a crust with none in the freezer. I was blown away by how good this crust is and my husband kept raving about it . I will search no more and will gladly be giving up store-bought. Thanks so much Chef John!!"

"reviewBody": "I’ve been making flaky pie crusts by hand for years, so I had my doubts about using a food processor to make it. As I get older my hands are no longer able to cut the fat into the crust and this is the perfect solution. Flaky and tasty is how I’d describe Chef John’s recipe! The only issue I have with all butter pie crusts in general is that, although flaky, they’re very hard and difficult to cut. I’m wondering if subbing some high quality lard for a portion of the butter would help soften it enough to make it easier to cut and eat?"

I can't tell you how many crust recipes I have been through and my frustration factor would go through the roof. I think I actually balled one up and threw it across the kitchen I was so frustrated (it was the general direction of the trash can). I tried this one and I was shocked....no fighting, 4-letter words, no frustration a very nice pie crust that rolled very well. I have used a similar recipe in the past but never with these results. I did use a pastry blender to cut the butter into the flour and incorporate to a nice ball. Yes it took longer but it gave me a chance to get a feel for the crust (I was to lazy to get my food processor out - and I was concerned it might be over powered . I have tried cookie dough in it before and it didn't work out well) Old school works just fine if you have the time and don't have a food processor handy."

"reviewBody": "I have tried many pie crust recipes over the years, but this recipe using a food processor is by far the easiest and best I've made. I measured the flour (12 ozs. per the video) and made this recipe exactly as written. The dough was easily made in the food processor and prevents overworking by hand. I like to watch the video first, but the detailed directions, make it a simple process also. The dough was easy to roll out. Since I was making a peach pie, I also brushed the egg wash (1 egg yolk stirred with 1 TBSP. water) on the bottom crust, to prevent a soggy bottom crust. The crust was very flaky and buttery. I usually keep this double pie dough in my freezer to have on hand. Let the dough thaw out in the refrigerator overnight and roll out! This is recipe is my \"go-to\" for pie crust."

My dough didn't come together like the video but I continued to work the dough. So glad I did. Put it in the fridge while I made the Chicken Pot Pie filling. After rolling out dough , filling and adding top crust I did the egg wash. Couldn't believe how lovely the crust turned out. If your not experienced in making pie crust, this is a great recipe, be patient with yourself and watch the video. Enjoy"

However, I think it was delicious and I received positive feedback as well! It went so well with this apple pie recipe I had.\n\nSince I had a small food processor, I split the recipe and repeated the processing step twice. I also might have to add more water next time because the dough kept breaking around the edges.\n\nThank you for the recipe! I never thought I'd be making my own pie crust. Now I feel a little inspired to try other pies and designs."

It is almost too buttery. Maybe I miss the lard flavor that I'm accustomed to using. And, it was very tough, even though I tried to follow the video pictures as to what it should look like when I finished processing. It took a lot of \"kneading\" to get the dough together, and then there were still many stray crumbs that were wasted."

My husband thought it was the best apple pie I've made to date! I didn't have unsalted butter, so I used regular butter and did not add salt to the dough. I had to use 10 tbl of ice water because the dough was too crumbly. Next time I will try to use 8 because the dough was very hard to roll out and work with. Thank you!"

This has a wonderful buttery flavor, and is light and flaky, likely due to the coldness of the butter, refrigerating the dough 30\" or more, or perhaps the vinegar. Yum!"
