Notes: if your crust is too \"doughy\" between the crust and the toppings, try to pre-bake the crust on its own for 5 minutes at the recommended temp, then pullit oit, add your toppings and bake for an additional 17 minutes! Itll be perfect!"

Which is best? Also, I usually turn the dough out right into the pan - the first time I tried to roll it out onto the counter, then try to transfer it to a preheated stone was hilllllarious - I topped it before transferring, then had to fold it all up to keep the toppings from spilling everywhere as I tried to move it without burning myself. Then unfold the saucy cheese and misshapen pile‚Ä¶Oh man. No matter how many blogs I read, I still gotta live and learn the hard way sometimes. I also learned I can divide the dough and put it in two pie pans - great for when the littles have friends over and want a personal pizza!"

"reviewBody": "this basic recipe is pretty dang good! I usually do let the dough rise a bit - it doesn't really take long and gives you time to assemble the sauce, toppings, pizza stone, preheat the oven. I would make one big suggestion, and that is to include the weight of the flour. We have been home sick w COVID so have made this twice in the past few days, similar temperature, sam tools, but once with double 00 flour and once part 00 and part unbleached white. I had to add more water in the former, more flour in the latter. And I don't think I am going to get a nice dough with adding more water droplets - hope it gets better as it rises. I appreciate that not everyone has a home scale (although they are inexpensive and GREAT for baking!!), but putting both the cup measurements AND the weight would be really a plus!"

"reviewBody": "This is definitely my go to pizza crust. It is so simple and quick. I usually make homemade pizza at least one night a week. We always vary it up - pepperoni, sausage, ground lamb, buffalo chicken, cheesesteak, taco, the varies are endless. I mix it up, let it sit a few minutes, and press it into my pans, prebake for about 7 minutes, take it out, top it, and bake. Couldn't be simpler or easier. The tough part is deciding what kind of pizza toppings we want. Most times we make 2 different ones. I have made it the way the recipe calls for, but I normally use quick rise yeast, so I can skip the proofing step, just to save a little time."

My husband likes a flavorful crust &amp; so I added more seasonings to the dough like Italian seasonings &amp; such. Added olive oil on the dough when I had it rolled out- then sprinkled Parmesan cheese around the crust part- Taste wise by adding &amp; tweaking the recipe more, a 9/10!

"reviewBody": "Pro tip this recipe requires 2 1/4 tsp yeast. Using a package measurement without the actual measurement is silly. My yeast comes in 2lbs bags. Let the yeast water, oil, sugar and salt sit in the warm water until a nice frothy head is present. I use a kitechenaid with a dough hook to work the dough. Then put some olive oil on the dough ball. Cold rising for a few days in the fridge is way better as it produces more flavour and better gloutin strands in the dough structure. But in a pinch leave the dough on the counter for 1 hr. until doubled in size then separate into 8oz balls. turning them in on themselves. Let rise again then push the dough out on a floured surface, never roll! I use a pizza stone in my oven and crank it as high as it will go 550F in my case. this allows the pizza to cook quickly forming large cavernouse bubbles. Using parchment under the dough and a peel makes transfer in an off the stone easy."

"reviewBody": "We got into making pizza when the pandemic shut everything down. I‚Äôve experimented with lots of different dough recipes. I was skeptical of this one due to the short rise, but this turned out really good. I used King Arthur 00 flour and mixed it in my stand mixer. It was really sticky, so I just kept adding flour until it was the consistency I was looking for. While it was resting, I read the reviews and decided to let it rise for about 30 minutes. I divided it to make two pizzas and cooked it at 550 on my pizza steel. It took about 6 minutes to cook. I have to say this dough was by far the easiest to handle out of all the recipes I have tried. It made pizzas on the thicker side, but the crust was a nice texture. Definitely will be using this one on a regular basis."

I made a ricotta pizza - but first baked the sauce, seasonings, garlic, and mushrooms for 15 minutes. Pulled out, then added ricotta cheese, and put it back in the oven at a lower temp for a few minutes, just to warm the cheese. I tried a slice before heating with ricotta, as you'll see in the image. I'll add more sauce next time but there will definitely be a next time! Thanks!"

I just used all-purpose flour and used instant yeast so i tossed all my dry ingredients first and then added water and olive oil. I added some garlic powder to the mix too since some of the comments said it lacked flavor. I used a pizza stone and didn't have corn flour so i sprinkled just a little of flour on it even though I don't think it needed it. It was perfect! Better than I expected!

"reviewBody": "This recipe is indeed quick and easy. Unfortunately, it is unmanageable as the dough is too sticky. Pizza crust is a type of bread, so you need to be mindful about the amount of water and flour you add. As someone suggested, this recipe is better if 1/2 cup of the water is used for the yeast and the rest is added in small bits about 1/4c at a time or less. Otherwise, the dough will not come together enough and you will need to add a lot more flour until it does not stick so much. Also, if you would like a pizza with a thin crust, you would probably be better using half of the dough. Also, to manage the dough, it also helps to rub a bit of olive oil on the hands. I also did a little bit of kneading but let if rest about 10 minutes or so. It is a good recipe but is not necessarily easy to work with. A rule of thumb is to check the environmental humidity if too high, use less water and if too dry use more but always add gradually."
