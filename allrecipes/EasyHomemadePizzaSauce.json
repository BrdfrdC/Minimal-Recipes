I read the reviews prior to making this sauce, so I was on the lookout for it being too watery. That turned out not to be a problem. That makes me wonder if people were using tomato sauce rather than tomato paste, which might cause it to be too thin. The tomato paste gives it nice, rich tomato flavor!"

I let this sit about 2 hours on the countertop while the crust was rising and being shaped. The flavors were great. Everyone loved it including the picky grandkid. This is definitely a keeper. It would also be a great dipping sauce for garlic bread sticks - with a bit of red pepper flakes added perhaps for some kick."

The only adjustment I usually make is to reduce the water by half to start and if I need more, I add it a bit at a time. Keeps well for day 2, if I have enough dough for another day."

I also added 1/2T of sugar. \n\nI spent 45 minutes simmering down the water content. The oil never fully mixed in. I would think adding vinegar or ketchup would help as an emulsifier.\n\nOverall if you only have tomato paste as I did and not any other tomato product this would work as a sauce, just going expect great results as the recipe stands."

I adjusted the water as well, it was going to be runny if I didn’t, 2/3 cups was plenty, I also doubled the amount of salt and pepper (more pepper than salt - 20 grinds of pink salt and 30 grinds of pepper). Just waiting to put it on pizza, but aroma filled the house and very easy to make!"

I also reduced the olive oil to 1/4 a cup and added an extra garlic clove. Then, I threw it all in a blender which worked really well. After all these adjustments I can say that my whole family really enjoyed the sauce, my husband especially :)"

I usually make this and use it shortly afterwards but this last time I didn't use the sauce until about a day and half later. Oh my goodness is it SO delicious after it sits for a while in the fridge! My husband has gone on and on about it ever since, saying it's the best pizza sauce he's ever had. So a word to the wise, this recipe is even 10 times better a day later!"

"reviewBody": "My father always made this sauce with beer instead of water. I like Budweiser beer for this sauce. It adds just a touch of flavor. I think it helps mellow out the acidic tang of the tomato paste and adds just a bit of sweetness to the flavor. I use the olive oil as noted in the recipe and stir in the beer last to get the sauce to the right viscosity. \n\nIt's going to firm up in the refrigerator, so you'll need to add enough beer so that's it's saucy when you put it in. It will be more like a paste when you take it out. It really should sit for a day to set up, but I have found that a minimum of 6 hours in the refrigerator will get the sauce to a reasonable flavor level. Time is always your friend with tomato/garlic combinations."

I reduced the water until the thickness was to my liking and dropped the oil down a bit. I then added about 1/2 tsp each of garlic powder and onion powder (maybe a little less)!and a dash of McCormick chili powder. I use whole dry spices and grind them myself with a small mortar and pestle but that's my preference. I let it all sit on the counter for about 4 hours. Awesome!"
