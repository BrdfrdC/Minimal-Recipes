I make this when I need to use up leftover rice, veggies, or chicken breast from the fridge. Separating each set of ingredients as you cook is best. I add Tajin citrus pepper after cooking rather than black pepper during. I sometimes add sautéed chopped cabbage with a white onion. In lieu of sesame oil, I’ll dump a teaspoon of sesame seeds in with the shrimp. I often pour a few ounces of hot water on top of the rice as I mix to prevent sticking. Pictured with hoisin sauce and Yum Yum sauce."

So everything was going well till I needed to add a teaspoon and a half of soy sauce and a bit more garlic. That still left things bland so I decided to be experimental and took a dive into my herbs and spices. Throwing together with paprika, basil, and crushed red pepper and omg it turned out amazing! Especially if you enjoy things with a bit of kick to it, you definitely have to try this out and all I changed was some spices! Everything else was fantastic and added onions to it since I love them!"

Very easy as long as you have all the ingredients prepped before you start cooking. This one is a keeper. I added a little oyster sauce after cooking, but that's just my personal preference. It was great with and without it."

"reviewBody": "Prepared the recipe mostly as is. I reduced the recipe to 2 servings and still had leftovers! So beware this recipe yields a lot if you are a person who eats small portions! Instead of using corn, I replaced that for the same amount of peas and carrots and chopped a small onion I had lying around. This was very good and as long as you \"mise en place\" (prep all before starting) you should have a meal in a matter of minutes! Don't fret if you do not have a fancy wok as long as you have your reliable non-stick pan that you know, you should be fine. Don't overcook your shrimp would be my most important advice for this recipe. I will make this again!"

I'm pretty picky with how I like my shrimp, so I wasn't sure if I would like it in a stir fry (fried or scampi is usually my go to). But even I couldn't help but go back for seconds. Delicious and simple. I did swap out regular onion for the green and accidentally put in 3 garlic gloves instead of two.....ooops, but I'm pretty sure that even my changes didn't make much of a \"flavor\" difference. It is great!"
