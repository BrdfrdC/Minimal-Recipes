I also combined the milk, condensed milk and 2 eggs on the stove top, cooked while continuously stirring until 165 degrees. Cooling completely, adding the vanilla and will use my Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker later!"

So then we added it it our ice cream maker. What we ended up with was a delicious and creamy vanilla ice cream that pleased all 6 of us! My oldest said it had a “marshmallow vibe. We also made a mint chocolate cookie frozen custard(we dyed it purple instead of green, because why not) and made mixed cones. Super happy tummies in this house"

I needed to ensure that this remained creamy without ice milk crystals and this did the trick! However, you could probably use 2 cups cream and 2 cups half &amp; half with similar results. I did not add any additional sugar as some recipes recommended. It was quite sweet enough. We did not use add-ins as this was our 1st time making it and we’d like a good base. This will definitely work for us and we look forward to experimenting with fruits and flavors!"

I use my ice cream maker and add chop up Oreo cookies, any variety of candy bar or even M&amp;M's candies at the end, then place it all in a freezer container to firm it up overnight. The kids all love it naturally but we know it's made with real milk and no by-products whatsoever."

We put the strawberry s in a processor to make the berries less chunky. To our amazement it was awesome. It's for our family 4th of July party we are having tomorrow. During the party I'm going to make the Coco and Cinnamon receipt I read in one of the reviews. This is very inexpensive receipt to make. \nHave Fun!"

That's true, but it ain't your Grandma's homemade ice cream. My results were good, it's very smooth and creamy, but first taste was disappointing. Tasted like sweetened condensed milk added to vanilla ice cream. We'll eat it, but no shortcut for me next time."

WOW! Caramel flavored ice cream - it was really good! Now I'm going to try mocha flavored, and when I get more caramel flavored condensed milk, will try to make a caramel frappuchino flavored one.\n\nI like that this recipe is so easy to make and my kids get to help without making a complete mess!"

I mixed together all of the ingredients listed, except I used only 1 tablespoon pure vanilla, which was plenty. I was hesitant at the creaminess and sweetness of the ice cream, partially because I use homemade sweetened condensed milk (also on allrecipes). So I added 1 pint of heavy cream and 3/4 cup sugar. I whipped all the ingredients together in a bowl for about 2 minutes then poured into ice cream freezer. Make sure and ripen this ice cream before serving; otherwise it will start to melt in your bowl as you're eating it--an hour in the freezer does the trick."

"reviewBody": "We just got a new Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker for Christmas and having never made home-made ice cream before I an trying out many recipes. This tasted good, but after I made it I froze it overnight. The resulting ice cream was very hard, and tasted more like diet ice cream. I think it needs more fat, maybe 2 cups half and half and 2 cups heavy cream. I also think that if it had been frozen for 3-4 hours, then eaten, the texture would have been much better. I might experiment with this recipe as others have. I would like it to work since it is so easy!"

"reviewBody": "Like many of the others, I found this very easy to make! I have tried recipes that need to be cooked, etc. that taste gritty from the sugar. With sweetened milk, it doesn't happen. I made recipe as described and put in ice cream maker. Worked perfectly! As my family enjoyed it, we thought of many ways to add yummy things to it. This time we added 6-single serve instant coffee packs diluted in a very small amount of warm water to the mixture. (It did not dilute well in the milk mixture). It is in the freezing process now, but the mixture tastes divine! May add mini-chips for added texture…I'll see how I feel when the final mixing comes around!"

Also, we gave it a mocha flavor by adding 1/4 cup of cocao powder along with 1 rounded tsp of instant coffee and 1 tsp of cinnamon. We used a Kitchen Aid ice cream freezer attachment and ran it for 25 minutes. Delicioso!"

"reviewBody": "I am making this ice cream right now in a Cuisinart ice cream/yogurt maker that someone gave to me. I would not call this ice cream but ice milk since it is not the custard based ice cream and basically all you are using is milk and sugar. I have to say, I am someone who craves sweets every day and this is way too sweet ! I would suggest somehow cutting amount of the sweetened condensed milk used in this recipe so that you use less, or maybe add other flavors to cut down on the sugar. It is so very sweet, I ate maybe 1/4th cup of the ice cream when it was done and I feel physically, like I just ate a whole bowl of sugar, with milk on it, jittery and nauseated. If I make this recipe again, I will just use 1/4th cup of sweetened condensed milk instead of the whole can and maybe add fruit for a sweet taste. \nAs far as an ice cream taste, this tastes like ice milk. Also the costs is far greater making this than if you just buy a carton of Breyers on sale. Homemade is sometimes better in some recipes, but next time I will just buy Breyers or Edys."

The first day is definitely the best. This is a good base recipe to add whatever you want. Play with extracts, too, if you want a different flavor altogether. Very easy, versatile, and tasty."

Instead of vanilla extract, I used the seeds/whatever you scrape from a vanilla bean instead. It had a lovely vanilla flavor that way. Husband was complaining it was gritty, but I think that is bc he was eating it before placing it back in the freezer--ice cream making is a process for a reason! Otherwise, he liked it. He added in M&amp;Ms apparently bc he could. I tried it and thought it was good, but can't have much of it due to being lactose intolerant. Thanks for the recipe!"
