So many critisize the ingredient list not the taste, but the bad for you ingredients! I'm sorry, but I'm sure that All Recipes members already know that a b'fast of deep fried bacon, french toast made with real eggs (vs: egg whites) and cream and white bread is not good for you. This knowledge also includes un-natural foods, low fiber, high carb, anything that tastes good! Thx, Tish"

I made a ranchero sauce from scratch instead of using salsa and we only had flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas so I just warmed them up, not fried them. I also used morningstar veggie bacon. MUCH lower in fat than the original recipe, but still bursting with flavor. We actually ended up eating these again for dinner a few nights later because it was so easy to make. I had some cooked, chopped shrimp from dinner the previous night and I threw that on top as well the second time. Yummy."

First we don't use beans, second we scramble our eggs, and last we use tomato saue with a little bit of water and add onions, jalapeno to that. We then place the scrambled eggs( that is done like an omlet, not scrambled scrambled.)on top of two corn tortillas. Of course we put the melted Munster cheese on top with beacon."

MUCH better, in out opinion.\n\nThis was yummo and we'll definitely be making it again!"

"reviewBody": "I don't know how \"authentic\" these are, but they were a hit with my family. I had all the ingredients and they were pretty simple to make. I didn't have refried beans w/green chiles, so I just added them into the beans before warming them. For my 6-yr old, I made him seperate beans w/out the chiles. My tortillas were VERY chewy...I don't know if I fried them too long, or not long enough, or if they were old. I also added SW seasoning and green onions on the top. I broiled them after they were assembled to melt the cheese, which I put on the top. (it doesn't say what to do with the cheese). Next time, I think I'll try them with flour tortillas, per my son's request, and maybe just use spray oil and/or butter like other reviewers have suggested. Jalapenos would be good too! These were pretty good. I will make them again...something different for dinner! :)) Thank you!"

Personally I prefer to cook/boil dry pinto beans then mash them up while frying them in bacon grease, just like they do in Mexico. If you don't want to prepare your own beans, then use canned pinto beans instead. Anytime I make beans for friends, they all rave about the taste. Try it and see if it doesn't improve the flavor. \nI also prefer a green salsa verde (tomatillo sauce) and jalisco queso instead of the red salsa and cheddar cheese."

He even made more the next morning with the leftover ingredients and surprised me with breakfast in bed! I added diced tomato, lime juice and cilantro to the refried beans and heated it on the stove. Also, you can just use cooking spray to \"fry\" the tortillas, and it's just as good, but less fattening. Very delicious. EDIT: These have become a regular at our house, and my husband goes out of his way to make them!"
