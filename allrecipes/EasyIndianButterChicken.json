Couldn't find tandoori masala at the market so used another recipe on here to make my own version. I didn't have enough heavy cream so used about a cup of milk as a sub, otherwise followed the recipe. Turned out amazing."

Just switch out the chicken with hunks of extra-firm tofu and use coconut milk or cashew cream instead of the cream. I just use a small spray of avocado oil instead of all the vegan butter. Still an amazing recipe!"

I had to constantly stir the sauce to get all the butter and grease to mix with the cream. The taste was okay but I felt gross eating this. 1 cup of butter and 3 cups of cream is nasty. I made this again with a suggestion that said 1/4 cup butter instead of 1 cup and 1 can of evaporated milk instead of 3 cups cream. It made the sauce thicker and made it smell more like a real curry sauce. No grease! The new version is my absolute favourite and I make it every month 5/5 stars and it's healthier. I also don't add any salt. You don't need it."

Minimal recipe changes:\n-10% cream instead of heavy cream\n-pan cooked chicken with no seasoning (didn’t have tandoori)\n-used no salt added stewed tomatoes instead of sauce and puréed most of them\n-onions and garlic took longer to brown than 15 mins on medium heat\n-used one pan for onions/garlic, one pan for chicken, large pot for sauce, another pot to make plain rice side dish\nBeyond delicious, first time making, picky son loved it (as did I), and now will find it hard to buy/eat frozen version - have been spoiled with this recipe! Had it again for lunch today. Not an everyday food though - the calorie and fat content is off the charts, but of course that’s why it tastes so incredible! Will make again, will recommend. Also, I never write reviews and created an account just to say thanks to mn!"

I took the easy option and used frozen onions and frozen peppers and, in addition, I used Aldi's Tikka chicken thighs - with the skin removed and cooked in the oven with the sauce on top. Made it for a buffet for 10 people and made enough for 15, hoping there would be leftovers but folk were actually asking if there was any more!!\nResounding success.\nThank you"

It has more of a spicy kick than the others I've tried - which is a bonus for me.\n\nTwo things I'd change, though, for the next time around: More chicken, less heavy cream. I'm going to add at least another half-pound of chicken and try cutting the cream down to 2 cups rather than three. I don't really mind having a lot of sauce, but three cups seemed a little much.\n\nNote: I couldn't find the tandoori masala at my local grocery stores. The bonus there was that I found I have an Indian grocery in the area. Problem solved and new things to explore!"

You should know that I have never had butter chicken so I have no preconceived expectations. But I’m here to tell you that if you up for being brave, I’m really enjoying this. I don’t care that it’s not “authentic,” like you have had at your favorite restaurant. I do keep garam masala, and I did use that and followed the recipe in a general sense. I made this in one cast iron pot. I used one stick of butter, onions and garlic. I used one can of coconut milk, a can of crushed tomatoes and hold on to your hats... a block of cream cheese! I thought it needed a little more zip so I added another pinch of salt, an extra dribble of crushed red pepper and sprinkled some curry on at the last minute. I mean...don’t knock it until you try it. I had multiple blocks of cream cheese I needed to use up and one just materialized in my hand as I was considering options. I’m glad I did. Next time maybe I’ll try it the way it’s intended but I’m telling’ ya what...mmmmm!"

I only used half of the cream and I cooked this in one large pot, so I didn’t use the oil on the chicken. I let the chicken cook in the butter and red sauce and didn’t add the cream until the chicken was cooked through. Then I just let the cream warm up, stirring through the chicken and sauce. Glad we like it because now I have the spices!"

( If you cant find the masalas, as other reviewers mention, there are other recipes on this site for them). Anyhow, this smelled amazing, tasted even better. It may just be one of the tastiest things I have ever made. I was a bit overwhelmed by the amount of cream so I used 1/2 of the butter and 2/3 of the cream in the recipe, and still had plenty of sauce and taste. Next time I may try the evaporated or coconut mile, and I may cut the pepper a bit, as this was a bit too spicy for my picky eater kid."

I used skin-on bone-in chicken quarters (leg with thigh attached) and dry rubbed the tandoori then set it sit for 30 mins, then added more tandoori rub and then baked at 425° for 20 mins skin-side down. Turned chicken over and turned oven down to 375° and baked for another 20 mins. Removed from oven and added to the sauce (along with any crispy pan bits) then followed the recipe from that point forward. Served with rice cooker saffron rice and mustard seed roasted green beans (using some of the rendered chicken fat from the roasting pan)."

I saw the reduced calorie version and did a variation on this, and only used about 1/4 c. butter total, and used a can of evaporated milk. Unlike some reviewers I sautéed the chicken and tandoori in a skillet prior to adding to the sauce. I only used about 1/4 t. of the cayenne pepper because my daughter isn't big on a lot of spiciness, but used the regular amounts of garam masala and tandoori. I didn't add salt because I thought with the canned tomato sauce and other spices there was enough. Next time I think I will add some veggies. I saw one review that used coconut milk, which I also thought sounded great."

Tip: crank up the heat a bit by adding an extra helping of cayenne pepper, and some chili flakes, also using skinless boneless chicken thighs changes it up and makes it very tender."
