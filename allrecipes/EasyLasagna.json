I did add Italian sausage (johnsonville) and doubled the meat *(the man loves his meat). I added more cheese and another egg and it was quick and easy. I used oven ready noodles so I did bake it a little longer (40). He loved it and said it was the best I've made. So thank you for the recioe!!!"

Also added minced garlic to the cheese mixture. I used more than 9 noodles (probably more like 12). Since I added extra stuff, I baked for about 45 min covered and 15 uncovered, and then let sit for another 10-15. Delicious! Might try shredded parm next time for even more of a melty cheese kick. I overflowed my casserole dish, but the lasagna came out great!"

"reviewBody": "The easiest and best tasting lasagna I've made, including authentic Italian recipes that take twice as long. I made a full recipe with the following tweaks - it will take at least *1 HOUR* to bake, so allow enough time. I used a 28oz container of Daisy cottage cheese and a cup of Fage plain Greek yogurt. I added a cup of chopped onions and ~ a teaspoon of cayenne pepper. I used all 15 of the thin, no bake noodles, 3 per layer in a 9 x 13, this turned out amazing. The addition of the cayenne really helped punch it up. If you use the no bake noodles, make sure to add the 1/2 cup of water around the edges before baking. This can also be scaled down for a 9X9 pan. The amount of cottage cheese is too much - I used 12 oz. for a 9X9. I still used 2 eggs, 8 oz (2 cups) of mozzarella and used lasagna sheets. The sheets are slightly thinner than regular lasagna noodles and fit perfectly in a 9X9. Allow a full hour for baking. Although it looked soupy when I took it out of the oven, after 10 minutes it was fine. I used regular (not no bake)lasagna noodles and Ragu."

My only suggestion is broil it for a few min at the end to make the cheese bubbly and brown bits. It’s so gooey! And if you like a lil spice, you can do 1/2 beef and 1/2 sausage. Oh and if you’re in a rush, pre cook your lasagne noodles. I just made it tonight with the precooked noodles and it cooked in 30 min instead of 45."

After reading some other reviews for ideas, I decided to use half ground turkey and half hot Italian turkey sausage. I used half cottage cheese and half ricotta cheese, but definitely the while amount the recipe calls for. For the shredded cheese I used an Italian cheese blend in place of the mozzarella (much tastier). I added Italian seasoning and omitted the salt (doesn't need it with all that cheese). It was absolutely delicious!"

Normally I use regular lasagna noodles but I do cook them a bit so that they are easier to work with still and they soak up some of the liquids to finish cooking in the oven and I've never had any spill over doing it that way. I do that cuz I have never done a recipe w/ uncooked noodles that every worked out. I also add a bit of Italian sausage w/ the beef....and I add some extra spices to the jarred sauce...but overall I follow the recipe. I do use cottage cheese even cuz I usually have that on hand. Great recipe...but if ya know your cooking history tweek it how ya need to to make it work for ya."

"reviewBody": "The written recipe and the video differ in the amount of times you repeat the layers. The written recipe says to repeat once and the video says twice. I think the video is correct because that way you use up all the ricotta cheese filling. For those who say it is soupy, I think you missed a layer which means fewer noodles to absorb the liquid. I hope this helps. Other than that, this is a great way to quickly make lasagna. I prefer the old fashion way and making sauce, but this is good when you are short on time."

I also used about 1/4 cup of water instead of the suggested amount, which was still a bit much. Despite these changes to the recipe the result was still great! Would definitely make this again.

I was worried it would be too \"saucy\" something my nephew objects to, but once it baked and sat for the 10-15 minutes after, it all came together satisfyingly. I did use ground turkey instead of beef because we don't eat beef, but it didn't make a bit of difference to taste."

I usually end up needing more sauce so I use about a jar and a half instead of just a jar and with the amount of cottage cheese I usually end up with an extra layer of noodles on top.\n\nI have a vegetarian friend so I even have made it with veggie ground round instead of ground beef and it tastes just the same. It was a hit.\n\nLike I said, a great base and easy to adjust to the taste of whoever happens to be eating it. I've added spinach or mushrooms or onions or whatever I have on hand."

My only suggestion...mpo, I like my top cheeses a little browner...mostly for aesthetic purposes. After 10 minutes at end, before setting, I would put under broiler for 2-3 minutes...or until it’s the eye pleasing color of your choice. Best lasagna ever!"

I like to use ground turkey instead of beef, and add some finely diced onions and salt &amp; pepper while it is browning. I use whole grain lasagna noodles. I agree with another reviewer that the cheese mixture is a bit much as the recipe is currently written - I like to use 15 - 20 oz of cottage cheese instead of 32. Everything else I do the same. It comes out great and I even get compliments from my picky eater stepsons"

I add in veggies with the ground beef, diced onions and today chopped mushrooms (to get more veggies into my kids). Sometimes I layer with spinach (1) because I am slightly anemic so it's a good source of iron and (2) the layer is so thin my kids don't/can't really complain about it. I also use all ricotta instead of cottage cheese. This recipe has yet to let me down!"

It means one less pot to clean, since I don’t have to boil noodles. I added about 5-6 packets of Splenda to my sauce to cut the tangy flavor. I also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. If you’re looking for a basic, no frills lasagna recipe that will please most people, this is it."

I didn't add salt because I find cottage cheese and Parmesan Cheese make it salty enough and I run cottage cheese in a food processor briefly just to get more of a traditional ricotta-ish texture. So far the best recipe I found for lasagna without precooked noodles is a spinach lasagna so my family was so happy to finally get a \"meat\" lasagna with no green stuff lol! This was delicious. I did add a little garlic and onion to the meat while browning but I always do that and I'm sure this would have been just great without it."

"reviewBody": "Loved it! I haven't made lasagna in years. When I did make it, I never boiled the noodles. Fast forward to this Christmas eve and a request from my youngest who was flying in from AZ. My favorite brand of gf pasta is Tinkyada but I saw a rice/corn blend from Barilla, which I picked up instead. I used 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 cottage plus two jars of sauce. I look at recipes for suggestions and break off with what I have on hand and what I know from past experience. I season the meat and add the water into the sauce. I found a shaved blend of asiago, parmesan, and Romano with which I am a little heavy handed. I ended up having more cheese blend so I made a second, smaller dish. Everyone loved it. Today is the 3rd time I've made it and I'm using beyond meat and since I'm low on noodles, I have a two layers of baby spinach. Hoping it is just as good!"

Honestly, I think it helped with the moisture issue too. I always doctor my sauce, since we like garlic a lot, and today I plan to use Italian sausage instead of ground beef. This recipe is my go-to for the technique, but I never make it the same twice."
