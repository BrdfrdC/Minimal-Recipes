"reviewBody": "This is an excellent recipe that I will use over and over again, without a doubt. Cooking for me is an art, not a science, so yes, I am one of those who changes recipes. This time it was necessary. I live in Guatemala and many things that are available in other countries just are unheard of here. I used a French Vanilla cake mix, but it is much smaller so had to use all of it to cover my pan. I added lime zest to the crust and the juice of a lime as well. For the topping, I took advice of others and almost doubled the ingredients, using the first lemon from my tree. Limes are abundant here, but not lemons. I wish I had added more juice and more zest, because the flavor when cooked was really mild. Delicious, but very mild. I like it tarter. I covered the top with coconut and that worked really well. \n\nI really liked the chewy crispness of the crust, and the cheesecake on top is excellent. Thanks for a terrific recipe that I will be tinkering with for a long time."

I baked for 15 min to set the crust, but it took about 30 min to set the filling and brown the topping. I live at high altitude, everything takes longer. Plus I did double the filling. So good!

"reviewBody": "I just think the recipe directions need some reworking. I felt like after I removed 1 cup of the dough I really didn't have enough left to adequately cover the bottom of a 9x13 pan. So I added about 1/4 cup back in. After the first bake, I'm thinking that maybe it just is meant to be spread more thinly than I thought as it does puff up nicely. It would have been more difficult to cover completely, but maybe the directions should mention that it will be quite a thin base. After the first bake it does say to cool while making the cream cheese mixture. Perhaps it should say to cool for at least 30 minutes as my mixture got quite melty and difficult to spread on the, still warm, base. That said, it was very easy to make and they taste great. And this recipe would lend itself to many different flavors: chocolate cake with peppermint flavoring or vanilla cake with almond flavoring all would be delicious as well."

I increased the lemon juice to 3-4 tablespoons (I used fresh squeezed). I added the freshly-grated zest from one lemon into the cream cheese mixture. I used melted butter instead of the oil. I mixed in sliced almonds with the topping. I baked it for about 7 minutes longer than the recipe stated because of the increased filling which included 2 minutes on a 380 degree broil because it wasn't browning very well."

I brought these to parent teacher conferences and several teachers told me how much they loved them! A couple even asked for the recipe. Note that I did also double the cream cheese filling part as some others had suggested. Because of this, they baked for probably 15 extra minutes. I just kept checking them every 5 minutes or so until I felt like it was generally firm and the top was browned. I also placed some powdered sugar in a fine strainer so I could sprinkle some on top- it made them looked more finished."

My husband HATES lemons and lemon-flavored anything, but said these were good and that even with the increased lemon juice, were not overpowering. All the reviews saying the filling should be doubled, I don't agree - I thought the amount of filling was perfect for a lemon bar, which I think of being more of a cookie rather than cakelike. To each his own! I will definitely make again! (Also, I used a plastic tumbler to roll over the crust in the pan, rather than pressing it with my fingers...much faster and less mess!)"

So I ended up using Duncan Hines lemon supreme cake mix. I added to it a small box of Jello instant lemon pudding mix. No milk, just the dry powder. I doubled the filling layer. To the filling I added the juice of a small lemon (no measuring) I baked the crust 15 min just like the recipe says. To get the topping to cover I used my hand to finely and evenly sprinkle it over the filling mixture. I had to bake it 20 mintes for the filling to set. I refrigerated them before cutting and serving them. They turned out perfect!"

Adds a great burst of lemon to this bar and makes this easy dessert even easier since I use jarred lemon curd! Second, please don't let this try and brown on top, even slightly. You will have dry bars. Just bake until the top is set, and you are good to go! Moist, delicious and super lemony!"

I did complain to Betty Crocker. I added a little flour but the topping was still not crumbly and didn't really brown. Don't know how they will taste, but I don't think that there is quite enough filling. I am trying them for a party but may end up eating them myself if they don't turn out right. May have to go back to my mother's recipe which always turns out but is a bit harder."

"reviewBody": "This was actually so disappointing. I'm always skeptical about using boxed cake mixes and this recipe just confirms that scepticism. It tasted so fake and processed, and you could barely even taste the lemon despite me increasing the amount of lemon in there. Would not recommend this to anyone."

I used 2 lemon cake mixes with pudding in the mix (Betty Crocker), ADDED 1 small box of instant lemon pudding, 2 eggs &amp; 1 C. oil and 1 Tbl Lemon Extract (1/2 mixture into 9 x 13, 1/2 mixture for top). Then for the FILLING, I used 3 pkgs, 2/3 C. sugar, 1/4 C. lemon juice, yellow coloring AND 3 EGGS (so it would firm while cooking). Baked about 30 mins until topping browned and middle firmed... EXCELLENT."

The only note I would make is that 15 min in the oven might be a little too much (at least for my oven) on the second part of the baking process. Bottom got a little burnt, so watch that time. Otherwise, Awesome! I'll be making more this weekend."

Notes for next time: Used 12 oz cream cheese and a bit less than 1/2 cup sugar. Used the zest from one lemon and 1/4 c. lemon juice (from 1 1/2 lemons), put 1/3 of the zest and a Tablespoon of juice in with the cake mix and the rest of the zest and juice in the cream cheese filling. Cooked as directed but with the extra liquid it needed about 25 minutes for the second stay in the oven instead of 15. Dusted with powdered sugar once it was cool. Soooooo yummy!!"

I was desperate for a non-dairy lemon bar recipe and all I had handy was HALF a box of lemon cake mix, some lemons and some Tofutti cream cheese (half a tub). I prepared the recipe exactly as directed, using HALF an egg (broken in a cup and stirred well) in the cake mix and HALF in the \"cream cheese\" mixture. Well, I wasn't expecting much, but it was actually very tasty, with almost no taste of cake mix at all! Made in a smaller pan, obviously, and I would recommend making a full-sized batch ... if only because everybody's going to want seconds!"

I was a little concerned how thin it was, but it expanded while cooking and was great. I'm going to use this crust recipe for all sorts of bars now. A great shortbread crust is good, but with the cost of butter these days, this takes the cake! The filling was also good, although I prefer a traditional lemon bars topping over this cream cheese one."

I had no problems with assembly, and although the crust seemed thin when I was pressing it into the pan, it did puff up and was fine. I let these cook to room temperature and then refrigerated over night, which made them cut easily and cleanly."

I remember my mom copying it from Good Housekeeping magazine many years ago. :) I always thought the bars were delicious and easy to prepare but a little too thin. To remedy the problem, I started making a double batch and using a small browie pan for the \"second\" pan. Doing this gives you enough to make the whole bath a little thicker. I also agree with others that add some extra lemon juice or lemon zest...gives a more lemony flavor."

I added a pack of instant lemon pudding mix in with the crust as well. I did double the of filling so for a double batch I used 4 cream cheese. I used 2 fresh lemons for lemon juice and also put a little lemon zest in with the cream cheese filling and another pack of lemon instant pudding mix. I baked it with the filling and crust crumbled on top for about 25 minutes. Do let it completely cool before cutting to cut smoothly. They stay very moist. I rate this 5 stars and will bake again!"
