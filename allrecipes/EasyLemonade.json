I used 3/4 cup bottled lemon juice and 1/2 cup measure for measure artificial sweetener. I just pored everything into a jug and mixed it. No heating. Thank you for giving me the ratios for a refreshing, cool, crisp lemonade."

I just dissolved the sugar in one cup of hot tap water, added the lemon juice and a little less than three cups more water. Put on the lid to the jug I was making it in, shook and pored over crushed ice. Yummy! Sweet and tangy enough for my taste."
