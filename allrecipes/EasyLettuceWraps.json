To increase veggie content, I added shredded carrots halfway through cooking the meat and then chopped water chestnuts and green onions at the end. Have substituted rice wine vinegar for the sherry when I was out and tasted great. I double the sauce mixture for our family too. Have eaten as lettuce wraps and as a bowl with shredded lettuce as the base."

I used ground turkey and just needed to add a bit of salt at the table and it was perfect for me; hubby thought there was too much cilantro since the turkey had a milder flavor than pork. But since that gets added last anyway, next time I'll just have the chopped cilantro in a bowl on the table for individual assembly. Cheap, easy, lightning - quick to make, nutritious, wonderfully tasty, AND low-fat! What else could I possibly wish for?"

My husband really liked it and I served it with some fried rice and roasted garlic broccoli. My 2 children also ate it well. The children and my husband said it was good just over rice."

I omitted the corn starch because I didn't have any but I don't even think you need it. I also substituted brandy for the dry sherry since I was out. Next time, I will up the cilantro amount because I love cilantro or will try the whole cilantro in the wrap thing. This is really good and I found myself picking at the pan and eating it without the lettuce. I think it would also be good served over rice or asian noodle dish. Great stuff. Try it and you will be amazed."

"reviewBody": "I've been dying to try this - the ingredients were always on hand but didn't know what I would serve with it other than ordering some takeout like Wanton Soup and egg rolls to go with it. But tonite was perfect - both of us had a big lunch and just needed a light meal. We loved it!! Didn't change a thing. I put out jars of Hoison Sauce, chinese garlic chili sauce and dim sum sauce. We made the wraps using about a teaspoon of the different sauces on them. OUr favorite was the one with Hoison Sauce. It was so quick to make and I look forward to making it during the summer when it is so hot that you have to eat and want something light. Maybe a tomato salad with it (from the wonderful garden grown tomatoes)?"

It is great with fresh whole cilantro leaves in each wrap. I also served it with a hot chili sauce (one available in the aisan foods section with a green top and a rooster on the front). These would also be great with a hoisin peanut sauce."
