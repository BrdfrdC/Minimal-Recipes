Flip it onto the platter and remove plastic. I then spread cream cheese over the ball and sprinkle parsley over the whole thing. Serve with crackers, cocktail bread or even fresh veggies (carrots, celery, etc). Thanks for the recipe. This is the closest recipe I've found to my original from years ago."

It’s so easy to put together, I to added a whole block of cream cheese but don’t feel in lessoned the wonderful flavor of this pate. This one is definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing it with us."

The only thing I do differently is that I line a round bowl with plastic wrap, let it set for 2 hours, flip it onto the platter, so that it's nice and round. I then cover the pate with cream cheese and then fresh parsley - this makes the presentation."

The people who like pate loved this but some people didn't try it, probably because of the presentation. Still, the flavor was really really good and I will serve again, just in a different way."

I was a littl worried when I first but when I pulled it out of the pan, positioned it on a platter with some crackers, it looked fantastic! I always thought pate was really difficult to make... until I came across this recipe!!! Thanks for making me look good!"
