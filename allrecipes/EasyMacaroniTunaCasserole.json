If I have celery and onions I will sauté them in a little butter and throw that in. If I don't have bread crumbs I have been known to crush up some croutons or use French fried onions. I always have cheese on hand but who knows what flavor it is but I do try to stick w/ cheddar or colby jack. Like I said...versatile. ;)"

In the macaroni, I added about 1 tsp onion powder &amp; paprika, and 1/2 tsp black pepper, garlic powder and oregano. Also added green onions and doubled up on the tuna. For the topping, I doubled up on the bread crumbs and added 1/2 tsp of onion powder, paprika and black pepper. Also used cream of chicken because I don’t like cream of mushroom (just don’t tell my partner that, lol). Definitely a keeper! Maybe sometime I’ll try it with the dill."

"reviewBody": "The concept gets 5 stars, but I did drop a star based on the fact that I made some changes. First of all, let's address the greasy breadcrumbs. I typically use a 4 to 1 ratio of Panko breadcrumbs to butter- so here I used a generous 1/4 c panko and 1 T butter- perfect. I also mixed half of the cheese into the casserole and just put the other half on top before the breadcrumbs. These two topping adjustments made one of the best casserole toppings I've ever had- and I'm a casserole fanatic. I also added about 2/3 c peas, and seasoned the soup with 1/8 t onion powder, 1/8 t black pepper, and 1/2 t salt (you probably don't need that much salt, but I buy a generic brand of soup that is never as salty as it should be.) I also didn't have dill weed or parsley, so I didn't use them. Anyway, I think I just made this a little over a week ago, and I'm about to make it again tonight. I thought that warranted a positive review. This is so different than the purist 100% from scratch tuna casserole I grew up with, and I think it's delicious. Thanks for the recipe!"

I also added frozen peas (rinsed under hot water), chopped onion, as well as 2 cans of drained tuna.

The whole thing tasted pretty good, though."

"reviewBody": "Once I made changes according to other reviewers' recommendations this became a 5. These are the changes: used two cans of tuna instead of just one, and added half a bag of lightly cooked frozen peas and carrots. Used quarter cup milk at the start, but after stirring in the mushroom soup and tuna, only added 1/4 cup milk instead of the recipe's recommended half cup, plus a half-teaspoon of onion powder, quarter teaspoon of garlic powder, quarter teaspoon black pepper, tiny amount of cayenne, and a squirt of Dijon mustard. Used a bit over a full cup of grated cheddar cheese on top after pouring into 2.5 quart baking dish. Over the cheese spread half a cup of Panko bread crumbs which had been mixed with 1/2 teaspoon of dried dill; did not add the melted butter to this mix. Finally, added a good handful of French's onions before putting into the oven. I've not made too many casseroles in my life, but have had enough of them to think that this recipe, when incorporating the changes above, is definitely a \"5\" or a \"keeper\". Will definitely be making this recipe again."

I also added 3/4 cup of frozen peas and a hand full of chopped fresh parsley. I mixed the cheese into the mixture. I did not add breadcrumbs or butter or dill. Baked in the oven per the recipe. So good."

I stumbled onto it because I was craving mushrooms and tuna, and the flavors of both mixed really well. I confused this recipe with another and bought Portobello mushrooms so I added a layer on top, a layer of cheese, and then the bread crumbs. I didn't use the parsley and dill."

I made it with cheddar broccoli soup in place of cream of mushroom, and added zesty garlic seasoning, and a little extra cheese on the top, as well as an extra can of tuna (since they've decreased most of the can sizes to 5oz). My son doesn't eat Tuna, and loved it. Good way to get a little broccoli and tuna in there. I did not use the dill or parsley since my breadcrumbs were Italian already."

I have to say that I won't make it again since its just as quick for me as making it from scratch. I followed the directions, except i did not use dill, and I added an extra can of tuna. Its a OK recipe. I was intrigued by the use of the mac n cheese in a box and had to try it, but I wish I hadn't."

Now, I'm always sure to have a box of macaroni and cheese and a can of mushroom soup in the cupboard for this easy, yet wonderfully tasty casserole. I've made tuna casserole from scratch and it wasn't this good. I followed the recipe exactly, and greased the casserole dish with butter. The two of us did have seconds but there were enough leftovers for a 2nd meal."

"reviewBody": "My family mostly liked this. My husband and I really liked the flavor (see my additions below). The kids (11 and 9), who don't like tuna casserole in general, didn't complain. Reviews were mixed when I asked what they thought. One said it was good. The other said she didn't really like it. But, like I said, they don't usually like tuna casserole, so this is a pretty decent review from them.\n\nI altered the recipe by mixing the dill into the noodle mixture instead of into the topping. I also mixed in 1/2tsp onion powder, 1/4tsp garlic salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/16tsp cayenne pepper. I thought the taste was really yummy.\n\nThe breadcrumb topping didn't turn out as I would have liked. It was not crusty at the end of cooking. It was just oily. I sprinkled on more breadcrumbs and put it under the broiler for a few minutes. In the future I would probably use about 1/2 the butter in the topping. \n\nThe cheddar cheese undoubtedly played a part in the oiliness, too. After eating it, I wonder how essential the cheese was. I think you might be able to reduce or remove the cheese with little impact to the taste. Alternatively, it might be good to mix the cheese in with the general mixture. \n\nIn spite of the negative things I've noted, I would make it again. I'd likely tweak it as suggested, though."

A lot of cheese on the top. Could double or triple the breading on the top - had to spread it with a spoon, still didn't cover the entire top. This fed 5 adult eaters easily (none left for dad who was working) - so if you need more, perhaps double. Baked uncovered in 3 qt dish for 25 minutes. Perfect!"

I thought my nephew would like it but figured my husband and I would end up eating something else after. I was very surprised by this recipe. It isn't anything fancy but it was very easy, inexpensive, and tasted just like old school tuna casserole. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I did add an extra can of tuna because I thought it needed it. Other then that I followed the recipe as written."
