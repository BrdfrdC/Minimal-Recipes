I froze it in mini-cupcake trays, one metal and one silicone, covered with aluminum foil. The silicone ones turned out more even and also were much easier to pop out of the form."

Poured it into a dish and froze it and my friend and sat and devoured the entire thing with two spoons. I also used sweetened condensed milk, i assumed the recipe called for that. Added a bit extra cinnamon just cause I like lots of it, but this turns out like a smooth artesian ice cream!!!"
