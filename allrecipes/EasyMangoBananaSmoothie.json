The frozen banana helps the smoothie to be at a cooler temp., which is critical for me when it comes to smoothies. I did think the banana flavor overwhelms the mango, but it was such a tasty combo that it didn't matter. Everybody loved it. :)"

I toned down the bananas (just enough so that I got the creamy consistency but not the overpowering taste) and added mango nectar. OJ would also work wonders. The drink is absolutely divine!"

The dairy products also made it more creamy. I used organic vanilla bean yogurt and reduced fat milk. I like my smoothies extra cold, so I made 2 servings and added 2 ice cubes along with the banana being frozen. ty"

My mango was cold, and the banana ripe and frozen. I thought the mango flavor could have been a little more bold, but Hubs liked its subtleness. An overused word to describe this maybe, but we both found it refreshing."
