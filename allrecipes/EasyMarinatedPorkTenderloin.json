"reviewBody": "I LOVED this recipe. This may be the best pork roast I've EVER made and I used this marinade recipe. It was SO juicy, not dry or boring at all as some pork tenderloin roasts can be. Save the drippings and make gravy for the tastiest leftover hot pork sandwiches. I did not have any honey dijon mustard so I used regular dijon with a couple of tablespoons of local honey that I buy at farmer's market. I think I'll continue to make it that way because it worked so well. My husband loves to make cold pork sandwiches with this roast as well. But wait!!! There's more: I love to make hot and sour soup and I use some of the leftover drippings IN the soup and a couple of handfuls of the pork, cut into strips, in the soup as well. You may wonder why there are so many leftovers; well, there are only two of us and I buy the two-pack pork tenderloin roasts...so there is a lot of pork to make lots of good stuff with after the initial meal. Be careful not to overcook; the timing suggested in the recipe was perfect...let the roast rest and it will continue to cook a bit but not be dry. I used a thermometer to be sure of how \"done\" it was, as suggested. Enjoy!! BTW, I buy local Monterey Peninsula/Salinas honey. Great honey is made here. There is a book, \"The Honey Bus,\" in case you're interested in a really good read and true story. Nope, I didn't write it, I don't even know the writer, but for people who love honey and who love to cook with honey, I highly suggest it for a good read."

It had a lot of flavor so I don't think the full hour marinating time is necessary. I will say that I used low sodium soy sauce and added no salt and it was still VERY salty. And I am a salt lover. Just leave out the salt and use low sodium soy sauce, for sure."

I didn‚Äôt find it too salty, but there was way too much mustard. The mustard (honey Dijon) felt like it was burning my insides hours later. I actually soaked the leftover pork in several changes of water to get rid of the mustard. I would cut the mustard from 3 tbsp to 1 tsp."

The tenderloin was cut into 4 pieces before marinating for 20 minutes, then an oven for 40 minutes at 350*F. I forgot the salt and pepper so we added that at the table but this is a keeper for sure for us."

Just a hint of pink and so tender! Don't overcook!!! We used the marinade as a gravy for the potatoes and pork. Note: I had to add 1/4 cup of water to the marinade around the pork as it was thinning too quickly and would have burned."

"reviewBody": "As others advised I decreased the soy by 1 T and did not add salt nor did I add the full marinade during cook time (there was plenty of liquid for cooking without it). The tenderloin itself was very tender and I consider it perfectly cooked. However, the marinade itself didn't taste good to me, it just wasn't what I was looking for but only by trying it could I say that. I will gladly use the cooking method ie., marinade (overnight) baked it at 400 for 1st 20 min then finish 15-20 min on 350. It couldn't have been easier to prepare and I'm happy I found the recipe just won't be making this sauce ."
