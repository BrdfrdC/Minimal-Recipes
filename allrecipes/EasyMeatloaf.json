"reviewBody": "Well, I dunno. I've never made meatloaf and neither did my mom so I am unfamiliar with how it is supposed to turn out. But there was about 1/2 to 3/4 cup liquid and grease in the pan when it was done. Mainly liquid, not as much grease as I had expected. The liquid seems excessive, but maybe that's normal? Like I said, I am ignorance itself when it comes to meatloaf, but 1 cup milk seemed like a lot? I did my best to drain the liquid, with little success. We'll see how the leftovers turn out. BTW, \"salt and pepper to taste\" drives me crazy. If I knew how much to put in, would I need a recipe? So I just guessed. 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp pepper. It could probably use a bit more salt, but the pepper was fine. I would have given 5 stars, but for the excessive liquid."
