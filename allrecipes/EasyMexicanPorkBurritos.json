"reviewBody": "This was a great start.... but I made significant modifications which made it fantastic! \nI didn't use a whole pork butt roast but rather a little over 3 lb. pork here in Kansas City, MO called \"country-style ribs\" made from thick-sliced (about 1\") butt roast, the SAME cut, but cooks faster and can be cut into chunks later rather than shredding with a fork as with the whole roast..\nI seared the meat first, which gave a nice subtle brown to the meat and I was able to drain off fat as I cooked the pieces in batches. I HIGHLY recommend this step as it significantly reduces unnecessary fat! Additionally, using the thick cut pieces significantly reduced the time when boiling the meat versus the time it takes to boil a whole butt cut.\nI added a couple tablespoons frozen orange juice concentrate to the cooking water, I also added chicken Better-Than-Bullion, along with a little extra chili powder, cumin and a very generous amount of chopped fresh cilantro. This addition was huge.\nAgain, cooking time will be reduced since the pieces are smaller. than the whole roast.\nWhen the meat is done, remove, place off to the side and cut into chunks, not shred. The first time I made this, I made the pieces smaller than I should have and had meat in cooking pot when the later steps were done. This was a mistake as the meat cooked up into the rest of the ingredients. So leave meat separate and add meat to the pot at the end of the final step.\nWhen cooking beans, tomatoes and chili's at"

The only changes I made were to accommodate the ingredients I had on hand and time. I cooked the roast from frozen in an instant pot on manual pressure for 1 1/2 hours. I didn’t have refried beans so I used rinsed and drained black beans instead. Excellent flavor that the whole family loved!"

Glad I tried this recipe - way easy, way tasty and my leftover pork roast is history! The only change I made (because I was using leftover pork roast, already cooked without the taco seasoning) was increasing the 1 packet of taco seasoning to 1.5 packets directly into the pork filling. Great with a green salad and sliced tomatoes!"

I will probably make these again because they are easy to make. I served these with guacamole and a southwestern chopped salad."

I roasted a 13 pound bone-in pork shoulder roast scored and rubbed down with salt, chopped garlic, about 2 tablespoons of liquid hickory smoke, taco seasoning and one 14.5 oz can of chicken broth and onions in the oven at 325, covered with foil, for 4 hours. When cooled enough to shred, I weighed out 3 pounds for this recipe and made shredded pork barbecue with the remaining (largest) part for a church supper. I served this recipe with soft flour tortillas (not fried, though I'm sure that would be excellent), fresh diced tomato, onion and finely shredded sharp cheddar. I will absolutely be making this again. Will roast in oven again, because it doesn't require checking on. Thanks, Carolyn Craft Kirkman!"

And then, just when I thought I'd exhausted the possibilities, came up with the notion to use chopped nuts and syrup, apple pie filling, cream cheese with strawberries, the list I think can go on and on.
