I also added a small can of diced tomatoes and green chiles, and once the food was served I squeezed a bit of lime over my serving. Overall, this is a delicious great meal that you can add different things to (corn, black beans, onion, cilantro, and on!) according to what you want/have. I will definitely be making this again!!!!"

Still it was a good dish and very filling. It was easier too using the chips instead of frying the strips. This was a great brunch, thanks for sharing the recipe."

I recommend smashing the chips down a little bit. Everything seems to get a little more coverage that way. I also threw in some left-over chicken between the layers. This would work well with any kind of cheese."
