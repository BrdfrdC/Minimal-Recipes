I recently purchased monk fruit sweetener and wanted to see how it worked with a cake. I did not want to bake a full size cake. So I chose this. The only change I made was the monk fruit sugar for regular sugar. I used dutch processed cacao, which is all I had. It was chocolatey, not too sweet, and delicious. I really could not any difference in the sweetness from regular sugar. Also, as a bonus, it was a delicious treat for one person. I will most likely make again, but perhaps switch coffee for the water and part of the milk."

"reviewBody": "My mug cake was perfect. I had a craving for chocolate cake but no way to get some. It was perfect in a pinch. I used cake flour for this recipe because I didn't have any AP flour on me but still turned out great. Also make sure to use a Jumbo mug though cause it'll rise when cooking and then fall down a bit. I probably would've added a little bit more time for mine because it didn't fully cook at the bottom but that's probably just my microwave."

Made some adjustments over time, cut the cocoa powder down to 1 tablespoon because 2 was too bitter for me, use imitation vanilla because the real stuff is liquid gold, and I mix in a handful of semi sweet chocolate chips before cooking to keep it moist and chocolaty."

Imagine what it will taste like when I use the right amount of ingredients. I used almond milk and applesauce. I added chocolate chips. I live by myself so cannot make entire cakes as I will eat the entire cake. This is easy to make, uses only a few dishes and satisfies my sweet tooth. I will most definitely make again. I did use a soup mug instead of a regular mug."

"reviewBody": "We've tried these before and made the same mistake of using a regular-size mug and making a mess. This time I made it and it worked well with good texture and taste. Again I made it with a regular-size mug which was too small. I paused cooking for a few seconds at a time to prevent the cake from spilling over the edges. I set the microwave for 2 minutes but only used about 1:35 of the time. I altered the recipe by adding egg and using the applesauce option. Using the egg variation it didn't come out gooey. for the liquid portion I did the following: • Mixed 1 egg &amp; 2 Tablespoons milk in a ramekin Mixed the following and added to the dry ingredients. ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract 1 1/2 Tablespoons applesauce 3 Tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon egg/milk mix Microwaved on 80% power for about 1 min 35 sec. stopping intermittently for it to settle down to prevent overflow. The cake grew out of the cup about 1 1/2 inches but it didn't overflow. Of course, cook time and power depend on your microwave wattage. Mine is 1100 watts. So at 80%, it is roughly equivalent to 880 watts because it pauses to make 80% of the time, not 80% of the power level."

It was so good) pop your cake in the freezer to cool and your topping in the fridge for about 5 minutes and then add your PB topping and a little chocolate drizzle on top and the. serve or eat to yourself! DELICIOUS!"
