It made enough for my husband and I for dinner, with enough leftover to freeze for another meal. We both loved it, and I will definitely be making this a lot this winter!"

I did add some extra spices but that speaks more to the jar of marinara than the recipe! I did end up adding 2 extra cups of broth to make up for the broth absorbed by the pasta but that was the only significant change I made. The family loved it!"
