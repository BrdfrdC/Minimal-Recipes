Instead of warm water, I put hotter water, and added half a cup of sugar and half a teaspoon of extra matcha prior to microwaving. I think this adjustment helped but overall this doesn’t stretch as well as store bought mochi, and it’s texture is definitely not as smooth."

We switched out \"matcha\" for \"taro powder\" and \"red bean paste\" for \"fresh cut strawberries\" and they turned out absolutely to DIE for. Didn't even last an hour after being finished before they were all eaten! 100% making this again with different flavor combinations to experiment with, loved how easy this recipe was to follow, and though it was incredibly painful making these.\n(Warning: the gluten is INCREDIBLY HOT when you have to work with it; have plenty of corn starch on hand to ease the heat of direct contact with the stuff, as well as corn starch ON your hands to prevent it from sticking to your fingers instead of the other side of the ball..lesson learned the hard way!)\nIt's probably best to make these with someone, who can laugh with you as you both try to grab at the hot gluten and throw it back down on your work surface trying to cool it off, and poke fun at how foolish you look and how funky your mochi balls may be turning out. They may look funny in the end, but they'll taste AMAZING, worth all the pain, and you'll have something to joke about if you shared the pain with someone else. (It also just ended up really fun to make, honestly, an amazing de-stressing activity oddly enough.)"

I heated mine for the full 3 min and 30 sec, followed by the full 30 sec. with one batch of the exact recipe, the dough made about 12 ping pong sized balls. I didn't have bean paste so I used Nutella in some and peanut butter in others, I also did not use the matcha powder and added a slight amount of icing sugar to make it slightly sweeter after reading another review.. Very yummy! In previous experiences, black sesame goes beautifully with this dough! Would recommend to those who love yummy homemade goods but don't like to wait. :)"

It is similar to the so-called snow-skin moon cake."

Some reviewers are correct; I have made a mistake and the flour should be glutinous rice flour which can also be called Mochiko. \nAlso, the green tea powder is optional as is freezing the red bean paste. Freezing the red bean paste just makes the process less messy. \nFor the cooking time, one can lower it to 3 minutes and add 15 seconds at a time until the dough looks slightly translucent. However, be sure to keep the plastic wrap on for at least 3 minutes to keep the moisture in. \nI'm sorry for all the mistakes but I am looking into correcting the recipe soon. Thanks!"

"reviewBody": "Similar to a recipe on RecipeZaar - I didn't have the matcha (and the other recipe doesn't call for it), so I made it without. I've made it twice, experimenting with the microwave time - ours seems to heat things faster than others. You can also switch up the fillings. I've used super thick cheesecake pudding (1 1/2 c soy milk) as well as another batch with peanut butter. The red bean paste is our favorite, but we make due with what we have. Solution for getting the mochi into balls is to put the batch on plastic wrap dusted with potato or tapioca (cornstarch works, too) starch. Get some starch on one hand, put a cut piece into that hand, spoon in the filling, and pinch up the sides with the not-so-dusted hand. Keeps for a day or two in tightly sealed container lined with parchment paper. The pudding ones should be eaten almost right away. Thank you Katrina for sharing!"
