"reviewBody": "These are delightful. My whole family liked them. I used Rapid Rise yeast. Added it to the dry ingredients and added the milk to the water. I beat the egg separately, then added it to the water and poured all the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. I began with only 4 c. flour and added more as needed while I kneaded it for 10 full minutes. Note: Be sure that the breads are a full 6 inches from the broiler and watch them closely. It only took 1 minute for each side to bake in my oven!"

"reviewBody": "This is a fantastic recipe, but we did make a couple of changes. We added extra garlic and found after that it still needed more, so if you like garlic then go heavy handed. Instead of regular salt we used rosemary salt. Also as a tip when broiling, these need less time with each batch that goes in."
