I used grapeseed oil. I added 1/4 cup raisins rinsed in hot water. I also added each 1 teaspoon each of cinnamon and vanilla. I used oat milk. I baked for 20 minutes at 400F in parchment paper muffin cups. The muffins are quite delicate when warm and a bit dry. I'd add 1/3 cup of oil next time. I'll try making these again with the extra oil and a higher fat milk. I will also try making these into 9 jumbo muffins."

The second time I forgot to soak the oats and mixed them in with flour first- still turned out good, maybe a tad drier. I also used half buttermilk and some chocolate chips. I find that the amount of batter per cup is not much, so the muffins are a bit small. Next time, I’ll reduce the cooking temp. to 400F."

I also added about 1/3 tsp of vanilla extract and several shakes of cinnamon to the base batter. I added chopped apples, blueberries, raisins and craisins, each fruit was added separately to the already filled muffin batter as it was in the tin before baking. I finished them all off with more cinnamon and slivered almonds. I did 20 min at 425 and think I might do 23 minutes next time. Overall I am very happy and will continue to experiment with the recipe!"

I always replace a third of the flour with whole wheat flour. Blueberries or chocolate chips mix in well. I've also replaced some of the sugar with maple syrup and added 1 tsp of maple extract for fun. They really only need 1/2 the baking time recommended. I like to double the recipe and freeze a big batch to thaw for an easy breakfast or snack."

"reviewBody": "I've been wanting something sweet, but not like a cupcake or cookie. What better than a muffin recipe? I'm very picky when it comes to my muffins. I like a hardy and semi-healthy breakfast item that gives me energy to go in the morning. I already thoroughly enjoy oatmeal cookies, so I thought that this would be a good alternative. I looked at the comments and followed other people's changes in the recipes. Instead of oil i used applesauce, and instead of white sugar, I used brown sugar; 2/3 to be exact. I've got a but of a sweet tooth, and i saw that this recipe could be a little bland if you don't add any fruits or other flavorings. Along with those changes, I added a couple dashes of cinnamon, a generous pinch of nutmeg, and I wanted to add vanilla, but I forgot at the end. It's a small batch; I had just enough for 6 large muffins. It's such an easy recipe that I could whip it up again any time. I added raisins to 2 of them, finely chopped apples mixed with brown sugar to the next 2, and left the last 2 plain. I'd cook it for less than I did because they were a little tough, but that could also be because I over mixed it. Be very careful with that. After they were done, I dusted powdered sugar over them for a pretty finishing touch. The apple muffins were fantastic, and so were the raisin. The plain ones were no match to the others. The recipe is not bad if you touch it up yourself and add a little bit of your magic to it. Would recommend."

I use whole wheat flour and rolled oats but otherwise make the batter as written (except that I use 1/4 cup honey or maple syrup, so they are probably a tad sweeter). \n\nThe muffins themselves have a very mild flavor. I always end up adding something just for fun. I love cocoa powder and frozen mixed berries, or banana chunks and mini chocolate chips. For a great twist, try frozen cranberries and mandarin oranges (with orange juice instead of milk). I always add chopped nuts and sometimes cinnamon and/or an extract."

I made no change to the ingredients-- only thing I did differently was after taking them out of the muffin tins, I smeared on just a little butter, them put them super close to my countertop oven on the BROIL setting. Watch carefully, and just give these little beauties some crispy brown on the top. I have some homemade jam and these were perfect. Toasty, hint of crispness from the browning, and allowed my jam to shine. (Whoa! I forgot! -- I used melted butter and not vegetable/canola oil -- that stuff is just horrid -- use butter or maybe light olive oil, or melted coconut oil)"

I really enjoyed this recipe \"as is.\" I didn't add anything to, or take anything from, the original recipe. I read others' reviews mentioning that they weren't as sweet as expected, but I don't like muffins that taste incredibly sweet or almost like a cupcake. If I make these again, I would probably add some boiled raisins, cinnamon, and a bit of vanilla extract. This recipe was super simple, and the resulting muffins were gone quickly."

"reviewBody": "We LOVE these muffins. Rather than buy junk food snacks at the store, I've started making these to have for afternoon snacks. They're cheaper and healthier than any of those other pre-made snacks at the store (fruit snacks, fruit &amp; grain bars, etc) I love how versatile this recipe is. If the plain muffins are a little too bland for you, you could try adding a tiny bit of butter and little sprinkles of sugar in the raw (or just white sugar) to the tops of them, and it will totally change the flavor.\n\nI've made these muffins three different times:\n\n1) First time it was made exactly like the recipe for the first batch (ie. plain). The second batch I replaced white sugar for brown, added some cinnamon, and added a powder sugar, water, and vanilla gaze to the top (after they baked). Both batches were moist.\n\n2) The second time I made a batch of plain and a batch of blueberry. I added vanilla, and to the the blueberry muffins, before putting them into the oven, I sprayed a little spray butter and sprinkled a little sugar in the raw on the top of them. For some reason they were a little dry though.\n\n3) The third time (just now) I made blueberry again, the same way as I did the second time. However, since they were so dry the second time I decided to add just a little more milk to the oatmeal (maybe 1 tablespoon). That may have been just a wee bit too much milk, but they sure are moist and DELICIOUS."

Also, I ended up adding vanilla extract to give them a bit more flavor. Almond extract works well. Or adding in a teaspoon of cinnamon is also another way to add some flavor. If you want a less coarse muffin texture, heating up the milk before adding it to the oats helps. The oats seem to soak up the milk better. Then let it sit for the 15 minutes as directed."

I followed the recipe as written (processing old fashioned oats to make quick oats); the muffins turned out light and lovely. Although this is a basic muffin, the oats give it a rich flavor, and there is a bit of sweetness to it. It tastes good as is, but lends itself to additions other reviewers have mentioned adding. I made these to trial wheat as a new food for our toddler, and he will certainly prefer these to the dry, oat-only muffins he's had until now :) I will definitely be making these again for my family."
