"reviewBody": "I followed the recipe exactly and these were rich, smooth, and delicious. At the end I felt that working with almond bark was easier then semi-sweet. Here's a tip that makes dipping them in chocolate super easy: After rolling your truffles into balls, place a tooth pick in each one, then freeze for about 2 hours. Before taking them out of the freezer, prepare your melted chocolate. Then remove the truffles from the freezer and dip each one into the chocolate completely - all the way to the toothpick. I placed each dipped truffle back on the waxed paper-lined cookie sheet. You can remove the toothpick by twisting it and out it should come and some of the chocolate should then run into the toothpick hole. For some I waited to remove the picks until I was done dipping, and I used my finger tip to dip into the melted chocolate and fill each toothpick hole so that I would have some wet chocolate to sprinkle the remaining Oreo cookie crumbs. You could also cover a toothpick hole by piping stripes with opposite color chocolate. SO EASY and fun. I may make another batch!!"

I tweaked it a little bit by adding white chocolate on top of the truffles and adding a small spoonful of shortening to both chocolates as they melted on the stovetop on low heat, whisking continuously. The chocolate cured perfectly. I kept them in the fridge until ready to eat and they turned out great. I’ve been asked several times to make them again."

I tried the 'batter' and thought they weren't so great.... but the finished product was fantastic.\n\nI added a few peppermint Dove squares which gave a great subtle peppermint flavor. I would totally do this again.\n\nI think next time I would set aside less cookie crumbs as I had more than enough left over. From 9 i would probably do 6 and thus add more to the mix.\n\nI used Newman's wheat free \"oreos\" and it turned out well, just not as many \"balls\" since there are less cookies in the container. I'm a big fan of this recipe."

Then I work in cream cheese with a spoon, then knead by hand to ensure a good mixture. I don't always chill them, but I let them sit in a stainless steel bowl, so I think the chill from the cream cheese remains. I use two bakers chocolate semi-sweet bars and melt in a double boiler with a couple of T of crisco to ensure a smooth texture. I added another 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint extract and topped the dipped balls with crushed candy cane."

I froze the batter before making the balls, then froze again before coating in chocolate. Personally I needed probably double the amount of baking chocolate or at least one extra pack per batch but people wanted to buy some off me! super delicious"

"reviewBody": "I decided to mix this up and use the peppermint Oreos. It was a wonderful twist! I will say that I struggled at first because the batter was too soft to effectively dip in the chocolate. So I rolled the truffles into balls and put them in the freezer for about 25 minutes. I used chocolate chips that I melted in the microwave and they worked just as well. The only thing you have to be careful of is, make sure you are generous when dipping the balls or they will just end up frustrating you.???"

I wish they'd given more specifics too, and it would have been easier to chill the balls before trying to dip. Big mistake! Flavor was good, but too sweet for my tastes. Overall, definitely not my cup of tea."

"reviewBody": "These are amazing, but beware that they are not for the novice or impatient! This was a 2 day project. Your chocolate can easily harden, and it can be tough to wrap the oreo mixture in the chocolate sauce. So be patient, and it if you make it to the end, you are likely to leave your guest in a chocolate coma! We suggest trying to warp the oreo mixture in some other things such as caramel or peppermint bark (which surprisingly 5 different stores had never heard of!). Those are easier to work with, and make the treats a little less sweet. I chose to top them with a strawberry puree, which blended fabulously, and also made for a much more beautiful presentation than all black. It is well worth all the effort."
