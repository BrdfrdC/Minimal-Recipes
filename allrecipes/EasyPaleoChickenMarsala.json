"reviewBody": "I love chicken marsala, and decided to try this version because of the added prosciutto. Next time I would definitely cut the prosciutto smaller than in thirds - I found the large pieces made each bite too salty. There also seems to be a missing instruction in Step 2 to remove the chicken from the pan. This was served over mashed potatoes for fairly easy weeknight meal."
