I don't keep white sugar in te house as I rarely use sugar except as a \"seasoning\" and even then it is usually an alternative such as natural maple, agave, honey, coconut blossom syrup... but this time raw cane sugar which is usually for guests. Then, I added 3 tablespoons of flour, approxinated the salt because the smallest measuring spoon I have in my set is a 1/2 tbsp (a teaspoon is 1/3 of that 🤦🏾‍♂️I have to do some shopping), and I added some blueberries (without dusting them with cornstarch as some say... that is why I added flour). They turned out quite fluffy!!! And Delicious!"

"reviewBody": "Good recipe. Didn't have any baking powder and I could take the salt a bit more than I'd like. Maybe because of the missing baking powder. Other than that they tasted pretty good. They were not awful. Will make again when I have all ingredients but will take the suggestion of others and cut back on the baking powder. Looking forward to making this again. Ms. Jen"

My son who seldom eats breakfast was grabbing his 2nd to eat while walking out the door to school. Is perfect for a sleepy morning. Will be using this again! To all those who fussed about the baking powder common sense would know that was a typo. It was fixed before I saw it. I would’ve known."
