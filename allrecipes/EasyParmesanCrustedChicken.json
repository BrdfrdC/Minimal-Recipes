Instead of combining everything, I thinly coated the chicken with mayo and then dredged it in the bread crumb mixture. For the mixture, I added a few seasonings to my taste, like pepper and garlic powder. When cooking, I put the breasts on a baking rack to keep from getting soggy. Made it 5 stars"

Two breasts took me closer to 20-25 Going to the temp on the meat thermometer is for dark chicken. Otherwise a very good, if simple, dish. People who like more flavor may want to do more than just use a sprinkle of herbed breadcrumbs."

"reviewBody": "This was good but not great. It does have potential. I cut the chicken breasts in half horizontally and reduced the amount of mayonnaise. To the mayonnaise, I added a bit of onion powder, garlic powder, and dried oregano and also used panko and spritzed the top with EVOO from my mister. Baked on a baking rack so the air would circulate underneath and not get soggy. I coated both sides of the chicken breast and turned it about half way through cooking time. I reduced the cooking time due to the thinness of the breast. I turned the chicken again and turned the oven from bake to broil for a couple minutes to crisp it up more. Sliced on the diagonal and served with spaghetti with homemade marinara sauce. I will make again but next time I think I will use even less mayonnaise and sear it quickly on both sides in the cast iron skillet before putting in the oven in the cast iron skillet."

I had to substitute a couple of the ingredients (three cheese blend for the parm and panko for the Italian bread crumbs) because it's what I had on hand. Even the picky eaters in the crowd loved the dish. Plated with some steamed broccoli and corn on the cob made a very eye-appealing, speedy meal. I did have to increase the baking time due to the chicken pieces being thicker than normal."

I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper to taste added powered garlic and Italian seasoning. Let it set for about thirty minutes so some of the flavors could soak in. I used 1/3 parmigiano cheese and 2/3 plain bread crumbs because I didn't have the other. It was a hit! I will definitely make this one again??"

But i didn't have preseasoned bread crumbs so i toasted a few pieces of bread and put Italian seasoning garlic powder onion powder and dried cilantro in a bag and crunched it all together. Also this way you can control a little more what flavors are going into it but it turned out to be one of my now favorite chickens!"

"reviewBody": "I would recommend drying your chicken off with a paper towel before putting the mayo on it. I also dipped the chicken in the mayo and took enough off to leave a thin layer of it. Then I mixed Italian panco bread crumbs with the parmesan in a bowl. Alas, I put the mayo chicken in the panco/parm and covered it thoroughly. I baked it on a cookie sheet for about 35 minutes. I put the chicken on linguine noodles and sauced it with spaghetti sauce. The chicken was very moist and had no issue with crisp-ness. Great alone but the Bf loves chicken parmesan with noodles and sauce. Topping it all with mozzarella is a good choice too. I will make again!:)"
