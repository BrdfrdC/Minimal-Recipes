It took longer and a hotter oven is needed. I set to 400 degrees on convection and baked for 40 minutes to achieve a lovely appearing golden crust. I used 1/2 the liquid from the peaches and to the liquid I stirred in cinnamon to our taste (about 2 tsp). Each time I gift a cooked dish to someone, I include the recipe and recommend Allrecipes as well."

Other recipes very similar to this one do call for a 9 x 11 pan. It would have cooked better and been done at the designated time if put in a larger pan. As it was I had to cook it a lot longer and it was \"doughier\" than when I made peach cobbler before. Next time I'll make this using a larger pan."

It did taste good as is but I thought it was a really safe recipe to experiment with.\nI used a strawberry mixture(14oz slightly mashed strawberries, tbs of lemon juice, tsp of cornstarch) in place of peaches.\nI used half a cup of white sugar and half a cup of brown sugar. I threw in a tsp of salt and a tsp of pumpkin pie seasoning in dry ingredients. I didn't have regular milk so I used evaporated milk. \nThis cobbler kills at every event I bring it and never last a week at home. My friend who doesn't like cooked fruit even loved it."

There is too much butter and milk. The crust portion is much too soft and gooey. When you pour the can of peaches including the syrup, there should be a more dry dough mix to bake and absorb the syrup. The dough is very wet. I would not make this again."

Melt your butter in your dish in the preheating oven until its good and hot. Pour your batter in the hot butter and pour your peaches on top of the batter, and do not stir. Do not cover and your crust will have deliciously crisp edges, and a nice gooey cake like center. Very good indeed!!! Enjoy!!"

The 9 inch was good, but a little dry. Then i made my own glaze out of leftover peaches, lemon juice, butter, then brown and regular sugar. Tasted great!"

I cooked at 360 degrees for 30 min and turned it off and left it in the oven without opening the door for additional cooking time. The flavor turned out perfect even without enough peaches."

I will absolutely be using less sugar, may take it down to 1/2 a cup next time being that the syrup in the canned peaches bumps up the sweetness factor to a highly inappropriate amount lol. I will also use a little more than a cup of flour, maybe a cup and a half. I hope I remember to come back and share my experience with the revision. Overall, I'm still going to eat every bit :)"

What more could you want in a cobbler. My recipe is folded, spilled on and well used. I have copied this for dozens of other home cooks. My hubby loves it warm with a scoop of French vanilla ice cream.. Blessings!"

I didn't know how much juice I had compared with store bought canned peaches so I poured most of the juice out and then put a little cornstarch in the peaches before I poured the peaches and their juice over the batter. \n\nI also made a second batch and cut the milk and sugar way down to make more of a pastry top. I was such a hit at a potlock dinner, that I never got seconds."

When fresh Colorado peaches are at peak season, why used canned peaches? I baked it a 375°F for 1 hour and the crust was a nice golden brown. I live at 6000 feet so baking is tricky up here, you may need to bake this cobbler for a shorter time, just keep an eye on it. Be sure to allow the cobbler to rest on a wire rack for 15 minutes before serving it."
