I thought it was a little too sweet so next go around I am going to try 1/2 cup of white sugar. \n\nOne thing I've learned over the years is that pecan pies always (for me) take longer than the recipe says. I cooked this one about 70 or so minutes and that did the trick. Just a thought...I wonder if adding another egg would help it set up/cook better/faster. Worth a try."

Also, I didn’t have corn syrup so used pancake syrup instead. The first ingredient listed on my cheap pancake syrup was “corn syrup”, so it functioned the same and added a nice, subtle maple flavor. You could probably use real maple syrup as well instead if you can afford to sacrifice a cup of it lol. Anyway, this was a hit with my husband and our friends who are already asking me to make another one with no changes."

Bake at 450 degrees for first 10 minutes then reduce heat to 350 degrees and continue baking for 35 more minutes."

I have made pecan pies where the bottom crust wants to stick to the pie plate and have solved the problem by always spraying my plate with Pam before putting the pie dough in. I do that with all pies and it helps to brown and crisp up the very bottom. This pie came right out with no problems. It is easy to make and I have just ran a copy off to put in with my favorite recipes!"

I changed the portion size and followed accordingly EXCEPT, when making a 9-inch I used 4 smallish large eggs and when making the 10-inch I used 4 large eggs. In general, I split the sugar - half white, half brown.\nThe key to not burning the top and cooking through - 350 degrees, covered w/foil for 40 min., then 325, uncovered for 40 min. If still not completely set, I then turn the oven off and keep the pie in for another 10 min.\nFor a pretty top - If you look through the pictures, mine is the one with circles. I put in the filling first, then starting on the outside, just put the pecans on top of the liquid (I don't even push them in), going around until that circle is done, then start the next circle. I point all my pecans one way, then the other way for the next circle."

I will definately be making this again.\nBecause this was for Christmas with guests, I took a spoon and turned all the pecans flat side down for better presentation once they floated to the top. I brought the whole pie to the table. If I was going to cut it before presenting, I wouldn't have bothered."

I followed the advice of leaving it in the turned off oven for about 20 minutes. I was worried that it still jiggled too much even then, but my husband told me that pecan pies will firm up after cooling. He was right and the pie was the perfect consistency!"

For those that said that they poured the filling in the crust first and then poured the pecans on top - you're supposed to put the pecans in the crust first and then pour the filling on top because the pecans rise up to the top of the filling. FYI - My dad LOVES pecan pie and he said it was one of the best he's had &amp; tasted fresher than most! Enjoy!"

"reviewBody": "This pie was fabulous, and so easy! I used light corn syrup and margarine instead of dark corn syrup and butter because thats what I had on hand (I read other reviewers say they used light syrup and it came out good, so I tried it too), and I didnt have enough pecans for this recipe, maybe 3/4 cup, but it worked out just fine. I poured them on top and pushed them down into the filling a little bit. I had to bake it an extra 15 minutes. The sugar did crystalize a little (nobody noticed but me) I'm not sure why this happened, but still it was the best pecan pie I ever ate... my family gobbled it up so fast, I only got a tiny piece... :( Anyway, thanks so much for this fast, easy and delicious recipe. I will treasure it for life..."

"reviewBody": "like many others have said, this recipe is problematic. the first one i made was a disaster, burnt to a crisp, and way too much filling. however the taste of the filling was good. so i thought i would make two pies instead of one. and instead of mixing the filling and pecans together, i arranged the nuts on top of the filling, put it in the oven and prayed!! they are almost ready now, and looking good. my only regret was not timing it. but i would say about 30 min + you will know when its done.\nperhaps the recipe was meant for a deep dish??? in which case i would have lined the crust edge with foil to help keep it from burning.\nbut the taste is there, excellent, you just have to fool around with it a little bit.\nok, so the second time didnt work out either. there was not enough filling for two pies. next time i am going deep dish."

I also use 1 cupful of pecan halves and add a handful of chopped pecans. I use Marie Callender frozen pie crusts becauase they are flakier and more buttery than pillsbury. I also reduced the dark syrup to 2/3 cups to reduce the sweetness and the risk of overflow. Hope it helps ;)"

This is the first time I have swayed from my grandmother's original recipe, and this recipe was an absolute hit! I will never go back to my old recipe. This pie was gone before the pumpkin pie was even touched. As a side note, it doesn't completely bake in the time listed. But I turned my oven off after an hour, and it set in the oven for an extra 20 minutes or so in order for the liquid to firm up. It was absolutely perfect. Thanks for the great recipe! It is now a family favorite."
