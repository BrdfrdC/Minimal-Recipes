The vegetable oil and salt amounts were too much, and made the pumpkin pie taste like salty oil with hard clumps. Use glass pan, less salt to taste, add some sugar to taste. Flour type make a big difference in crusts. Use pastry flour 00 and traditional crust technique."

One thing, it did smoke while cooking because of the oil dripping out of the crust, so if you use it as a top crust I would put a pan under it to catch the drippings so they don't burn. But I was really pleasantly surprised at how it transformed during baking. Nice option for when you need a quick crust."

I had all of the ingredients for a pumpkin pie but not enough time to make a crust. I used this recipe and it was perfect. I always use melted coconut oil when recipes call for vegetable oil. I baked the crust as directed, then added the filling and baked according to the pumpkin pie recipe. It was delicious! I disagree with other reviewers who said it was too salty and not sweet enough for a dessert pie. You need a bit of salt to balance out the sweet."

This kind of reminds me of the density of graham cracker crusts without the flavour. If you do choose to make this crust, it is definitely NOT good for sweets. It might work for meat pies, but I think any other pie crust that uses butter or shortening would be better than this oil recipe. Thanks anyway"

I saw a tip to roll it out on waxed paper and then place it in the greased pie dish and peel off the wax-- I'll try that next time! I used this for a quiche, but I understand that if used for a pie it would need more sugar added. This worked perfect and it was easy. No more refrigerated Pillsbury pie dough needed anymore.

I ended up adding about 2 tablespoons more flour after I pressed crust into pan because it felt too greasy. Turned out really well though. Every one loved the chocolate pudding pie I made with it. My mom said it was great, and she wonders now if she prefers a pressed crust instead of rolled because of the texture. It held well during serving, and was kinda flaky or crumbly when eating (yummy). Will definitely make it again and try as written for a savory dish!"

I made a second one and tried to roll it for a lattice topping- that didn't work as far as looks but the taste was great. Altogether a great option for a baked from scratch pie in a short time. And at Thanksgiving, who has extra time?"

I double the recipe, add twice the amount of sugar, divide it for the bottom crust, then add either a touch more sugar or cinnamon for the crumble. The topping turns out crisp and beautifully brown. I've had no issue with the bottom being soggy, even without egg wash. I do think pre-baking the crust is key. A keeper!!"

This last time I added 1 egg to it and it seemed like it held together a bit more than without. It is perfect for pot pies with the salt, but for fruit and cream pies I half the salt. It has a very good flavor. I gave it 4 which is an average of 3 (crumbly texture ) and 5 (flavor and ease)"

This year I was single-handedly cooking a Thanksgiving meal for 17 people, and I tried to \"cheat\" and use a store-bought graham cracker crust for my pumpkin pie. That crust fell apart the second I opened it, and with no time to go to the store, I had to find an emergency recipe with ingredients I already had in my kitchen! This was perfect for what I needed it for. I followed a tip from another reviewer and modified it to 1 tablespoon of sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. It was great. However, it would be impossible to use if you need to put a top layer of crust on your pie."

But I am going to keep this recipe as well, because of course they are not made with oil, and this is definitely a plus! moreover, it is not messy at all: if you really want to keep it to a minimum effort, you don't need a bowl and a rolling pin either. I mean to try it again, making the kitchen robot do all the work; I think it will be more \"smooth\" and perhaps less sandy and grainy... also, if you plan to use this for a sweet pie, be careful of the amount of salt (I happened to use it on my first try with a caramel filling, and it was fortunate, I declared that I had a \"caramel au burre salè\" French pie in mind from the beginning, but it was so untrue!"
