I read all the reviews and made changes using more butter and brown sugar and adding the pineapple juice. I used sliced pineapple and put a maraschino cherry in the middle of each and it was SO delicious (and beautiful!) we ate The. Whole. Thing. in one evening!!! I added the pecans which made it wonderful. Will definitely be making this one again - and again - and again ...\n\n[My only glitch was using a 9\" metal cake pan with sides not high enough so it started oozing over the edges while cooking. I solved it by putting the cake pan on a foil-lined baking sheet and it came out great.]"

Finally, I drizzled real maple syrup across the top, just a couple of tablespoons. All said and done very good! The only thing I would say is that the actual cake could be a little tastier. This is probably a result of Bisquick being used, but this could even be altered to make it taste a little better also. Good stuff!"

I asked for the recipe and she started listing ingredients. Please write them down! So she wrote down the ingredients, but they didn't quite match with the verbal ones. She went home, so the hunt began. The only difference was the entire can of pineapple juice and 1/4 cup milk in the cake. And the recommended increase of butter and brown sugar. The pineapple juice is great!"

I wish I would have read the submitters review on this about making it sweeter or changing up the topping. I am one to think that most desserts are too sweet, however the cake part didn't hardly seem sweet at all. When first done it was very soft, but by the next day the cake was kind of doughy. I had thought the topping should have been a little more prominent too. Only change I made was using a homemade bisquick type mix. I have used it in many recipes calling for it with great results. I would follow the reviewers advice about increasing the butter and brown sugar and definitely add the nuts, it might add something to the flavor and texture."

I did add the sugar and juice to the butter in the pan and melted it till it bubbled then I poured it in my 9\" round pan. I also use the \" Homemade Biscuit Mix\" recipe found here on Allrecipes.

"reviewBody": "I made this for my CEO's birthday...per his wife, it's his favorite. I've never made Pineapple Upside Down Cake before so I was attracted to the word \"Easy.\" Not only was it easy, but it got rave reviews from everyone in the office. I used the suggested variations (1/2 cup butter, 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1 tablespoon of the drained pineapple juice) and it was perfect. I'd recommend this 100%!"
