"reviewBody": "This was great! I think it’s also reminiscent of a meatball sub. We used toasted Italian bread for dipping. Overall, my family found it fun to share a pizza together in such a unique way. We plan to try this again changing out the meat for different pizza toppings to see how it turns out. I also feel like a softened 8oz block of Neufchatel cheese could work well mixed in. Thank you for the great recipe! It really was quick and easy to make."

I'd love to experiment with this, added pepperoni or other cheeses. But the base is solid. Great, different fondue to add to our rotation!"
