Aren't those canned tomato products 'cooked' in the canning process? ...... &amp; the umami that deepens the flavor of pizza sauce is a bit of anchovy or its oils..... doubly necessary in this day of flavorless cheeses."

Used \"diced\" tomatoes that had been seasoned w/ basil, garlic, and oregano, \"real\" garlic instead of dry, \"Italian seasoning\" instead of just oregano, and liberally tossed in some grated romano. DEE-LISH-US!!! CALORIES: 4 servings = 300 1 serving = 75"

"reviewBody": "Our family really liked this when my wife and I made it; a definite improvement over the usual store-bought sauces. However, because I was making enough dough for two 10 x 15 sheet pizzas, have a wife that loves margherita pizza and needed to make enough to cover both, I added a partially-drained 15 oz can of petite diced tomatoes and increased the seasoning. Ultimately, I used approximately 4 teaspoons of oregano and 2-1/2 teaspoons of dried minced garlic, then added approximately 1-1/2 teaspoons of basil and 1-1/2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning along with the original teaspoon of paprika. I warmed the mixture in a sauce pan, while waiting for the pizza dough, to help develop and test the flavor. Everyone enjoyed the flavorful, chunky sauce. I'm including a photo of the final results, specifically my daughters vegan style pizza, made with the sauce and pizza toppings that include a pepper &amp; onion medley, plant-based meatballs / crumbles, non-dairy cheese and pineapple."

My husband was very pleased, we both loved it, I wrote this down immediately so I don't forget how i did anything, we will be using this as our go to sauce recipe from now on! We're very happy with this recipe!!!! Thanks for sharing it!!"

I use fresh garlic not dried and more like 2 heaping teaspoons (but we love garlic) and also add a good heaping tablespoon and a 1/2 of dried basil. (Update: watch the amount of paprika you use, I had discovered Penzy's half sharp paprika and decided to use it in the recipe... Even though I decreased the amount by 1/3 knowing it was strong, it overwhelmed the sauce. I remember that happened another time with a fresher more flavor forward paprika I had tried. So beware of the amount of paprika.)"

I had Penzey's Italian seasoning on hand so added 2 tsps of that rather than play with the oregano/basil ratio others recommended. We will definitely be using this recipe again."

No need of cooking makes it so much easier. It was enough for 5-6 medium pita breads. Top it with mozarella, then peperoni, grape tomatoes and any other desired ingredient. Healthy homemade recipe. Enjoy"
