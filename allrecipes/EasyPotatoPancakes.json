"reviewBody": "These didn't really work out for me. I suspect it may be a combination of a ratio issue and my shreds were too large. Size of potatoes, or pounds, or cups of shreds would really be helpful. Also, should the size of the raw patty be 1/3, or 1/2 cup, or larger? I had a very large amount of shredded potatoes with using 5 russet potatoes. I used a food processor to shred, and the shreds were kind of large, for this recipe, I suspect. I poured off a lot of starch, too. Also, the potatoes absorb a lot of oil, and I had more than one batch. I had to add oil, for each new batch. The patties didn't hold together very well, for me. Sorry, this didn't work out very well, for me."

We decided this time to keep the skins on when we shredded the potatoes in the food processor. It added a nice flavor and was easier. I do put the onion right into the food processor with the potatoes instead of chopping. Family loved them. Double the recipe, they disappear quickly."

These are one of my absolute favorites and though the sour cream or applesauce are both good, I prefer them with just a lot of butter and salt. A very good pairing for them are some nice sage sausage links. Also, I've seen a few people say that they use leftover mashed potatoes and those are just as good, as a tip though you can also use leftover spaghetti squash in place of the potatoes. They turn out a little sweeter but are still delicious......hmmm....I do have some leftover mashed potatoes in the fridge......."

You have to shred the potatoes so that they turn into a thick liquid \"dough\"....I'd only use one egg and instead of flour, use some oats (they help to absorb the liquid and for crispier pancakes). Add a little nutmeg! Traditionally served with apple sauce! You find them around Christmas time at every Christmas market!!"

Sqeeze some of the water out of the potatoes before adding anything to them, them add the rest. After you place the potatoe pancake in the frying pan gently press it down with a fork like a hamburger pattie to cook through. Hope this helps, it's a great recipe and don't be afraid to add cheese, bacon bits, etc. It's definately great just as it is. Thanks again"

"reviewBody": "OK, I broke my \"cardinal\" rule of not modifying a recipe when I try it for the first time. I added only maybe 1/4 cup of finely chopped onion, omitted the flour, and also added 3 Tablespoons of mayo (as I saw in another recipe), and a 15 oz can of corn, well drained. I used the ready-made 20 oz package of shredded Hash brown potatoes from the refrigerator section (Simply Potatoes). Mixed everything and it was REALLY wet and loose and I was afraid that it would never hold together. I formed it into 4 large patties about 5 inches in diameter and one inch thick on a heavily buttered pizza pan that fits on my gas grill. Covered it tightly with foil and put on the grill over medium-high setting for 10 minutes, removed the foil and flipped them, then loosely re-covered with foil for 10 minutes. My fear that they wouldn't hold together was completely unfounded. I think the secret to having them stay together is to not try to do ANYTHING until the first side is well browned. They came out looking really great, but they were bland. I think I should have used a whole onion, as the recipe states, and I don't think the mayo did anything significant except add fat calories. I'm going to try this recipe again, only sticking more closely to the instructions as written. Very aesthetic results, just need to jazz up the flavor a bit for my taste. Thanks for a solid recipe, will definitely be going back to this one again, especially to do on the grill for Summer cooking."

I wish the recipe had specified how thick to make them, as mine were not done in the middle and I had to continue to bake them in the oven for 10 minutes at 400. I added paprika, onion salt and garlic powder to the mixture and I think these would have been rather bland had I not. The outside was very crispy, DB and myself both enjoyed them with ketchup! I will continue to make these but with modifications."

When I mixed all the ingredients together I also added 1 teaspoon of salt and pepper to season the potato pancake. I made mine how I would usually make pancakes, I sprayed a little oil on the skillet on medium high heat. Then I added a spoon full of potato pancakes. It came out crunchy and very tasty. Definitely my choice of breakfast. Will make more soon. Thanks for the recipe...."

"reviewBody": "This morning we decided we wanted some potato pancakes, as we already had some potatoes cooked, and didn't want to deal with a fussy recipe. And this was just the ticket. We didn't want to make as much as the recipe suggests, so we used two potatoes, a quarter of an onion, and added just a touch of half and half to the batter for texture. We cooked them on a stovetop griddle, and they came out absolutely perfect. We didn't have any applesauce, but we mixed a little candied ginger purée with some apricot-pineapple jam, and also used Trader Joe's Greek-style yogurt as topping. We also made a quick scramble with fresh, home-grown bell peppers, and enjoyed the perfect breakfast! Thanks so much for this wonderful and easy recipe."

The recipe reminds me of the potato pancakes a German friend used to make for me (this was before I realized that if I wanted something specific to eat, I could just make it for myself--yes, I was young and stupid). For the first course, I dot them with hot sauce. For dessert, slather them with applesauce. If I have the time, I'll soak the shredded potatoes in water, drain and give 'em a whirl in the salad spinner. Thanks for the recipe."

"reviewBody": "Shred the potatoes extra fine. After the potatoes are shredded you dry them with a kitchen towel by putting them inside and twisting the towel. This will get rid of the excess water in them. Beat the eggs until they are frothy then add the potatoes that have been dried to the eggs mixing them well. .Then add 3 tablespoons of mayonnaise to the recipe (this is the secret my Mutter taught me). Skip the flour as you don't need it with this recipe. If the recipe seems to watery skim the excess water off the top with a paper towel. I don't add salt to the recipe instead I salt them as they fry. I also add a bit of paprika to the mix. If you're using this as a side dish then top with sour cream. As a desert don't add the onions and then top with applesauce (although I can remember eating the pancakes with applesauce along with pork dishes). wunderbare"

Not only had I never cooked for his mother before - I'd never even had a potato pancake before! I found this recipe and it seemed easy enough. I conned him into buying me a food processor for the potatoes. Not having the food processor would have made a very easy, simple recipe into a very long, tedious one. This turned out great! I used sweet onions, so they added a nice flavor. His mother compared them to a local Polish restaurant's pancakes. She said they were as good, if not better. It could have just been lip service, but everyone went back for seconds (and thirds!) so I'm pretty sure they were impressed! Thanks!"

Absolutely need to have the oil really hot! As has been mentioned previously, make small pancakes, flatten them with the spatula. The recipe calls for just a few ingredients, and that contributes to the down-home appeal of these latkes."

I read the reviews and only added one egg tonight and I had to use a few more tablespoons of oil in the cast iron skillet. I used the food processor as others suggested. After processing the potato and onion together, I put the mixture in a clean dishtowel and squeezed out the moisture before adding the egg and flour. Best latkes ever. Thank you for this deceptively simple and delicious recipe. If I would have septupled the recipe we still would have eaten them all in one sitting!! We had them with sour cream and applesauce. They were perfect."

"reviewBody": "Yum yum, I've been making these for years without flour. Making one large cake is easier, just pour it all in the frying pan. I use a bit more oil to aid the bottom to crisp. Cooking covered 15 to 20 minutes each side over medium heat also insures the potato in the middle is done. Upon flipping I add another tablespoon or two of oil to cook the other side crisp. It's manageable to flip if cut in quarters by using a firm spatula. My family does not like these unless they are crispy, crisping really ups the flavor and adds texture. Definately serve with a dollop of sour cream, I like the green onion garnish idea as well."

Cut the pepper to 2 pinches and that was just right. These need the pepper though. I have to have salt with my potatoes and it tastes better cooked in then added after so I kept the salt the same. I did not squeeze the potatoes well enough after rinsing but the only thing it affected was the splattering. Now I have itchy wrists and a messy stove. I just bought a mandolin to make these and it was well worth the $25.99. Thank you."
