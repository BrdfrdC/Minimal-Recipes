There was a lot of liquid so I would also cut back the tomato sauce to 8 ounces. The vegies came out very soft - I would cut them into very large pieces. I made the seasoning blend and used it as a rub for the roast. Beef tasted great! I think because of all the sauce, the flavors got diluted."

This will make the most tender pot roast! And another thing add a dry packet of liptons soup mix to your roast before cooking for more flavor!! Other than that it's a good recipe"

The meat wasn't quite tender enough so I removed, sliced and cooked an additional 15 minutes under pressure. I use a pressure cooker as I have not purchased one of the instapots yet. I accompanied my meal with gravy made from the broth and roasted cauliflower and brussel sprouts. My family loved it on a cold winter night."

Tasted better than when I slow cook a roast for 6 or 7 hours. This is the way I will make it from now on. It was tender, fall apart, perfectly cooked. \n\nChanges I made: cooked 5 lbs of meat instead of 3, kept liquid as mentioned but added 1/4 cup red wine. Did not want to add the veggies in with the meat, so I left it in the cooker for the whole 45 min."

Cooked it in a cast iron Dutch oven with lid and after browning the meat as in the recipe, I placed it in a 250 degree oven for 2 hours, then increased the temp to 325 degrees for another 2 hours, adding the carrots and potatoes the last hour! I think the cast iron Dutch oven cooks hotter so the lower temp and adding more beef stock as needed prevented burning! Delicious meal!!"

I added mushrooms, carrots and potatoes after the meat was done cooking. I read the reviews before making this recipe and I agree that 15min is too long for the veggies to be pressure cooked. I went with 10 and although the potatoes held together they almost were too soft. - - - I made a delicious gravy to go along with this meal by using the broth, garlic powder, onion powder and a touch of milk along with flour. This was one of the best meals I have prepared in awhile. I highly recommend this recipe especially if you go the extra step to add a few more herbs and spices."

"reviewBody": "This was terrific. I'm rating 4 stars on the original recipe, but reading the reviews I made changes that make it a 5 star meal for sure. It is so tender I ate the meat using a fork only; a knife is unnecessary. It is hard to mess this up. Here is what I did:\n\n-Did not brown the roast.\n-Placed large chunks of carrot, celery, onion on the bottom.\n-Heavily salted the 3 pound roast, then placed in the instapot.\n-Added about 4 cups of beef broth.\n-Added a splash of red wine, worchestershire, pepper, garlic, rosemary, and thyme. \n-Set the instapot for 1 hr 15 min, and left it alone.\n(I wanted mashed potatoes, so I just prepared those separately.) The roast came out so tender and tasted fantastic, but I like salt and added a dash more at the table. We'll follow someone else's idea and thicken the broth, then add noodles to make a soup tonight or tomorrow. This meal is a keeper...just add more spices than the recipe calls for."

"reviewBody": "This is an ---EXCELLENT--- recipe - Very Tender and Tasty! Like many others who commented, I made some modifications. Instead of a \"Pot Roast\" I used a Tri-Tip Roast (about 3-4 lbs., fat-cap included). I blotted the roast dry with paper towel; seasoned both sides with Kosher Salt; coated all sides with Wondra Flour. Using my Farberware Electric Pressure Cooker I browned all sides in EVOO on SEAR setting. Instead of Onion Powder, I used 1 Lipton Onion Soup Mix packet and sprinkled all over top of roast along with an unmeasured sprinkle of Garlic Granules (about 1-2 TBLS) and generous sprinkling of Coarse Ground Malabar Black Pepper. I poured 32 ounces of Swanson Beef Stock over the top; omitted the Worcestershire Sauce completely; quartered 4-5 small Red Onions &amp; placed on top; quartered 4-5 medium-sized Red Bliss Potatoes and place on top. I would have put Carrots in, but no room. I placed lid on, selected STEAK/MEAT setting; adjusted the time to 60 minutes &amp; hit START button. Once done, I did a Quick-Release; removed Onions &amp; Potatoes to a bowl and Roast to a platter (easily scrapping off &amp; discarding all the fat-cap without sacrificing any meat (fat came off like softened butter). Selected SEAR setting again &amp; brought liquid to boil, added Wondra Flour to thicken liquid to gravy consistency; put roast &amp; vege's back in pot, put lid on/locked it. Selected KEEP WARM to keep warm until serving time."

Potatoes and carrots were just a little softer (not mushy, just softer) than I like, so next time I'll cut back to 10 - 12 minutes. Also added some slivers of fresh garlic, a bay leaf, some extra salt and doubled up on the Worcestershire. Didn't have beef broth so just used a couple of bullion cubes in hot water. Thickened up the sauce by making a slurry with a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch. Everything came together quickly and perfectly!"

I decided at the last minute to use a different recipe that cooks a 3 to 4 pound chuck/blade roast for 70 to 90 minutes on high. The roast came out the most tender, juicy and flavorful that I have ever tasted anywhere. The carrots, onions and potatoes went in at the start. The potatoes to use are the small ruby red potatoes, whole. With their skins on and the skins not pricked, they cook perfectly, tender but not mushy and the carrots most tender and flavorful. Cooked at 30 minutes on low would never cook a 3 pound chuck roast."

We had enough left over for one meal for 2. Whoever is cooking one 3 lb. roast for 8 is starving their guests. Otherwise, I cooked as directed and It's my go to from now on."
