This was a very simple recipe and it turned out sooooo so good!! It definitely hit the spot for my pumpkin bread craving."

Rather than 1 large loaf, I scooped the batter into two loaf pans. Baking time dropped to about 30 minutes. The top of the bread loaf was just perfect. (You know how it can over-bake while you’re waiting for the inside to bake!) I’ll do this one again!!"

"reviewBody": "This is a good base recipe but I thought I needed to be a little less sweet, a little more pumpkin-y and have a little more spice. I made this as muffins rather than bread. Decrease the sugar to 1/2 + 1/3 c (I actually used 1/2 c Truvia + 1/3 c sugar, and it turned out beautifully). I decreased the chocolate chips to 2/3 c. I used 1 c + 3 tbsp of pumpkin puree, which added moisture as well as pumpkin flavor. I added 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, and the juice of a 1\" piece of fresh ginger root."
