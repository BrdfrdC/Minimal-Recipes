And honestly, these were such a relief to find. I had made some blueberry muffins, and everyone but me liked them. I'm 35 weeks pregnant with my fourth, full time teacher and have three other five and under. I am exhausted and was out of vanilla and a few other things. This recipe made my day. Thank you! One bowl pumpkin muffins for the win! Oh and I added a scoop of unflavored vegan protein powder, because I felt guilty making so many muffins. Lol"

Depending on the brand of cake mix used, this is (with the current WW plan) only 2-3 points per muffin! At my meeting, it was recommended to use a spice cake mix and pumkin - no other ingredients needed. I used yellow cake mix as recommended here and 1.5 tsp of pumpkin spice blend. The batter is very thick, but that's totally FINE. It bakes up nicely and makes lovely, moist muffins. Thanks for posting this recipe!"

Easy to do and loosened the batter a little. Made more than a dozen muffins with the added ingredient. For ease I would make them again, flavor was good but a little too cakey for muffins. If you're not much of a baker, could use 2 tsp. pumpkin spice mix rather than all the spices."

"reviewBody": "I just made these and this is a great and easy base recipe that can be tweaked to your liking! The main changes I made were - I used 1 T pumpkin pie spice sincere that is all I had. I think next time I will even increase that to 1.5-2 T since the spices were not the most noticeable flavors. Like others mentioned the batter was really thick and I had a bit of a hard time getting it incorporated (I was just using a spatula) so I added 1/2 cup of water and it smoothed out nicely. This added about 10 minutes to the baking time. Finally I added mini chocolate chips to the batter and sprinkled walnuts on top. I also just sprayed the muffin tin and the muffins popped right out. Again with a few tweaks this is a great easy and cheap recipe!"

I made a few changes, instead of yellow cake batter I used french vanilla, and I have heard some people use chocolate. It would be a good idea to split the batter in half and add some cocoa powder to half if you have some chocolate and some vanilla fans as we do in our house. Also, I only baked for 18 minutes and they turned out FABULOUS! Thank you for posting this, it is one of our favorite fall muffin recipes!"

We even cooked an extra 10 minutes because we were sure it should have been more done inside. The next morning the muffins were the same inside, but the taste was even more bland. It needs more spice for sure. Plus a brown sugar crust on the top to help bring out the flavor. Muffin paper did not peel off well."

I will definitely make them again."

Use an ice cream scoop for absolutely perfect muffins. Love, love, love!"

"reviewBody": "The reviews I read were good but I really wish I had read some of the negative reviews too. The batter was quick to put together, but it was very stiff and it was very difficult to get it into the muffin pan without making a mess. These muffins definitely do not look like the picture ... but I guess I should have read more reviews before making this recipe since there appears to be some tricks to getting these muffins to look more like a normal muffin and not like some strange spikey cup cakes. I lot of people didn't like the texture but I didn't mind that so much because they were very moist .. more like a cupcake then a muffin. They were just way to bland .. the muffins have the texture of a cupcake without being sweet .... which is just weird. I love pumpkin and yellow cake mix, but together (even with the spices) these muffins just don't have much taste. I would have given these 1 star but the recipe was realy quick and easy and I think with some tweaking the muffins could be better especially with some of the suggestions made by other reviewers ... I think I can salvage the remaining muffins by adding either cream cheese frosting or a glaze, but don't think I'll be making this recipe again."

These muffins are dense in a \"substantial\" way, and extremely moist. Amazing! I used fresh sweet potato puree that I had on hand from another recipe. I also left them in the oven for an additional 10 minutes...my choice...not because they needed to cook longer. I prefer the tops to be a bit more golden. I used an Immaculate Baking Company yellow cake mix. I plan to have my nephew try this recipe during one of our baking classes together. Enjoy!!!"
