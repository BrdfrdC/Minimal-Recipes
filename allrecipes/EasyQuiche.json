I did the same, and also made the biscuit mix using flour, baking soda, etc. I used a glass 8x8 pan and the quiche was about an inch thick when done. I went with frozen spinach. Everything tasted great! Halving the recipe and using an 8x8 pan meant it was done at about 45 minutes. Made four nice-sized servings. The crust was not thick, like a quiche or pie crust. It was just a bit of a thicker bit of the ingredients. If you're a quiche purist, which I am not, that may bother you."

Did not have milk or broccoli, so substituted sweet peas and heavy cream with a dash of water. Added onions, garlic, salt, pepper and a few pieces of leftover bacon pieces from another meal. Mixed it up in a 2 cup measuring cup. It all fit into a small baking dish. It's a delicious Monday morning brunch."

I have tried different cheeses with tasty results.\nI forgot the butter tonight and think I will not put it in in the future as it really wasn't needed. The cheese has enough fat.\nI added diced red pepper, onion, and garlic that I sauteed in bacon grease that was left from the home smoked bacon slab I cut some cubes from and fried. I also used leftover Christmas ham my other half smoked too. That made the dish the best tasting one yet. I often use green onion or scallions as some call them but I did not have any on hand. I missed that flavor addition tonight."

The first question I get asked anytime we're planning a potluck is 'are you going to bring one of your delicious quiches?' or 'Please bring a quiche!' I usually don't do ham/broccoli however as some of the people in my office hate ham in general (for whatever reason), so I do spinach and green onion, which everyone loves."

I used a package of frozen spinach (thawed and water squeezed out with paper towels) in place of the broccoli because that’s what I had on hand, and it was really good. I’m sure the broccoli would have been good too. Glad I baked it for the full 50 minutes. It looked a little dark on top and it almost looked overdone, but it was actually perfect and the inside wouldn’t have been completely set up if I’d cooked it for a shorter amount of time. I’ll definitely put this in my Saturday morning breakfast rotation."

I sautéed fresh mushrooms onion garlic &amp; spinach &amp; added Buddig single package of ham diced up. I used fresh grated Parmesan-the whole cup of Parmesan really gave it flavor. I used cup of fresh grated cheddar. Added pepper. Only had to bake 44 mins and it was golden and fluffy."

"reviewBody": "This quiche truly is as easy as adding everything in one bowl and then transferring to the baking dish! I typically don't like to modify recipes until I've at least tried it once, however I was missing a few items and had to swap out some things. I don't use cow's milk so I used the unsweetened unflavored almond milk I had. You honestly would never know it because it has the cheeses to add richness. I also didn't have ham so I swapped that out for a package of pre-cooked bacon with no nitrites/ates. .\n\nAs I'm sure you've read in other reviews, this recipe yields much more than one pie. In fact it filled two pie dishes perfectly. I baked the filling in a pre-made Pillsbury crust from the frozen section. It was $1.99 for a pack of two. INCREDIBLY TASTEY! My partner is a veteran of restaurant management and LOVED this quiche. Looking forward to trying this next time with no crust and substituting other vegetables and cheese. That's really the beauty of dishes like this; once you know how to make it there are so many options!"

I NEVER put the butter in it and I think it's fluffier and firmer without it. The combinations I make are: spinach and mushroom and Spinach and bacon. Wilt the spinach and mushrooms in some water in a pan, drain and blot as much water as you can with a paper towel. Brown bacon and blot with paper towel."
