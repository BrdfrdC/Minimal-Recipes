"reviewBody": "This really is easy and tasty. I didn't have wings, so I used 4 chicken legs for two of us, and it was still quite good. It was way more flour than I needed for 4 legs, but I've put the rest in the freezer for next time. I used a wok to cook in and didn't measure how much canola oil I used - probably 3 cups, maybe 4. Since the legs were obviously bigger than wings, I cooked them for 10-12 minutes, turning them a couple times. The chicken was juicy and flavorful with a nice crunchy coat. The Texas Pete wing sauce with butter (which I heated in the microwave) gave a nice kick but not enough to hurt. Good recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I didn't find a tablespoon of butter to be nearly enough for our liking. I ended up adding 4 tablespoons (1/4 cup). Recipe says it serves 6 but this was just about the right amount for hubby and I so keep that in mind. These were good but who doesn't love a classic wing? I recommend making as is to start off and only add more butter to the sauce if you see fit. I'm already looking forward to making these again!"
