"reviewBody": "I read the reviews about being too sweet, so I made two pans to test side by side. The full sugar version is quite good. I reduced both the brown and white sugar to 3/4 cup of each. The reduced sugar version has more of the tart rhubarb-style taste I love. I will make the reduced version again. I will consider upping the topping. To get a good enough base you use about 3/4 of the batch, leaving the topping a little thin. One note, it took much longer than 5 mins to get the sauce thick and clear. Also, the corn starch clumped up the first time I made it. So the second I pre-slurried it before adding it into the pot. This is for sure a way for me to contend with my bounty of rhubarb! Thanks!"

I did 75% the brown and while sugar and it was plenty sweet. I also doubled the crumb topping /crust. The proportions with the doubled crumbles were so good, but pretty hearty. I may try to make the standard recipe for a lighter dessert."
