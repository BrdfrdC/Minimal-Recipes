I used a cast iron skillet (I didn’t have anything else suitable) and cooked the roast to 120 degrees, removed it from the oven and let it stand for 20 minutes, shooting for medium rare. Well it turned out well done, however, I think that may have more to do with letting it stand in the cast iron skillet. Next time I’ll remove the roast and let it stand. My husband liked it, so we’ll give it another shot."

"reviewBody": "This came out absolutely perfect, and in a (admittedly higher end) toaster oven. I would like to address FlyingHippy. You clearly did not follow the recipe \"step-by-step\" because your own comments suggest you used ribeye steaks (\"really thick cut ribeyes\" is not the same as a ribeye roast). Also at no point in the recipe was 375F an option. It was 500 for 20 mins and 325 for 90-120 mins. Mine came out perfect at 90 mins and leaving it in the toaster oven until the sides were done. Our OP put a lot of time and energy into putting this out there, and more than a little trust. Trolling might feel good for a few minutes, but learning how to actually cook and follow a recipe brings out a lifetime of benefits..."

"reviewBody": "My favorite steak is a ribeye so I figured I should try doing a ribeye roast this Easter. This being my first, I began Googling and ended up here (thankfully). Prep was simple, made a garlic butter spread and generously lathered it up while my oven heated to 500 degrees. Some salt and coarse pepper followed then I seared it for 20 minutes on the dot, then decreased it to 325. The last thing I wanted was to overcook this baby. Alexa pitched in and set my first timer then we waited. I followed someones advise to pull it at 125 degrees then tented it for 20 minutes. Sure enough, worked like a charm! Thanks for the tip! I will definitely be doing this again, easy peasy and delicious!"

After the initial 500 degree 20 minute cook time I turned the oven down to 325, but after inserting a temp prob I could see things were cooking way too fast. I finally got the oven temp down to 275 and slowed the cooking way down. It took approx 2hrs at a slow and lower temp, i.e. 139-140 degrees I took out the roast. Because of the slow cook time the roast didn't need to rest. It was rare to m-rare. It was really delicious, and my wife loved it for our Christmas dinner. She asked me to do another one tonight."

Also, I will combine the salt, pepper and any other seasonings used with the garlic butter and then coat the roast. I urge you to try it and marvel at your skill!"

"reviewBody": "This gets an easy 5 star rating. No changes needed but you can cut the butter to half if you want. I agree with others who suggested 20 minutes per pound after searing. That seems to produce the best result, even for smaller 2 pounds roasts. While the steak is wonderfully pink, I didn’t find it to be bloody. So make sure it rests appropriately (20 min max). Also, since the steak cools a bit while resting, make sure your au jus is piping hot!"

Used half a cup of butter and added some seasoning to my 4.8 lb roast, did as instructed on high for 20 mins, 1.5 hr at the lower temp and rested for about 25 minutes before carving. Perfect rare, medium rare throughout. I did leave the roast out for an hour prior to cooking which I believe is crucial to the doneness of any meat. Thank you for the recipe! We will repeat soon!"

I only take off a star for now because I have had better, but it could be that I didn't like it as much as other recipes because I prefer rare to medium rare cooked beef. I'll update it once I try it again.\n\nAlso, what would be a good method to make the outside crisper without affecting the inside temp too much? Thanks."

If you are using this guide for ribeye steaks then you need to find another guide. 2nd if your not using a roasting pan, placing your ROAST on top of a bed of celery will prevent overcooking and burning at the bottom.
