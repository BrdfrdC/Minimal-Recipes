"reviewBody": "Awesome! Great taste if just a bit sweet, but nice texture. I had to make 2 changes out of necessity: subbed sour cream and just a bit of cream cheese in for the yogurt and vanilla wafers in for the lady fingers. Both worked fine. I didn't need anywhere near 2 cups of coffee and so I even added just a couple of teaspoons of it right to the cream mixture. I used a pumpkin flavored coffee and did make it strong and it really does come through just right. I did not think with the amount of coffee that I ended up using that would be true but the wafers really do take on the coffee flavor. Very nice, will definitely make this again. Also this is extremely easy to make!"

"reviewBody": "I was pleasantly surprised by how good this was! Marscapone is very expensive where I live so this is a tasty frugal version and it has no raw eggs which I liked.\nI used plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream as I had some to use up.\nI added 1 tbsp Kahlua and 1 tsp Espresso powder to the cheese mixture.\nI used 3/4 cup each of coffee and Kahlua for dipping the ladyfingers, my packages were 5.5 ounces each and I used 2.\nI found it a little sweet, would try 2/3 or 1/2 cup of sugar next time.\nI sprinkled with cocoa and grated 90% chocolate between each layer and on top which helped counter the sweetness.\nNo one could tell it was not mascapone, the texture is slightly softer but the taste is good and close to the original.\n#AllrecipesAllstarsCanada\n#FacelessNoMore"
