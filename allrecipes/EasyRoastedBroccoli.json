"reviewBody": "I never review any recipes From allrecipes since I always change them up a bit. Yet, in this case I had never even thought to roast broccoli. It turned out fantastic, I did my usual thing, I made changes. I tossed the tops in melted butter (lightly) instead of olive oil, and cut all tops about the same small size. I sprinkled w/garlic powder then baked on an oil-sprayed foil lining on a cookie sheet in a preheated oven. Temperature at 425 degrees for 13 minutes. Once out of the oven I pulled up the foil to unstick any pieces, both sides were slightly browned. I tossed the broccoli with about 1 to 2 table spoons of parmesan cheese, not too much. A couple of whirls of fresh ground pepper and the result was delish! Slightly crunchy tops and al dente stems. I’m not a big broccoli fan, but my husband is, and this dish will go in my rotation. Thanks for the idea! \n\nLast thing, wash them ahead of time and layout the pieces on a towel to let dry. You don’t want to use wet broccoli, the dryness makes the tops crunchy."

"reviewBody": "I will make this again, but I modified it a little bit. I added a bit less oil (maybe 1/3 less), and tented it with foil after about 8 minutes, because it was starting to burn a bit. I massaged the broccoli with the oil, salt and pepper for a minute or so before putting it in the oven, which I believe helps the broccoli stay a bit more tender. I also ended up lowering the heat a bit after covering with foil. It was great, but just a bit too browned on the top. I think next time I will start at 350 F, maybe put the foil on top sooner (5-6 minutes), and then finish roasting for 15 minutes."

Then I put them on a tray, sprayed some olive oil and sprinkled some sea salt. I put them in the oven for 30 minutes. It was very tasty, however, I think it would be better if the broccoli is not frozen to start :)"

It came out nearly perfect. I added a tad bit of lemon juice then had some leftover grated parmesan cheese that I sprinkled over the top after it was finished cooking. The oven was still hot but off, but I threw it back in to keep it warm while I worked on the main dish and other sides. Worked great! It's a very easy yet elegant side dish."

He ate more of this than I did and loved it. Why? He said it was because it was not soft and overcooked which is how he describes \"steamed\" broccoli. I made this exactly as written, used 3 stalks for two of us, made sure that the stalk pieces (including the stalks with the crowns) were as close to a quarter of an inch thick as possible. Used 1 T. olive oil, coarse sea salt and black pepper. Delicious!! Ate the last little bit while cleaning up the kitchen and was just as good cold."

I had frozen broccoli that comes in the steamer bags from Costco, so I heated it for 2.5 minutes in the microwave to thaw it. I then added the olive oil and some Montreal Steak spice, per other reviews, directly to the bag to toss it together. 400 degrees for 18 minutes seemed perfect. It was tender, but not mushy."

Add Salt and Pepper. Baked for 20 minutes at 425. The flat side will brown on the pan and the top side gets a crispy crunch. Super yummy."

I made a few changes in the seasoning (I used some Chicago Steak season, lemon pepper, and new Orleans cajun) and the amount of oil (Two and a half tbsps). I also opted for using frozen broccoli (took about 30 minutes instead of 18). It turned out tasty and great. I have a new way of cooking broccoli!"

I toss all in a plastic bag, give it a good shake, then spread it over the baking sheet prior to baking. I'm going to try the parmesan cheese addition next time I cook this. I just shake olive oil into the plastic bag, but feel I use at least double the amount listed so that it gets over all the florets."

Were I to try this again, I would do a foil packate, lower the temperature and increase the time so that the broccoli has a chance to become tender."
