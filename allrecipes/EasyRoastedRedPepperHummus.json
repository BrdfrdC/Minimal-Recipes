Just our preference."

The recipe did not include a portion of plain yogurt or plain sour cream or anything like that to make it even more creamy. It needs the sour cream or the yogurt to bring a little tang and extra creaminess to the hummus. Suggest adding equal parts yogurt to tahini to the blender while making at start. Add more to taste. Also added a quarter cup of extra virgin olive oil. For that reason, you give a four star."

"reviewBody": "As written this was incredibly bland and not appetizing. I ended up adding more lemon juice and roasted red pepper and then adding a bunch of seasonings from other recipes online to fix it. I added half of a jalapeño, garlic, toasted onion powder, roasted garlic powder, chipotle powder, smoked paprika, black pepper, salt, cayenne, cumin, and some olive oil. I wasn't measuring, just sprinkling in small amounts of the seasonings until there was more flavor and kick. I took this to an event and people raved over it and kept asking for the recipe! (Fun tip: it sounds bizarre, but if you find yourself with overly runny hummus- say your tahini is too thin or you've added extra lemon juice- a little bit of potato flakes added to the mixture doesn't change the flavor and allows you to thicken it to your desired texture.)"

That being said, I'm sure that there are as many hummus recipes as there are cooks who make it, all of us tweaking it to our tastes once we are familiar with the method and the tradition."

I followed the recipe practically as written - the only changes I made were to add some spices (cumin, cayenne powder) as I wanted it a little spicier, and omitted the dried basil, which I find tasteless. I also included the juice from my home-cooked garbanzos, having taken note of reviews saying it was too thick. The result was tasty, but mine turned out a little soupy, probably because my tahini was more runny than my usual brand. I really like the sweetness added by the roasted red peppers, as tahini can be a little bitter. Overall, a very good recipe that I will continue to make."

Four stars because it was fabulous with a few changes. \r\n\r\nused 1/4c tahini\r\n1/4c lemon juice\r\n1 whole head of roasted garlic instead of the raw cloves\r\n1 roasted red pepper\r\n1 roasted pablano pepper (because we like a little heat)\r\nand then drizzled olive oil thru the chute until the consistency was as we liked it. It was very dry without the oil probably because I cut down on the tahini and lemon juice. I did \"peel\" the chickpeas.\r\n\r\nI did use salt and pepper for some added interest. when my 14 yo boy tasted it he asked \"is that all you made?\" LOL! \r\n\r\nAnyway start with this recipe, it is solid and then adjust as you wish."

"reviewBody": "I usually make hummus on the fly without a recipe and it turns out differently every time, so I thought I would search for a good recipe. This one got so many great reviews and I was excited to try it. Not sure what happened with mine, but I did not like this at all. WAY too much lemon juice (and I even put in less than the 1/3 of a cup).......tasted like raw garlic....and needed salt! I didn't eat the first batch. Tried it again with sauteed garlic, the juice from 1 lemon (about 2 Tblsp), and a pinch of salt. So much better. But I can't give a recipe more than 1 or 2 stars if I had to make major changes to it."

I come short of saying \"Great\" but if I could find the tahini it might be that. Thank for for the recipe."

It has one of those things that you can use to mash and stir things around as you blend."

I roasted my pepper on the grill, so there wasn't any added liquid from the pepper that you would get from peppers from a jar. It seemed a bit thick, so I just added a little water to get the right consistency. Good flavor!"

Roasted my own red pepper (used 1 whole one) and followed the recipe pretty closely except I added a dash of salt and used half the lemon. This couldn't be an easier recipe and it is SOOOO much better than store bought! For those who said it was missing something, it's probably all those chemicals in the store bought we are all used to eating. :) Will make this again and again, also trying other flavors. It was great even before I added the red pepper. Thanks Marbalet! Highly recommended."

Likely because of omitting the tahini, it was a little on the runny side, but it still tasted really good and had a decent texture. Next time I will plan ahead and look for tahini to see if it makes a difference."
