"reviewBody": "Love this but be careful! Every time I made this following the recipe exactly the patties would easily fall apart, I couldn't figure out why till I looked it up. ground chuck does not like all the extra wet additives. You can make a hamburger with just the ground chuck, don't actually need the breadcrumbs and egg for a basic burger. Keep the amount of wet ingredients basically at 0 if you want your patties to stick together. \n\nGet rid of the water you simply do not need it in your patties, they will fall apart, instead of using the Worcestershire sauce to make the patties use, garlic powder/sugar/and a little bit of steak seasoning for that smoky flavor. Like I said you want your patties dry, lol. You can use dried tomato (chopped really finely) in place of the ketchup. \n\nIf you want to keep the Worcestershire sauce and ketchup added it to the gravy. Great recipe but adding all that liquid to the patties guarantees they will fall apart on you"

"reviewBody": "The prep time is off by about a factor of 2. From the time i started pulling the ingredients from the fridge until it went in the oven was 38 minutes. I found the mix to be a little wet and hard to handle before browning, I think the oats do not absorb the liquids as well as the bread crumbs. It might be good to let the mixture set for 20 minutes before browning. I de-glazed the frying pan and used that liquid in place of about half the milk. My family was not fond of the texture and flavor of this recipe, but I really loved it. This stays in the file for bachelor night, but won't be made for the whole family."

"reviewBody": "I skipped the oven and did this on the stovetop since my family didn't want to wait 45 minutes for this to bake. The meat patties came out very tender and moist and I got 6 good sized portions from this. I am not sure I liked the oatmeal part instead of bread crumbs but I am the only one here who is texture picky. I didn't have cream of mushroom soup (all I had was a cream of chicken mushroom which didn't sound good) so I used a can of beef consomme and added in some flour to make a brown onion gravy. My husband loves salisbury steak and this passed his taste test. I only tolerate it (texture thing and it's too much like meatloaf) but it had a decent flavor. I didn't care for the moist meat patties but that's back to my texture aversion so no reflection on the recipe. This turned out fine and I'd make this again. I would stick to doing the stovetop method the next time too unless I already had the oven going for another dish. I had this from patty to pan and on the table in less than 30 minutes."

I subbed some minced raw onion for the dried, added a handful of fresh chopped parsley and used a large jar of brown gravy instead of the soup. I served it over egg noodles with a green veggie. Leftovers did not make it past midnight. Next time I make these I want to double or triple the recipe and make some trays for the freezer."

So I recommend; this is a good fall/winter recipe, very comforting."

My only change to the patties involved putting them straight into the baking dish and I used onion powder in place of the dried, minced onion. Also, I sprinkled dried onion soup mix over the gravy before it went in the oven. This was good with a baked potato along with fresh fruit."
