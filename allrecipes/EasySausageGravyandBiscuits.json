I used turkey (10) round sausage patties that I tore up after I defrosted. For the flour I used a salad dressing shaker along with the milk before adding it to the sausage so I could ensure no lumps. Lastly used 1% milk. Husband loved it and much healthier than what you get at a restaurant."

"reviewBody": "Just about the easiest food to make. This is the classic recipe many Americans, at least in the South, grew up with. Can't really go wrong. The biscuits are secondary to this whole experience. One can use any type of bread one wishes. This is about the gravy. Not to say fluffy, buttery, golden brown biscuits aren't an ideal pair with this, but English Toasting Bread or even a good sourdough works as well. If there is any suggestions I could make it would be that one might want to have some extra milk on hand as this recipe can get a little thick at the end of the cooking stage, and I add a tablespoon of butter before browning the sausage. The extra fat helps with consistency, as I have always found ground sausage just doesn't add that much fat at all. I also use whole milk. This becomes a very rich gravy, as one might imagine. Southern Comfort Breakfast food. :)"

I added garlic and onion powder as well as sage. Still didn't help. I read others reviews and decided to try it again, only this time I'll cut it half (way too much of end results) and use a lard/butter combo, use a milk/broth combo (milk's too expensive), and less flour. I had to keep adding milk to get it more gravy like. I'm not giving up, just twerking it again. Thank you for forging the way."

"reviewBody": "I HATE making any gravy/sauce from scratch using flour. It ALWAYS clumps and looks nasty. Not this one! So easy and tasty. The flavor is in the sausage. Pick a good one. Jimmy Dean sausage is obviously everyone's first choice, but I used a more affordable, tasty store brand and it came out great. This was the easiest, simplest country gravy recipe EVER. Previously, if I did not have the little packet of gravy mix, I wouldn't dare make sausage and gravy. And don't skimp on the milk. While I would normally use a 2% milk no matter what the recipe called for, the whole milk called for in this recipe may have been what made the difference. I am using this recipe for a school's \"Breakfast with Santa\", and I have NO worries about how it will turn out."

Now, do it all over again but try it with bacon!!! My favorite!!"
