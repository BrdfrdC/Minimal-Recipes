The parmesan after removing from oven was a WOW factor for the palate. 12 minutes at 370 worked great and they were still plenty moist. I did very lightly dust them with spray-coconut oil before sticking in oven Also, this is about the fastest and easiest party dish that I ever made. Thanks for the guidance!"

This keeps mushroom stuffing from drying out because mushrooms have a lot of moisture. I have never precooked the mixture. I have frozen these after being baked(cool completely before freezing) and at a later time microwaved after being thawed. They were excellent. Made these for years."

Cook the sausage in the same pan and remove. 3). Cook the onions until translucent then add the garlic and cook until aroma is released. Make sure you scrap the bits from the pan. \n\n4). Return meat and season with basil, oregano, crushed red pepper, salt, and pepper. 5). Mix in bread crumbs, cheese, etc. 6) Drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil in the bottom of each cal then brush the exterior with same oil. 7). Fill caps then brush tops with oil. 8). Add remaining cheese to the top of the caps and bake. 9). For a slightly crunchy texture broil them for 2 minuets at the end."

This recipe had the least and most easily substitutable dairy ingredients. I doubled the recipe and used one pound hot and one pound sweet Italian sausage and subbed half the parm (we can have this in moderation) for some lactose free yogurt cheese (from Trader Joe's similar in flavor and texture to jack cheese). My only other change was to use dried parsley instead of fresh, because that is what I had."
