And for the first time cooking something myself it tasted really good! if ya want some more spice. After you have finished plating it, a couple of drops of tobasco improved the taste. (if you can handle the heat that is)."

"reviewBody": "I don't write a lot of reviews but I had to for this one. I was looking for an easy gumbo recipe after my 8-year-old loved the gumbo at a Bubba Gump restaurant. (Who'd have thought?) I had never made gumbo before and some of the recipes just look so laborious. This took a little time but was so worth it! Everyone loved it! The only change was I added a can of diced tomatoes and I used half a cup of canola oil and half a cup of butter for the roux, just because I think roux should have butter in it and I can't help myself. \n\nThe Cajun seasoning I had was Tony Chachere's Original Creole seasoning and I only used one tablespoon of it because I didn't want it too spicy and people could add more after if they wanted it hotter. I served it with Jasmine rice and garlic bread. Really happy with this one!"

Trying to make it friendly for my son to eat I added pre-cooked, cut up, chicken thighs in addition to shrimp and sausage. I took the advice of folks and used Old Bay seasoning so I didn't have to buy one more bottle of seasoning then added a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos. Well my husband loved it! My son not so much cause that small can of tomatoes had just enough spice to turn him off. A do-over for sure."

I added more flour and less oil plus one half stick of land o lakes butter (salted) I made my own broth using chicken bullion cubes and water. I didn't have any any Cajun seasoning, so I used old bay seasoning with a little sea salt and added a bit of ground thyme. I also added mixed vegetables in place of okra cause I didn't have okra at home. My roux was my desired consistency of thickness."

It cost roughly 20 bucks to make the entire batch. Love it."
