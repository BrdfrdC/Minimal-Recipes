It's a very simple, straightforward recipe, so I'll give it credit for that. I\nUnfortunately, I still found the recipe rather bland. I used 93/7 ground beef and nefchatel cheese to remove some of the fat from the original recipe. Perhaps that's where the flavor was lost. Still, not a complete disaster. It was filling and we will stretch it into multiple meals."

"reviewBody": "LOVE this recipe! I have 3 boys with very different food likes and dislikes, but this one was a hit with everyone! I didn’t have all the ingredients on hand, so where it called for frozen/thawed vegetables I used 2 cans of drained mixed veggies instead, and I added 1 tablespoon of dried minced onion. I had breakfast sausage I needed to use up, so I used that in place of ground beef which ended up making it a little too salty, so I’m really looking forward to trying it with ground beef as called for instead. I only had sour cream and chives mashed potato mix too, which I think was another reason it seemed a bit too salty, but the flavor was good! I also made my own beef gravy with water, bouillon powder, flour, butter, and added some beer for flavor which also turned out well! This has definitely become a favorite and I’m absolutely going to make this as one of my go-to recipes!"

He said it’s not supposed to have cheese, but I said everything is better with cheese. Definitely took longer than 10 mins to prep but worth the time. Sautéed onions with ground beef as recommended on some reviews. Used package of mixed vegs that was less than in recipe but plenty - instant mashed potatoes were great and easy. Loved and will make again. Made my picky husband taste (he had chicken for dinner). He liked and said he’d eat for dinner next time I make."

My younger teen and I, thought it was bland, bland, bland. :( So, tonight I tried to save this dish; rather than throw it out. I sauteed a conservative amount of: freshly minced garlic, and some freshly minced white onion; upon tasting --- still not enough flavor! Then I added a conservative amount (I didn't want to add too much, because I could always add more but; not take the seasoning away), of the following: garlic powder, onion powder, freshly cracked black pepper and, sea salt and; a couple of shots of Worcestershire sauce. It was better; but still not enough flavor! So, I added more of only: garlic powder, and onion powder and; now the dish had enough flavor! :) I'm sorry, I wouldn't make the original recipe again. I will try a different Shepards Pie recipe, if I make it in the future."

First I doubled the recipe, not sure I needed to it was quite filling and we had a lot of left overs (but they were devoured as well). Sautéed 1/2 and onion and garlic with ground beef and added a packet of Lipton beefy onion soup mix to the ground beef. We used Betty Crocker Garlic mashed instant potatoes and otherwise followed the recipe as is. My husband &amp; kids loved it and requested it be added to the rotation of recipes. Thanks for the great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe for St. Patty's Day. It was easy with a few tweeks ;) Instead of whole potatoes, I used boxed garlic mashed potatoes. I also added onion and garlic salt and sour cream to the meat to season it a little, as suggested by another user. The only thing I would change, is the type of veggies I placed on the bottom. I bought a frozen bag of corn, green beans and carrots (my husbands not a fan of green beans.) But, I can't eat broccoli or cauliflower, so my choices of mixed veggies were limited. Next time, I am going to buy a bag of corn and a can of mushrooms to put on the bottom. I think the flavors will be awesome with this recipe. My husband still ate it, picking out the green beans of course. It did taste very good reheated the next day as well!"

Instead of Cream cheese, i used a half can of Mushroom Soup (store brand), and a table spoon of sour cream. I used 3\\4 cup of canned corn and canned carrots to mix with ground beef. Instead of garlic clove, i substituded garlic powder. I also added dried french onion soup mix and pepper to season. My family ate it all. Wish i had made a bigger dish."
