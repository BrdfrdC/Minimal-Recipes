"reviewBody": "This was great! Super refreshing meal that ended up being more like a salad. \n\nMy bag of frozen shrimp came as 12oz, so I used the whole bag. I also swapped jalapeños for the serranos since that's what I had on hand. \nI marinated the shrimp in raw lime juice for 4 hours hoping it would fully acid cook, but it didn't quite make it, so I ended up tossing shrimp and lime into a sauté pan for just about 3 minutes to warm through.\nMade a quick avocado mash with garlic and lime juice to spread on the bottom, then tossed the ceviche across the top.\nAte with some Taco Bell Fire flavored Doritos that were somewhat disappointing as chips but worked well as quasi-croutons."
