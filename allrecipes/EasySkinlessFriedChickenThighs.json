Most importantly only fried for 15 minutes. Past that, they would’ve been burnt. Served w bbq sauce. But gravy and mashed potatoes would’ve been great!"

I did as most everyone else &amp; doubled all ingredients as I didn’t think a half cup of flour would go very far. I dropped them in flour first, then egg &amp; then in the bag of flour. They had a great crust. Don’t turn too much or you’ll lose the tasty crust!! Family was pleased!!!"

Just make sure you season the meat before coating with batter for more flavor. I used skinless chicken thighs the first time and chicken tenderloins the second. Thanks for the recipe."

"reviewBody": "Quick weeknight dinner. I doubled the flour mixture but not the salt; it came out without enough salt! I ate mine with ranch dressing. We liked it! Oh yeah, another thing - our chicken was boneless as well, so it had quite a bit of surface area and it wasn't as thick, so in 20 min it was quite ready... I took the first batch out after 16 min and finished it in a 350 degree oven turned down to 250. The chicken was done; we like our chicken well done!"

So instead of 1 teaspoon of salt I doubled just like everything else. Well I should have put 1 1/2 teaspoon instead and it would have been perfect. Other than that is so easy and delicious."
