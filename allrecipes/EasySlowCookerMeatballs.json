"reviewBody": "It tasted fine. The meatballs were very moist from slow cooking all day, which I liked, but the downside is all the fat from the meat stays in the sauce, where when I bake them some of that drains away….so not very heart healthy. The recipe is definitely missing salt, in the sauce and the meatballs. The sauce was not to my taste, but my husband loved it. It was very runny which is not surprising since all the steam runs right back in while it cooks in a slow cooker so it does not thicken like on the stove. I added cornstarch in the end to thicken it up."

A teaspoon or two of Italian seasoning should be added. Also a teaspoon of sugar added to the sauce to cut the acid of the tomatoes. Also suggest some parmigiana cheese, grated, to add flavor to the sauce. Increase the amount of garlic. Just my opinion."

The sauce didn't change much in flavor for a really long time but after it crossed the 8 hour mark the flavor got a lot deeper and meatier. I will use this recipe on repeat for dinner at the end of the day. The only change I made to the recipe was that I used half italian sausage and half ground beef instead of all ground beef. And i definitely wouldnt take it out before 8 hours"

I had 2 pounds of ground beef and didn't feel like dealing with fresh parsley or garlic so I used dried. I used the recommended amount of bread crumbs plus a bit more. I followed another reviewers suggestion for freezing them and throwing them in the crock frozen since I was going to cooking them longer than the recommended time. I didn't have the tomato puree but did have a little extra spaghetti sauce. I did season my sauce with garlic powder and Italian seasoning and found the sauce very flavorful. Will definitely make these again."

Parmesan to the meatballs, I reduced the bread crumbs to 1/2 c., and I put the onion in the sauce and cut them in large chunks. For the sauce, I removed the tomato puree, added 2 minced garlic cloves, basil, oregano and 2 T. sugar. I made them into about 30 meatballs, baked for 15 minutes at 350F to cut the fat, and refrigerated until the next morning, removing any remaining fat. My slow cooker runs hot, so these probably would have been done in 4-6 hours. The nutrition facts are deceiving since they're based one one meatball. Who eats one meatball? Not me! :-)"

"reviewBody": "These meatballs were really easy to make, except for the part of grating the onion. It took quite a while to do that and I finally gave up and just finally chopped the remaining onion. Are used a jar of high-quality spaghetti sauce (Organica Bella marinara) and a 28 ounce can of mashed tomatoes. That was more than enough sauce. It needed more seasoning so I added about a teaspoon of fennel seeds and at least one and a half tablespoons of oregano and some salt and pepper. Turned out great. The meatballs stayed together nicely with the amount of breadcrumbs the recipe called for. I probably would not have used that many breadcrumbs if I had made it up myself, but this amount is good. I would definitely make this again."

I add a little parmesan to the mixture, not alot since we add more before eating. I also broiled the meatballs for few minutes until brown prior to placing in slow cooker (I've also pan fried /seared etc.. but this takes longer) . I prefer the texture that the oven or pan frying gives you over the soft mushy texture from cooking straight from the Crock-Pot. I'm not a chef by a long shot but trying recipes here and there, tweaking a little or a lot it seems, this is the recipe we come back to. Thanks"

I did not make any changes to the recipe other than crafting \"Italian\" breadcrumbs by using Panko breadcrumbs and salt, garlic salt, pepper, basil, and oregano. I used ground sirloin 90/10. Made an extra 1/2 recipe and cooked for 7 hours. This maxed out my 6 qt crockpot - although could swap more meatballs for sauce, unless you want sauce for pasta. Will definitely make again!"

"reviewBody": "I bought a lb of ground beef. Then, decided I'd like slow cooker meatballs and searched the site. I read comments and decided to saute onions, green pepper, and garlic plus add seasonings. Then, I decided that it wouldn't be good to add hot vegetables to the jeat mixture as it would cook the egg. I soaked the bread crumbs in some milk. I added raw onions, formed the mixture into balls, and browned in the sauce pan along with the vegetables. I didn't want to put raw meat into the sauce. The sauce is leftover jarred spaghetti sauce and an 8 oz can if diced tomatoes plus seasoning. To that I added the meatballs and sauteed vegetables. It says cook six to eight hours. As mine were partially cooked and looked done, I cooked for 3.5 hrs, I think. In any case, they were thoroughly cooked. I never have any luck with meatballs. I'll call these a success and will make them again. It's nice to cook sans oven and without watching meatballs overcook in a fry pan. I didn't make pasta but served with good bakery bread. We're it for a family, idcook spaghetti and shave parmesan cheese on top. Maybe, I'd add fresh, sauteed mushrooms and more green pepper. I spiced with chili flakes as reviewers complained of a bland sauce."

Really couldn't be easier to make, and it was nice to have this ready to go at dinnertime. I made smaller meatballs, so I cooked them less time, obviously. This recipe is nice because you can season the sauce and meatballs any way you like and just use this recipe as a guide for cooking them in the slow cooker, which is great and something that I would've never thought to do! I will def be making these again~YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)"
