I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so used a dry packet pork gravy mix (only thing I had in my pantry) and added a little water when whisking with beef broth. We served over egg noodles. Only cooked on low for 3 hours. Was even better then second day."

The only thing I changed was that I used golden mushroom soup so I was able to use less broth I also used a full cup of sour cream. I made extra so I would have some for over egg noodles tonight. 2 meals from 1 slow cooker easy recipe"

Also, I doubled the recipe with 1 lb of ground pork and 1 lb of ground beef. The meatballs were a little dense, but very tasty. I might try using an egg with each pound of meat next time."

The sauce was kinda thin so I added 1/4 tsp of cornstarch in the last 30 minutes. I would hold off on adding the salt next time since thereâ€™s already salt in a lot of the other ingredients. Just salt to taste at the end."

It seems like itâ€™s already done after only 2 and a half hours"

"reviewBody": "Meatballs. It was good, but NOT what my grandmother who immigrated from Sweden or my relatives there, make when we visit. Swedish meatballs are not the same as commercially prepared meatballs for sale. The seasonings in this recipe don't completely reflect what makes meatballs, well, Swedish. One of the seasonings is Grillkrydda, which isn't easily found here in the US. Allspice can be used as a substitute. Worschestire sauce and steak sauce aren't flavors that are found in authentic recipes, either. Bottom line. This is a good-tasting recipe, but please don't call them Swedish!"
