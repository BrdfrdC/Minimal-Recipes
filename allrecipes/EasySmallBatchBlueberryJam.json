You will know when it is ready (thick enough) when you pull your spatula across the bottom of the pan and it takes a second or two for the mixture to fill in the bottom of the pan. Also, I didn’t mash the blueberries until the very end, and did ever so lightly. YUMMY!"

That is easily remedies, just add more or less to your personal taste preference.\nI saw a few comments about doing the upside down method of sealing your jars. This is a very bad idea. This does not always seal properly even though you will think it did, possible and even probably allowing harmful bacteria to enter the jar. Please only use proper canning methods (like a water bath) to seal your jars properly. Yes it is more work but far, far safer for you and your family."

Thanks to a previous reviewer I knew how to gauge proper thickness without relying on the time. Her suggestion of cooking until when stir there’s a delay in the liquid coming together again, enough that you see the pan bottom. Hope this helps someone else. Otherwise, thanks for a simple recipe I will definitely use again."

"reviewBody": "Love this nice simple recipe that makes delicious jam. I want to add the information from another reviewer about prepping the jars. Wash the jars with soap and water and rinse thoroughly. Place in a large deep pot and fill the pot and jars with water. Bring to a boil and allow to simmer vigorously for 15 minutes. Turn off and leave jars in the water until ready to fill. At the same time place the lids in a small saucepan and arrange so they are not stuck together. Cover with a couple inches of water and bring to a boil for 15 minutes. Set metal tongs in the pan. This can all happen while berries are cooking. The idea is that the jars and everything touching the jam is as sterile as possible. This will avoid any of the mishaps you sometimes hear about home canned food."

"reviewBody": "I made this jam twice, doubling the recipe each time. I used 8 cups of berries and puréed them in the food processor for a few seconds until the berries were chunky, but broken down. \nThe first time I made this recipe, I cooked it too long in an attempt to reach that magic jam setting temperature of 105 Celsius. It turned out too thick and too sweet for my liking. It’s still useable, but I wanted a softer set with the blueberry taste at the forefront, not the sugar. \nThe second attempt I was much more successful. I paid more attention to the time and cooked it for just 25 minutes, heeding the advice of other reviewers. It was exactly perfect. Just what I was looking for. I canned three jars and put a fourth in the fridge to enjoy now. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I should also mention that I tried 3 other recipes and have done a side by side taste comparison. My family and I all agree that this is one by far superior."

It thickened well and was done before the 30 minutes but I also had around 3 cups of blueberries instead of 4. I like that you can make it the consistency you want. For those that say it didn't thicken I think they probably did not leave it long enough and you do have to continuously stir so that it doesn't clump in parts and burn. I don't know if the pinch of cinnamon did much to the flavoring but I added it in anyways. I recommend this recipe! Thank you so much!\n\n Side Note: It probably tastes even better with real sugar lol."

It will be great on toast and vegan ice cream. Thank you.\nUpdate: had to come back and edit my review because I just grabbed it out of the fridge to eat plain. So good."

"reviewBody": "I was cleaning out my freezer, and found several packages of frozen blueberries. Blueberries had gone on sale several times this summer and I planned to eat my surplus as a frozen treat. Needless to say, they were obviously forgotten in the depths of the freezer. I was so pleased to find this recipe and made a double batch. It did take a little longer than the recipe specified to thicken up, probably because I used frozen blueberries. I was going to use the ‘line down the middle’ trick one reviewer suggested, but it never got to that point before I took it off the heat. I ladled it into sterile jars, lightly screwed on lids, and turned them upside down. Sealed like a charm! I had a little left over so we could sample this, and it is so good! I followed the recipe, including a bit of cinnamon. Thanks for this recipe; I will definitely be making this again."

I added 3/4 cup of organic cane sugar to 16 cups of fresh organic blueberries and the juice of 1 organic lemon. Not too sweet and definitely not too tart . I canned the resultant jam. Made ~ 80 oz of jam."

I could see if using sweeter berries to use less sugar or more lemon. It turned out great and I made 3 batches. It shrinks a lot and it takes about 30 mins on the stove. And if you pour quickly into canning jars the heat naturally seals them."
