I par boiled potatoes in chicken broth that I drained, then added the potatoes to the sausage mixture to sauté, used the broth to cook the regular rice, the excess broth was added to the sausage and fresh vegetable mixture for the simmer time. Didn't have tomato sauce but used up some fresh tomatoes, worked out well with the broth. Had pepper jack vs mozzarella, hubs really liked it. Was a good meal and easy prep after a long day at work."

I used 3 tsp minced garlic (from jar) and 1 full can of tomato sauce. To add flavor I added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp oregano, a sprinkle of smoked paprika, and a little salt and pepper to the sauce/vegetables. I put the lid on top until broccoli was steamed. I cooked the rice separate and served the dish over rice instead of mixing them together. It has great flavor."

I used basmati so had to cook 18 minutes and added fresh broccoli last 8 minutes. This gave the rice good flavor too. Great 1 pot meal!"

Made brown rice and I am glad I did since I covered to simmer all the other ingredients and it came out super soupy, so the rice would have been mushy if it weren’t brown. Needed some spice since it was rather plain other than the smoked sausage. Still a pretty tasty dish. I did not read any reviews until after I was done, otherwise I would have followed some others and added more spice."

Like everyone else, I cook with what’s in the pantry. I had no mozzarella cheese, so we used grated Parmesan. This was a low effort but tasty meal."

Then cooked the sausage first, (otherwise the garlic gets too charred). Used a slotted spoon to remove the smoked sausage once it was browned. Added the (fresh) pepper and onions to the oil for 7 minutes, sprinkled kosher salt to taste. Added the (fresh) broccoli and garlic, for an additional 2 minutes. Added the tomato sauce (with salt) and the water to the skillet for 2 minutes, returned the sausage with the cooked rice to the skillet and mixed everything together. Sprinkled with cheese and YUM!! (I think cooking things separately, adding kosher salt to the veggies while they cook and using salted tomato sauce fixes the bland flavor problem)"

The result: it was still bland! Next time I will cooked the rice in the chicken broth, skip the tomato sauce and use Rotel Diced Tomatoes and Jalapeños to kick it up!! I will also added Louisiana seasoning to the garlic, sausage, pepper and onion mixture."

"reviewBody": "This dish was pretty good, but of course I made changes. First, I used Johnsonville roasted garlic turkey sausage because it’s what I had at home. I used the 15 oz can of contadina Italian and herbs tomato sauce instead of the 1/2 cup of regular sauce and minced garlic instead of crushed. I used a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables (red peppers, yellow peppers and onions) and the baby broccoli florets. I followed the regular instructions, but added pepper, garlic powder, seasoning salt and crushed red peppers for seasoning. I used shredded Colby jack cheese, but don’t really know how much."

I did what another commenter did however, and used all fresh vegetables, doubled the tomato sauce and used a mix of jasmine rice and basmati rice made fresh rather than instant. I didn't layer however, but once I put the cheese on I popped it into the oven for a quick few mins on high broil to really melt the cheese and get a bit of a brown going on. My husband loved this dish, and devoured three bowls before I could finish my one, lol it was absolutely delicious! It does need a little something, he says hot sauce though I don't like hot sauce, but something like that just for that extra little punch of flavour. This is definitely a new favorite, thank you!"

I added the garlic after the sausage and veggies were almost done as to not burn it. Added a little black pepper. It was quite good. It was reminiscent of a Cajun dish so I added Louisiana hot sauce when it was served. It was tasty. I would make it again."

No cheese. My 16 and 18 yr olds cleared their plates. :)"
