The Cilantro is an absolute must have for this recipe! Then, I'm gonna use the cooking suggestions in the other reviews. I'm gonna accompany it with Black Beans flavored with onion and Andouille sausage and some beef and cheese Quesadillas with homemade salsa. Should be a great supper!"

Cover and turn to the lowest setting for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, turn off the heat, fluff the rice with a fork, recover and let sit covered for 10 minutes."
