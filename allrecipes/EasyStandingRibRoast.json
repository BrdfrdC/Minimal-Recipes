It took longer to cook than anticipated, and was over 170 degrees when checked with a thermometer. I thought that it might be overcooked, but was nice and pink inside. It was delicious and perfect."

"reviewBody": "Best ever way of making standing rib roast. Usually I use the first two ribs of the small end of the roast with the rib cut and tied back. For medium rare I will be oven on 500° for 30 minutes. Then turn off and leave it sit for about two hours and then heat to 375° for 30 minutes."

When I returned from Christmas Eve service I had to put it on the grill to finish as I needed the oven for a pie. My grill baked 2 turkeys in roasting pans at Thanksgiving so I knew it would be no trouble with this roast. Perfection!"
