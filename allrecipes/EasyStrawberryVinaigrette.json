I‚Äôd like to give a special shout out to the ‚Äúindividual‚Äù that gave this great recipe 3/5 stars for the reason below: I used frozen blueberries and added a chive. The taste was there but it turned into ice cream had to add water. Next time I'll thaw whatever fruit I'm using. You basically rewrote the recipe and blamed someone else for your stupidity. Who does that? You probably leave your shopping cart in the lot too."

"reviewBody": "I'll be using frozen strawberries next time and trying that. I used fresh strawberries and it came out a little frothy. I think by freezing the berries, it collapses the cellular structure of the berry when it thaws, making them more smooth when they blend up. Sweet, tangy and kind of thick. I tossed it with fruit salad, nuts, spinach - really good!"

I also used fresh strawberries, weighing them out and used 10 ounces. I didn't have apple cider vinegar so used the raspberry blush vinegar I did have. I blended it for a really, really long time and it did not separate by the time we served it several hours later. It was totally awesome!!!"

Using this over arugula, bacon, blackberry, and gorgonzola salad. Bonus- the kids love it too! It's nice to use nutritious, vitamin-packed dressing for them! Super fast and easy to make in the blender."

Caveat; frozen berries needed an allowance for some thaw time- even though my berries were cut slices, they were cold enough they made an 'ice cream' consistency. Glad I made the dressing first; after prepping salad greens I still had to wait a bit for the dressing because I didn't want to dilute the flavor."
