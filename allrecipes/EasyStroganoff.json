Its a recipe that you would make as an \"everyday meal to get by\" but its DEFINITELY not a dish you would make for an occasion. The taste is very bland and general, there is no real outstanding feature that makes it memorable. Also, the ratio of pasta to meat is way off, there is too much pasta and not enough meat."

The meat itself was seasoned well, but once everything was mixed together, there was a lack of flavor, more of like a Hamburger Helper-type dish. It could have used a few more ingredients, such as wine, Dijon mustard, parsley and/or onion. I ended up adding quite a bit of fresh-cracked pepper and salt to give it some flavor. I also ended up doubling the meat and the ratio was perfect."

I cooked onion with the hamburger and even used more garlic powder and seasoned salt. I dumped the soup into the hamburger mixture because I thought it would combine easier, and it did, and then I poured that into the noodles. I'll use way less noodles if I make this again. Too many noodles, not enough meat."

I sautéed the mushrooms, onion, and garlic then add the seasonings, Worcestershire, a beef bullion cube, and soups. Last I add the dairy. I do half sour cream and half greek yogurt for more of a tang. For topping (for looks) add rough chop of fresh flat leaf parsley! Taste like it took hours to make. But from start to finish, took me 45 minutes. I also brown the meat while sautéing the veggies. Time saver but does use another pan. Hope this helps someone. Enjoy!!!!!"

I made the following alterations: skimped on the Worcestershire, (hubby doesn’t care that much for it) added onion powder, a splash of red wine, and a tsp of Beef flavor Better than Bouillon to beef while cooking. I used 1/2 c sour cream and 1/2 c Fage plain non-fat Greek yogurt. We served it over cauliflower rice which was browned in a dry, non-stick pan with Trader Joe’s Everyday Seasoning. Next time I will make less saucy by either only using one can of soup OR by reducing/omitting the milk. Will definitely make again since it was easy and tasty!"

"reviewBody": "Wow! I just made this for dinner, and it was a hit even with my almost 2 year old! I'm a vegetarian so I substituted the ground beef with soy crumbles. I read through many reviews before making the meal. First, I browned the \"ground beef\" in about 1-2 TBS of butter with chopped onion and chopped crimini mushrooms and the garlic. I quickly added regular salt (only half tsp) and double the Worcestershire sauce (2 TBS). I then added only one mushroom soup (stock up at Trader Joes) and then 1 cup of vegetable broth to the pan. Finally, I added almost the whole container of light sour cream (16 oz). I set that on low until the egg noodles were done, and a few minutes before the egg noodles were done I added frozen green peas to the pot. Drained the noodles and placed back in pot. Slowly mixed in the sauce. Delicious."

I substituted the beef for ground turkey and seasoned it while it was cooking with more Worcestershire sauce than the recipe called for, chopped onions, seasoned salt, black pepper, minced garlic and garlic powder. After I drained the noodles, I tossed with a little butter and then used only one can of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup milk, omitted the mushrooms because I don't like them and used about 3/4 cup sour cream and threw in some cooked mixed vegetables. When it was done, I tasted it and immediately added more black pepper, garlic powder and a healthy coating of adobo. Only then did it taste like something I would serve. When my boyfriend tasted it, he threw in more adobo, black pepper and garlic powderbefore eating a large portion. For me to have to add so much salt to something wh en I detest using salt is unacceptable. I won't this again"

When it was all warmed through, I added only one can of mushroom soup and used reserved beef boulion from the noodles that I cooked instead of water or milk. I also added a little more worchester sauce when I added the noodles to the pan of beef. I let all heat through, put it in a big bowl and tossed the sour cream in. It was very close to the slow cooker stroganoff that I love to cook but just didn't have the time this time around."

I did use skim milk (because that is all we drink) and 98%fat free cream of mushroom soup (again that is what we use) and light sour cream so that may have made a little difference in the lack of richness in flavor. I also added some peas like I always do with stroganoff and some black pepper just to give it a little more flavor. But over all a good recipe."

Added that to the ground beef with about a cup of water. And then went on to simmer all other ingredients. It was definitely a favorite! It sure made a lot too!\n\nI added the sour cream in at the last minute and mixed it all together in a VERY large Tupperware container so it would be ready to be put into the fridge since there was so many leftovers! Great recipe!"

Very good though. I sauteed fresh mushrooms in a little butter with a clove of garlic and added those towards the end of simmering. I also cut the seasoned salt down and added a splash of white wine. Served it over white rice instead of with egg noodles. Yummy :)"

"reviewBody": "This is one of my husband's favorite recipes! I changed almost everything in it, but I followed the basic outline. I substituted ground turkey for the beef, rotini for the egg noodles, and 2 cups fat free yogurt for the sour cream (yogurt gives the stroganoff a bit more tang). I significantly increased the garlic and worcestershire sauce and slightly increased the seasoned salt. I left out the mushrooms and reduced the milk. I think my changes make the recipe a bit healthier and more flavorful. Make sure you cook the meat with the seasonings instead of adding them after you brown it so that the meat takes on their flavor."
