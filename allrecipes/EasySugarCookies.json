I shaped it into walnut sized balls and put it in the oven. When I took them out they were still thick and I could barely even pick them up without them crumbling. They didn‚Äôt taste like anything. I added more salt and 4 tablespoons of butter. The things I added helped with making the dough moist and overall better. If you do end up making this recipe I recommend you add more butter, an extra egg, or more salt."

I only used 5 cups of flour. I added 1 cup of brown sugar 2 cups of sugar. A teaspoon of cinnamon 1teaspoon of almond extract 1 cup of pecan chips. Only cooked it for 8 minutes. As regular sugar cookies I have no doubt the recipe will turn out delicious."

I loved that you don‚Äôt have to change anything in the recipe for it to work. What I loved the most about this recipe is that it‚Äôs so easy and quick that my 2.5 year old can truly be part of the process!! It‚Äôs such a wonderful bonding experience. Many ‚Äúquick‚Äù recipes ask you to chill the dough for an hour, or that you add many more ingredients, or that you roll the dough in a fancy way. All of that starts being too complicated for a toddler."

"reviewBody": "Made this after reading a ton of reviews, made sure my butter was extremely soft and ended up with a dough that was very shaggy and requires lots of compressing with my hands to get in to balls. Once in the oven they never spread. I checked after the longest length time and they were still raw. I cooked them an additional 5 minutes to get them cooked enough but by that point they were all burned on the bottom. I won‚Äôt be making this recipe again. I consider myself a semi professional baker as far as cookies and pastries go and there isn‚Äôt enough liquid in this dough as written. It needs less flour and another egg or a tablespoon of milk to get the proper consistency. The dough is also very bland. If I were try again I would sub half the white sugar for brown, cut the flour by half a cup and add either a half an egg or tablespoon of milk. Good luck bakers!"

Once I started adding the dry mixture to my wet ingredients, yes it can look as if it is crumbly, I continued to beat and did the rest with a wooden spoon. The batter is so smooth and perfectly moist. I didn't need to wet my hands prior to rolling, they rolled out perfectly without leaving a sticky mess on my hands. The first batch I baked for about 9 minutes, they are crispy and moist. I like a chewy cookie so the next batch I will try at 6 1/2 minutes. Either way this is the perfect sugar cookie!"

I followed the directions, but I didn't have vanilla, and I used margarine instead of butter. I dont have a mixer, so I left 1 cup of margarine out for a couple hours to get soft, and it mixed well with a fork. The leftover dough I wrapped in plastic wrap, and put in the fridge. I Google that, should stay good a few days, and freeze if you need longer, which I won't, I'll bake the rest today or tomorrow. People complaining must not have followed the simple directions, because like I said, im new to baking and following the simple instructions came out great. My roommates liked them too, one even asked me to show him how to do it."

( unsalted butter tastes the best ) make sure to seperate dry ingredients from wet ingredients or it will all be messed up! i hope these help and heres a pic of the cookies i just made!"

Also, a tip, I noticed people saying the creaming of butter and sugar was too crumbly, and what I did to fix that/avoid it was I would beat the two then fold it to smooth out the separation with a fork. Repeat this until smooth and it works just fine. Overall good easy recipe!"

"reviewBody": "These are indeed Easy Sugar Cookies as their name asserts. I have made them many times, and everyone loves them. Plus, I have had some fun tinkering around with the ingredients. For one batch, I abandoned a traditional family recipe we call Santa Cookies, a shortbread cookie with crushed red and white peppermint candies mixed in that we leave out for Santa, hence the name. While my daughter loved the crushing process, this recipe had its drawbacks. Instead, this year, we used the Easy Sugar Cookies recipe, replacing ¬æ cup of the sugar with the same amount of peppermint candies (about 25 candies) powdered in a mixer instead. No one likes this loud process. However, the result was so much better, and Santa approves! Tip: I cover the top of the mixer with cling wrap before putting the lid on to contain the candy dust, and I process the candies well before I plan on using it to allow the dust to settle."

As someone who doesn't like overly sweet cookies these are fantastic.i am a baked and bake professionally I'm not giving a 5 star because I do have some tweaks. I had to cut out a decent amount of flour when making these because I realized as I was adding it that it would of made the cookies overly dry. I also want to note that you have to watch these cooking. They cook longer than the specified time which is fine but they can easily be over baked too. The first tray ended up being slightly over baked but I myself don't mind a slightly crisp cookie. I wouldn't give these out to anyone though. I watched the second tray very close and caught them before they over baked but it's pretty much a matter of seconds that can make a difference. I will make again and tweak things a bit but great starting recipe"

I popped them in the oven and then (lol) started reading the reviews. Of course focusing on the ‚Äúbad‚Äù ones. But this is what I found out. I followed everything as spelled out above. But I think the problem could occur if one isn‚Äôt mindful of a couple things. 1) make sure your temp is 375 (NOT 350, as a lot of recipes use 350F) and 2) I started with the 8 mins but they did not look right so I did 3 more mins watching closely and checking. Still felt they were not ready so I did 3 more mins, and what VOILA! So I‚Äôm not sure if that might help somebody but those 2 things made for a decent and good cookie to give to Santa (and eat). MERRY CHRISTmas!!!! Just give it extra time but monitor them. Hope these turn out for you."

Though, there was one little problem. I followed all of the things listed in the recipe, but the dough turned out really crumbly. I added some milk to bind it together, and it worked. But, it got really sticky, so I just put oil on my hands to make it easier to roll in balls. I didn't except it to turn out this wonderful, but it did! I can't wait to make another batch for Christmas next year! (Also, if you are using salted butter just make sure that you add a bit more sugar than you would have, so it doesn't make the cookies salty.)"

I switched to mixing by hand with a spoon and it magically changed to regular cookie dough. (Same idea as how others say they kneaded the dough). If I use this recipe again I will experiment with less baking soda since I could taste it in the cookies. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm only giving 3 stars. I will actually try another recipe first that doesn‚Äôt use 1/2 lb of butter. Not because I don‚Äôt like using butter, I love butter! But because right now it‚Äôs $9/lb here! I used my convection setting and the texture was perfect."

Turned out just as wonderful as always!! Love these cookies!! I softened my butter in the microwave then used a mixer for all the liquid ingredients till it was smooth. After adding the dry ingredients I kneaded the dough till it was no longer flaky. Maybe that's why others are having such difficulty. Merry Christmas!!"

It looked terrible to me, because the dough rose up through the filling and became a top layer. It was an interesting look but the pie was moist and yummy. I would suggest anyone wanting to try this, to bake at a lower temperature and prebake the crust about 10 minutes before adding your pie filling. I am thinking of making a cherry pie next with this crust. YUMMY"
