I always have apples on hand that need to be used and I'll also add anything else starting to ripen too much: berries, plums, pears. Along with almond extract, nutmeg, ginger and slivered almonds. I really like the cookie-ish crust. I cut the amount of butter some to save my arteries. But the more butter, of course, the more delicious."

Used half white and half brown sugar. Also I hate pies where the apples are still firm so I baked my apples for about 15 minutes before adding the topping and then baked as directed. The apples were nice and tender but not mushy. If you like your apples a little firm then don’t bake them first. This was a nice easy recipe and I would make again."

Delicious as-is, but I often will add some nutmeg and allspice, or in a hurry a few shakes of Penzey's pie spice, just to spruce it up a little bit. But you can't go wrong with apple, cinnamon, and sugar! And the crush is kind of like a big cookie... Mmm!"

Otherwise the recipe is made as is stated. The only thing that I had reservations about was the topping. The first time I made the pie, I didn't know how to put the topping on the apples. It is easiest to take spoonful's of the topping and place it on top of the fruit. Then I use a pastry knife to spread it evenly (as possible) over the apples. It will form the \"crust\" as it cooks. The slice holds it's shape, even though there is not a bottom crust to hold the slice together! Delicious! Not to sweet, but not tart either!"

But maybe it is not needed as that layer turned out with very little sauce, maybe the pie crust is meant to soak it up?"

"reviewBody": "I have made this multiple times now, family requests, and will continue to make. Easy and reminds me of apple dumplings but not as much work. I do add cloves &amp; nutmeg and sometimes add raisens or craisens . It makes a little sauce if you add a few spoonsfull of water or apple cider over the apples before adding the topping. This is a keeper. Great served with vanilla ice cream or warm with milk poured over it. YUM YUM"

I used only one Granny Smith apple and the rest were a red apple variety so I could have cut back on the sugar. I baked it for 45 minutes and the filling was still juicy and the crust was still soft. It did run over the pie plate into the oven so next time I will put something under it. The taste of the original recipe was fine for me but I might try the changes suggested the next time I make it and I will definitely make this again!"

"reviewBody": "This Is my first time I have stopped to rate a recipe. I have been told I make the best apple pie that they have tasted. But this recipe is equal to my best apple pie if not better. I did follow the recipe 99% as the recipe called for. The only thing I did as other Reviewers suggested was I added an extra quarter teaspoon of cinnamon to the 1 teaspoon, 2 teaspoons would of taken away of the apples it would of been too much of a cinnamon taste instead of complementing the apples. I also just soften the butter instead of melting it and I added a good half a cup of chopped pecans to it to give it an extra texture. So instead of pouring the topping on I was able to Pat and cover all the apples dealing in the juices. The pie came out perfect. To cut some calories without any sacrifice of taste, I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of Splenda brown sugar then a good pinch of regular dark brown sugar as I used 7 Granny Smith apples. I have an automatic apple peeler, corer n slicer . I make so many apple desserts and applesauce , it is a must in my kitchen. Judi Hill Port Charlotte FL"

This tastes like a wonderful apple pie without making a traditional crust with all it's the mess! I used the bowl I mixed the apple slices in to also beat up the batter (after pouring apple slices into the greased pie dish),easier clean-up! The crust was a little thick, so dollop it on then spread, but the heat evens it all out. It comes out sweet and slightly crunchy YUM! It is definitely a sweet dessert, but my tart apples needed that!"

It turned out absolutely wonderful...my apples were very tart, so depending on the taste of future pies I might suggest that more sugar be added to the apples themselves. \n My biggest surprise was that after the pie cooled when cut it hung together very well while removing it from the glass pie dish.\n\n AWESOME RECIPE!!!!!"

Next time (and there will be a next time) I will either add a bit more sugar or include other sweeter apples in with the tart apples."

The first time I made it the apples practically disintegrated, so I cut them a little thicker the second time. I also spread the topping so that it didn't go all the way to edge. This kept it from getting too thin, hard and brown right at the edge. My search for the perfect apple dessert is over."

This pie was just as delicious if not more so than a regular apple pie. I ran out of flour while I was mixing the batter, and all I had was some apple cinnamon muffin mix. I ended up using about 1/2 cup of the muffin mix and 1/2 cup flour, but it actually turned out very well. Highly recommend this recipe."

If you prefer a crunchy crust you cook it a little longer but be careful not to overcook it because then you'll end up with a crust that is too hard and you can't blame it on the recipe if that happens. I added 1/2 tsp more of cinnamon and decided to include 1/2 tsp each of cloves and nutmeg to spice it up a bit. The results were delicious. This pie is so easy to make that it's practically fool proof. Try it and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised that something so tasty can also be so easy."
