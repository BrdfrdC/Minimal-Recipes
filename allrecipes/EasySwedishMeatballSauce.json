"reviewBody": "We love Swedish Meatballs from Ikea, however they tend to make the tummy hurt. I made these for my kids and my one son came downstairs and said, \"What's in this sauce, did you make it from scratch or was it bought?\" I said, \"Why? You don't like it?\" and he said, no, it's actually really awesome! So for that, it will be a regular dish in our house. Easy to make and delicious! I did take the advice of another reviewer and added about a 1/4 cup of sour cream since I had to double the recipe due to the size of my family. Low heat did take a bit longer than I wanted to thicken the recipe, so I used medium-high heat."

"reviewBody": "It was satisfying and delicious! I adjusted the recipe for 1 (one) serving and altered it as such: used water instead of beef stock; used worsterschire sauce instead of soy sauce; used butter, milk and cream cheese instead of heavy cream; used fresh parsley instead of dried rosemary and added it near the end of cooking. The sauce cooked down much quicker than the instructions say, which is due to the reduced amount of used ingredients. So, when the sauce is well incorporated, I suggest adding the frozen meatballs to sauce sooner and letting the sauce thicken while the meatballs cook through. Absolutely tasty!"

Soy sauce is salty so I used Worcestershire instead .. cream, flour , butter , beef broth , &amp; added the frozen beef meatballs.. I pair them with any pasta really .. I usually keep like 4 different kinds and don’t have eggs noodles today. I have this Italian seasoning Blend and fresh pepper . Took no more than 20 mins … I like mine more on creamy side but you can add more water or broth if you’d like ."

The only change is that I usually use frozen meatballs so I heat them in the sauce for about 20 minutes instead of just 5. This is a perfect amount of time to boil some water and cook egg noodles. Great recipe, I make it all the time!"

My meatballs were precooked and heated in the oven before adding it to the sauce. For those questioning 1 tsp of pepper, I started off with 1/2 but ended up using the full tsp. For those questioning the beef broth, why not? Will add this to my rotation. Thank you!"
