Sweet potatoes are already naturally sweet, brown sugar will take it to a different flavor level. I've never seen a recipe ever call for more than 1tsp. cinnamon. Not a big marshmallow fan? Take 5 and place in flower shape, insert pecan in the center. Bake as directed. Old lady who knows how to cook. ;)"
