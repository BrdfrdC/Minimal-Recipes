"reviewBody": "I modified slightly. Didn't have arrowroot so that was missing. Instead of a slab, I took one pie crust instead of two and put on the bottom of individual ramakins. There are 5 of us. I still dusted the bottom with flour but first sprayed with non-stick spray. Used fresh berries rather than frozen. But generally followed all other steps and it was delicious. My family loved it. I didn't use all the crumble topping so saved some of it for a later date."
