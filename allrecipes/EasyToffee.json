It takes the guesswork out if you have cooked it enough. I found 6 minutes in the oven was perfect. If you don’t cook it enough it becomes chewy. Make sure you use a larger bowl at least a 4 Cup size 8 cup bow is better because it does foam up to double the size on the 3rd time. I learned the hard way."

I think it takes all the guess work out of it. Use good chocolate chips! If you use cheap ones they will not melt properly. The one thing I changed was to use milk chocolate. It’s not as rich I think. I just pulled another pan out of the oven. Mmmmm thank you for this recipe! Beats the heck out of spending 2 hours mixing and baking cookies. And everyone I’ve given it to can’t stop eating it!"

I just kept stirring with a heat resistant rubber spatula until I can scrape the bottom of the pot and see the bottom clearly. I also cranked up the oven to 400 degrees and put the poured toffee/cracker trays in the oven for only 5 to 6 minutes. It comes out bubbling! Then I push the crackers back into place, roughly, and sprinkle the chocolate chips all over. Once they are glossy, I spread the chips with an offset spatula. I decorate the top with Christmas colored nonpareils and crushed candy cane on other batches. People loved them! It just took a long time to set and not be sticky on the bottoms. I left my trays out overnight on the cold counter. I made 7 trays of these and got many compliments. It’s hard to resist snacking on them yourself!"

Now it's very easy to spread. \nDoes anyone know how the store it? can it be be sealed and keep in the freezer?"

After spreading them on top of the buttered/sugared crackers, place foil over the top. Wait a minute and the chips will melt from the heat. Use a spatula to spread evenly. Keep refrigerated otherwise the chocolate softens."

I made a whole batch and distributed them as gifts between my three children's teachers for Christmas gifts. Plus, we got to steal some in the process! They have that wonderfully sweet and salty combination and they look great! I don't have a candy thermometer, so when cooking the brown sugar and butter, you only have to cook long enough until it comes to a boil and reaches a \"caramel looking\" color. (A few minutes) Then pour over your crackers."

I melted the butter and brown sugar in the microwave and cooked it until it boiled after that I cooked it for about 2 1/2 minutes. I used ritz crackers instead of saltines. I cooked it for 10 minutes instead of 15, and then cooked for an additional minute after I put on the chocolate chips, to help them melt. I used heath bar bits instead of almond. I broke it into random sized pieces toffee. It was a hit at the party I went to, and was asked for the recipe. I will definitely make again for the next party I go to."

Very cool recipe! Thanks -- p.s. don't have a candy themometer, but followed another suggestion to bring it to a boil and then boil it 2 minutes. Worked great."

My mom used to make something similar to this around Christmas so this served as a great reminder to her recipe. I used white sugar and accidentally put the chocolate chips on top before I baked it, but it still came out great. The new in laws loved it!"

When you cook the brown sugar and butter it is watery - as it heats to the proper temperature it comes together and when you can wipe your spatula across the bottom as you stir, it will separate so that you can see the bottom of the pan. It is hard to describe in typing but once you see it, you will get what I am trying to convey :)"

One mistake I made the first time I made this-- I didn't mix the butter and brown sugar enough and ended up with a buttery/sugary mess that was more separated-- the sugar stayed in the middle and the butter ran along the outer edges of the pan-- still tasted good but wasn't as presentable-- so make sure you mix it until the sugar has completely dissolved. Also... i brought this to a Christmas party and did it in thirds... One third had peanuts on top, one third had walnuts and one third had mini M&amp;Ms... All three combinations were wonderful! ENJOY!"
