Placed tortilla in warm pan, spread olive oil around, and sprinkled garlic salt and Cajun seasoning/Italian seasonings over it. Sprinkled cheese; cheese then pepperoni; cheese then a lot more cheese onto different \"pizzas\" using alfredo sauce, Marinara sauce, both sauces at once. One pizza I added some fresh Romano/Parmigiano. I used the dinner plate sized tortillas. Sliced into 8 worked best! We all ate great with a few slices leftover for lunch -- Dad's lunch! Overall, very inexpensive, easy and tasty. My boys suggested that we don't need to order pizza anymore!"

We use low carb tortillas, and instead of heating the tortillas in the oven, we char them on our gas stove top burner for a half minute or so per side. Then we put the sauce and toppings on and finish in the oven. I checked out this recipe primarily to compare the time and temperature used. Basically the same as ours, but I like the idea of seasoning the tortilla before browning in the oven!"

Make sure you poke some holes in the tortilla so it doesn't bubble up. This is perfect for me as I love lots of veggies on mine and my hubby only likes meat. Now I don't have to buy a whole separate pizza that I can't eat by myself."
