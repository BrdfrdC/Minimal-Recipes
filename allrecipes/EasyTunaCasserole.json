A great recipe for an inexperienced cook just getting started or an experienced cook who knows what flavors they personally like. After reading some of the comments, I added a cup and a half of frozen peas. I also added some garlic powder and onion powder. Also, about half a cup of milk. Can't go wrong with this recipe! 5 stars if you like a bland tasting casserole. I had to jazz mine up a little bit. The french=fried onion rings on top make this delicious."

I used 4 generous cups of cooked egg yolks pasta, 2 tuna cans, 1 can of chicken cream (low salt), 1 can of mushroom cream (low salt), 1 large tablespoon Dijon mustard, 2 large mayo tablespoons, about 3/4 cup half &amp; half, celery salt, Italian seasoning, cumin, garlic powder, salt &amp; pepper, added a bunch of three cheddar mix and finally, topped with bread crumbs, and pizza mozza. 25 min. in oven. Then topped up with more breadcrumbs and crispy fried onions. Now trying not to eat the whole pan in one sitting!!!"

Husband liked it and daughter came in from work, took a bite, and said this is really good! I know substitute crackers, chips or whatever but I think the fried onion rings was the magic. Also the recipes didnt say anything about green peas but the picture showed green peas so I added a handful of frozen green peas to the mix. Saving the recipe. \n\nI had bought the fried onions rings specifically for this recipe and they should have been fresh; they weren't. I put them in the oven in a separate pan while the casserole was cooking so they 'crisp up' somewhat. They weren't as crisp as I wanted them but the taste was still really good."

"reviewBody": "I’m not fond of tuna casserole but I will say this recipe is the best I have ever had and everyone loved it. Although I did feel it was a little dry so next time I will add a little milk with the soup. I will definitely cook this again. I was looking for low potassium recipes as my husband has kidney disease and this one came up and I’m so glad I found it."

Everyone at the potluck liked it. Next time I'll add garlic salt and pepper to the soup mixture and use cream of chicken, cream of mushroom, and cream of celery. I think that will give it more flavor. Four stars because it's a starter recipe."

WhenI followed the recipe - only substituting ingredients that I had in the cupboard, mushroom soup for chicken, it was very disappointing. The following night when I added milk and reheated the leftovers in a double boiler it was much better. If I make this again I will add the milk at the beginning."

Super easy! The only thing I added was one bag of frozen peas and carrots (I cooked them first) so I could get more veggies into the kids, lol. One of my kids said how much they loved the fried onions. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing."

Due to having surgery and recovering I finally found time to find one and LOVE IT!\n\nI followed the recipe to a T with a few little changes. Here is what I did differently:\n\nI used a smaller casserole dish, sprayed bottom and inside with butter spray, mixed everything (macaroni, tuna, soup, 1/2 cup cheese, 1/4 cup frozen peas) in a big plastic favorite bowl. Next I put mixed ingredients in dish, added 1/2 cup cheese on top then baked for 25minutes.\n\nThe last thing I did was put total of 3/4 cup of Fried french onions on top and baked 5 minutes.\n\nBest Tuna Casserole dish I've tasted in years! The smile on my Dads face when he was eating was PRICELESS! ?"

Divvying up one can of tuna, soup and just 3 cups of macaroni would be skimpy servings for just 4 good eaters unless you add salad and a couple of side dishes to boot."
