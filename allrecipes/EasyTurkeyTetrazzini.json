"reviewBody": "This IS incredibly easy for a tetrazzini dish- I had it prepared in no time. I eliminated the mushrooms because of personal taste. Because tetrazzini is one of our favorite dishes, it is not fair to compare this side-by-side with a more complex recipe; therefore, I can say only that I found this to have too little sauce for the noodles. By the time they are baked, you have a very heavy noodle dish that has little taste. You also have the possibility that your noodles, will dry up. I have found this to be true more than once. I recommend doubling the sauce component or significantly cutting back on the noodles and baking it in a smaller casserole dish. This is a 3-star as written, and a 4-star once you adjust the ingredients for dryness. I only leave it at 4 because there is very little taste to this and it could benefit from more spicing."

We seasoned with thyme, parsley, celery seed, white pepper, and onion flakes then topped with buttery panko and parm for crunchy topping. Base recipe is good, but make it your own!"

I didn't have egg noodles so I used angel hair pasta. I followed everything as written, it was very tasty but I'm a big caper fan so I added a couple of tablespoons of them. I highly recommend. Wish I had taken a photo but we dug into it as soon as it came out of the oven."

Frankly, this tetrazzini benefits from a few aromatics, so use them if you've got them. Also, other suggestions to add a 1/2 broth is also recommended. Otherwise, outstanding recipe!"

I would have liked it to be more creamy. I did double the recipe and added a can of cream of mushroom, as well as more sour cream. Also, bread crumbs on top with the fresh grated parmesan would have been incredible. Make it your own."

The only tweak I make is using fresh 'shrooms and sprinkle a couple tblsp of red wine in while sauteeing in the butter. Once the wine begins to reduce, I like to put a shallot and chopped clove of garlic in the mix before adding the \"wet\" stuff for the sauce. Total comfort food."

Made this once with smoked turkey - it was really good.\n\nPressure cook on high for 3 min (based on 10 min on the egg noodle packages if using a pot of water). Let natural pressure release for 5 min.\n\nMix in about 1/2 parmesan cheese and sour cream.\n\nTop with 1/2 cup of parmesan then I use the crisper top for the Instant Pot to bake at 375 for 10 to 15 min.\n\nOne pot to clean.

Okay, substitution time! \nSo for the Cream of Celery Soup, Add to the Mushroom flavor by using Cream of Mushroom with Garlic worked great. And as a substitution for the Sour Cream, I really had to think about this one. No Yogurt available without fruit at least, so I decided to use 8oz Cream Cheese. It has the nice tang similar to Sour Cream so I cut it up small, added it in the other hot ingredients and added enough Whole Milk to get to the desired consistency, apx. 1/2 Cup, and mix it all in. IT Tastes Fantastic! I also added a can of drained Peas. This recipe gave me other ideas like instead of using the Noodles, add it to a layer of hot but not fully baked Tater Tots. \nI’m sure the original recipe is delicious but if you are in a bind, like me, give it a try, who knows, you may have a Double Header!"

I reheat my gravy on the stove and then add the cream of celery and sour cream and/or Greek yogurt. I also added some Parmesan and cheddar cheese to the sauce before mixing it with the noodle and turkey. Then topped with more shredded Parmesan."

I think it would turn out better if the noodles were stirred into the sauce instead of placing them on the bottom and pouring the sauce on top. The cooking times were accurate. I actually prefer the Chicken or TurkeyTetrazzini Deluxe on this site, for the flavour."

"reviewBody": "Turkey tetrazzini is a great way to use up Thanksgiving leftovers. I took off a star because this recipe took quite a few changes though. A recipe should work on its own without needing changes. Some of these were necessary, some not, and I didn't want to go to the store to get anything. I swapped cream of celery for cream of mushroom soup, because I used up my mushrooms in Thanksgiving's green bean casserole. It would have been better with the mushrooms though. I also sautéed half an onion, a couple os stalks of celery, and some minced garlic to add more flavor. I knew the recipe as is would turn out dry, so I added an can size amount of broth that I had made from the turkey. Whenever I make noodle casseroles, I don't like mushy bland noodles, so I only cooked them to a bit firmer than al-dente and let them soak up juices in the oven. I had bowtie pasta on hand, but just about any noodle or pasta will work. To use up leftover veggies, I added about a cup each of peas and shredded carrots. We like cheese, so I added all of the parmesan directly into the casserole. After the initial 30 minutes of baking, I topped with shredded mozzarella and bread crumbs and baked another 10 minutes. Great way to use leftovers and clean out the fridge!"

I thought I was doubling the sauce but when I went to make it noticed it was only 8 oz of egg noodles, well I had a full pack that’s 16 oz and proceeded. This wasn’t dry at all. Had to use cheddar instead of Parmesan due to what I had but it was so good. It will likely be a year before I make it again but a great way to use leftovers. Thank you."

"reviewBody": "This was delicious with a few substitutions both out of necessity and to add flavor. I did not have cream of celery. I used cream of chicken and substituted celery salt for regular salt. I sauteed about a cup of a frozen mix of sauteed onion, celery and green pepper (did not need the green pepper). I put 1/2 of the parmesan into the mix along with some mozzarella and put the remaining on top with a mix of 1/2 a sleeve of Ritz crackers. I dotted the top with butter and baked it in a deeper dish. It took approximately 30 minutes to be perfect and soooo yummy. No green pepper next time. Many have commented that this recipe is dry. It could have used a little more moisture. I imagine a cream of mushroom soup added would be perfect."

Thanks to many excellent suggestions to take it to the next level.\nI prepared my sauce first and let it simmer to build the flavours while I did the pasta. Sauteed the mushrooms, onions and then the garlic. Added one can of cream of chicken and one cream of celery and some globs of sour cream. A bit of milk to thin it out just a bit and 2 TBSP sherry. Salt and pepper and 1 heaping teaspoon of poultry seasoning. Added in my 2 cups of chopped turkey and let it simmer while I did the pasta.\nAfter dumping the sauce on the pasta I sprinkled panko on top, finely shredded Parmesan and bit of Asiago. \nBaked at 350º for 30 minutes.

I felt it would benefit from more sauce, while at the same time, I did not want to significantly increase the condensed soup. We also prefer a crunchier topping. So, we add the chopped and sauteed onion, garlic, celery too, a healthy splash of milk (or cream, yum!), some peas, a little extra salt, plenty more pepper, and finally, add Panko tossed with melted butter to the topping. These small changes make the perfect Tetrazzini for us. :) Thank you very much for a great start at an excellent and easy Turkey Tetrazzini!!"

It was so good. We haven't made a turkey, so I bought some turkey breast and am currently roasting it to make this dish. I will be doubling the ingredients this time, using cream of celery soup and cream of chicken soup. I also use about 3/4 to 1 can of milk to help with creaminess. I read other reviews and did that the first time. I make roasted green beans with bacon and onion as a side dish. There were no leftovers last time. Making double to (hopefully) have leftovers this time. With two growing teenage boys, nothing much goes to waste:)"

Simmered for about twenty minutes while I was boiling the pasta and chopping the turkey. I added leftover turkey gravy for the sour cream and forgot the parm but added a splash of sherry per suggestions. Baked at 350 for 25 min then added the last of the FF onions for another 5 minutes.
