I didn't use the whipped version for either, but both batches turned out beautifully. My whole family loved them! I love fudge but frequently don't get it right with regular recipes. This is going to be my go-to from now on. Delicious!"

Works great if you are vegan/have a milk allergy and nut allergies by using a jar of alternative \"butter\" like from soy nuts or sunflower seeds (I used Wow butter) and a dairy-free can of cream cheese frosting (I used a famous brand in the white can that starts with a \"P\"). Turned out great and helps me to not feel too left out during the holidays at the dessert table. It is not meant to be a nutritious daily health food but an occasional much-needed treat."
