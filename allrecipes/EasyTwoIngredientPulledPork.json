I used Sweet Baby Ray’s Sweet Visalia Onion barbecue sauce. I separated the pork a couple of hours before serving time, and then again before serving. The consistency was still great. Everyone went back for seconds, paired with Hawaiian rolls and coleslaw. I don’t think you can mess up this recipe, even if you did, like me. :)"

"reviewBody": "Excellent method- this is exactly the same way I make pulled pork when I’m using the crockpot. Obviously it will only be as flavorful as the BBQ sauce you use, but if you find your finished product bland you can always add some combination of chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, paprika, ketchup, molasses, or apple cider vinegar to doctor it. I prefer to use a cut of pork that isn’t quite so lean."

At the seven hour mark, I ladled/spooned out all the water I could and shredded the tenderloins right in the crockpot. Poured in a bottle of City BBQ's mild sauce (19.5oz), stirred it up, and cooked it for the last hour. It was awesome! Girlfriend complained that it was too finely shredded, but that was my fault: I got carried away at how easy it was to pull apart."

"reviewBody": "I bought a 5 lb. boneless half pork loin. Cut it in 3 pieces and seasoned it with salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder. Put it in the crockpot (tight fit). Added about 1/2 cup water. Covered and cooked on high for 1 hour, then low for 7 hours. It made a lot of gravy/broth that was delicous and I didn't really want to throw it out. So after taking the pork out onto a platter to shred, I emptied the broth into a measuring cup that allows fat to separate. \nI shredded the pork and added back to the crockpot and about a cup of the broth to moisten it a bit. Added a 24 oz bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and cooked together until hot again about 1 hour.\nSimply delicous! It was just enough BBQ sauce to flavor but not over power it. Served it on Hawaiian slider rolls. Yum!\nOnly thing I did differently was add back some of the broth instead of throwing it away. \nWill definitely make again!"

I poured in one can of Coke and added several cloves of garlic to create a marinade sauce, and let it cook on high temp for another few hours. It came out delicious! Next time, I would use less barbeque sauce--I emptied the whole bottle and it overwhelmed the other flavors."

It was potluck Sunday at church and I needed to come up with something. I made the recipe as written and the meat shredded perfectly and was moist and tender. I added the entire bottle of sauce, cooled it and refrigerated it. Sunday morning I put it in a disposable foil pan and covered it with foil and baked at 350 for about an hour. I had people coming up to me saying they heard I had made the pork and to tell me how delicious it was."
