We used Miyoko’s vegan butter in place of coconut oil, and I almost accidentally used blackstrap molasses before realizing that that is not the right kind of molasses for making cookies. I bought some Grandma’s Molasses instead and it tasted just PERFECT!!! I highly recommend this recipe for vegans looking for gingerbread cookie recipes!!!"

I found the dough a little crumbly at 1st but I added more flour and the dough was perfect. I found the dough to be better to cut shapes when thicker as too thin and they fall apart. Once cooked they were so yummy and soft and a big hit!"

"reviewBody": "This dough was a bit challenging to work with as it broke/cracked easily. This recipe only made 10 cookies for me as I needed to leave the dough on the thicker side to keep it from cracking. I would agree with another reviewer who said they might try not chilling the dough at all next time. I love the aftertaste more than the cookie itself but I’m grateful for a vegan recipe!"

"reviewBody": "So I made quite a few substitutions for my dietary needs. First, I used bob's mill 1 to 1 flour, coconut sugar, and blackstrap molasses. The result while making them was a very crumbly dough. But working it with my hands helped soften the coconut oil and make it a very firm dough. Chilling did not help, as I couldn't roll it out without it breaking apart, so I rolled them into individual balls, pressed flat, and cookie cut out. The result was a very dark, only light sweet, and kinda dry cookie. Next time, I will add a little more wet ingredient. But for a first try, it wasn't bad"

"reviewBody": "This was the first time I ever made a vegan cookie! I thought the consistency was great but I will add more spices next time. I couldn’t taste the difference between this and a cookie made with butter. Also the 2 hours of chilling time didn’t do much in my opinion, so next time I will probably only chill if I’m having trouble rolling it out."
