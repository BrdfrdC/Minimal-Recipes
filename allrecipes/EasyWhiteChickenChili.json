To make it thicker I smashed 1 can of beans and shredded my cut up chicken, To kick it up a notch I used 1 can of HOT green chilis. And finally adding a half a brick of cream cheese to make it sinfully good.."

I also made some additions just for flavor. I added more seasoning to taste, cumin, garlic powder, salt, white pepper and Knoll Tomato Chicken Bouillon powder. I also mashed one of the cans of beans for a thickener as well as a little flour for just a slightly thicker chili. Serve with a dollop of sour cream and some tri-colored tortilla strips you find in the produce section for salad toppers. Very delicious!"

So, I added 3 tsp of chili powder, a few shakes of red pepper flakes, and a couple extra pinches of cayenne pepper. I used rotisserie chicken instead of breast. I also only had one can of canella beans so I subbed some pinto and added 1/2 cup instant rice. Also added 1 cup heavy cream (more calories but richer tasting)."

However, I'm always requested to bring it to tailgate parties and this is where the embellishments come in! Double the recipe, quadruple the amount of cumin, add 4 tbsp. Hot chili powder, a cup or two of frozen corn kernels. (I skip cayenne, but do add 2-3 shots of sciracha). Of course, the chili is no longer white, but the flavor is wonderful. This will fill the slow cooker. Other tailgaters wander by, enticed by the aroma. There is never any left."

"reviewBody": "I made this and it was great. I did make some minor adjustments. 5 cups of the broth was perfect . I also cut the chicken into chunks ahead of time, then mixed about half of the seasoning with about 2 tsp of oil to coat the cut up chicken and refrigerated for about an hour. This simplified things as once the chicken was browned I just added the rest of the ingredients. I also added about a cup of diced red bell peppers. One additional can of beans mashed up to thicken the chili as suggested by another reviewer worked well. This is a really good recipe and is very easy to make."

I used rotisserie chicken, 2 cans of white beans, 1 can of green chilies, 1/2 onion, 1 clove garlic, 1 container of chicken broth, 1 tsp. cumin. I added 1/2 cup heavy cream and a can of corn, a squirt of cilatro paste and about 1 cup of cheddar cheese into the soup. It turned out great. I seasoned with herbamare."

But this recipe \"as is\", is a staple in our house.\nPlease, if you change a recipe, DON'T rate it!!!"

The key to making chili is never throw out the juices that come with the beans, just dump them into the chilli! Also great to eat alone with a spoon, without adding any other carbs/fats."
