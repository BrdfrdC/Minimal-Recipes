"reviewBody": "Second year making these and they were just as much a hit as before. Making the cookie is super easy, but the coating is still an issue for me. I microwave melted the white chocolate last year and found it cooled down too quickly. I melted it and kept it on the stove this year and that seemed to work for a bit longer...it still seized up and I had to start with fresh. Next year smaller batches of chocolate and get faster, I guess.\nAlso, milk chocolate seemed to not really set...I have those in the frig. Still yummy though."
