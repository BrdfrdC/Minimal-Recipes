This will be how I make my Filet from now on, no need to grill when they taste this good!"

Then followed the recipe by cooking with the broiler. While that was cooking, I put 1/2C of reduced balsamic vinegar and 1/2C red wine. This cooked with the beef drippings and reduced to half and got quite thick. Once the beef was done, I drizzled the sauce over the top and served it up. Best os two good recipes. Delish!"

"reviewBody": "My husband loved it, but he said you have to like the taste of meat, which he does. There was very little flavor for me, it was very tender and juicy but I like to taste all thelse ingredients. Before someone says I didn't follow the instructions, I assure you I did to the letter, I bought two filets fresh from the butcher, bacon fresh as well. It was cooked perfectly and he enjoyed it very much. I will try again but will add more seasoning as it was quick and exceptionally tender. I will suggest a bit more instruction on boil, every oven has different broil options. For instance the oven I am using has low and high broil whereas my range I am waiting to have installed has specific broil Temps so knowing exactly what temp or broil setting would be helpful for someone who has never cooked filet before. Mine was done perfectly as indicated so I know I used the proper setting."

There were huge flames leaping up from the broiling pan! Thankfully I got the pan out and into the sink without being burned, but the house was completely filled with smoke, set off all the smoke alarms and only improved hours later. Maybe put a warning on the recipe that you need to keep a close eye on them just in case. Not exactly the romantic meal I was hoping for!"

Not having shallots I used garlic powder instead. The filets came out delicious. Steak is my bailiwick and this recipe has saved me. Chef in the Making - you are on your way.\nOh - I did serve it with baked potatoes and pan-fried asparagus (recipe on site) instead of your recommendations - hope you don't mind. Thanks for sharing!!!"

Outstanding.\n\nTo make it a little fancier than the potatoes and veggie our budding Wolfgang suggsted, how about baby carrots steamed just long enough to make them tender, mix a tbl or two of butter and the same of orange marmalade. Mix those up, heat and pour a thin stream over carrots. Pair this up with garlic bread and a Caesar's salad and oh boy, ring a ding ding!"

I do everything just as the recipe says EXCEPT we like it RARE so we only cook it 2-3 min. on each side and we don't use shallots, don't think I have ever had shallots- to be honest, I don't even know what a shallot is! haha The only thing I ask is to ADD MORE RECIPES KID! haha You are AMAZING.

I did however do these a bit differently - I rubbed these with a bit of olive oil but left off the onion powder and chose to use a little minced garlic and kosher salt. I let these come to room temperature and grilled them. It doesn't get any easier or any better than this!"
