Spray your warm muffin tin with non stick spray... Do not use butter spray... It's gross and full of artificial fat and stuff"

"reviewBody": "I make popover all the time. The secret to both rise and stability is heat! Increase the oven temp to 450Â° F. This means putting the buttered (empty ) pan in the preheated oven for just a few minutes (until the butter starts to smoke) and reducing the cooking time to 15 - 20 minutes. The popovers are done when they're golden brown."

These were better than any restaurant popovers we ever tried, and we tried lots of them. Do make sure you butter the inside of the muffin tins with the melted butter. Highly recommend this recipe!!!"

"reviewBody": "For the reviewers that had difficulty I need to edit this recipe to say that the butter should be MELTED and \"brushed\" into the muffin tins, didnt realize I forgot that part until now! That COULD be one reason, also I would say you need to cook longer so they dont fall, that is when I have my biggest issues...we recently moved and our new oven cooks much slower than our previous house so when I make these I have to cook them longer than usual. Good luck! And I only use white flour for these, not sure if you are using a different type?"

But for a pop over I wouldn't do again I like them to stay puffed &amp; crunchy on outside &amp; soft inside..theses ones are just soft."

Dense, didn't rise so much as a centimeter, and were VERY eggy- like spoon bread! :( \n\nI am a very careful measurer, and am very attentive to temperature and all baking aspects. Maybe I literally \"babied\" these to much... I will give these another try, and maybe not be so \"A.R.\" about every part of the process. \n\nIf anyone sees what I did wrong- PLEASE let me know!! I'd love to have your experience as my own!"
