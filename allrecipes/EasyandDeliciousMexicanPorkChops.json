I used chicken broth instead of water, loaded my chops up with Adobo seasoning and a spice mix that we like that's basically a fancy chili powder, and added a chopped jalapeno for some heat. The people who had problems with their rice not getting cooked in time might not have had their pan sealed tightly enough. You really need to crimp that foil on there to keep the moisture in! Mine came out perfectly and I can't wait to make this again."

I had thought I picked up mild picante sauce at the store, but I didn’t realize until it was already in the oven that it was hot, not mild. Oops! I figured it would be WAY too hot, but it wasn’t. That is, if you like spicy food. My adult son said it tasted like enchiladas, which he said was a good thing. My only complaint was that the rice was kind of mushy. I baked it in a 9x13 pan for exactly 1 hour at 350 degrees, so next time I will check it before the hour is up. Excellent flavor, though!"

"reviewBody": "Normally I do not write reviews, but I after reading reviews, I must comment. First, picante sauce is a type of chunky salsa. Pace made Picante Sauce a household name years ago, but it still is salsa. So, you can use salsa in this recipe. Depending on how hot you want it, choose hot, medium or mild. Second, sauteing the pork makes the outside nice and crunchy. If you don't want to do this step, you need to cook it longer. Pork that is tough may be undercooked. If it is dry, it is overcooked. Third, if you are in a high-altitude area, rice has to cook longer , with more liquid. I microwaved the rice in the bake pan with the water about 6 minutes before I added everything else. The rice came out perfectly cooked. I used one poblano chile and one jalapeno chopped up in place of the bell peppers, but they did not make it any spicier. I would use more jalapenos next time. Pork chops were rather dry, even with all the liquid they were sitting in, so they were overcooked. The concept is great, but we were not happy with the result."

I don’t disagree. I might add a little more rice next time - my teenage son is a big rice lover. Other than that it was great and we will definitely make it again."

They cooked rather quickly and the rice still had a few minutes to go (we didn't mind too much). Next time, and there will definitely be a next time, I will make sure to get the thicker chops. That way the pork and rice will be done at the same time. The flavors were quite good! Thanks for a great recipe that was easy and delicious!"

It took only 15 minutes to get into the oven since I browned the 6 pork chops on a pancake two -burner skillet while I mixed 2 cups rice, 4 cups water, 8 oz Tom sauce, 10 oz *Rotel mild diced tomatoes-and-peppers, 14 oz reg diced tomatoes and taco seasoning into 9x14 baking pan, added chops, green pepper and COVERED. Baked one hour, turned off oven added cheese. Easy and yummy."

"reviewBody": "Note to those who said this was too spicy: keep in mind that picante can mean a couple things in the USA. I believe what this recipe intended was a salsa style picante (something like Pace brand). You can choose the heat level of this type of sauce. Be aware that there are other sauces labeled picante that are more like hot sauce and would make this dish exceedingly spicy. (such as Tapatio salsa picante) I used a medium Pace picante and this dish was not very hot at all, in fact my brother added his own hot sauce on top!\n\nThis dish was tasty and the rice was complimented by all family members. The problem I had was that after an hour when I took the cover off it was still very liquid with about an inch of unabsorbed liquid on top even though the rice was done. I put on the cheese, turned up the heat, and let it bubble and reduce for about another 15 minutes. Then I took it out and let it stand for another 5-7 minutes hoping the sauce would thicken up and it did. Next time I will probably take the cover off after 40 minutes, bake another 20, put on the cheese, and bake another 10. \n\nMy only other complaint is the green peppers didn't seem to add much besides color. Next time I might dice them and add to the sauce mixture instead of on top. For a pop of green you could add jalepeno slices on top at the same time as the cheese.\n\nGood recipe overall and will make again."

I sauteed the chops, removed them and added the liquid ingredients plus rice. I put the chops on the rack and cooked on Manual for 15 minutes. The result was more liquid, but the rice was cooked and it was delicious."

I didn't have picante sauce either, but I found a recipe for \"Copycat Pace Picante Sauce\" on food.com that worked really nicely. I really liked the rice in this recipe.
