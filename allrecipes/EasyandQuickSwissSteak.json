,"description": "This was my favorite growing up. I was amazed when I was older and asked my mom for the recipe how EASY it is! A small amount of prep. time, a day in the slow cooker, and you&#39;ll be amazed! It sounds too simple to be good... TRUST me! This gets RAVE reviews when we make it! The amount of vegetables is only an estimate. Use as many or as few as you choose. When it&#39;s done, you will have a yummy gravy, and will have to carefully dig for the steak pieces."

Season the steaks with salt and pepper before dredging in flour. Then brown the meat as directed. Lightly Brush a 13x9 casserole dish with olive oil. When the steaks are browned, move them to the casserole dish. Once all the steaks are browned and in the casserole dish, cover with tomato/pepper mixture. (2.5 lbs yielded 8 steaks) Bake for 25 minutes in 350Â° oven. Perfectly tender and flavorful."

I am always looking for good recipes, and this one has been my favorite. It was simple and delicious. If I could have added salt, I would have done cartwheels. Cube steak can be tough, so I was worried about that. It was fall apart tender. I made it as is. I get confused on the ratings system, which I use. People rate the recipes but totally change them.

I used one pound cube steak, floured and browned lightly with a few sprays of Pam in the skillet. I didn't have crushed tomatoes so I slightly pulsed diced tomatoes in my blender. I used one can, and an equivalent amount of fresh chopped tomatoes pulsed into a large minced chop. I added 1/4 package of Trader Joes Fire-roasted peppers and onions. I added one package of beefy onion dry soup mix, and 2 cups water. I baked in my oven 3 hours at 350. The cube steak was soft and tender, falling apart. I thickened the tomato mixture with some corn starch mixed with water stirred into a bubbling/hot mixture. Served over egg noodles. Family raved over it. The dry soup mix added great depth of flavor along with the fire-roasted veggies."

I came across this recipe and thought it would work. I only had 1 huge fresh red pepper &amp; some frozen green peppers. I had a huge sweet onion. And I had Italian tomato sauce. But those amounts filled up my crock pot. My only addition was Kitchen Bouquet Browning &amp; Seasoning Sauce which I always had to tomato/meat recipes for added flavor. I started late so I cooked on high for 3 hours and then reduced to low for 3 hours. It was PERFECT! The meat fell apart. I served it over egg noodles. Added a salad and sourdough bread. Totally Yummy! Thanks AZDADOF5. This will be a regular in my house!"

I did everything suggested by other readers--Italian stewed tomatoes, extra sauces and seasonings, etc.--it still tasted like nothing and had the MOST unappealing consistency. \"Goulash\" is the only word I can use to describe it. I saved the leftovers in a corningware dish and though I'd try to turn them into a pot pie for dinner tonight, but I don't think I want to make the effort. The only reason I gave it two stars was because we were able to eatit, didn't have to throw it out."

The end result, though tender and 'stewy' was a little bland so I had to try and salvage it by adding soy sauce and extra seasonings. Next time I will add some beef stock instead of plain water."

It really helped to kick it up a bit. Also, I only used 1 green pepper, 1 onion, 1 red pepper. The veges were just enought for the amt. of tomatoes I used. I will keep this in my recipe box."

"reviewBody": "My family really liked this, but since I feel the proportions are off a little as written, I'm giving it only 4 stars. I only used 1 cup of flour (seasoned with seasoned salt, garlic powder, fresh ground pepper, and paprika) and had lots left over. I used 2 green peppers, 2 onions, no red peppers (too darn expensive) and 3 14 oz cans of Italian stewed tomatoes....and while everything was delicious, I had way too many veggies and broth in proportion to the meat. I'm actually going to make some lentil soup with it after we finish the meat! Altogether, very tasty and healthy....just modify it to your own desires. Thanks for the post!"

I used 2 large green and 2 large red peppers and 3 medium-sized onions. Also took part of another reviewers suggestion and used Italian Style Stewed Tomatoes instead of crushed. The other suggestion about adding 2 beef broth cubes was a winner too. This FILLED my 4.5 quart slow cooker to the brim! When all was tender . . . served over egg noodles. WOW! Will be trying again with sliced roast. Thanks for the recipe :-)"

I used stew meat and it came out so tender it was falling off my fork! I also added 2 beef broth cubes and I obmitted the red pepper. Another reviewer commented it was a sloppy mess, it is kinda sloppy as the meat is so tender that it breaks up and it is kinda like a stew. But it tasted so good I didn't mind, for leftovers the next day I piled it on top of a slice of bread, YUMMY!"

And i added garlic and other seasonings (2 packets of Emeril's Essence) to spice it up as recommended by the writer in the review section. It was still bland! It is horrible. I can think of many better ways to use fresh peppers and cube steaks. The sauce ends up tasting a little like the peppers, but if I wanted that, I'd make it! And why bother with the flour and browning? So disappointing..."

It already has the bell peppers and the onions in it along with some other spices. Using these tomatoes takes either the bitterness or sweetness you get from using regular canned crushed tomatoes (they are always different). Also add some extra garlic and serve over egg noodles"

I typically use a lot of seasonings in the flour... Mrs. Dash, lemon pepper, garlis salt, etc. have fun with it! Also, The longer it's cooked in the slow cooker, the better - for GOOD steakes 8 hours is the minimum! Also - it should read 2-3 onions and 2-3 peppers - the more the better! Enjoy!"
