No time to do that. I saw yours...easy and quick. I ended up marinating them for about 2 hours. Any more like the other recipes called for would have made the flavor too strong for me. If you don't love the taste fat gives to meat this won't be for you...but I LOVE it! I grilled it to a perfect medium rare on my tiny grill. It was like eating a tender ribeye steak. :) It was amazing and I will make it again! Thanks for this great recipe. PS--I have never given feedback on any recipe, but yours deserves it!!!"

"reviewBody": "Really easy and really good. I did make some adjustments. I did not have sesame seeds so I did not use them. I added season salt, onion powder, black pepper, and red wine vinegar to the marinade. I also used the marinade once removing the ribs. I simmered it down with some chopped celery, bay leaves and minced onions and used it to drizzle on top of the finished grilled ribs. Once I drizzled the sauce, I put them in the oven covered on 350 to bake for 30 minutes and they came out very tender and full of flavor. This is a keeper. Yum."

I do tweak the recipe a bit ~ I use maple syrup instead of sugar (in a pinch, you could also substitute pancake syrup). The secret weapon is toasting the sesame seeds and adding to the marinade while still smokin' hot. Adds a nice flavour. I omitted green onions."

I let it marinate also for 24 hours and am still holding a bit of it in the fridge for a quick dinner during the week. I made it with bok choy and carrots - both grilled and served it with kim chee. The meal was perfect!"

I was skeptical about a recipe with 4 ingredients (soy, sugar, garlic, sesame oil) but these were delish! Hubby didn't stop raving! We did the ribs in the crock pot but this would be great grilled. Also would be an excellent marinade for flank steak."

"reviewBody": "oh emmm geeee! I've never had korean ribs but if this is what they are like - yowza! these were fabulous! \nI had beef ribs that needed to be cooked, and I was driven by what is in the pantry since the stores are closed to day for a holiday. I followed the directions as written, and added a teaspoon of ground ginger and a few dashes of chinese five spice powder, then marinated for about 3 hours. \n\nThe flavours stay with these even after cooking, a delightful sticky sweet/salty delicious-ness. Just be sure to monitor progress regularly on the grill, as they can flare up as the fat of the beef rib releases. Mine did suffer a char here and there, but still came out very tasty. Will be making again very soon.\n Thanks Doubledown for sharing. This recipe rocks!"

"reviewBody": "These were awesome, but I have to say my addition made all the difference. I added a couple of scoops of plum sauce in my measuring cup and added the soy sauce over it to equal a cup. By doing this it made the marinade thicker and gave it just the right sweet and savory taste Korean ribs need. Sorry no exact measuring and I can't remember if I added sugar too. I also emitted the sesame oil and seeds just out of preference. Black pepper, garlic, onions are a must and I marinaded it for 5 hours. Will use it over and over and over because to buy this at our local restaurant is way more expensive than doing it yourself! Enjoy :)"

"reviewBody": "I really like this recipe. I used pork ribs and it came out amazing. Started them on the grill to get a nice sear. I kept a small pan filled with the extra marinade in the grill as the ribs cooked. This was nice because it started to reduce and made an excellent glaze. I applied the sauce multiple times during the grilling and by the time I finished they were coated perfectly. I removed the ribs from the grill and wrapped them in foil and allowed them to cool a bit before cutting them apart. I'm pretty sure that I will be using this recipe every time I do ribs. Thanks!"
