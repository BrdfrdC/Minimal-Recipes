These were a great hit as always!!! This is the first time I used a different crust and my family raved about these pies and asked me to keep making them with the graham cracker crust. I also used fresh berries. This is an easy, refreshing summer treat when strawberries are plentiful. I have never tried it with the frozen berries, but this is a 5+ with fresh berries!!!"

It was simple to make and tastes delicious, especially on a hot day like today! This recipe was simple to make, yet awesome!! The only difference I used was I cut up fresh strawberries as opposed to the frozen ones."

"reviewBody": "I found a strawberry pie recipe once that instructed me to mix chopped strawberries with cornstarch and boil to create a glaze -- what a horrid mess it made! I ended up dumping it all down the drain. I use Marie's strawberry glaze and use my own real whipped cream as it tastes so much better than Cool Whip. Using small-medium sized berries makes for a better presentation -- turning them pointed side up. This recipe is simple and delicious! It reminds me of the pie served at Bob's Big Boy. Thanks Michelle!"
