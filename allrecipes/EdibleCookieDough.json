"reviewBody": "Almost right. You should bake the flour at 350 for 5 minutes to make it safe to eat. Youll need about 1 and 3/4 cup of flour but cook 2 cups to be safe. (I spread it out flat on a baking sheet with parchment paper 1 cup at a time) I used margarine instead of butter so that may have effected how much flower i needed. I also spooned in the flour a few tablespoons at a time till i got the right consistency. Taste test and adjust to your liking if needed. (Taste testing will help you avoid that \"flowery\" taste) Add a little bit more brown sugar if its too buttery (the flour will probably hide that too) i was able to get it to actual dough consistency without the flowery taste with this method."

Though I did add around a 1/4 cup of white sugar because I just found it a little odd to not have it in there, added a bit more (really just over a teaspoon) of brown sugar and flour (that I had cooked before hand, please don’t use raw flour) to make the consistency better. Was super fun and easy to make and I will most definitely be making again!"

It's just one of those things you have to add a bit of this and that to your liking. Glad to know about cooking the flour from previous comments, I honestly didn't know that. I had to pull myself away from it so I can share with my husband after work! We are going to put it on some ice cream!"

"reviewBody": "THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOTE: i haven't seen any reviews addressing this, and the recipe doesn't either, and i don't want someone to make this mistake. when adding your vanilla extract, i BEG of you, do NOT use pure vanilla extract. pure vanilla extract contains a minimum of 35 percent alcohol, the same proof as captain morgan rum. when you bake it, the alcohol gets cooked out. but since this is raw, you'll essentially be getting drunk off cookie dough. a one-star review said that their throat is \"still burning\" after eating this, and it's likely because they used pure vanilla extract. please use imitation vanilla extract if you plan on making this, as it contains no alcohol!\n\nanyways, all in all, the recipe was really good, and i recommend it a lot! i'll probably be making it again another time"
