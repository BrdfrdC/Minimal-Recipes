"reviewBody": "Great base recipe with endless variation possibilities. I made some adjustments after reading the reviews and they turned out great! We were having friends stay with us so I made these ahead of time and we just heated them in the microwave 40s in the morning. - I have teflon coated muffin pans so eliminated the cooking spray and butter. - Used frozen hash brown potatoes but thawed/warmed them up before baking. - Used breakfast sausage in half and ham in the other; both tasted great. - Sautéed mushrooms with garlic and salt. I would do this with any veggie. - 8 eggs is more than enough; 10 not needed - Seasoned eggs with salt, pepper, garlic, paprika, Lawry's seasoned salt. Probably 1/2 tsp each but added a little at a time to taste. - Layered ingredients into muffin tin: potatoes, meat, mushrooms; then ladle 1/4 cup egg mixture. Top with chives and cheese. - Since the hash brown potatoes are already cooked, skip the first 5 min. bake. Just bake the pans at 350 for 20 min - they turned out perfect."

"reviewBody": "Excellent! Very flexible recipe. I used cooked sausage patties instead of ham, omitted spinach, and added mushrooms. I tried some with shredded hash brown potatoes &amp; some with red potatoes sliced about 1/8-1/4\". I also tried different cheeses on top (Mozzarella, Cheddar, and American). We preferred the ones with the potato slices and Cheddar cheese. I prepared the eggs like I normally do for scrambling (Half 'n' Half, S&amp;P, basil, dill). I did not mix the vegetables, but sprinkled some of each into each cup. Needed fewer eggs, and less tomato and bell pepper. Prep time was long, but worth it. After refrigerating, I reheated for 40 sec. each in microwave. These are a keeper! I'm sure the recipe would be just as good if made without my changes. This recipe can easily be adapted to your pantry and preferences. Thanks for the recipe."

I added leftover sausage, green onion, mushrooms and a bit of shredded cheddar to mine. I think shredded potato would work, but the sliced potato on the bottom was a fail for me."

I load each muffin cup with and equal amount of ham, veggies and cheese first then pour egg mix on top so that each egg bite gets the same amount of ingredients. I also add a quarter tsp. of salt and pepper to the egg mix. I wrap each left over EB in a paper towel then seal in plastic wrap to store in fridge. Husband LOVES these and they reheat nicely in the micro."
