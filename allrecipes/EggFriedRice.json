I rinsed the white rice so I could get rid of some of the starch that makes it clump up. Followed the instructions to the letter (sans rice) and added a bit more soy sauce while it was cooking. I let it sit for a while (about 15 minutes) stirring it a bit every 3 minutes. Came out crispy and delicious, I mean, even the egg tastes really nice and I'm not a fan of egg yolks. I doubled up on egg, rice, onions, garlic and carrots because I was really hungry.\n\nIt's a great recipe with the ingredients it has. Not many people have sesame oil lying around, or oyster sauce. I had veggie oil and basic vegetables, so I went with it, and it was good."

I also used low sodium soy sauce. The rice came out pretty tasty for homemade Chinese food, but it was a bit too salty for my palate. I might decrease the salt next time to 1/4 tsp since soy sauce has a good amount of salt in it to begin with. I also feel like the taste is \"missing something,\" though I have no idea what. I will look to reviewers' comments next time to make improvements. Will try this again and play with it a bit."

If you are really in a pinch, spread it out on a pan and broil it under low heat, stirring frequently, to get some of the moisture out. This isn't ideal and the texture will still be effected, but it is much better than using rice fresh out of the pan. 2) Oil makes it taste..well, oily. Use butter instead. 3) I just add the soy sauce once the rice is in the pan."

"reviewBody": "Very good. It can be made much better with a few substitutions. I used short grain Asian rice for a more authentic result. Cooked the rice in chicken stock (1 part rice to 2 parts stock) laced with the soy sauce. Great touch for even flavor penetration - much more effective than sprinkling on the soy sauce at the end and stirring in. Added a tsp of very finely chopped ginger which lent a lovely fragrance and taste. Stir fried everything using a touch of sesame oil. Minced scallions were subbed for the onion. Skipped the green beans and subbed baby peas. Some water chestnuts adds a nice crunch. All of these \"subs\" were pretty simple and gave a deeper, more authentic Asian flavor. This recipe is, however, an excellent basic spring board for countless variations."

"reviewBody": "I made some changes to this recipe which contribute to the 5-star rating. I thought I would share those changes for any who may be interested. We don't care for minute rice and we had some leftover rice that we wanted to use (particularly considering the rice shortage these days) so I used that instead. I followed the directions to saute the onions and green beans, but added some carrots and peas in addition. I used 2 eggs instead of one. Then I put in my rice. It needed some moisture in reheating and so I used 1 cup of chicken bouillon (to add more flavor). Everything else I did the same. My husband loved it and that really does say a lot for this recipe."

It made for an amazing dinner, much better than any Chinese restaurant that I've ever eaten in and for a fraction of the cost. This is a very simple recipe, easy to make and has a great flavor. I didn't have to go out and buy anthing to do it, the only change I made was that I added steamed peas instead of green beans and it turned out great. Also I didn't add any extra salt that it called for because Soy tends to be so salty anyway."

Then I added two eggs instead of one, let that fry for some time, still on medium heat, added a little more salt. I then added the rice and fried it some more on medium heat.
