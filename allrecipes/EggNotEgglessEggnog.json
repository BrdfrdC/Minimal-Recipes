I used Lactaid instead of milk. \nBecause the Lactaid is on the sweet side I was able to use a little less sugar. Every thing else is PERFECT!!!! Thank you so much for sharing."

No, I don't think the instant pudding is a health food, but I think this is a less expensive and slightly healthier option than store-bought nog and it tastes great! Easy to make as well! Will use this often and especially when milk is on sale, this is a great value! Will share this recipe with vegan friends as I'm sure it could be made with plant-based, milk-alternatives."

I actually tried it because I had used all of the eggs making deviled eggs :) It tastes VERY much like the store-bought eggnog that has gotten SO expensive. It is EASY to make, and quite a hit. I did trade a pint of whipping cream for part of the milk so that it would be thicker. Thanks!!"
