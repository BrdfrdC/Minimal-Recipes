I tried this recipe just as is with real mayonnaise and dry mustard rather than miracle whip and yellow mustard that I’ve always used. The result was a creamier egg salad with no vinegar flavor. I wasn’t sure about using dill weed but it adds a great unexpected layer of flavor. It is a smoother, more blended taste bursting with flavor. This is definitely a step up from my good ole stand by recipe. Thanks for sharing!"

People in my house don't like mayo too much, so I ended up added more spices (cayenne pepper, curry powder, and Johnny's seasoning). I also used regular mustard and chopped up onions. If I had done the recipe exactly as it says, I would have ended up with a dish no one would have eaten. Needless to say, my mom and little brother liked it, hence the three stars. I will, however, be going back to my more traditional recipe for egg salad sandwiches, because this recipe just didn't work for me."

"reviewBody": "This definitely had way too much salt, and too much mayonnaise; it drowned out almost all of the egg flavor, and left you with basically a garlic/pickle taste without the crunch. Not a fan. Maybe we were just used to the less-is-more way we remember our moms making it when we were kids; a bit drier (less mayo), and just enough salt so the egg wasn't completely bland, and a bit of black pepper. Maybe she put mustard in there - that part was pretty good in this recipe, and though I'm a fan of dill and certainly garlic, it just didn't play out in this concoction very well. Unless you plan on adding a bunch of smaller items (diced/minced onion, minced garlic, celery, bacon/ham bits, or whatever else) - definitely cut the mayo down and add gradually to taste; that part was a huge factor, I think, in why this didn't work."

"reviewBody": "The only change I made: I used minced green onions because I could not find onion \"flakes.\" Is dried minced onion what is meant? Clarify, please. \r\nOtherwise, my main complaint is that, with the exception of the pepper and mustard, amounts given for seasonings are heavy-handed for my taste. \r\nThe first thing I noticed was saltiness. Now, my salt shaker and I are fast friends, so when I say something's a little on the salty side, it's a considerable problem. Half the amount should do it. Fortunately, it's not inedible once it's spread on bread, but the saltiness is still very noticeable. \r\nSecond, the garlic powder leaves an unpleasantly heavy aftertaste. Again, I like garlic, but somehow a pronounced garlic aftertaste from an egg salad seems a little strange. You will need breath mints. \r\nThird, the dill is overpowering at the amount listed. I like to taste the eggs in egg salad.\r\nIn the end, all I ended up tasting was salt, dill and garlic, pretty much in that order. The eggs seemed to be nothing more than a vehicle, which I find a shame. The delicate taste of egg just couldn't survive the onslaught of seasonings. \r\nPerhaps the original amounts would work better with fresh garlic and dill. With dried, they're just too much. I would cut each in half, at least. \r\nI will most likely make this again, because I think it has great potential. But I will not use the original seasoning amounts unless I am able to use fresh ingredients, and I will cut the salt back in any case."

I cut the salt, dill and mayo in half, used fresh finely chopped onion instead of the flakes, and sprinkled in some paprika. It's now awesome :)"

This was better than mom's, even my first time around making this salad. I will cut down on the onion flakes next time. I did use 3/4 Miracle Whip and 1/4 Mayo since I prefer a sweeter egg salad. All in all, this was good and it was better than 4 stars but not quite 5, according to my tastes. I will make this again and again."

I(2nd to only my dads which I just like because he made it) I followed other reviews as I added 2T real onions a little less on all the spices than whats called out, 1/2 cup mayo. I suggest you start with 1/2 cup and add as needed, no way to fix too much mayo. I highly suggest adding one stalk of celery. It really was the cherry on top. Will make again."

"reviewBody": "This egg salad is a decent base, but as written it wasn't quite to my liking. I scaled the recipe for one serving, but kept the proportions right for the ingredients, and all I could taste was mayo and dill. I noted a lot of other reviewers cut the mayo, but I am not a fan of dry sandwich fillings. There was too much mayo even for me! Couldn't taste any of the other seasoning or ingredients, and I even added a diced rib of celery. If it weren't for the nice crunch, I wouldn't have even known it was in there. There was more mayo and dill than egg, so you could hardly say it was egg salad! I think in the future I'll use half the amount of mayo called for (you can always add more if needed, after all), and half the amount of dill, add in an equal amount of paprika as dill (1/8 tsp each for a 2-egg batch), and add the celery again."

I rate it 3/5 because it's possible that I did something wrong (I know... WHO messes up egg salad???), so maybe it was me!"
