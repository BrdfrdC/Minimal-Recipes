We like them on lightly toasted whole grain bread or in a Crescent Roll with Boston Lettuce. This is definitely an Oldie but a goodie, at least for me."

To this day, they take me back to Girl Scout summer day camp when there typically was one in my brown paper bag lunch packed by my mother. I’ve always put some chopped celery in mine, but never onion until today…and I liked it. The star in this is the zing you get from that little bit of the dry mustard powder, LUV it. GOLDIE6175 I agree, I love it just the way it is!"
