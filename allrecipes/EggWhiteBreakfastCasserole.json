"reviewBody": "This is a good basic recipe! I made some changes to it and it turned out really great: -Used BRED neopolitan pizza crust (super-thin, no sat fat); -Used about 20 ounces of organic eggwhites; -Used portobello mushrooms (sliced), Canadian bacon (diced), garlic, spinach, and onion; -Used fat free cheddar cheese. I coated a 9x13 glass pan with sunflower oil so the eggs would crust over. Submerged the pizza crust into eggs then baked as directed for 10 min. Sauted garlic, onion, mushrooms, and Canadian bacon for a few minutes, then added spinach and just sweat it; Added veggies and cheese to casserole, then increased heat to 375 degrees and baked for 15 minutes. Insert a butterknife to see if eggwhites are done. This casserole has a nice smokey flavor and the eggwhites get crusty!"

"reviewBody": "Great recipe! We really enjoyed this! It was easy to make, and tasted great! I halved the recipe (used about 10 egg whites), and baked it in an 8x8\" pan. It did need to bake longer than the listed time, but that could have been due to the smaller pan making the egg layer thicker than intended. I did find it to be just a bit too salty, so I would not use the added salt in the eggs next time. I used 2 sliced Roma tomatoes for the top, and that worked great. I think adding in some diced bell pepper would be a nice addition to this as well. I served it with a spinach salad and some sourdough toast for a quick and easy dinner. Thank you so much for the recipe!"
