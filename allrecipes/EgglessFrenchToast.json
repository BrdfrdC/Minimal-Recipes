The difference I did is in one of the batches I dipped the bread on both sides which makes it softer but gives it more flavor. The second batch I brushed on the mixture and it came out crispier but with less of the taste. Note that I did toast them in the pan BEFORE applying the mixture."

I didn't let the bread soak because I suspected that it would get soggy, but it still became a formless glob in the pan while simultaneously burning onto the pan no matter how much butter I put down or how low the heat was. I'm sure that this is a good alternative if you can't have eggs, but otherwise, you may want to go out and buy eggs for a different recipe."

Your son is blessed to have parents like you who will find ways to help him experience foods he otherwise couldn’t! \nMy eggs were frozen, so I had to improvise today. I used honey wheat bread, and did brush the mixture on each slice, and waited for it to toast like I would a grilled cheese. Even my autistic 10 year old loved it, and he is very texture sensitive! I will probably never use eggs in French toast again!"

I can’t imagine what would have happened if I didn’t toast it! The French toast was still very mushy BUT my 2 year old and I still very much enjoyed it. It reminded me of the inside of a cinnamon roll. It is quite hard to flip though and does stick to the pan even with a significant amount of better. I should also add I non dairy milk which may have made it mushier."

"reviewBody": "Hey guys, The trick to this recipe turning out great is a \"Pastry Brush.\" Instead of dipping the bread,brush both sides with a pastry brush. This makes the toast extra crunchy and never soggy. It's delicious when done this way. Also, I make a quick Strawberry sauce to go over it. The pastry brush really brings out the true flavors esp.the butter. Try it and see. ?????"

"reviewBody": "First, I only used half the cinnamon called for, and it was plenty for me. I had some issues cooking this. I put my bread in quickly and did not soak it. I was able to get 2 extra slices out of the mixture.It says to cook over medium heat, but 5 minutes on medium heat is way too long; my bread was burning at 3 minutes. I turned it over and did that side about 3 minutes, and it was super soggy. For the next 2, I turned the heat down to medium low and cooked each side 4-5 minutes. Once I got the temp and cooking time down, it was much better, but it is still a bit soggy in the middle, more so than with egg. Maybe a bit of flour added in with the milk would help. I made a slice with whole wheat bread and gave to my preschooler, and she liked it a lot."

Follow the times as written and don't let the bread sit in the milk mixture too long, and you'll get a browned, custardy toast just like the egg version. I served it with oven roasted plums and toasted almond shavings. Definitely a keeper recipe. Thank you for sharing it with us."
