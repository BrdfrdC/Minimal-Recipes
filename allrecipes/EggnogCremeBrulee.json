I was able to get 6 ramekins instead of 4. Once they were set, I sprinkled each with a couple of teaspoons of sugar and then used a kitchen torch to caramelize the sugar. Topped with a couple of fresh raspberries and a sprig of mint. Yum!"

"reviewBody": "With this delicious recipe, think \"custard\" not \"creme brulee\" and I think you will be happier with the outcome. If you are expecting a creme brulee texture, you will be a bit disappointed, but if you make this with the expectation that you will have a delicious eggnog custard, you will most likely be very happy. I make this as written with the exception of using Neufchatel cheese in place of the mascarpone and it is a family favorite that is absolutely delicious! I do not brulee the top, but that is just personal preference. I just think it is perfect as is!"

I also cut the egg nog about 50:50 with half and half cream, then used a pinch of cinnamon. Once it had been refrigerated for 3 hours, I spread a thin, even layer of white sugar on top and caramelized it with a brulee torch. It worked out perfectly. Very interested to try it with spiced rum!"

"reviewBody": "It was very good. I liked the idea of adding Mascapone cheese. However, it's pretty pricey, so I substituted cream cheese. The recipe said nothing about the brulee sugar on top so this was more like an Eggnog custard. I know how to brulee so I just added some white sugar on the top of each and torched it. Very simple. I used it for a pre-Christmas dinner party and everyone said they loved it. I know I'll make it again so long as the eggnog is still available in the grocery store."

I baked the filling in a deep dish regular pastry pie crust, in a water bath, until firm, approximately 55 minutes. Just awesome - great rich eggnog flavor, with a firm creamy texture from the marscapone. Since there was no burnt sugar on top, I would compare this more to a custard than a creme brulee. I will definitely make again, as custard or pie. Yummy!!"

The directions were good, I had no trouble, it set up nicely, the consistancy was good- I don't know, it just was kind of..... not creme brulee. Maybe it was TOO eggnog-y or something. If you ADORE eggnog, this may perfect for you! If I were to make it again I think I'd add some southern comfort or brandy or something, and replace some of the eggnog with cream."
