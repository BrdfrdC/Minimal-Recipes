I love cinnamon but I doubled recipe and the cinnamon covered the bread and it burnt on the toast and was not edible. I wish I had read the reviews like I normally do because I had to dump the entire bowl of mix out and start again wih less cinnamon. I think the recipe is great but wih a lot less cinnamon! Sorry"

"reviewBody": "As previously mentioned, the eggnog to eggs ratio is way off. For 6 servings, 1 and 1/2 cups eggnog is way to much. ONE cup is too much, which is what I used. The result is a mushy texture in the middle even though I cooked for over 20 minutes. Next time, I think I’ll only use 1/2 cup eggnog for 4 eggs. The pumpkin pie spice is an excellent addition, however I only used 1/2 teaspoon and that was more than enough. This recipe has the potential to be a wonderful Christmas morning breakfast, but it definitely needs some tweaking on the ingredient amounts. I’ll try it again with the suggested corrections and update my review."

I used 6 large eggs with the 1 1/2 cups eggnog. Because I used thick cut cinnamon raisin swirl bread, added only a tsp cinnamon, but 1 Tblspn nutmeg. I used the whole loaf of bread (10 slices), and there was probably enough mixture left for another 6 slices. The result was a delicious French Toast, which DH also loved. I did not add any syrup, just a little butter as this mixture was quite sweet."

I also added a couple of \"good\" dashes of salt and one Tablespoon of white sugar. I added the sugar because some of us do not like syrup or toppings on our french toast. The little bit of sugar gives it that extra boost of sweet, then.\nI used thick sliced White Bread in lieu of French Bread, as I had the white bread on hand. This recipe, for me, made 8 well-dipped slices of toast. After flipping the bread, I let it firm up a bit while cooking. Then I spread softened butter on each slice. That way the butter melts on and into the toast whilst it finishes cooking.\nThis was a hit and tasted great with or without any syrup or toppings.\nI do recommend this. This recipe would be just fine as written. AND it is flexible enough to make any tweaks you might want or prefer."

I used Trika G.'s spices (Ground nutmeg- 1/2 tsp., 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice) and let it sit for about 1.5 hours, since I didn't want the bread to be too soggy. Then I placed it on a foil covered baking sheet, sprayed itcooking spray and baked it at 400 degrees for about 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through. The French toast gets fluffy and was not soggy in the least!"

I use 4 eggs and 1 cup egg nog then just nutmeg dashed in before I dip each one because the spice just floats on the top and is gone after a few slices are dipped. We always use Kings Hawaiian bread sliced thick. Dip the bread quickly and then cook immediatly. Tastes great with blueberry syrup too."

Since the batter has more liquid than typical french toast batter it soaked into the bread much more making the finished product very soggy. The flavor was fantastic but I ended up eating around the edges only due to the sogginess. My husband who loves egg nog and french toast asked if he had to eat anymore. Very disappointing Christmas breakfast."

I couldn't taste the nog and although I grilled the bread for ages, the middle was still soggier than I'd hoped for. I guess I'll blame the cook for too aggressive of a dip and too thick of bread. Wonder if baking in oven would have yielded a better result?"

I don't have anything that holds 12 pieces of bread flat (does anyone?) so I stacked the bread in a plastic container with a lid, and poured the mixture in between and on top, but ran out at the end. In order to try to soak all the pieces, I flipped the container a couple times. There must be a better way, because the next morning the pieces were so soaked that they were hard to get on the griddle in bread-shaped pieces. If someone else has a different way, let us know. Otherwise, stick to the standard dip-and-grill method."
