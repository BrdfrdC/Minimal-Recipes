"reviewBody": "Amazing recipe! Made 1/4 batch and added a pinch of salt to round it off. The longer it sat, the better it got! The nutmeg and rum really softened over time and the whole thing mellowed out more. It wasn't as sweet as initially thought it might be. Will definitely add this to the rotation, it's like drinking ice-cream!"
