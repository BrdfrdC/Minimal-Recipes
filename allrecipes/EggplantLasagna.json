I used approximately half the amounts listed in the recipe for the other ingredients. It made plenty for two senior small eaters plus a smaller serving which I'll have for tomorrow's lunch. In the twelve years we have been together, this is the first time I've received what might be construed as something of a compliment on my cooking from my domestic partner. He said, \"You'll want to save that recipe.\" LOL. I'm quite fond of eggplant, so no doubt I'll make it again. Tasty."

I had about 10 ounces of low fat ricotta I needed to use up, so I inserted a thin ricotta layer. Made my own rich marinara with canned tomatoes, tomato paste, sautéed onions, garlic, olives, herbs, chili flakes, a little red wine. Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was great. Family loved it! Leftovers in freezer for easy weeknight meal!"

It turned out absolutely amazing! The eggplant was still crispy even under the meat sauce and cheese layers. If you are looking for a new dish to add to your rotation you won't be disappointed."

"reviewBody": "I made quite a few modifications to this, based on what I had available and not being a meat eater. I prepped the eggplant as in the recipe, but used the grated parmigiana between layers, instead of in the breading mixture. I made the red sauce with onion, orange bell pepper, mushrooms, garlic and diced tomatoes and let it simmer while the eggplant was baking. I ended up baking the eggplant probably an extra 20 mins to get a better color. I also made about a cup and a half of béchamel sauce, as I didn’t have any mozzarella and only some Monterey Jack cheese mixture. I know, totally changed the recipe, really, but it turned out really delicious! I layered everything and finished with the béchamel sauce and the cheese I had. It was a hit!"

He even asked for this dish for his birthday dinner. :)\nI did do some tweaking. I added 1/3 cup of part-skim ricotta cheese mixed with chopped steamed spinach to each layer between the eggplant and the meat sauce. I also prefer to use plain breadcrumbs with my own Italian spices added. Also, I like using hot Italian-style ground turkey instead of beef to give it a bit more kick and to cut back on the fat."

I used ground turkey, because Corona and quarantine and that was what I already had in the freezer. I don't think it harmed the flavor at all. I also only had one eggplant, so I tried halving the recipe, but ended up using as much sauce as it called for, and used ricotta as the middle cheese, because what is lasagna without ricotta?? My husband, a big carnivore, was hugely impressed, and even tried to have it for breakfast in the morning. Overall, this is a great recipe."

I baked the eggplant slices on silpat which worked great. I also used fresh Mozzarella cheese slices and only made two layers. Would definitely make again. I would have added fresh basil if I had it available."

"reviewBody": "I love eggplant and I make a variety of casseroles with it. This dish was tasty and pretty easy to make. But I had a problem with the amount of the ingredients! The 2 large eggplants weren't enough to make even 2 layers in a 9x13 pan. I had to switch to a 7x11 pan and even then I was only able to make 2 layers. Because of that I had too much meat sauce leftover and less cheese was needed. If I make this again, I would either keep the eggplant amount the same , using smaller pan and cut down the pasta sauce and the cheese, or add another large eggplant, with more breading ingredients."

Cut it lengthwise and didn’t peel the eggplant. Used the ends with the peels for the bottom layer—peel side down.\n\n2. After browning ground beef added 1 clove of fresh, minced garlic and fresh mushrooms and simmered on low until mushrooms cooked through. \n\n3. In between each layer, I added ricotta cheese (gotta have ricotta)—saved motzerella cheese for the top layer only. \n\nDelicious!"

"reviewBody": "This was brilliant! The key is def the eggplant treatment per another reviewer. I once made lasagna with slices of raw eggplant and then tried to cook the whole thing to death. I distinctly remember the eggplant being tough as shoe leather and the whole dish was not cohesive and just a major fail. The roasted and breaded eggplant takes on a natural and pleasant sweetness and the texture was fantastic. The breadcrumbs also helped to bind the dish together nicely. Per my personal tastes and what I had in the cupboard, I used panko. Also added my 3-cheese filling of ricotta, lg curd cottage and mozzarella cheeses, egg seasoning and garlic. I also used Rao marinara to reduce sugar and added about 6 oz of ground pork sausage to my meat mixture for some added pizazz. There’s a lot of room for experiment and adjustment to personal taste. I made a big enough pan to eat off all week, however the family went back for seconds and thirds, lol. Huge win and has me wanting to try other eggplant dishes now that I know the “trick”."
