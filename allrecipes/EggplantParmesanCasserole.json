I roasted, peeled and sliced two poblano chiles and put them inside the eggplant with the cheeses. I also made individual casseroles instead of one large one, and they only took about 25 minutes to bake. A great recipe to start with and a yummy hybrid, too!"

"reviewBody": "We've made this twice. It was delicious, just as written. Well, Prego was too sweet, so I added a little garlic salt. My next batch used a marinara sauce without sweeteners, so no adjustment was necessary.\n\nMy tips have to do with being a new gardener. I read the wrong advice, and some of our eggplant was overripe and had turned bitter. After slicing the eggplant, I put it onto paper towels and salted both sides. Waited 30 minutes, and then rinsed the salt off. I even tasted the corners of a few slices after it was cooked. One eggplant was TOO bitter, so it was discarded. (New gardener.) \n\nWe loved it. It is now in our favorites. It was like lasagna without the noodles. I'm passing this recipe on to my vegetarian nephew."

I made this recipe as presented, and while it's not \"traditional\" eggplant parm, I found it delicious. I found the half-inch slices just right and easily bendable after being in a HOT pan. The sliced garlic added a wonderful layer of flavor as well. Fewer calories and great flavor make it a definite keeper for me."

My domestic partner is not a fan of meatless dishes, so I added about 3-4 ounces of browned ground beef to the marinara sauce. I also used only about half or two-thirds of the crumb topping, as I thought it would be too much for my taste. I consider the recipe a real winner because my partner who almost never comments on my new recipes other than to say I worked too hard on it said, \"This is really good!\" Next time I'd add some basil and oregano."

I completely peeled both the eggplants, sprayed the circles with cooking spray and baked them all at once in a 425 degree oven to save time. I used a jar of Rao marinara and also added cremini mushrooms and a chopped onion to the sauce. I used ricotta and mozzarella, parmesan, an egg and nutmeg for the filling. It came out amazing!!! I love all the eggplant in this recipe!!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe is amazing exactly as written, given you are using your own home made Marinara sauce or a good quality brand. The first time trying a new recipe I always follow directions before giving it my own twist. My family devoured this, my Meat and Potatoes husband and my vegetarian father alike, so now now I use 3 eggplants- 5 cups of Marina sauce- I double the cheese filling but still use the same amount of Bread crumbs for the topping to might it a little lighter ( I use 4-C Gluten free plain variety). Now that this has become one of my staples I decided to grill the eggplant tonight ( instead of frying, since eggplant does soak up so much oil- I seasoned with a dash of oregano, basil and garlic . My family didn't notice a the difference and it was easier too! By the way, I buy Aged Parmesan- and grate it fresh. Less preservatives- and this dish tastes very Farm to Table!"

Because real parm cheese is hard to find/expensive, I used half salty cheese from market and used decent cheddar instead of pepper jack."

Certainly this is prone to the flavors embedded in your marinara, mine was a recipe found on this site (substituted homegrown tomatoes for stewed, added ground fennel &amp; spinach and it was FANTASTICALLY AUTHENTIC! \nI've been a long time eggplang parm fan but didn't care for the breading, usually soggy. This is the only way to make eggplant parmesan for me! Thank you Chef John!"
