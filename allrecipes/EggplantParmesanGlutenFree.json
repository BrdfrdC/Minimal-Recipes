Rao's brand marinara was very good in this. I used a bit more marinara than the 16 oz. but not much more, maybe a couple of large spoonfuls. I used 4C gluten free breadcrumbs, the plain version, but added some Italian seasoning. This will definitely be made on a regular rotation. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!"

It was so comforting having a healthy, hearty, low-carb, GF, hot dinner to come home to after work. I added Italian seasoned lean ground turkey, which I browned with onion, fennel seeds, and Italian seasonings, and I added between the layers of sauced (already baked) eggplant slices. I used a mandolin to make long, thin strips of eggplant. I only sprinkled a tiny bit of Parmesan on the eggplant before baking and used very little mozzarella, just for purposes of calorie/fat reduction. Delicious! Will definitely make again soon!"

I used a Misto sprayer with extra virgin olive oil to lightly oil the slices before baking.\nI sprinkled Italian seasoning on top before baking and it added a subtle lovely flavor.\nI will definitely be making this recipe again!"

I also used panko gluten free Italian style breadcrumbs because that was all I had in the house. I would not use the Panko again because it made the dish too crunchy. Other than that, it had wonderful flavors and I would definitely make it again with the above changes."
