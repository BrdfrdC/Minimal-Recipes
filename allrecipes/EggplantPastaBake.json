Did not use the vegetarian burger crumbles, Used french fried onion in the middle layer and on the top, used 1 pound of pasta (didn't think the half pound was enough for my round dish) and added 1/2 cup extra of cheese."

"reviewBody": "This was a solid recipe. I didn't find it to be bland as some reviewers stated. I did use a generous amount of fresh garlic in the sofrito, as well as some dried basil. Added some goat cheese to the white sauce and skipped the mozzarella, as I felt that the goat cheese would make it more flavorful. I realized last minute that I didn't have enough penne pasta and had to sub out spaghetti, but that worked. Topped it with a bit of fresh grated pecorino romano. This dish had interesting flavors and was an enjoyable and different vegetarian dish. Will make again."

"reviewBody": "So, I had to change a few things because I live in a place where things like vegetarian burger crumbles don't exist and because my oven cooks at a steady 600+ degrees... 1) Since I don't have vegetarian burger crumbles, I just left them out all together. Maybe it tastes better with them, but it was still quite good without them. 2) I can't afford olive oil in this country but sunflower oil did just fine. 3) Ancho chili peppers don't exist here so I used a central-asian spicy pepper. I don't think I'll do this again because I didn't feel like the spice really added anything to the dish but I will add a second red pepper for a bit more of that flavor. 3) I didn't have mozzarella cheese but another melt-able white cheese was substituted and tasted great. Overall, the recipe was good but it did come out bland, as another reviewer mentioned. When I make it again, this is what I will do differently: 1) I will cut the eggplant to be about 1/8 inch thick and probably use a second eggplant. 2) When baking the eggplant, I will put pieces of garlic inside the eggplant slices and put butter with a sprinkle of salt on top. 3) I will salt and season the white sauce to taste and make a little extra to mix with the pasta. 4) I will mix some white sauce and cheese with the pasta before putting it in the dish to bake."

I was looking for another way to use eggplant besides parmesan, so I will do this recipe again only next time use some garlic and fresh herbs to give it a little more flavor. I really liked the white sauce and my kids liked it, I don't think they knew they were eating eggplant...sshh.. don't tell:-}"

I made a few changes..I used Smart Balance, fat free milk, and whole grain pasta..which made it even more figure friendly. Also, the serving size is HUGE! I would take a big piece of this over a tiny piece of lasagna ANY day of the week! This is worth the time and effort :)"

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe last night. And, of course, like many people, I made a few changes but, only because I didn't have an ingredient. I used a green bell pepper instead of a red one since I didn't have it. I also had a little left over ricotta and put that in the layer inbetween the cream sauce and the pasta. Despite my changes, it came out very good. When I make this again (yes, it was that good) I will use the red bell pepper because I think it would add a little sweetness to the recipe and also add a little less onion. I used the amt as stated and it was just a little too overpowering. Also, some of us are used to thickening our white sauce. Don't do it. Follow the recipe, it thickens while it bakes. And, I don't think the ricotta made a whole lotta difference but, if I had extra, I would still add it again. If I didn't, it wouldn't be missed. Enjoy..."
