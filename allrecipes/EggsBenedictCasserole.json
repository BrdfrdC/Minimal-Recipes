"reviewBody": "My adjustments were to use diced ham rather than Canadian bacon and I added about 3 oz. sliced baby Swiss cut into small pieces on top. I also lightly toasted the muffins before cubing. My whole family enjoyed it, however I feel like needed some freshness to cut through the richness. Next time I may add some lemon zest into the egg mixture, a pinch of cayenne or some fresh parsley. It had a nice bread to egg mixture ratio. I baked it at 350 for 45 minutes since I needed that temp for other items. A big winner for our brunch today."

I have made this with diced parboiled asparagus layered in with the ham, it was tasty and looked pretty. Favorite variation is to sprinkle a cup of shredded Swiss cheese on top for the last 15 minutes of baking, and serve with avocado slices on the side. Now that's yummy."

I toasted the English muffins then placed in casserole dish, i used ham and sliced like canadian bacon and lightly fried on both sides then placed on English muffins. Egg mixture i used 1/4 c. Finely chopped Vidalia onion and added 4 cheese cheddar and whisked, poured over English muffins and ham and refrigerated overnight. Left out onion powder but added salt &amp; pepper , sprinkled paprika before putting in oven. When done used 2 pkgs hollandaise sauce mix (i luv hollandaise sauce). Just absolutely delicious ??"

I used a pound of bacon instead of ham and I used 3 toasted and cut up everything bagels ( they were big so that is why 3) instead of English muffins. I also didn’t have green onions so I just added onion powder. I also added garlic powder and paprika. I didn’t have time to let sit overnight so I just cooked right away. I think it was good this way a touch crunchy and then I used the knorr packet for eggs Benedict and it was fabulous! My picky kids loved it. I’m planning to make Christmas morning."

Will make this for Christmas breakfast instead of traditional eggs benedict - so much easier and all the same great tastes!\nUPDATE: I just made this for Easter breakfast tomorrow (going to bake it the traditional way) and recommend adding another 3-4 eggs with a bit more milk and onion powder."

"reviewBody": "I ALWAYS make a new to me recipe AS PRESENTED. This is a GREAT recipe. I made it as presented twice. After the trial run, I made the following changes:\n\nAdd garlic (fresh OR powdered) and WHITE PEPPER to the eggs and use a blender to scramble the eggs. Use UNCURED ham or bacon.\n\nAfter the cooking process, sprinkle sharp white cheddar cheese, THEN add the green onion. (I like the crunch and freshness of the green onion).\n\nCover the Casserole EVENLY with the hollandaise sauce and serve. \n\nYUMMY.\n\nTHIS IS NOT A HEALTH FOOD, however, if one does not eat like this everyday, it makes a really nice treat to greet a weekend morning.\n\nTry some green chile or a dash of cayenne pepper sauce and be keen not to overpower the dish with the spice of your choosing.\n\nTry it my way. You will NOT be disappointed."

It turns out fantastic and as another reviewer posted Knorr hollandaise sauce is the BEST, we have been using it for years. I think it is better than homemade. Thank you for sharing!!"

With apologies to the original ‘author’, I made a few changes simply because I always adapt a basic recipe to our taste. First, I cubed the muffins and spread them on a baking sheet to air dry the day before. I used whole milk, real butter (a holiday splurge) omitted the green onion but used onion powder and chives. Also added S&amp;P, Colmans powdered mustard, and a dash of cayenne pepper.\nI did use pkg. Hollandaise, but again used real butter, and seasoned with a dash of cayenne and the juice from 1/2 lemon. It was delicious! Served with hash browns and fresh fruit salad, and, of course, Bloody Marys!"

"reviewBody": "While this does not replace traditional Eggs Benedict it’s not bad when you want the basic flavors of EB but don’t want to go thru the effort of making it from scratch, especially when serving a group of people. There is definitely a place for this in my life. It is nice to be able to plop a casserole like this down on the table so you can enjoy eating with your guests instead of standing over the stove preparing each dish individually. By the time you sit down to eat everyone else is done. \nThe first time I made it I followed the recipe as written, using Knorr package mix with fresh lemon juice added. MUST have fresh lemon juice in Hollandaise! Also used real butter, not margarine. It really was not bad. The Knorr mix is much better than I anticipated, actually rivaling many made from scratch hollandaise sauces I’ve had. \nThe second time I made it I toasted the English muffins first and used thicker slices of a good baked ham cut into cubes which I sautéed in a little bit of butter for more flavor and made my own hollandaise and again, real butter. I also used chopped chives instead of green onions and seasoned the egg mixture with sea salt and fresh cracked black pepper. I made it the morning I served it which helped it not be so soggy, one of the things the Family didn’t like about it the first time I made it. It was even better. Truth be told tho, the difference in the hollandaise sauces was not that great and I would definitely use Knorrs again in a pinch. Overall a goo"
