Took reviewers advice: did dice up the mushrooms, did add 2 tblsp diced Vidalia onion, added small peices of cream cheese to the pan before pouring the ranch eggs which allowed cheese to soften and integrate a little more. Hubs hasn't had this before but he liked it alot. Yes to this breakfast choice."

I ended up having to scramble my eggs because I used the wrong skillet. Eggs were starting to stick in my stainless steel, so I scrambled them up, which worked fine. Next time I’ll use my Teflon skillet to try it like an open omelette or frittata."

Just a few details, we did use Sliced Mushrooms from the store but they still seemed too big and we did cut the slices in half so they were more manageable bite sizes. For the Spinach I cut stems off then coarsely cut it all so I had smaller pieces to. Working the mushrooms and spinach this way more evenly distribute the ingredients. I did cover the pan to help the top set before flipping. Served with Rye bread toast. I love this recipe, so Good!!!!"

I enjoyed this one so much that I made it two days in a row last week :) I went to Costco today to buy the ingredients so I can make it for the husband this week. You are going to need a big spatula to flip this one, I just fold it in thirds once it starts to firm up. Perfect as is, but I sprinkled grape tomatoes that I cut in half right before serving (see photo;) Thanks Kel Kel for sharing your delicious recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Yummy! I NEVER say yummy, but in this case it was the first word that entered my mind when I thought about how I’d describe this. Maybe it’s because I love spinach, mushrooms and garlic, and particularly when all three are used at once. Or maybe it’s because these eggs sort of mimic an omelet I make a copy-cat version of from a now defunct breakfast/brunch restaurant in Milwaukee. It’s distinctive ingredient? Cream cheese. Little creamy, gooey, slightly tangy bits of cream cheese. Put all four ingredients into the eggs and it’s no wonder I said yummy. Even Hubs, who rarely rates recipe five stars, said that as far as eggs go, this couldn’t be any better – five stars from him too! (Note: With six eggs I didn't bother to try and cook this without stirring and then flipping this big panful. Rather, I just cooked this as scrambled eggs, in long, fluffy curds)"

After adding the eggs, I turned the heat to low and covered the skillet to help the eggs set, it is not easy to flip this if the top is still runny. I would suggest a cheese other than cream cheese. Maybe a nice white cheese that melts well. The cream cheese didn't melt well and looked a little messy. Thanks for a delicious breakfast."
