Next time I will skip the cinnamon &amp; replace the mayonnaise with something lighter, maybe creme fraiche or light yogurt. I might also replace the lemon juice with pineapple. And I know it won't be Elise's Waldorf Salad."

Granny Smith, Gala &amp; Red Delicious, unpeeled. I also added a Red Pear, Red Grapes, few Marshmallows, Walnuts in place of Pecans. The Whipped Cream added so much to the Dressing! This is going to be a favorite of mine. Thanks for the recipe!"

I scaled the recipe down to make a 2 serving recipe to share with 2 of my children that would enjoy this as well as me. It was prefect. At 1st, I was not liking the mayo taste but that was before I chilled it in the frig for an hour. After chilling for the amount of time, the mayo flavor disappeared and a hint of cinnamon lingered as well as the flavor of the apples. I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe, all with a side of bacon."
