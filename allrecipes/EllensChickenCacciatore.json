After I browned the chicken thighs, cooked the onions and mushrooms, I put it in my crock pot. The chicken was really tender. It all smelled wonderful! My husband and I both felt the flavor was pretty bland though. I think if I make it again, I'll add more seasonings. I served it over rice hoping the thin liquid would stick to it. It did. I think I'll take other's advice and add tomato paste if I make it again. Thanks for sharing though!"

In this case, I omitted the mushrooms, used crushed tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes, reduced the rosemary &amp; added a little thyme. We like to kick our sauces up a notch so I added about 1 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes. I also took the lid off after the 40 minutes of simmering &amp; let the sauce cook down a bit before serving it over whole wheat linguini noodles."

I left a very small amount in the skillet and the results were still very good. The chicken was very tender, and the recipe was easy to follow, with not too many directions or ingredients. This is a great recipe in taste, easy instructions, ingredient that are mostly in cupboard, and minimal time overall in preparation to actually eating."

I served it over pasta instead of rice. Much better for my taste"

When the cacciatore was finished cooking, I sliced the breasts and returned them to the sauce. I served this over medium pasta shells with lots of Locatelli. This sauce has an excellent flavor, and I will definitely make it again. Changes I might make next time -- crushed tomatoes vs the diced; and crushed rosemary vs the \"sticks\" (just texture preferences). Try this one! You won't be disappointed!"

I don't like when people change so many things in a recipe and then rate the original! I just wanted to say that I had 3 large chicken breasts on hand, so I used them. I also didn't use the rosemary. I used lots of garlic and was faithful to your other ingredients, mixing orange juice to the wine. Oh yeah....I added chopped celery. I made it in a large dutch oven. I think it is wonderful and my family does too. A crusty Italian bread to sop up the delicious juices makes it a keeper. Thanks for giving it to us."

Also, without the tomato paste, it is a soupy dish which lends well to making a soup dish with the leftover sauce. I like my sauce thicker so I do add tomato paste. With my left over sauce, I make a tomato soup the next day and add some chicken broth, lemon juice and shredded chicken to it. Really, you can also add vegetables in it but what makes it for me is the base sauce. Enjoy!"

The sauce was perfect, not watery as some claimed (maybe due to no wine so less liquid). Husband had seconds! Note to self: use non-stick pan next time, the chicken thighs stuck to my Calphalon pan even with oil. Everything got scraped up in the end but it was a bit of a mess when I removed the cooked thighs from the pan. Will make again."

My 3 year old twins inhaled this and one of them rubbed his tummy and said mmmmm. I served it on white rice and a side of bread.

Even if the original recipe is meant to be a thin sauce it really does work out better with the paste. \n\nEasily makes enough sauce for 12 oz of penne pasta, probably enough for 16 oz. depending upon the ratio of sauce to pasta that you prefer.\n\nThis has a nice mild flavor but is not bland at all. Be sure to top it with grated parm. Even my mushroom hater of a teenage son gobbled it up!"

I used a whole cut up chicken, skin and fat removed, except for the wings which were left in tact. I washed, dried and seasoned both sides with salt, pepper and rosemary. I browned in oil and butter and after removing added the onion and garlic and red bell pepper slices, I used red wine (all I had on hand) and had I used crushed or plum canned tomatoes in place of the diced, the sauce would've been thicker for the side of the pasta I made for this. Despite the thin consistency, which is what this recipe aims for, the flavor was excellent. A keeper and remake for sure."
