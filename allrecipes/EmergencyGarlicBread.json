Growing up my mom made this, I did for my family, I will have to ask if my sons if they do in theirs! I love roasted garlic and when on hand I blend it in the butter, heavenly! A reviewer said they had trouble with lumps when mixing the garlic powder in with the butter. I've always used that method to be sure it's seasoned to taste (love garlic) never had lump issues. Maybe your butter wasn't softened enough or just required more blending. I'd give it another try as it is the way to be sure if you've added too little or too much."

I do add some Italian seasoning to the butter along with the garlic powder. ANd I don't broil. I just bake on 425 for around 6 mins or so. THANK YOU for this! Thank you for making the rest of us not feel like freaks when we have been using this recipe in a pinch for years!"

"reviewBody": "I do this all the time with the inexpensive French Sandwich Rolls you can get from the Kwip Trip convenience stores (Aldi's also carries them). They are cheap (less than a $1.50 a package for 6), and make the most incredible crusty, chewy garlic bread! A swipe of margarine or butter, a sprinkle of garlic salt or powder, and a dash of parsley, bake at 400 for 7-8 mins and viola, instant yummy garlic bread without the fuss or expense. Each roll gives you two individual good size slices like the hot dog buns so it's perfect. You can sprinkle on Mozzarella cheese if you prefer cheese GB too. Thanks for the reminder that sometimes the simplest is often the best!"

"reviewBody": "Garlic bread emergencies happen with shocking regularity in our home and this recipe is my 911 solution. I make it exactly as written (I know! Who does that?) with a really loose interpretation of \"as needed\" and although it is easy to tell the difference between this and Italian bread, it is still quite delicious. Besides, I can only use so many breadcrumbs or make so many burgers, dogs, bun tacos and sloppy Joes. This recipe wins on 3 fronts - it's fast (10 minutes) and easy (3 ingredients), it uses up leftovers, and it's delicious. If that's not worth 5 stars, nothing is."

I used my stove's broiler (don't have a toaster oven) and had to throw out my first batch because they burned. :( I used hamburger buns and even went out to get more just to try these again! I added parmesan cheese on a few, but I think I prefer them without it. Thanks for the great recipe CANDYLAND7! UPDATE 2/15: Following another reviewer's suggestion, I just toasted the hamburger roll in my regular toaster. After it toasted, I buttered it, sprinkled with garlic powder and parmesan cheese. In a pinch, this works great (actually it didn't burn like my in my broiler and no heating up the stove)! Great tasting and good for a snack, too!"

"reviewBody": "I tried this recipe since I had a craving for garlic bread but only had white sandwhich bread! I luckily had steak rolls and decided to try this recipe. I didn't exactly follow the ingredients, just doing it by eye. It did take longer than for minutes, mostly 'cause I didn't know if I should've set my broiler for low or high! I decided to be safe and went with high. It is good when you're in a pinch! It tastes delish and I had it with eggs. However, I put a little less garlic at first so had to add more and stick it in the broiler again. It came out crispy, just the way I like it! Overall, this recipe is great, especially if you cook often or have used a broiler. I am a terrible cook and have only used a broiler once, so I had just a bit of trouble. I would recommend."

I ate the whole batch with dinner! When I made this, I used up a bottle of garlic powder, and it amounted to slightly less than 2 teaspoons - I would've liked quite a bit more. And for the butter, I used 2 tablespoons, more than the recipe mentioned. In my case, the hot dog buns were a softer bread than the garlic breads I'm used to, but that was okay. I guess I'll keep this in mind for occasional impromptu dinners."

However, I learned to melt butter and add garlic powder, then just dip cut side of hot dog bun and place on a cookie rack on a raised cookie sheet. Bottom gets a bit crusty also. Dipping gets more butter on evenly. I will try parsley and maybe parm cheese this time. Having Lasagna Christmas Dinner 2013."

It is a delicious way to use up hamburger and hot dog buns that are left over from your picnic or bbq since our household only uses fresh unfrozen buns for those 2 meals. The kids also love it because I let them assemble their own and like another member's review stated, it is really tasty with a little Parmesan cheese or finely grated cheese on top.. Mrs. Dash is also a good little spice to sprinkle on top (hence the kid's wanting to make their own.) Great add to this site candland7."

Just a warning--don't try to mix the butter and garlic powder to spread on top! I tried this the first time, and it just clumped up, so I had to melt more butter and brush it on and then sprinkle on the garlic powder just as written. Thanks for saving my dinner tonight!"

My go to's for day old or leftover bread/buns is usually homemade bread crumbs, croutons or bread pudding...I will be using this simply pleasing recipe as well now that I remember it!! how could I forget such an easy-cheap and great tasting recipe???? Hmmmm....good question.... The church ladies also added shredded cheese to about half of them and left the other half plain for those who don't or can't eat cheese. I will be making these tonight as I have eggplant parmesan....( from this site) that I made late last night ready to go in the oven for dinner. i came on here to look for a quick recipe for garlic bread to accompany my dinner as I don't have any and the nearest store to me is 25 miles ( i live in the boonies on Table rock Lake)....and found this one. I will make a homemade garlic bread spread with some herbs and seasonings and top the little \" french breads\" with an italian cheese blend and then broil until light golden and bubbly!! Another reviewer suggested serving these with sloppy joes....I have some leftover burger buns as well and will pt sloppy Joes on the menu for NFL sunday coming up this weekend !! These would also be a great base for a meatball sub.... I gave it a 5 for the ease-low cost and versatility of the recipe."

This was a double bonus for me because it made some room in my freezer, which is awesome AND my boys were thrilled. So, YAY! I served this with Macaroni Gratinee, which is a fancy schmancy way of saying goulash. NOTE: This works with any kind of stale bread you may have on hand and is a lot better if you can use fresh garlic but it's not a necessity."
