I did add maybe 1/2 tsp of salt and did the egg wash before baking. I was worried I undercooked ?these because they definitely werenâ€™t browned very much (I cooked them for 18 mins), but they were perfect!!! I will be using this dough recipe with many other fillings and recipes. This was so easy, I am still in awe with the results. Thank would post a picture, but they were all gone within seconds!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!!!"

It was super easy to make, not too many ingredients, and the flavor of the dough is amazing.\n\nI needed to bake these the same night that I made the dough, so I made the dough and chilled the dough in the fridge for 45min. After 45min I was able to roll out the dough with lots of extra flour to prevent sticking, then brush with an egg wash and bake for 25min at 375.\n\nThey couldn't have turned out better. In fact, they were so good that the next day we made a triple batch with dinner and dessert fillings! Thank you for such an awesome recipe!!!"

I took out about 1/4 of the dough the first time and I'm glad I did. It was simple to roll but took me a while to get the hang of how much of the filling I could put in and how to seal it best. They did turn out amazing, and it was my first time making them. I did start out with cutting about a 3\" circle but the next time I made them more like 3.5\" which worked much better. I pulled out another section of dough when I was about halfway through filling the one I was working on."

I've made them 3 times now and I used a cookie cutter to make them in 3\" in diameter (just right for bite sized dessert) and 4.5\" diameter (for more traditional sized empanadas). If you're new to making pastry dough, definitely recommend reading other reviewers' tips as this isn't the easiest/quickest thing to do if this is your first rodeo."

"reviewBody": "Overall this is a really good recipe and I loved the flavor and texture of the dough but I gave it 4 stars because the filling was not all that interesting and as many said just leaked out. The dough can certainly be sticky but what I found helps is to refrigerate the dough into about 1\" balls rather than one large ball. Then I rolled each ball between two sheets of parchment paper using a little flour if it started sticking (don't use too much flour because the flour will dry out the dough which then causes cracks and more seepage). Be sure to keep the dough cold to prevent major sticking! For filling, I mixed cream cheese with some jam since I didn't have preserves and found that didn't seep out like plain jam. I also mixed cream cheese, honey and toasted pecans which was tasty, plus you can use more since it doesn't leak out at all. Have fun, be patient and enjoy. Thanks for the recipe."

"reviewBody": "Let me start of by saying that I come from a Mexican family and that I grew up with empanadas. While this is not like the traditional dough it is really good. Fed them to my family (born and raised Mexican) and they all loved them. Made them with pumpkin stuffing and dusted them with sugar to make it a little sweeter (which they barely were). Also, for the people that said the dough was not easy to handle, I think it might be because the recipe calls for one package (3 oz) of cream cheese. One package of cream cheese is 8oz not 3oz!! I almost put the whole package in myself."

I took them to taco night at church and EVERYONE loved them. And I amazed them by it being homemade dough. Thankfully I tripled the recipe- a whole block of the cream cheese, and I measured the flour then sifted (maybe I should have sifted then measured?). Be careful when removing from pan, they will break."

I plan to make a breakfast version with eggs and bacon so I thought it might add a little different flavor. We will see how my experiment comes out tomorrow! \nMy boyfriend loves these filled with cherry pie filling, as does my stepfather. Both have been asking for them for their birthdays."

The hardest part of this whole dish is to make sure you get a good seal all the way around the empanada. That and deciding which preserves to use for the filling. I chose to make some with Oregon Marion Berry Seedless Preserves and some with Apricot Preserves. Being a fragile dough, I found it easiest to place the cooked empanada on a bed of cinnamon sugar and then spoon additional sugar over top until coated.\nI served them with a dollop of Greek Goddess Honey Vanilla Greek Yogurt on top. They were a seriously big hit!!!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe makes just 11-13 empanadas, so if you cook for the family with three or more persons, you should even triple these recipe. The dough itself is tasty, but it is more cream cheese-y, not buttery. I made empanadas with cherry pie filling and didn't like the result very much. You shouldn't roll the dough thin, if you use preserve/berry filling, because the filling splatters out of the edges. Don't you too much filling, 1/2 teaspoon more and you ended up with the filling onto your baking sheet. The baked empanada is very fragile, you can easily tear it with your nail or spatula when it is hot. Probably I will make these empanadas again but with another filling."

I didn't have the ingredients on hand to make the pastry the day/night prior so let it set up in the fridge for about 4-5 hours then used it immediately after removing from the fridge. It seemed to work out fine, but I'd make sure to allow for extra chilling time if I expected warmer weather. I used peach jam and sprinkled the empanadas with the cinnamon-sugar mix before baking instead of rolling tm after baking. This keeps the final product from being too sweet. Thanks again!"

I was not sure about the dough, reminded me of play-dough and very granular until I mushed it all together, and had to let it sit out a while longer so it was soft enough to roll out the next day. I had to leave it in the oven for 25 min and also the cinnamon/sugar wouldn't stick to the fresh-out-the-oven empanadas so I ended up coating them with butter and dropping them in that way. For the filling I just bough some apple pie filling and processed it in my blender, worked great. Overall they're a big hit, might try a different dough recipe next time though."

"reviewBody": "Good recipe. The only thing I think would make the recipe easier would be to toss the empanadas in cinnamon and sugar before baking because it doesn't want to stick very well to the cooked dough, and I like them COATED! For filling I cooked down some finely chopped apples with some sugar, cinnamon and a teeny sprinkle of nutmeg and clove. I also made a caramel sauce to dip them in. Delicious!"

They literally slipped right off the mat and the mat wiped clean without any effort. Because 3 oz. packages of cream cheese do not exist, I read many reviews before making these to see what others did. In the end I used the entire 8 oz. brick of cream cheese, 1/4 cup of butter and 2 cups of flour. I think the dough could use some flavoring, maybe cinnamon. I found the dough tasteless and the kids did not like them either."

I would like the dough to be a bit sweeter, but with the cinnamon/sugar it was fine. I made 3 different kind using canned apple pie filling, canned strawberry pie filling and chocolate chips. I liked the apple best, but my kids liked the chocolate. I will be making these again."

"reviewBody": "Wow! It is a mystery to me how a pastry dough with so few ingredients could be so wonderful. I am in love with this dough and will probably use it for a lot of things, including pies, in the future. It came out wonderfully delicate and almost melts in your mouth. I made these empanadas with cherry and apple pie filling. The cherry ones were good, but the apple ones were AMAZING! I simply chopped the cherries and apples up into smaller chunks, and made the empanada rounds a bit bigger than the recipe called for so I could squeeze more pie filling in there! \nI found it a bit hard to roll the bigger empanadas in the cinnamon sugar, so for the second batch, I simply coated a spare cookie sheet with a dusting of cinnamon sugar and when the empanadas were done, I transferred them to the coated sheet and then sprinkled the tops with cinnamon sugar as well. \nThese were a HUGE hit at my Super Bowl Fiesta and I will be making them again in the near future.\n\n*Tip - I found that the cherry pie filling oozed out of the seams on the first batch. For the second batch, I wetted the outside edge of the bottom, crimped the two edges together with the tines of a fork, then rolled the edges (much like you do for a pie crust) then crimped them again with the fork. I then pierced the tops with the fork to let steam escape. May seem like overkill, but the cherry pie filling did not leak at all after using this method."

I filled mine with apricot preserves, strawberry preserves, a homemade apple filling, and blackberry jam. The jam leaked out, the others did not. This is definitely one I will be making again. I used a 3 inch rim drinking glass as my \"cutter\" it was a perfect size. Just make sure to pinch your edges together and do not over-fill. These are awesome. Will be adding these to my recipe box!

For the filling we used canned cherry pie filling and canned raspberry cake filling. They tasted better while still warm, but we took them to school the day after baking and they were a big hit even at room temperature. I was not sure how to store them, given the cream cheese and butter, but we kept them at room temperature with no issues. These empanadas were great and we will definately make them again."

I had no problems with the preserves oozing out since I put a teaspoon on preserves in the middle. I also rushed the chilling but putting the dough in the freezer for about an hour and then letting it sit for about 10 minutes on the counter. The dough was quite sticky but I just rolled it in a little flour until it wasn't sticky anymore and it worked great. All in all these are delicious and I look forward to making them again and again."

"reviewBody": "This is an easy and delish recipe. The dough is flaky and tastes fantastic. I was skeptical of the cream cheese, but clearly this combination works! You don't taste the cream cheese in it at all - it is a wonderful pie dough. In fact, I fully intend to make a pie using this for crust. I made three different kinds: apple pie filling, pineapple preserves, and strawberry preserves. I liked the pineapple the best, but everyone else raved over the apple pie filling. I made a double batch and was glad I did. The recipe doesn't make much and when I doubled it I had some left over. The dough stayed in the fridge fine for five days. I actually thought it was easier to work with after it sat for a couple of days. The key is that the dough MUST be very cold. I plan to try making a savory one with ham and cheese. I am going to try to make it with very thinly sliced deli ham and cheese from a wedge of laughing cow swiss. I can almost taste it now. Make this recipe!!! You won't be sorry."

Also, we didn't roll these out. I cut the chilled dough in pieces and then rolled those in balls and flattened with a glass. I did have to flatten a little more by hand. We rolled the empanadas in sugar before baking and that turned out great! About half of the empanadas with strawberry jam leaked, but I probably put too much in those. I also made a few with peach preserves and none of those leaked. The preserves were not so runny so that might have something to do with it. In any case, both flavors were delicious. And the crust is delicious so it was okay that some leaked. My 10 yr old made these with me, and even my 9 and 4 yr olds got in on the action. Fun family recipe if you're not in a hurry. The oldest was taking these in for a cultural project at school and we had never made them before, so very happy that they came out so well. Great recipe!! We're going to try wiith savory fillings next time"

We use some cornstarch with water to brush the edges of the circles to help them stick together, and press the edges closed using our fingers not a fork for the prettiest presentation.

I just chopped up the apples much smaller than I would for pie. The rest I filled with fruit preserves. I found the apple pie did not leak at all while the fruit preserve filling was very leaky when cooked. Since I had so many leftovers I just froze the prepared but unbaked remainders.
