"reviewBody": "Very delicious. Better than some we bought from an Argentinian bakery. But I don’t live somwhere where Goya discs are easily found so I used 1 can of Grands biscuit dough which yields 8 biscuits or 8 large empanadas. I used a plastic empanada press so I wouldn’t have to manually pinch the edges. Don’t forget to drain the meat of grease after you brown it. The recipe left that out. The filling can be made 1-day ahead. I fried 2-3 empanadas at a time in a 4-qt pot. I have a family of 4. Two empanadas per person and a side of Spanish rice was a satisfying meal."

About 3/4 minutes at 375 degrees and the Empanadas turned out great. I made about 15 of these and all were gone in short order. A great half time snack. Recommend trying and mixing your favorite ingredients. I love japalenos but wasn’t allowed to add them to the mixture. Maybe next time??."

If I don't want to eat all right away, they freeze well. Freeze after putting empanadas together. I just put them in freezer bags and eat within a month. No need to defrost. Just put them on a baking sheet 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes. Yummmm."

You know its good when they say they are full, but reaching for thirds."

The only thing I do differently is add more of the olives and a little of their juice (I love the green olive taste) and I add in fresh chopped cilantro. When I think of empanadas this recipe is what I think of. \nAlso, you can use this exact same recipe to make chicken or tuna empanadas. Years ago when I had a house full of kids we actually used to make 20 of each (beef, chicken, and tuna) and it would last us for 2+ days."

I make 20 each time and they disappear like loose $100 bills. I prefer to bake them, they brown up nicely without the mess. To bake them I use an egg wash on the outside before they go in the oven. Thanks so much for this recipe."

Instead of deep frying, lightly brush them with olive oil and bake them in the oven on 350 for about 12 to 15 minutes (or until the nice brown color appears). Both ways are delicious. Thank you for sharing this recipe!"

The only reason that I'm giving this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 is that the recipe takes so long to make. Maybe I'm just a slow cook, but I felt like these took forever to finish. It's also not the type of meal that you can walk away from at any point during the process, so you really can expect to be cooking for at least an hour and a half....not to mention clean up time. They were really fun to make, but they aren't an ideal meal for someone with a busy schedule."

Their products are very well made and not salty. This was an excellent recipe and very easy to follow. Everything was perfect for a Sunday football afternoon dinner. I made the empanadas along with the Goya rice with black beans mix and Progresso cheesy enchilada soup. I also served nacho chips with salsa and chipotle baha dip with two different types of mexican beer. It was a fun, delicious meal on a very cold day. My family loved it. The only thing I might change would be to use the smaller discos. I used the larger ones and we cut them in half as they were easier to eat. I doubled the recipe and made a big batch and unfortunately I only have three leftover. The next time I will definitely make more to freeze for another meal."

They had a great flavor but it was missing something. Next time I'll add some cayenne pepper and cheddar cheese. Also, we couldn't find the discos anywhere around here. I used pie crust dough instead, which made them flaky and delicious. Thanks for a keeper, Goya!"

I couldn't help but add a little white cheese (I used monterey jack) If I make it again, I will add the olives and keep the onion in larger chunks for me because I think the texture would be better if prepared as the recipe is originally written. I loved the addition of the shredded cheese though. As for the Discos, I couldn't find them at the grocer so used regular pastry dough that I made."

I wanted to try the meat mixture first before ambitiously tackling the pastry aspect, so I used the meat mixture in enchiladas. The sofrito and sazon were also not to be found but was able to get them from Amazon with free shipping and I'm glad I did. Next time I'll tackle the pastry part with alternate helpful suggestions from other reviewers. Now I'm inspired to try other recipes using sazon and sofrito."

"reviewBody": "OMG ... my new favorite! Out of necessity (not rebellion), I had to change a couple things. First of all, I double the recipe because I have a big family. Next, I only had ground turkey meat (20 oz) so I used that instead of the ground beef. Next I couldn't find the Goya Discos to save my life so I finally settled for pie crust sheets. So because of that I baked these at 425 degrees F for about 20-30 minutes. The whole batch made 20 medium turnorvers. I served these with the Mango Salsa (also on this site) and my family went nuts over these and dovoured almost the whole batch. I kept eating the filling ... so savory and flavorful. I did season the meat with garlic salt and pepper and also added a bit more sofrito, but other than that I followed the measurements (doubling of course) and this recipe is a keeper. Thanks so much for this. My mom was Puerto Rican from Hawaii and she used to make these all the time but she died with the recipe. It brought back great memories."

These were absolutely FANTASTIC and so simple to make! The only Goya products I used were the Discos (I could only find the achiote ones, which I was unsure of, but they were great), the Sofrito and the Sazon. I fried these up in my deep fryer, and they cooked up perfectly. I really cannot believe how good these were and how big of a hit they were with my family. I got 8, and I froze the leftovers (already cooked) for another time, so we'll see how that goes. I will definately make these again, anytime~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)"
