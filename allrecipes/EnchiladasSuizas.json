Simply microwaving the tortillas isn't accomplishing what the frying does, which is to prevent the tortillas from absorbing all the sauce and disintegrating. Rate the recipe people, not your \"tweaks\" and changes. That's YOUR recipe, not this one."

I did struggle a bit with the whole fry-dip-fill-roll process, so I simplified by spreading a thin layer of the chili sauce on the bottom of the baking dish, then fried a tortilla, set it in the dish, added sauce/chicken/cheese, then rolled. My family loved them and said I should practice by making more!"

I also added some red pepper with the onion and used a can of green chiles(all I had on hand). I was worried about getting the tortillas too crispy to roll so I didn’t brown them enough. Next time I’ll let them brown a bit more. Really good and easy recipe to throw together in a hurry. Thanks for sharing."

First I warmed my Tortillas in a skillet on med/high &amp; used an oil spritzer which works great. I downsized to a serving size of 6. I only added 1 cup of broth rather than 1 1/2 that was called for, I also used leftover Pork instead of Chicken &amp; to the Verda mix I sprinkled in some dry Fajita mix to taste. Everything else stayed the same &amp; between the two of us there was only 1 1/2 enchiladas left. Guess that will be my lunch for tomorrow. :-)"

"reviewBody": "AMAZING! what I did to make this so much easier..\nfirst I did not roll the shells, I layered them like a casserole. I boiled the chicken and used the broth adding chicken bullion. Pre packaged mexican cheese. 2 small cans of diced chilis (this added so much great flavor). I did not dip the first batch of shells in the sauce .\nI made sauce, poured some down in the empty dish and smoothed it around, fried tortillas slightly and I honestly think this is a must even thought it is a huge process(fried tortillas have a different taste and consistency). Then I layered the first shells , and flipped the first shells around in the sauce that was already in the dish, meat, cheese, fry next batch, dip is sauce, layer on top, rest of the sauce plus heavy cream, then 1/2 of second pack of cheese on on top , green onion and bake 20 min. = restaurant style enchiladas to die for.\n***Also the reason I even tried this recipe was because I was tired of throwing away tortilla shells that were broken in the package. So this is an excellent recipe for people like me who always have a lot of broken shells and can't use them for tacos, save'em and make this meal."

I cheated and used canned chicken because I had a bunch in the pantry, and they STILL tasted amazing. If your enchiladas can survive canned chicken, you know they can survive just about anything!"

I found that awkward the first time I made them. I poured some salsa into the bottom of the casserole dish, and put a spoonful of salsa on each tortilla before adding the chicken and cheese. They were much easier to handle being dry on the outside and pouring the salsa over them in the casserole got the outside of each enchilada. My girlfriend and I loved it and will make it again for sure."
