I made this recipe exactly as written except had to use jalapeño pepper instead of serrano. Not by choice, just all the serrano peppers were gone. (I did remove the seeds to reduce the heat). I also only added half the water as stated for the sauce to speed up the reduction time. SO very good and I had one leftover that I had the next day. I was sure it would be kind gross and soggy. NOT the case! Maybe not as great as day 1, but still super good. The Mexican Crema is very important. Has a big of a sweet cream flavor — unlike sour cream. Can’t wait to make them again for company!!"

"reviewBody": "I have made this I think 6 times now in the last few months. I'm actually kind of a novice cook but it doesn't at all seem laborious or time-consuming to me. Maybe I was just born to cook Mexican food (I for sure was born to eat it!). :D\n\nCouple notes I'd make:\n\n-I was born in California and grew up eating spicy Mexican food, but 2 whole serranos is plenty (assuming you don't de-seed them). 3 makes it quite a bit more spicy than is comfortable for most people.\n-You can easily cut the bouillon in half without losing flavor. Helps to keep the sodium level reasonable.\n-I ladle on tons of salsa at every step: drenching the chicken before I roll the enchilada, again on top of the enchilada before I put the other toppings on, and once again over everything, just in case. My plate is swimming in salsa, and it's amazing. (And it still leaves you with tons of leftover salsa for leftovers or chilaquiles the next morning!)\n-I've discovered that Greek yogurt works very well as a substitute for crema (similar consistency and tanginess).\n\nI made it today (again!) on lockdown with COVID-19 circulating and so couldn't source cilantro or lettuce. Both really do help with adding flavor and texture, but it was still amazing. :)"

I went to my local Mexican market for their in-store made cojita cheese, to make it true to recipe. I even bought a delicious rotisserie chicken from them. The only things I did differently - I used only 1 cup of water, which was enough to keep the sauce with some thickness. Also, after I wrapped all of the enchiladas, before adding any additional sauce, cheese or crema, I put them in a 400 degree oven for 12 minutes, so I could serve them hot. Then put them on a bed of lettuce, topping them with more sauce, cheese, a little crema, along with cilantro, cheese and avocado. Light and healthy summer's end supper."

The second time I made this I made two small changes, I used just a bit less water because the sauce is pretty watery. I also baked the assembled enchiladas for about 10 minutes at 425 just to make sure everything was good and hot. This might be one of my favorite recipes I've ever used from Allrecipes."

Like my mother that just goes into the fridge and brings out a bunch of items and 30 mins later we have a great meal. I need to follow instructions (LOL).... Well I followed these instructions and it came out GREAT!!!!!! Going forward I will make the sauce ahead of time so that the following day I just have to just roll the tortillas. They do get a little cold especially since I'm a little slow. :) But I place them all in a casserole dish and then placed it in the oven for about 12mins. Cheese was melted added more sauce and Yummmmmm!!!!! Looking forward to making this again."

So after reading all the 5 star reviews I went out and bought all the ingredients. \n\nI used only one Serrano pepper; roasted, seeded and stemmed and the sauce was far to hot for company or even me.\n\nWhile making the sauce I dipped my little finger in to see if I need to ad more peppers and threw the entire batch down the garbage disposal.

I added a ton of honey and yogurt and chicken broth to try to tone it down and that didn't even work. I had to run to the store and buy store bought enchilada sauce. Also it's way too much mexican crema, I drizzled it and probably only used a quarter of it, as it would have been way too much. Also I put them in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes to melt the cheese a bit which was great. I will make again but with lots of little changes."

We followed the recipe as closely as we could, the only changes we made were we used chicken breasts left over from a recent cookout, and we used plain greek yogurt for the crema because we couldn't find it at any market around here.\n\nThe end result was delicious, for sure. But we (my wife and I) had to make an assembly line to assemble everything at the end. It took us almost 2 hours to prepare. I had planned to have dinner ready when she got home, but there was no way I could have completed this alone and have it still be hot and fresh.\n\nSo I give it 4 stars because it has a truly wonderful flavor. But I will not make it again, because the ingredients are too hard to find, the kitchen was destroyed after I was done (too many bowls, pans, trays etc to clean up), and the sheer effort required to make it."

I use home made corn tortillas when making enchiladas of any sort or tacos etc. but especially for green enchiladas. The other thing as for the chicken. I usually boil a whole chicken for the stock and shred the chicken for the enchiladas. I use the stock for the sauce and I use the left over stock for my Mexican rice instead of water. Its more work but I think the secret to any fantastic Mexican dish is using home made tortillas. Also if I can't make them we have a tortilla company here in town and I usually go and buy them warm there to use for our enchiladas."

I use the verde sauce for making chile verde almost weekly. I adjust the garlic and serranos, more garlic and usually only 2 serranos. I don't have a griddle so I first used the broil setting in my oven then I started putting my tomatillos in the oven for around 20min first then adding my serranos and garlic and turning the broil on. Love the way the flavor comes out!! It's been amazing every time! I've actually got tomatillos on my counter now, I'll be making this tomorrow!"
