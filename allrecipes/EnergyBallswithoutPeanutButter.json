"reviewBody": "Really great little energy bites! Thoroughly enjoyed the flavor! When I've made energy balls in the past, I've never added additional sweetener--I usually just rely on the dates for that--so I only added a little at a time until I got the sweetness-level that I personally enjoy, and that allowed these to still be formed into balls (about a 1/4 cup total). My one issue with these was with the addition of the mini chocolate chips. They did NOT want to stick into these things, and it was a fight to get them in there. I also couldn't imagine adding a full cup of them. I used a 1/4 cup and that seemed to be more than enough--but that could just be my taste preference as well. I also realized too late that I'd forgotten the raisins, but will definitely add them next time. Using a 1.5 tbsp scoop, this made 23 balls for me. Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make them again!"
