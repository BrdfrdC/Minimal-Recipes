I always double the recipe (10 cups of flour) and use 4 cups of Whole wheat flour in place of unbleached white flour. I also add Chia seeds, sunflower seeds or flax meal to boost the nutritional content about 2 tablespoons each. I also use powdered milk since I make over 40 loaves during the months of November and December to give away. I don't use an electric beater, just use a really large bowl and a big slotted spoon. Easy bread to make and super delicious!"

"reviewBody": "I love love love English muffins, and living in Guatemala the only ones I can get are at McDonalds!! So this recipe seemed to be a good solution. I like the fact that they are one of the quickest yeast breads I have ever made, canister to oven in about an hour, and no-knead is always a plus. I only needed about 4 1/2 cups of flour for a good stiff batter. I didn't have any corn meal -- almost impossible to find here -- so I sprayed the pans and used oatmeal flakes in place of the cornmeal. That worked well. \n\nBut the batter stuck horribly to the plastic wrap and peeled off a big chunk of each loaf so they were only about 1 1/2 inch tall loaves. Flavor is good, and they are great toasted, but smaller than I wanted. Maybe more flour?? Texture was great with lots of holes and spaces for butter. I made three small loaves and one is already gone from last night, and two more are in the freezer. Gonna love em. And will make it again, probably adding a bit more flour."

When I found this recipe, I was cautiously optimistic, but still halved the recipe because I was nervous about how it would turn out. I used whole wheat flour and it took longer than 45 minutes to raise to double. Aside from those things, I followed all instructions as written. \n\nI just toasted a piece to try it out...and now I'm on my way back to the kitchen to make another batch - one loaf for my freezer and one to give for the Secret Santa at work. This is a fantastic recipe and will be a staple at our house."

One of the reviews said that the final product should be more like batter than dough. If that is true, there's no way I could add in all the flour. I left half a cup out to keep it on the batter-ee side of things. It was very moist and toasted nicely. Just didn't really taste like anything really. Certainly not like English muffin. I will say it was extremely easy to make and made a decent vehicle for the topping of your choice."

"reviewBody": "This is much the same as the recipe provided by King Arthur Flour's web site for one loaf, with two exceptions; for one loaf, two tablespoons olive oil is added, plus it calls for 1/4 teaspoon baking soda, twice the amount called for in this recipe. All other items are reduced by half.\n\nI don't know how it would be possible to \"spoon\" the \"batter\" into anything. I have made this bread six or eight times, and it always forms a firm round of dough in the bowl. Trying to \"spoon\" it would only result in the spoon being firmly contained in the dough. Be prepared to use dough hooks on your mixer.\n\nLet the bread cool completely before putting into any kind of container. I find \"sealing\" the bread into an air-tight container results in the loaf developing a soggy characteristic. If it lasts that long. Folks in my house want a slice before it can ever get cool, or toasted."

Dough is very sticky and I found greasing my hands and then using them to spread the dough in the pans worked great. I haven't had it toasted yet, but looking forward to it. A bit on the heavy side as breads go, but fine for an English muffin type bread. Good flavor. Would make this again."

"reviewBody": "I devised a bread machine version that worked well. First, I heated the milk and water mixture in the microwave. (Cautionary note: make sure to stir the water carefully-I noted a 20-degree difference in temp between the bottom and top of the bowl). I added _all_ the dry ingredients (including the 6 cups of flour) to the bread machine pan, then added the heated milk and water mixture just before the machine started mixing. _After_ the very warm liquid and dry ingredients had combined to an extent, I added 3 teaspoons of rapid-rise yeast. \n\nThe volume of the dough was just right for a bread machine, and the mix was a good consistency and easy for the machine to handle. I allowed the dough to rise a bit in the bread machine pan before removing it, dividing it, and placing it in the two bread pans. \n\nWhen this bread bakes at 400 degrees, the top crust browns very quickly. (A typical bread baking temperature is 350 degrees). I took the loaves out of the oven at 20 minutes after I noted that the crust was quite browned, but when I made the first slice, I noted that the bread interior wasn't optimally done. Next time I will leave it in for the full 25 minutes even if the top crust has turned very dark brown. \n\nLike every English Muffin loaf, this bread is meant to be toasted. Toasting gives it a fine, crispy crumb. Enjoy it with butter and jam."

Cut the recipe in half and since I planned on making it in my bread machine I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the water and baking soda. Added 2 tbsp soft butter. Also heated the milk in the microwave to 150F but added cold water to bring temp down. Looked perfect coming out of the machine and the texture and taste were perfect! Will be making often."

Had all the knooks and cranies you would expect from an English muffin. The only thing I did different was to add only 5 cups of flour. I think adding that last cup would have been too much. The baking time of 25 minutes was also right on. I will be making this one often. Thanks for the recipe!"

I've never nuked it, always baked it and it's always been fabulous! My whole family has this recipe so they can make their own...we love it. I make it for 2 of us and cut the loaves in half, wrap in tin foil then freeze. On the weekends...take foil off, wrap in paper towel, nuke it for 1 minute on high....ready to slice and toast!"

Finally, to make it a little healthier I only use 1 tsp of salt (you'll never notice a difference!) \n\nWhen baking I like to put tin-foil over the loaves after 10 minutes of baking and leave on for the remaining 15. Loaves still get crunchy but not quite as dark on top. This recipe is a keeper! :)"

I use 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 4 cups of bread flour, I think the wheat flour gives it just a little more flavor. It is a quick and easy recipe, the hardest part is getting it out of the bowl and into the pans, a spoonula makes it a little easier. It always amazes me how perfect the loaves come out after raising and baking, no matter how sloppy it looked going into the pans!"

Even with two-day shipping time, it's still perfect for toasting when they receive it. A good all-purpose breakfast and sandwich bread to have around the house all the time."

It was a hard piece of dough and the instructions said pour the batter. Well, this was no batter, it was a hard rock. I let it rise, well that didn't work. My yeast was fresh. So, like I said, not sure what went wrong. Don't think I'll be trying this again. UPDATE***** I made this again this morning after much discussion on the Recipe Exchange about what happened my first time. I heated the milk/water very carefully and it turned out PERFECT. Sorry for the first review being bad, it was all my fault. My picky husband even commented on how good this was. I toasted it and served with Ham &amp; Potato Soup from this site. Delish!!"

These make the yeast jump and preserve the bread - not that it lasts long enough to go stale.

Much easier than using a coffee can, my family love them sooo much that I always have to make a double batch, one for my father-in-law (who always happens to stop by when he hears Im making it) and one batch for us so that I might get some for myself.

"reviewBody": "This is the exact recipe my aunt has been using for years and we go crazy whenever she gives us a loaf. It's fantastic. Some tips for beginner bakers: This bread is perfect for beginners...it's very simple and there is no kneeding involved. You can use an instant read thermometer when warming your milk in a saucepan. It just needs to be somewhere between 120 and 130 degrees. Crisco works well for greasing the pans. Don't use a hand mixer to mix the dough..it's far too sticky. Use a Kichenaid mixer with a dough hook (switch to the dough hook AFTER the second round of flour goes in). If you don't have a Kitchenaid, you can use a cuisinart with the dough blade...it works just as well. If you have neither, you can mix it by hand, but that's sort of a pain. After you divide the dough into the pans (and before it starts to rise), sprinkle a little more cornmeal on top for more of an english muffin look. The bread is best toasted! We usually eat it with just butter, pb &amp;j, or cream cheese. Oh..and I bake it at 425 instead of 400 because I like a crispier crust."
