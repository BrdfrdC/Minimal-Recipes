Definitely an anytime dish and great as leftovers-not solely for breakfast. I tweaked the recipe a bit, reduced the servings since there was only 3 of us eating the dish. Even though I used the whole can of chilis (put a spoonful on top of each muffin with the sausage and mixed the remainder with eggs &amp; sour cream) and reduced the eggs, there was enough liquid to soak into the muffins and bake them up to their tasty goodness."

The ingredients cost me all of $14 at Aldi. This makes a good sized, well filled 13 x 9 casserole dish. It went fast yet again! Was just glad I could get a little portion for myself before it was gone. Note: Only 1 pkg. of the 12 oz English muffins is needed. I cut the muffins into 6 slices after buttering and pile them across the bottom of the casserole dish for nice bite size pieces. I double the amount of green chilies. I had extra brown and serve sausage links - warmed them up, sliced them thinly and threw them in with the cooked pork sausage."

The problem was that I didnt read it all (surprise!) before I started to cook and realized we needed to chill it over night. Boo hoo. So we collectively decided that we would give it a shot anyway and only chilled it for about 30 minutes. It turned out great. Everyone loved it. We added extra eggs like some users mentioned and that worked too. Appreciate all the feedback and hope my experiment with NOT chilling overnight (like it was clearly explained in the recipe) still made this A-ok! Good luck and thanks for sharing."

"reviewBody": "I had to make an unexpected breakfast with the items that I had on hand and this recipe was perfect and adaptable! First, I defrosted a 12 oz. pack of Johnsonville Chipotle Monterey Jack Cheese Chicken Sausage in cold water. Meanwhile, I buttered a Pyrex dish and put two halved whole wheat English muffins in the dish. I melted a little butter in the microwave and brushed the muffins lightly with butter (next time, I will omit the butter, the rest of the ingredients makes it creamy and the butter won't be missed). I halved and divided the cheddar cheese and mozzarella cheese then I mixed the 4 eggs and ¾ c. light sour cream in a separate bowl and set it aside. I didn't have the chilies on hand therefore I omitted them. Next, I took the thawed sausages and cut off the skin, chopped, and browned/cooked in a pan. Since the sausages were frozen, I probably only used 10 oz. of meat after I skinned and ground them.\r\n \r\nWe each ate one serving (1/2 of a muffin plus all the goodies) and refrigerated one serving each for breakfast the next day. DELICIOUS! It was a perfect leftover! \r\n\r\nI cooked at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. Next time, I will probably decrease the cooking time by 5 minutes since the edges were brown. But, still YUMMY!"

Otherwise, followed the recipe as written. The 35 minute bake time was still perfect for a smaller version of this recipe. If doing this again, we would alter the egg/sour cream/green chili mixture by adding chopped mushrooms and onions, reduce or omit the butter, and sub Canadian bacon for the sausage. We will make the modified version again. Thank you for sharing, amycheryl."

I made the recipe exactly as it was written with the exception of only using one package of English muffins. \n It wasn’t dry like some breakfast casseroles can be. I think the addition of sour cream really played a role in that. The green chilies added a nice subtle flavor. If you really like green chilies you could definitely use two cans and make it a more prominent flavor. I made this for a work brunch and it was gone in no time!"

I did use bacon instead of sausage, to me it's just a better flavor and less greasy.\nI do hate to change recipes around, but I omitted the green chilies. I'll make this over &amp; over again."

I actually used a stale bread braid bc it was too hard to eat any other way, so went looking for a strata. It worked perfectly. I also just used sausage patties and cut them into pieces. I'd be willing to try this with English Muffins; I like the idea, and I think it would work very well. I'll keep this one to try completely as written! thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "So very good! Made this last night and baked this morning....love these kind of casseroles. I used whole wheat English muffins and yes 1 pk is way more than enough. I actually was one muffin shy of a full pk and I even had to cut some in half to fit around the edges of my 9x13. I used 7 whole eggs and 3 egg whites (had leftover whites in the fridge), used cheese and garlic chicken sausage out of the casing and crumbled. I think next time I will use 2 cans of diced green chilies....they really add a great flavor to this. All in all there is hardly any left as everyone had seconds....thank you!"

Unfortunately I have no idea how to go in to the recipe and change that! So, hopefully people will read the reviews. If not, they'll have a leftover package of English muffins!"

"reviewBody": "This is a delicious breakfast casserole! It is very simple to make, but only requires ONE package of English Muffins - not two. There are 8 English Muffins in a pack and when they are split open you have 16 halves which is more than enough to cover the bottom of the pan, so I think there was a typo in the recipe. But the layers of muffins on the bottom makes the perfect buttery \"crust\" and it was just perfect to pop in the oven on a busy morning for company or during the holidays! I will be making this often - very delicious and easy!"
