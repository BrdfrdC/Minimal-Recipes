I find I need to sift the baking soda with the flour beforehand because I find little \"baking soda bombs\" randomly in the finished scones (ewwww). Just before baking I popped the shaped dough into the freezer for 5 min. I was able to cut the triangles out individually and bake them separate from each other. Delicious!"

As others noted, 3 TBS of orange juice is not near enough liquid to bind the dough. I also agree that orange juice did not add much in the way of flavor. Adding zest would be a good idea. I would go with heavy cream next time for the liquid as well. I would also use a full stick of butter . And why is this recipe written so funny - for Brits maybe Maybe something did not translate well."

I should’ve known better, but I was in a hurry and banking on all the good reviews. The dough would not hold together, so I upped the juice to 6 tbs. The scones didn’t rise and are a bit more like hockey pucks than scones. The texture is hard to describe. Not hard, but not soft either and a bit gummy. They are still edible, as they are full of chocolate and sugar, but just barely."

I used a small canning jar lid to size them and 12 minutes was perfect timing wise. They tasted like chocolate chip biscuits (as expected).

I used my hands to mix the butter / dry ingredients mixture, and then used a spoon to quickly mix in the orange juice &amp; chocolate chips (stirring only for a total of about 10 seconds). Then right away spooned out onto parchment paper and formed into an (approximately) 2-inch tall round, cut into 8 pieces (pie style), separated the pieces out so they would cook evenly, and baked at 400 for about 14-15 minutes total. MMM! I rated 4 stars only because I had to change the amounts. The flavor was delicious though!"

I also didn't have a scone pan, so I rolled each piece into a ball and then flattened them on the cookie sheet. They baked beautifully!"

It took twice the amount of orange juice she listed to make the dough and I added 6 minutes to the bake time to get the nice holden brown color as well. I used cruising in place of the chocolate chips and I added the zest from the orange, the flavor was delicious! I will use it again with the changes I've made."

We loved this recipe and I will bake my own scones from now on. One tip: I formed a large round and cut out slices, like a pizza. Those little edges crisp up a bit, and they're fun to dunk in coffee or tea."

"reviewBody": "I like this recipe. It is simple with few ingredients. It comes out tasty. I pretty much follow the recipe as it is and maybe add just a bit more OJ, but I do like my scones crumbly so I try not to over moisten it. It does help if you use your hands to mix the dough then you wind up needing less OJ or Butter. I gave it four stars because it is not the absolute best tasting scone I've ever had, just above average. However, the easy of making it makes it a good recipe for me and you can also add other ingredients if you like such as chopped nuts or fruit. I also do not go through the whole rolling the dough and the cookie cutter. I just pat them down on the backing sheet into relatively the same size and thickness as described in the recipe."

Also, I used a small Pampered Chef rolling pin and pressed the dough into a 9x9 glass dish. I cut it into quarters, then cut three triangles into each quarter. I took the triangles out and placed them on a greased cookie sheet. It was so easy!"

After following the recipe and adding the orange juice, I did not have a dough but a pile of dry ingredients with a few coarse looking crumbs. I ended up having to add more orange juice, more butter, and also a tablespoon of heavy cream to make it resemble a normal scone dough. I would not suggest using this recipe."

There is NO way this would have worked with the crumbs I had at 3 tbs. of orange juice, which knocks the recipe down another star. After this correction, the scones were pretty tasty, but the texture wasn't your traditional scone texture, which isn't surprising considering the liquid is orange juice instead of buttermilk or cream. They were good enough to make 2 batches, but overall not my favorite scone recipe."

HOWEVER - I did do a few things sorta differently due to ingredients and prior scone making experience - 8Tbspn of butter (if salted, reduce the salt in recipe by 1/2) cut into pea size chunks and 'pinched' into the flour mixture by hand. Then I used semi sweet chocolate chopped coarsely instead of chips and used 4Tbspn of OJ AND 3 TBspn of 1/2 &amp; 1/2 or heavy cream. Made a large round circle and cut into triangles and separated before baking. YUM!!!!!!!"

She suggested increasing the butter to 8 TBSP., OJ to 8 TBSP., and included the zest of half an orange. It was awesome. I enjoy the orange scones from Panera. This recipe is wonderful and almost identical to Panera's if you leave out the chocolate chips and make the changes I have included. I also created an orange glaze for the scones. This scone recipe is a great base for variations of flavors. One of the best recipes I have accessed from the Internet and was not disappointed in the least!"

Since I've never made scones, I didn't know if I was just supposed to work with the dough and that it would still work out, but I simply added more juice.

Because I was adjusting the amount of liquid so much, the biscuit-style dough ended up being a bit tough. These are almost too sweet, I may also reduce the amount of sugar next time. I will have to make them again because my wife loves them and I may have to hide them if I want any! I used a pastry knife to cut the disk into square pieces, which gives nice browned corners.\n\nI have since tried this using 8 tbsp (1/2 cup) each of butter and water (which works if you don't have orange juice handy), cutting into squares as before. This batch turned out much better and made a lot less mess!"

These stayed the same size and seemed dense and flavor-less.\r\nLike other reviewers, I had to add WAY more OJ to get the dough to come together, probably due to the lack of cream and eggs.
