Determined to try again, I went back to the original recipe and kept my heat on medium. I cooked it in a nonstick pan, and I added the two tablespoons of corn syrup as suggested in other reviews. As it got towards the end, I put my candy thermometer in and watched as it closely approached 300 degrees. I pulled it off and immediately spread Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips and some lightly salted, roasted, Dimond almonds that I had chopped finely. This time the result was superb and I will definitely make this again!"

I have always put in the almonds at the very end, say about 30 seconds before the temp reaches 300, (which should be included in the recipe for those that do not know the hard crack temp). This time I added the almonds about half way through and as I suspected, they burned. Also I had the separation issue but it was still cooking and it eventually came together before the hard crack stage. But I really suggest adding in your almonds near the end of the cooking process to prevent scorching or burning. It's still edible, but just has a slightly burned/scorched taste."

Muscle up because your arm does get a workout! That's fine though; this recipe is an unbelievable crowd pleaser!\nP.S. This is the first time I've ever rated a recipe!"

"reviewBody": "THE BEST! These was addicting delicious. I used a non stick pot to cook the butter/sugar and found a couple things important to remember. 1. Use a whisk - I was using a nonstick pot so I used a silicone whisk a- it helps to keep the butter and sugar mixed together and slow it from cracking into an oily mess. Also constantly whisk/stir - it keep everything incorporated. 2. Let the toffee cool somewhat before adding the chocolate to the top. You don't need to wait long - 2 minutes is plenty. Just long enough that it isn't molten lava. Waiting for it to slightly set means you have chocolate on TOP of your toffee instead of inside it. 3. Play with your toppings. Keep the chocolate but while the chocolate is still melted - you can add toasted nuts (always toasted if not you are doing it wrong), sea salt, crushed pretzels, (I even saw someone add rosemary and sea salt). I used this as a cookie swap \"cookie\" and everyone asks me to bring it year after year. Easy and delicious!"

I followed it to a T this time (with the exception of doubling it and adding nuts to top instead of in batch), and it still separates at the end. (Maybe my candy thermometer is a little off? Or maybe I should use less butter if doubling...not sure). Anyway I was going to give this a 4 star but I've made it every Christmas season for the past six years since I found the recipe, so I think that deserves 5 stars because it must be doing something right."

Here’s the key missing element: it’s not humidity, it’s how hot you get the mixture – it must get over 300F, close to burning. Here are a few more helps: First, stir and keep stirring to the end. Second, one clue that you are close to done you will smell a slight wisp of the mixture burning. I typically keep going for a minute after that and then quickly put it into my buttered Pyrex dish. Third, as you cook the butter/sugar mixture once it gets boiling the appearance will change twice. At first it doesn't seem to be mixed, the butter floats on top, and it changes to be kind of a silvery shimmery mixture that clings to the side of the pot. That mixture will then change turning medium brown, look a little greasy, and not cling to the side of the pot so much as you stir it. When that starts you are close to being done. Stir for a minute of two more unless you smell it burning. I hope this helps you."

Definitely a must so there's no sugar residue remaining. Needed to make another batch because after posting this on fb my neighbor wanted it - all of it Lol. This is so easy and quick :) a fool proof recipe that totally melts in your mouth-AaaaMazing!"

"reviewBody": "This is a pretty good basic recipe. I like my toffee more buttery so I use equal parts butter and sugar. You will also want to use more water (I use 1/4 cup to 1 cup sugar) so that the the toffee hardens more slowly. I make toffee every Christmas and it is ALWAYS damp where I live, so I thought I'd share some tips: 1) Always make sure toffee is a full 310 degrees (hard crack stage) before pouring! 300 is OK in dry weather, but go hotter if it's damp. Otherwise it will be gummy. 2) in damp weather, transfer to the fridge to set as soon as you can. The toffee will \"sweat\" a bit so Blot it with a paper towel once it's hardened. 3) store in air-right containers, preferably in the fridge."

Kept heat (on gas cook top) between medium and medium low using an iron skillet. It took about 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Poured in a lined 9 X 13 pan, patted some nuts in, sprinkled with chocolate chips, spread once melted and topped with more nuts, again pressing nuts into chocolate. Once the color becomes brown it will thicken like a roux. That is when I took it off heat. Will make this again very soon. Also I used more nuts than called for."

The trick is to keep your heat LOW and use a good stainless steel pan. This way you don't have to stir as much and that will keep the sugar and the butter from separating. You should only have to stir toward the end every few minutes or so. Do not stir constantly. Don't worry it won't burn. Just let it do it's thing."

"reviewBody": "This is similar to the toffee I've made each Christmas for friends and family since the '80s. I use 1 lb of good quality butter, 2C sugar, a small bag of slivered almonds and 1 'giant' Hershey bar for each batch. That's it - no water. Cook butter/sugar at medium low in a heavy pan (I use the pan of my pressure cooker). Cook til it almost reaches hard crack stage and then add all almonds, let cook til hard crack and then pour quickly onto large piece of aluminum foil (I spread it on my kitchen table and put a towel under it). Spread as thinly as possible as it will harden as you're spreading. (My end result is thinner than the picture shown.)Break chocolate bar into pieces, let it sit a few minutes and then spread over the hardened candy. I let it sit overnight and then break into pieces and store in tins. Tips: only use high quality, brand name butter and let it soften first at room temp. Stir occasionally at first and then as it starts to change consistency and especially as it starts to change color, stir constantly, using a wooden spoon. I don't have a candy thermometer but determine its readiness by 1) color (coffee with moderate amount of cream) AND 2) stream a bit of the toffee from the pan into a cup of ice water - if it makes a brittle piece of candy instantly, it's ready. Don't put almonds in too early as they will burn. Re butter separating, I've had that happen a couple of times but I just stirred briskly as I was pouring onto foil to incorporate."

While this recipe was edible, it did not taste like the English Toffee I know and love. After the sugar hardened, there was a lot of oily substance in the pan, I suspect from all the butter. It didn't turn out like something you could hand out without napkins or package up and give as gifts because it was way too greasy, and frankly, didn't taste all that much like English Toffee.

My niece and I tried it, and the first batch burnt. It was because I got nervous because the sugar wasn't melting at first, and I think I turned the fire up too high. Well, after tossing that batch, we tried it again, this time with the fire kept very low,allowing the sugar to melt slowly and stirring every few minutes. We used raw almonds and roasted them in the oven separately. While the sugar was melting, we let the almonds cool. Once they were cool, I rough chopped them. I didn't add the almonds to the toffee until right before I poured it onto the cookie sheet. It turned out wonderful!! I was soooo proud and happy we tried it again. I will definitely be making this treat for the holidays."

The first time it separated and I hadn't read the reviews to know there is a remedy for this. drained off the top and the bottom stuff made good toffee. I just finished my second batch. First I calibrated my candy thermometer, it was about 15 degrees low, ok. Took it slow and easy. I started getting concerned when it began to boil, I thought the froth on top was coming over and got another pan ready, not needed. Finally it began to turn color about 225 degrees. Thermometer 15 degrees low? finally about 235 I felt it would be burning if I didn't get it out of there. I had a cup of ice water with me to test it, and it was granulated. Well, I am forging ahead, I may have to try it again. I had to laugh at some of the superstitions, like stirring it only clockwise and only making it in dry humidity. I live in Colorado, 20% is a humid day here."

"reviewBody": "I gave it one star so it's easy to find help when people have problems making it. It's not greasy! If you are saying your toffee is \"greasy\" that means it SEPARATED! I have read that when it does that, you can add 1 TABLESPOON of HOT water at a time (no more than 5 of them) until the mixture comes back together. DO NOT make toffee when it is raining or snowing. You will not get crunchy candy. You will get chewy candy that sticks to your teeth. Use BUTTER (not margarine, crisco, etc.). Don't cook it too fast. Goes from done to burnt in a few seconds (as fast as it takes to count 4 mississippis!). Hope that helps. Also, use a deep pot. If you don't, the mix will bubble up and over the pot while cooking. Candy is very tricky, and can still separate for reasons nobody knows."

A couple things I changed per reviews were replacing 2 Tbs of butter with corn syrup to prevent sugar crystallization and I followed the instructions to melt the butter then keep it on the lower side of medium for the rest of the time giving the butter time to incorporate with the sugar. Also, I used Parchment Paper instead of buttering the large cookie sheet which worked perfectly. The only change I'll make next time is a touch of vanilla. I did use a candy thermometer watching it rise to 310 before pulling off the burner which resulted in a perfect crunch with zero burn issues."
