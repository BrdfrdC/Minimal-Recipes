To be honest (TBH), I eyeballed the quantities based on 290 g chickpeas and frozen blocks of spinach: Used 1 whole onion and about 6 cloves of garlic. I could see it with an Indian spice blend, instead of straight cumin. I'd consider using nutritional yeast or pareve (non meat) chicken soup powder instead of the cumin."

In an effort to reduce sodium, we use low-sodium garbanzos (Kuner's No Salt Added Garbanzos, if that helps). We're not nutritionists, though :-)"

This is an excellent side dish or a vegan entree."

I too added some Smoked Spanish Paprika but I also thought oregano or rosemary would be great addition also. Before serving I mixed in some lemon juice and parsley, because it begs for acid. \nTake aways:\nGreat solid dish to build upon--probably have these ingredients in many pantrys.\nPairs well with many dishes.\nAdd your favorite acid: lemon or lime juice, wine, etc...\nAdd the spinach towards the end to let the beans cook before spinach gets too wilty."

I cooked the onion with some red pepper flakes before cooking down the spinach half way and then added the beans and about a 1/4 c of broth. Let it simmer until the chickpeas were tender and smashed. Little lemon. Omg best and simplest veg meal I've ever cooked and it reminds me of being in andalucia. Thank you!"

I would like to try this again, and add a little something. What to add? I'm not sure. Still, it's definitely a worthwhile recipe, and I did enjoy it."

I thought the cumin and the spinach went really well together, but this didn't surprise me--cumin is one of the spices that make palak paneer so delicious! I didn't smash the beans, but I might next time. I might also add a bit of lemon juice or tomato next time. I honestly never bother draining frozen spinach--nine times out of ten the recipe tells you to add water anyway, so why bother? Or else I find I need to add some because things are too dry. Anyway, this was simple to make and tasted great."

The video recommended a sprinkle of lemon juice at the end, which does enhance the flavors magically. I used a bunch of fresh spinach and removed the stems, then chopped it all. I also added 1/4 tsp paprika after reading one of the reviews (might try more next time). I added the spices with the garlic, added a little water to keep it from sticking to the pan, and then added the chickpeas after about a minute of spices cooking. I mashed most of the beans before adding the spinach."

I followed the recipe with some exceptions: I omitted the cumin, instead of onions, I used onion powder. Based on previous reviews about a bit of dryness at the end of cooking, I combined a couple of reviewer's suggestions and added a splash of lemon juice and cream to finish. I used heavy cream. Why heavy cream? Because it's delicious and heavy cream will not curdle with acidic foods or liquids. I also seasoned with salt to taste after adding the salt from the recipe. I enjoyed something new and will be making this again!"

"reviewBody": "Absolutely delicious! I added cauliflower and baby bella mushrooms. I also substituted pinto beans for the garbanzo beans since that was all I had. I sauteed the onions in the olive oil for a few minutes, then added cauliflower florets. After about 5 minutes, I added the garlic, spinach, and beans and added a tablespoon of chicken broth. I covered it and simmered until spinach was wilted. I added various seasoning to taste and spiced it up a bit with a pinch of habanero seasoning. I am trying to decrease my intake of meat and eat more beans for protein and this served as a main dish for me and is quite fulfilling. This will become a staple. Thanks for a simple and great recipe!!!"

Today I tried putting 1/4 t. cumin and 1/4 teaspoon curry powder (both a bit scant) and I think I found the winning combination. If you have never tried this, 1/4 t. curry is not enough that you consider the dish a curry dish but it gives the dish a tasty flavor."
