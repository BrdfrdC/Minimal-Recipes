"reviewBody": "I am a great cookie/baker, it‚Äôs my specialty. Had a request for oatmeal, and decided to try a new recipe, after using a couple others from this site for years. This is hands-down the BEST oatmeal cookie recipe, the caveat being to use the alterations in the comments (extra flour and oats, less salt, baked at 350¬∞), along with using 1/2 shortening, 1/2 butter. I portioned out my cookies onto a cookie sheet using a Pampered Chef scoop- it makes big cookies. I refrigerated overnight, and baked right from the fridge. Halfway through I used a fork to lightly flatten the cookies, then returned to the oven. Mine took approx 15 minutes to bake, I pulled when the edges were very light brown and let them cool on the cookie sheet. The texture is off-the-charts; both crispy and chewy. I added walnuts and dried fruit (raisins, crans, blueberries, cherries), and a little almond extract in addition to the vanilla. I double the recipe, portion, refrigerate, then baggie up and freeze. Thanks for the great recipe!!!"

Not too sweet as I thought they might be when I saw the amount of sugar, chewy inside with a crispy edge, and not too oily or dry, just the right amount of moisture for my taste. I think I will continue to use this as my go-to oatmeal cookie recipe. And I just might try adding a few dried cranberries and ginger! The recipe seems versatile enough to be able to change it up if you want to experiment. Thanks for posting!"

"reviewBody": "I followed this recipe exactly. The cookies are really delicious. Mine turned out both crispy and chewy. I think they have a nice sweetness but are not overly sweet. I found that if I used a dark metal baking sheet, the cookies baked more quickly. And I found that using an air-baking sheet required a longer baking time. Like another reviewer suggested, I tried using a cookie scoop to measure an equal amount for each cookie. After I scooped the dough, I rolled it into a ball and placed the balls on a regular stainless steel baking sheet. Th√®se cookies were perfectly round after baking. They were all a consistent size. I would make this recipe again and I would even include it in my holiday baking. I would even try making bigger cookies to use for making ice cream sandwiches. I think they would be gr√©√¢t with vanilla or strawberry ice cream. Thanks for sharing this gr√©√¢t recipe."

And this is coming from someone who is without her Kitchenaide stand mixer and oven right now!! I whipped this recipe up by hand, and baked the cookies in my Black and Decker toaster oven. I had to let the cookies bake a little longer (about 5-10 minutes more) just because I was using a toaster oven. But my daughter couldn't wait to devour them as soon as they were done!! I divided my batter in half and added raisins to the first half, and chocolate chips to the other half. ??"

One tsp sized spoonfuls is too small though, you end up with cookies that are only an inch and a half wide. Go for a tbsp, it makes a normal sized cookie around 3 or 4 inches wide. Makes great ice cream sandwiches with a little vanilla ice cream."

I cut the recipe in half b/c I was only cooking for one, and added a little more flour based on the other reviews. I know this kind of changed the recipe, but it still turned out with a great flavor and consistency. Mine were a little cruncy on the edges, but the center was moist and soft."

"reviewBody": "An acceptable cookie but not one I'm likely to make again. Given other reviewers' remarks about the cookies being flat I upped the baking soda to 1 teaspoon and that took care of that issue. A teaspoon of salt was too much, and to others who try this recipe I'd recommend using half that. Normally a little salt makes flavors come alive, but in this case I have to think that too MUCH salt has the opposite effect, as these were kind of flat tasting. Finally, since I used chocolate covered raisins instead of walnuts I omitted the cinnamon. But if I had used it, it wouldn't have been two teaspoons, it would be half that as well. Glad I tried this recipe, but for me it's not a keeper."

I pulsed the oats, 1 cup at a time in food processor, until the oats were about 1/2 original size. These cookies were excellent. I will make them the same way next time. I may try pecans next time, although the walnuts were delicious, too. The cookies did \"come apart\" slightly immediately after baking, but they \"came back together\" after cooling. Just use a nice thin, flat spatula to remove from cookie sheet. I tossed in 1/2 cup raisins. Yum! Thanks for sharing, Beatrice."

Next time, I'll cut it to 1/2 tsp. Also, I accidentally added too much soda - a little slopped out over the 1/2 tsp so I had maybe 2/3 tsp of soda. The cookies turned out well."
