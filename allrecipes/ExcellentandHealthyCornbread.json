Put in the oven at 400 degrees for 23 minutes and it was runny in the middle! Put it back in for about 10 more minutes. Completely bland. Will not make again.

I used stevia in place of sugar and the corn completely masked the odd flavor of the stevia. This cornbread is more flavorful than \"sweet\" so don't let the 1/4 cup of sugar put you off if you like a non-sweet version."

"reviewBody": "I used greek yogart and had to add probably 1/2 cup of skim milk. Without the milk it was a dry dough than a batter. Even after the milk I still had to spread it into the pan with a spatula. I also used a preheated cast iron skillet with olive oil in the bottom. This gave it a nice crispy bottom crust. Cooking took closer to 15 minutes than 20 minutes. It turned out really well and has a very pleasant texture. It's not crumbly at all and holds together really well."

I read comments after mine was in the oven and saw others have added almond milk as well. Not sure if it is an ommission in the recipe, but definitely add milk."

Also added a half Tbsp. canola oil. All of these made the recipe moist and hopefully a little healthy with the WW flour and flaxseed meal. Baked them as muffins, so lowered the heat to 375 and baked for 17 minutes. They're just right for a dinner muffin with pulled pork or a breakfast muffin...not too sweet, but sweet enough; nice tender crumb and moist!"

Based on other reviews, I added 1/4 cup honey and am pleased with the slight sweetness in the final result. Fyi, the way I made it is about 150 calories per slice, compared to 225+ from other recipes. Very pleased."

Yield is 12 muffins.\n\nAdditionally I made the following substitutions:\n\nReplace the 1/4 cup sugar with honey\nI used plain nonfat greek yogurt and increased the amount by 1/4 cup to 1 and 1/4 cups yogurt.\n\nAlso, if you'd like an additional kick, add 1/2 - 1 whole jalapeño diced to the batter depending upon taste."

"reviewBody": "I substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for half of the white, used unsweetened almond milk instead of yogurt, replaced the sugar with Splenda and poured it into a hot, oiled cast iron skillet to give it a nice chewy, crispie crust. Baked it only 18 minutes and it was great. My husband never asks me for anything because he doesn't want me in the kitchen late into the evening. But this is one recipe that he will ask for. So I will continue to used this recipe. NOTE: For the hot skillet trick, I put a tablespoon or so of olive oil in my cast iron skillet and slide it into the oven while it's preheating and I'm mixing the batter together. When my batter is ready, I pour it directly into the hot skillet. It should sizzle when you do this! Makes for a great texture."

"reviewBody": "I love this recipe. Since I am diabetic, I must watch sugar intake. I make another recipe from a diabetic cookbook, but so many steps. Recipe got my eye, because it was made with yogurt (which I make my own to control sugars and preservatives). I took suggestions from other reviewers and added couple items as well: 2 tablespoons honey and applesauce; as well as, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder. Next time I might add 1 teaspoon vanilla. Also not sure if other reviewers meant white whole wheat or whole wheat so I made it with 1/2 cup white whole wheat and 1/2 cup white flour. Cornbread was not dry at all. Also I baked at 400 and crust was too brown, and not quite done inside. It could be my countertop oven, but next time will turn down to 350 and bake longer -- possibly 25 -30 mins, or until done. \n\nBut I will make it again -- very, very tasty and so easy to make. Great with chili, or just as desert after dinner with homemade fruit spread."

The finished muffins had good flavor, but the texture was pretty muffin-like, rather than crumbly and cornbread-like. It was a great accompaniment for chili, though, and it did taste pretty good. I would definitely try it again with plain yogurt or by adding some milk with the Greek yogurt."

I also skipped the sugar and added two packets of stevia because I don't like really sweet cornbread. It was moist yet crumbly. Next time I will add the canned corn and some green chilis or jalepenos for spice! This was perfect four soup and chili and I will make it 100 more times!"
