I toasted my walnuts in a skillet, I just sauteed 4 cloves of garlic with the other veggies rather than roasting it first. I deglazed the pan with 1tsp of balsamic vinegar and then subbed some of the salt with miso paste until it was salty enough for my liking. Great base recipe though and delicious as written"

I would say it was a 3-star when I combined the walnut mixture and mushrooms, but then I got crazy and added about 1 T. of half and half. Took it way, way up in my opinion. I also added just a little bit of lemon juice while sauteeing the mushrooms to counter the earthiness, but I was very conservative (since I don't cook with mushrooms too much, I wasn't sure how it would work). Not sure if the lemon juice is registering in the final product, but it's fantastic."

Also we sauteed the mushrooms for a very long time to bring out the natural sweetness. Low and slow produces amazing results."

Only had crimini mushrooms, just shy of 1 cup walnuts so added almonds, only had freezed-dried shallots, dried parsley and thyme. So, added a wee bit of chardonnay to compensate for the dried goods and processed it in my mini-prep processor (it got pretty full). Was short on time so put it in the freezer for about 10 minutes to quickly cool it. Even with all the drawbacks, it was tasty and everyone enjoyed it. Will try it again with correct ingredients and sitting time...am sure it will be over the top!"

Increased roasted garlic paste, shallot/onion, salt, pepper, herbs. Important not to overbrown walnut, but next time think I'll try almonds or almond meal.

This recipe has the potential for endless variations of different nuts and mushrooms, all delicious!\n\nA word about mushrooms: 1-wipe clean with a paper towel to remove any debris. 2-discard the stem, it is \"tougher\" than the cap and may produce a gritty texture in the finished product. 3-initially cook on med-high heat with butter and oil (adding oil increases the smoke point and keeps the butter from burning) to caramelize the mushrooms, (just like caramelized onions, they taste better). Then lower the heat and add non-salted flavored liquid (wine, sherry, etc) and water as necessary to tenderize and finish cooking. \n\nI would also like to clarify the amount of walnuts, I believe it is 1 cup of whole walnuts, not chopped, or diced, so adjust accordingly and use a smaller amount of chopped or diced. Take care not to burn the walnuts!"

"reviewBody": "crazy good! and someday i want to make it exactly as written. however ... i had some shrooms in the fridge that i needed to use up and this recipe caught my eye -- must have been the word \"exotic.\" mine were not, but thought i could sub anyway. oh, wait. walnuts? didn't have any of those either. no shallots. i used regular onions, white and baby bella mushrooms, elephant garlic, all the fresh herbs listed plus sage. for the walnuts -- and this is REALLY nuts! -- i used old-fashioned peanut butter! i made just a little in case it was inedible, but here i sit with my \"woven wheat crackers\" (didn't have french bread!) chowing down like crazy! thanks for the \"exotic\" inspiration!!"

"reviewBody": "Ok, I did not care for this recipe and I LOVE all of the ingrediants. The mushroom mixture was great until I added the walnuts. Even thou I thought that it was not good, I still brought it to the party hoping that it was just my taste buds. No one had more than one bite.\n\nI can't even figure out how to fix it. I really want to give it one star but that would give it a very low star rating and deter other people from trying it out on there own. Maybe it was me...but I don't think so. Look at my other reviews and see that I am usually a very possitve reviewer.\n\nThanks for the recipe."

"reviewBody": "This pate is one of the best dips I've ever had. I sauteed the mushroom ingredients on low, because when cooking with pure butter it burns easily, so I wanted to be careful. I added a splash of white wine, and I slowly cooked the mushrooms for about 45 mins. I also didn't feel like roasting the garlic (it was too hot out), so I added minced garlic to the mushrooms. Next time I'll try it with roast garlic, but it was still fantastic. VERY gourmet, and perfect for a classy event, or wine tasting."
