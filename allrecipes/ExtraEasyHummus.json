I think the trick is to use a really good olive oil the best you can afford to mimic the missing sesame oil taste. Sesame is very potent which is what most people are looking for in a good humus. I used carlino olive oil drizzling the top with extra oil and a sprinkle of sun dried tomatoes. Delicious with vegetables and homemade pita."

Sometimes I choose to increase the garlic, and I almost always sprinkle in a little extra cumin (just because I love it!) My favorite addition was a jar of roasted red peppers, which made the most delicious hummus. I, too, serve it either with veggies or I make my own pita chips to go with it. Thank you so much for this fantastic recipe!"

This recipe TOTALLY eliminates that! \n\nTwo things I did differently. I added 1 TBSP of lemon juice (just the concentrated stuff I had in the fridge) and I used sesame oil instead of olive oil. It gave the finished hummus that sesame taste that is in traditional hummus without having to buy an expensive bottle of tahini.\n\nI've also double the recipe and used 1 TBSP of sesame oil and 1 TBSP of olive oil and saw no difference in the taste. Everyone I've served this too is totally wowed by it."

I used 1.5C of frozen chickpeas that I had previously cooked and just added a bit of water. I used my blendtec twister jar to blend it and it turned out beautifully! Smooth and creamy. Next time I may try adding a little fresh jalapeno."

I would only use 2 if they were small cloves. I used 3 tablespoons of the bean juice and added juice from half of a small lemon which was 1 tablespoon. Be careful with salting this as it is plenty salty to begin with from the beans. I blended it up in the blender tried it out and it was wonderful except for the lack of tahini. I added 2 drops of smoked sesame oil and reblended it. My girlfriend said it was the best hummus she'd ever had."
