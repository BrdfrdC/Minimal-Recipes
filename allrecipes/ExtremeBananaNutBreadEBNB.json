"reviewBody": "This is the best recipe for banana nut bread I've ever made. Of course, being from Texas, I use pecans instead of walnuts. Also added 1 tsp vanilla this time, haven't tasted it yet because the loves are still cooling :). I am thinking about increasing it by half so that the loaves aren't so thin, but this may not be a good idea because the increased baking time may make the outside too done. Anyone have any thoughts on this? Mine fall so much and leave such a trench in the middle that I think next time I'll add a tsp. of lemon to help the baking soda do it's job. These are kind if nitpicky things - the main thing is it's a great recipe!"

I do not separate mine into loaves, I cook in a Bundt pan. I have gotten a great many \"mmms\" when giving this as a gift. It is my most often requested snack from the grandchildren."

The only thing I did different from the recipe was that I used brown sugar and added vanilla extract to it. Plus, I doubled the recipe and it turned out awesome. Some recipes don't like it when you double it so I was taking a chance, but it turned out really well."

Be sure to include the recipe-otherwise you'll be asked to make it constantly (trust me I couldn't keep family and friends supplied!). I believe I do one thing differently. I let my banana's get very ripe. I then put the banana in a freezer bag, (measured for one batch) mash them inside the bag, flatten the mashed banana and freeze them (I think it makes the bread a little darker). When it comes time to indulge or I can't take the begging any longer, I can just pull out a bag from my freezer as it defrosts quickly. I'm a little heavy on the nuts too, just how my family enjoys it. I've yet to add any other ingredients such as chocolate chips for example. This recipe is in my permanent cook book now! My kids and grandchildren will remember me for this moist, rich, tender, nutty bread, just as we remember my mother‚Äôs pumpkin pies! Sorry no picture. It doesn't last long enough! Thanks for Sharing the Recipe!"

I think I will make a homemade caramel icing for the next batch as one of the ladies in my hometown church does this and it is DELICIOUS!!! She even bakes the loaves or uses a Bundt pan and freezes a couple that she can thaw, add the icing for family dinners, church homecomings and be one step ahead!!! Thank you so much for posting!!!"

Also used cinnamon sugar rather than flour when greasing the pans. YUM!!!! We all are until we were sick to our tummies. A bit too addicting but worth it;!!"

Don't use more than 2 cups banana, this last try I put a whole extra one in and it was a tad mushy, but kinda good ooey mushy. I also baked it at 340¬∞ instead of 350¬∞. 35 minutes for muffins and 40-50 minutes for small or large pans. I've already eaten 3 muffins and I can't control myself."

"reviewBody": "OK, a colleague forwarded this to me when I shared the recipe I inherited from my grandmother at work. The ingredients are identical (although her base recipe is half of this one - 1 cup of bananas, etc). She received hers from a friend from Hawaii, so in our family we always called this \"Hawaiian Banana Bread.\" I don't know what they call it in Hawaii - probably just banana bread ;)Anyway, the ingredients here are great, but I personally don't like it with nuts. My father makes it with pecans and/or chocolate chips. YMMV. Also, I disagree with the comment that you can substitute any other fat. Yes, technically you can. The results are inferior if you do. Specifically, when I was a kid (and the way I inherited this from Grandma Mary) we used margarine. Transfats aside, the texture and flavor are just worse. Of course butter improves the flavor. it also improves the texture by increasing the difference between the crust and the interior - particularly when warm.\n\nThis brings me to another point. I love this warm. It's amazing straight from the oven - I don't agree at all with the comment about leaving it to cool. Yes, it's a bit harder to handle when it is warm - it is so soft in the middle, it will fall apart a bit. But cut it with a good serrated knife and it's fine. What I particularly love about it warm is that you have this crunchy-chewy crust and light, warm middle - the texture plus the aroma plus the taste are a knockout combination."

Yes, I admit to hiding it from people so I will make sure to have a slice for work.

"reviewBody": "I followed Virginia Sista‚Äôs review and this is actually the best banana bread I have ever tasted. I mixed dry ingredients together separately then the wet ingredients separately. I had like 5 medium super ripe bananas but not totally black bananas though. I added also 2 tsp vanilla extract. Oh also I used cake flour, King Arthur brand in place of regular flour. I used 2 cubes of unsalted butter. My husband and I can‚Äôt have the salt. I only added 1/2 tsp of salt to this. So slowly mix in the dry ingredients into the wet but use an electric hand mixer to mix the wet first before adding the dry always make sure to mix the dry by itself before adding to the wet. I used the electric hand mixer to mix it all up. I slathered butter on a glass bread loaf pan then shook flour around on it then tapped the excess off into the sink. Put half ingredients in each. I have one ceramic bread pan too. That seemed to cook quicker than the glass. I jabbed a knife to make sure it wasn‚Äôt slimy. Then done. A little moist is ok though idk. It was great as f!!k!
