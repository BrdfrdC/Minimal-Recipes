"reviewBody": "I really enjoyed this bread! I used Bulgar grain instead of barley because of allergy issues. Grind them up in my Oster blender for a minute or so, 1/2 cup or so at a time. Sift it, and grind the bigger pieces. About 1/2 hours, but it got me really into the process. It IS a much more liquid dough, but that is okay, it is a little elastic but pour into the bread pans. I used the full cup of honey, because the dough had a very \"dry\" grainy taste, and I only used 2 TEASPOONS of salt. Wonderful after 2 minutes, but does get more solid the next day. Add a little marmalade, butter or honey, and you have an awesome meal. HEAVY! It feels like a fruitcake, but tastes like a slightly sweet, savory grain. Enjoy!"

I wish there was a recipe out there that created the same texture as the Ezekiel bread you can buy in the store. This loaf would be impossible to use for sandwiches, and each slice is only about 3\" high in the middle. I'm very disappointed after spending the money and time on it!!"

"reviewBody": "My wife asked for this bread for sandwiches. I decided I didn't want to mill the flours every time, so I started by milling 1 lb. wheat berries, 1 lb. spelt, 2C barley, 2C millet, and 1C green lentils. I combined these and set aside as \"grain flour.\" Next I milled 1/2C each of the three beans, combined, and set aside as \"bean flour.\" \n\nTo make the bread, I measured out 2-1/2 cups of the grain flour and 6Tbls of the bean flour. This came to 1 lb. 2 oz. by weight. I added 1 lb. 6 oz. of bread flour (using all whole-grain will yield more of a brick than a loaf.) In a stand mixer, I then kneaded the flours with 2 packages \"bread machine\" yeast (much more reliable than active yeast), 1/2 C honey, the olive oil, the salt (2Tbls is not too much; 2tsp will result in a lifeless bread; if you are afraid of salt, just leave it out), and about 2-1/2C water at 105 degrees. This dough is not batter-like, but it is quite slack.\n\nWhen I bake bread, I use a long rise to develop flavor, so this may be a weekend bread for you. Let the dough rise three to four hours (it can also rise overnight in the refrigerator). Turn out on a floured board and divide. Knead briefly by hand. Put dough in oiled pans as directed. Let rise another two to four hours. This is as high as the loaves will get; they will deflate slightly when transferred to the oven, and there is no oven spring. \n\nMy wife got just the sandwich bread she wanted."

"reviewBody": "I was researching Ezekiel bread and thought that I would make this recipe if it were like the product in my health food store. The thing I noticed is that this recipe does not call for soaking (sprouting) the grains. What makes Ezekiel bread complete nutritionally is the fact that the grains are not ground until they have the starches broken down through soaking. They are then ground. The soaking releases enzymes that makes the amino acids we need in our diet. The phytic acid in beans, grains, nuts and seeds keeps absorption of minerals at bay. Soaking these foods before cooking diminishes the phytic acid and allows us to absorb those necessary minerals. I'll make the recipe but I will be soaking those grains first!"

Added flax seed and raw sunflower seed to the batter and sprinkled some oat flakes on top of loaves. I worried about all the grains and beans being ground into flour but it work very well in my blender. It is heavy duty high speed so I don't know if it would have ground that well in my food processor. I think it would be good with cinnamon and raisins also. Will make this bread often."

The second time I reduced the water to 3 cups, used 7.5 cups of ezekiel mix ( I buy all the grains mixed and grind them) 1 cup white flour and only 1/2 cup honey. I also add 2 tbsp vital wheat gluten to make a smooth bread."

"reviewBody": "Perfect! No problems with rising too much or sticking to the loaf pans. Since I live by the rule \"cooking is an art; baking is a science\", I measure very carefully for baking. I also use non-stick loaf pans lightly sprayed with Pam. I've made this bread several times in the past few weeks, and I love it! I switched the 1 cup honey for 1/2 cup of molasses and 1/2 cup of organic blue agave, which works well. I've made it in the bread machine and in the oven. Not too much difference. I think the bread machine version has a little more stability. I'm also going to try adding dried cranberries or raisins to make a sweet bread next time. Right now I enjoy it in the morning, lightly toasted with butter. For those who like a hearty, grainy bread, this is a good choice."

"reviewBody": "I love Ezekiel bread...however this was a bit sweet and I did not even put in the full cup of honey. Since this is cooked, I think I'll substitute blackstrap molasses in my next attempt since my raw honey is prized and I hate to spoil it's enzyme power by heating it over 117 degrees! \n\nI could not get the loaves out of the pan without wrecking them. I greased very well. Next time I'll definitely use some parchment paper but the recipe needs to include the rest of the story. Slicing after a day would be helpful to include, as others mentioned. Tasted great and ingredients are great, too. I buy yeast in bulk so 2 tsp. = 1 pkg. yeast, or 4 tsp. for the entire recipe. \n\nI've used a recipe for steel-cut oats bread and in that you boil water and put it, salt, blackstrap molasses, butter and steel cut oats in a bowl and let them sit before continuing by adding yeast, water, flour, etc. this may help with the hard bits in this bread."

"reviewBody": "This bread is awesome!! I mix all the grains together and grind them in my cuisinart blender. You can only do 1/2 cup at a time or it overheats the blender. If the blender starts to get hot I let it rest a while. I also put 1/2 to 3/4 cup in the cuisinart food processor. It takes a lot longer to grind to a coarse meal in the food processor. In food processor it takes maybe 5 min or more, in the blender a few minutes. So part of your day is spent grinding flour and making alot of noise. After that the recipe is so easy. I've made it with 1/2 the called for honey with good results. I always make one loaf with raisins swirled in and cinnamon sprinkled on top, and one with sesame and pumpkin seeds on top. Let them cool completely and keep in the fridge before slicing. I have done this and wrapped slices in plastic wrap for freezer. It freezes very well. You can also substitue other grains if your low on one. One time I used part buckwheat groats. So wholesome and delicious. Thanks to the reviewer who originally gave the blender tip. It would never have occurred to me to try grinding grains in a blender. Grain mills are too expensive for me right now. Great recipe!"
