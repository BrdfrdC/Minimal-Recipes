I add fresh cilantro, then toss my meat in it and let it sit while I cut up my veggies and then put meat and the marinade into a pan and cook until whatever meat is done. I also slice my meat before marinading it. So it's not a whole flank steak, chicken breast, whatever. Which makes it so the marinade penetrates the meat faster. I prefer my veggies sauteed separately with just salt &amp; pepper."

I make this recipe every 2 or 3 weeks at home. Also I use wood chunks on my grill for even more smoky flavor to the outside skirt steak i use. I found most importantly that it must marinate over night for that real authentic taste and tenderness of the meat. I know some may argue the liquid amount but it's marinade for the meat. the meat takes only a few minutes to cook."

I work a lot so I put some pre-cut stir fry meat into the marinade on Thursday for dinner Friday evening. Leaving only veggie prep for Friday. I cooked the meat first then removed it from the cast iron skillet I was using to cook the onions. The onions deglazed the pan nicely, becoming coated in the cooled down marinade, then I added the bell peppers and extra marinade to finish cooking, adding the meat back to come up to Temp after the rest was cooked and the marinade and juices had formed a thick sauce.

About 15 minutes before grilling, I pour the other half on mixed veggies: 1 each of red, yellow, and orange peppers, 1 red onion, 8 oz of halved mushrooms, and 2 zucchini, quartered lengthwise and cut into 1/2\" thick pieces. Seriously: Save some for your veggies; you won't be sorry!"

"reviewBody": "This was amazing! Only my second time cooking steak, so I was nervous, but it worked out very well. I did make a few substitutions. We generally eat paleo, so I subbed in coconut aminos for the soy sauce. Instead of plain water, I used bone broth. (We had freshly-made beef broth, but chicken would probably work just as well.) At my 7-year-old's request I used cumin instead of cayenne, since she was afraid it would be too spicy. It was delicious that way, but I might try sneaking in some cayenne next time anyway. ;-) I marinated four top sirloins for 24 hours, let them rest for an hour, then seared them on the stovetop. I cut it into chunks, then used some for that night's dinner and divvied the rest up for future fajita meals. Delicious, and so easy. Will definitely make again! Thank you!"

Will try and marinate longer next time, and there will absolutely be a next time. Served with Mexican rice (rice a roni) and refried beans, guac, chopped gr. onions and cilantro. Cheese and sour cream and flour tortillas as well as salsa and some habanero hot sauce made this one of the best meals we've had in awhile. (also we used tri tip bottom sirloin for the meat)"

"reviewBody": "I am a vegan and found this a great starter base for a fajita marinade. It works well for my veggie blend of onions, red, green, yellow and jalapeÃ±o peppers, zucchini and/or yellow squash, and tofu (black beans work as well). As per many review suggestions, I lessened the water by half, the cayenne by at least half, used only a few drops of liquid smoke, and upped the lime to our family's taste. I also added a generous shake of both cumin and coriander, and fresh cilantro. I felt the recipe wasn't flavorfully complete as written and needed the changes made, therefore the four star rating. That said, the recipe, with changes, turned out a restaurant quality 5 star marinade!!"
