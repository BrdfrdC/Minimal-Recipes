I thinly sliced some beef and sautéed that after sautéing the peppers and onions. I recommend using a nonstick pan. I wish I had added a smidgeon of fajita seasoning. The only change I made was to use corn tortillas which I had on hand."

Then I brought everything in and sliced the steak and finished assembling the fajita quesadilla and toasted them in a cast-iron skillet on the range-top."

"reviewBody": "Very good results for minimal effort! I scaled it down to 2 servings and used the pre-cooked chicken breast strips that I cut up in place of the steak (will try with that another time). I added a few good handfuls of frozen chopped multi-colored peppers and onions (what a time-saver!), cooking briefly in a little olive oil. I didn't have Mexican cheese on hand instead I used a few slices of processed American cheddar cheese and a piece of pepper jack cheese. I wanted to flavor/spice this up a bit, so I topped the onion layer with a little cumin, smoked paprika, onion and garlic powder and black pepper. Thanks for this great recipe which I'll surely make again!"

"reviewBody": "Only slight changes in ingredients, we used thin cut sandwich steaks cut into strips and sautéed since we didn’t have any leftover steak. Added some fresh jalapeños to the veggies too. And rather than use 2 tortillas, I used one, and folded it like an omelette to make it easier to turn. But we essentially made it as written. This is one of those dishes with a lot of versatility. I’ve done similar things with shredded Buffalo chicken and even pulled pork bbq. Definitely a keeper."

I used a whole green bell pepper and half an onion and cooked the steak peppers and onions for 10 minutes on the stove on olive oil. I then but everything in the tortillas and added lots of shredded Colby jack cheese and put each one on the quesadilla pressed and they cane out great. I served with chips and fresh pic de gallo and guacamole"

I made vegetables on the side and I only ate two quarter wedges, which surprised me that I was full. I didn't use salt and I expected these to be bland but they weren't at all. I used baking spray instead of more oil and just sprayed my pan for the tortillas. Worked great! Also used whole wheat tortillas. Can't wait to make this again."

We grilled the steak and sliced it into very thin strips. I sautéed the onions,and peppers until half way cooked then added a cup of sliced mushrooms and continued to sauté the veggies. After cooking the quesadillas as suggested, I sieved them with sides of sour cream, avocado and salsa verde as options. I used the large flour tortillas which were too large and not as easy to flip over. I will remember to used the smaller 8 inch tortillas. This made two large quesadilla. Will make this again."

I made per the directions, using chopped cooked mild sausage in place of the steak (because sausage, peppers, and onions are perfect fit, right?!). I don't care for sausage, so it's tough for me to gauge, bit it was good w/the sausage and I'm sure would be prefect w/leftover steak, too. Leftover sausage, leftover steak....no matter what the protein, this is a great, quick, simple weeknight meal. THANKS for the recipe!"
