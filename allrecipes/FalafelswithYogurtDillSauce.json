She used our fine cheese grater for the potatoes and onions which was a great choice (see what I did there ;) hehe)! These were the BEST I have ever eaten! My husband had seconds and he isn’t a huge fan normally. Super moist and makes way more than I thought so we have tons of leftovers (we didn’t need to double to use as a meal for two adults and a teenager (my son opted out)). Thanks for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "Pretty good with amendments to the recipe but much more labor intensive than planned.\n\nAfter reading other reviewers' comments decided not to add 3/4 C panko crumbs inside the mixture; reduced to 1/2 C.\n\nChickpeas were not easy to mash with a fork, so tried my wonderful ricer used for mashed potatoes, but that didn't work too well, so ended up using a soup spoon, which took awhile to mash. Perhaps using a food processor next time would help. \n\nMixture already seemed dry so added 1 tbsp. olive oil + 1 tbsp. tahini, an item not normally on hand. Ended up doubling those amounts as most comments were about dryness and the mix still seemed slightly dry. Perhaps next time will use less panko inside, more olive oil or even another egg. Not sure.\n\nUsed a 1/3 cup measure to scoop the mixture into the panko, needing a total of 1/2 C for the six patties the recipe made. On my electric stovetop cooked them 3 mins. per side, perhaps a tad too much. Thankfully the yogurt sauce helped add moisture.\n\nWe liked them but not sure the recipe will become a regular. Just something different to try given that all the ingredients were on hand as well as time, which one needs for this recipe."

The sauce is wonderful on the falafel. It's a strong flavour when tasted on its own. Wasn't sure about it so I put it on the side and dipped first. Second bite it was was poured on the falafel. \n\nThanks for the recipe."

"reviewBody": "I omitted the potato and pepper and baked these instead. To avoid a dried out crumbly mess, I added 1 tsp baking powder and 1/8 cup flower after mixing the other ingredients. This gave them a moist cookie dough consistency, easy to make patties with. I lined a cookie sheet with foil, sprayed the foil and patties with oil, cooked 12 minutes, flipped them, sprayed and cooked again. The result were healthier falafels that held together, perfect on a pita with lettuce, tomato, the sauce and some goat cheese on top!"

I made the falafels exactly as the recipe indicated, with the exception of subbing dried cilantro for fresh. Where I flubbed it was on the sauce - I used plain greek yogurt and dried dillweed (adjusting my spices down). That wasn't a good combo. But I found the falafels themselves pretty good (I wasn't sure what they were supposed to be like, honestly) - I ate them with mustard-based bbq sauce. :-)"
