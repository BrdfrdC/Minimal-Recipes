"reviewBody": "This is good for homemade salisbury steak. I omit salt when using cream of anything soup - even though I use the healthy choice - lower sodium and fat free. There's still a lot of sodium in the soups, if you're sensitive to salt. There's salt in beef broth unless you're using no sodium or homemade, this all adds up to a-lot of salt. .. save salting until sitting at the table. To a couple Allrecipe Members comments below: You do not make the soup when a can of condensed soup is called for, use the contents of the can UNLESS stated otherwise. To another Allrecipe Member - I have two sons and a daughter - my daughter has numerous recipes of mine that she asked for years ago. One of my son's is married and his wife asked for some recipes that they both love, so maybe the recipe gift at the shower is going to be better received than you anticipated."

Too much sodium and not enough flavor. Also used home made beef broth. A little horseradish sauce in the burgers and worcestshire sauce add wonders."

I also used only 10 oz of beef bone broth and one can of cream of mushroom soup and there was plenty of gravy. I also added some minced onion in addition to the chopped fresh onion. Next time we will use the healthy request cream of mushroom soup too to cut down on the salt. Thank you for this great recipe."

I intended to add the Worcestershire, garlic powder and mushrooms to the recipe, and only remembered the mushrooms, which were, of course, a great nutritional addition. The only change I made was to use golden mushroom soup, rather than cream of mushroom, since the golden does not have soy in it."
