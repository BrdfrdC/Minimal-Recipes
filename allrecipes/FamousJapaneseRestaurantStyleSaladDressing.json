I also used a full stalk of celery, and 1 carrot. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely make this over and over! Thanks for sharing."

I used only 1/4 C. oil, used olive because I didn't have peanut oil. Used only 2 Tbs. onion. Added a pinch of ground celery seed and added 1/4 tsp. sesame oil. I mixed it with my immersion blender. I also used low sodium soy and did not add any additional salt. I'm sure I will make this frequently!"

I did not add any water as the dressing was quite fluid - it did not need water. Next time I think I will reduce the white onion and add some green onion."

"reviewBody": "We made this exactly as listed, and the onion flavor was very powerful. The rice wine vinegar was a little too prominent as well. I think if we reduce the onion and increase the celery and add a bit more sugar then it will be great. Great place to start and easy to adjust since it's a simple recipe. I also agree that there is no reason the mince the ingredients (just cut small enough for measurement, the blender will take care of the rest). We used a white onion and all fresh ingredients."

If not available try green onion\nwhite part only or a leek."

This tasted pretty much identical to the dressing I get at my favorite Japanese restaurant. I did as others here suggested and didn't chop up anything, just let my food processor take care of it, but I did mince the ginger root so that I was certain it would incorporate well. My picky husband went crazy for it...great recipe :)"

I agree with the reviewer who said to use fresh ingredients - not canned, dried, powdered, etc. I regret putting in the ketchup. It tasted much fresher without it. I tasted it before realizing I forgot to put it in. Next time I will use a little fresh tomato instead, or just skip it. I also added some grated carrot for extra texture but it was not needed. I threw in chunks of the onion and celery and used the small cup of the magic blender. BTW, if you are making a full recipe, use the larger cup."

Light flavor olive oil instead of peanut, honey instead of sugar, tamari soy sauce. \nAlso this last time I made it, I didn't have a few items so had to make more changes.\nI used white wine vinegar instead of rice. I also just added more vinegar instead of adding water.\nCelery seed instead of celery.\nAnd I used a red onion instead of a white. I think this really helped w/ the flavor some to make it less oniony"

"reviewBody": "This recipe does need some tweaking, but it really is a winner! I have omitted salt, ketchup, honey, celery and water altogether because they are unnecessary. I used the white part of the green onion because it is milder than regular onion. Go easy on the ginger, a little goes a long way! Do not add salt! You will get plenty of salt content from the miso and sauces. The sweetness will come from the carrot and ginger. Mine came out a nice golden yellow color. Here is my version if you want to give it a try. Just combine all the following ingredients to your food processor until well blended and then refrigerate overnight:\n\n1/2 c. green onion (white part only) - 1 bunch yields appx. 1/4 c.\n2 cloves garlic \n2 carrots\nJuice of one lemon\n1 T. Gari - Japanese pickled ginger\n1. T. Tahini - Ground sesame seed paste\n2 T. miso soybean paste\n2 t. fish sauce\n2 t. Ponzu soy sauce - Soy sauce with citrus\n1/2 c. peanut oil\n1/3 c. rice vinegar\n12 turns of pepper mill"

Excellent without modification, perfect if you add just a little shredded carrot in order to give it some extra sugar and texture.\n\nDon't expect miracles with dry, powdered or jarred substitutions. Fresh ginger, fresh garlic and fresh veggies are a must for this. I've made it with peanut, olive and avocado oil (depending on what I had in the cupboard) and it came out great each time. If you do add sesame oil, go light, it's very strongly flavored and anything more than a fractional teaspoon is going to overpower the other flavors."
