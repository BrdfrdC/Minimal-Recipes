I will be trying Pepper Jack next time. In some parts of the country hash browns are shredded and in other parts they are diced. I use the diced version. I originally looked up the recipe because mine says to refrigerate several hours or overnight. I couldn't see any reason except to prepare in advance. This recipe showed that I don't have to do that. Thank you."

It was just the right amount of spice. I also added some fresh chopped tomatoes and a red bell pepper. This was perfect, as I had leftover ham from Christmas and can’t think of anything better that I could have used it for. I will definitely be making this again. I served oranges, blueberries and bananas to go with because it’s all the fruit I had and it went very well with the little spice from the pepper jack. Thank you Lorrie for this one."

"reviewBody": "I was cautiously optimistic while putting this together last night as we are not really casserole lovers (at least not the way I make them). Since there are just 2 of us, I halved the recipe (more or less) and used a 7\" Pampered Chef round pan. I didn't have green onions so I added some grated Walla Walla Sweet onion. As a personal preference, I added some Dijon and sweet paprika to the eggs but otherwise followed the recipe. This morning I baked it for 45 minuted and it was done even in the center. I think the secret for getting this all the way done is to use smaller pans (9\" or less). The verdict: my 8 y/o thought it was too spicy but after adding a dollop of sour cream he enjoyed it. I thought it was very good. On my second piece, I added a sliced just-picked Roma tomato and a little fresh basil. That was also very good. Now, on my third piece... ;)"

But I'm sure it would be easy enough to increase by half to fill a larger dish. Also, next time I think I may add some canned green chilies to it for a little extra spice. Hubbie loved it just the way it was though. :)"

With that being said, I think anyone that is making this recipe should consider whether the 1/8 tsp of salt is enough for the amount of food. I found that the salt needs to be tweaked a little bit from 1/8 tsp. (This, of course, varies among cooks. So I don't use it when judging a recipe.) I have made this recipe numerous times. I am currently using about 1/2 tsp at this point. I have also used Monterey Jack cheese as a viable substitute. Almost anything would work."

"reviewBody": "This was very good but a little bit watery. If I make it again, I will probably add more eggs and less evaporated milk. Also, after pouring the egg and evaporated milk mixture over the top of everything, including the cheese, the cheese still got too browned . If I make it again, I'll mix the cheese into the casserole a little bit, or, cover with a loose foil tent until the last 15 to 20 minutes, or, simply wait until the last 15 to 20 mintues before adding the cheese. I had to take the hard brown layer of cheese off (it came off in a big slab) and I had to replace it with more cheese and bake it for an additional 15 minutes for the newly added cheese to melt."

"reviewBody": "This is a very bland version of what I enjoyed at home growing up. Skip the pepper jack &amp; go for a more flavorful cheese. Or, follw my mom's lead &amp; vary the ingredients by season. In the Winter she would add in equal amounts ham, green pepper &amp; onion with colby or mild cheddar for a Western casserole, in the Spring, she would blanch &amp; cut up a pound of fresh asparagus &amp; use muenster or sharp cheddar for Spring casserole. In the Summer, it was well drained diced tomatoes &amp; lots of onion &amp; substituting bacon for the ham along with sharp cheddar. In the fall, chopped broccoli &amp; medium cheddar. This recipe reminded me of those wonderful eats of the past. I had forgotten about them. \n Since I have a pound of asparagus in the refrigerator and some extra frozen hash browns on hand, I think I shall make another one using mom's flavors &amp; this as a proportion guide for the other elements. So, while not the tastiest recipe I have found here, this may prove one of the most adaptable. If you liked it, but didn't love it, I hope you consider some of my mom's variations."

It didn't necessarily keep them crispy (they'd been sitting in liquid all night!), but perhaps it did add a bit of extra flavor. I think next time I'll use more hash browns. This recipe was okay, but everyone (who didn't need G/F) much preferred the Zippy Egg Casserole to this one."
