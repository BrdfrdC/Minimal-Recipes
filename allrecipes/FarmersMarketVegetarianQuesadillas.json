Our town is pretty small, and the farmer’s market tends to die down a little around the end of summer, so i had to make due with a Kale, Radish, and brussel sprout quesadilla. Topped that off with some freshly made LOCAL cheese curds. Not the sort of combination i would usually try, but it’s worth keeping our local farmers’ tables as full as mine!"

I also used colby because that's a preference and whole wheat carb balance burritos. I toasted one side in the pan them flipped them and filled the toasted side with the veggies and cheese while the other side toasted. I don't like soggy tortillas and thought this would help prevent that. It worked perfectly! These were really filling and incredible without seasoning! I will definitely be making these again!"

"reviewBody": "Made this today (8/21/18)--had gotten a couple zucchinis from someone so thought this would be a healthier way of using them instead of zucchini bread or bars. I used red, yellow, and orange mini peppers; zucchini in place of the yellow squash since I didn't have any; and added 3-4 handfuls of fresh spinach. When I removed the quesadilla from the plan, I topped it with sour cream and picante. This was easy to make. Tastes like other veggie quesadillas I've had. Also, I would probably use a little more cheese than what is called for in the recipe. I agree with others that the filling seemed a little sparse. When I spread the amount called for on one tortilla, it was at least an inch from the edge of the tortilla. Smaller tortillas (or doubling the filling) would probably be a good idea. I'm not one for hot/spicy food but agree with other reviewers who noted the taste was rather bland. Maybe a little chili powder or some other spice added when cooking the veggies."

Didn't put any cooking spray or oil on the pan - just let the veggies do their thing. Added some taco seasoning for a little boost. This makes enough for two meals, but keep the veggies separate - don't end up the next day with a soggy tortilla like I did. Still tasted good though!"

I halved the recipe and folded them over. They were delicious. My daughter gave them 5 stars too. I will add this recipe to the rotation. Thank you for it."

The addition of chili powder, garlic, cumin, and oregano to the stir-fried veggies really ramps up the flavor. Extra virgin olive oil also makes the flavor more rich. Also when I make quesadillas, I fill half and fold over the top. Makes it SO much easier to flip! No pieces of cheese and veggies all over the pan!"

After thoroughly coating the veggies with oil and seasonings in the bag, I poured the oiled veggies into a grilling basket and roasted then on the patio grill. Remove the veggies when cooked and assemble the quesadillas. Spread a little oil on the both sides of the outside of the tortilla of the assembled quesadillas and finish grilling on the hot grill. Now, that's a great summer meal."
