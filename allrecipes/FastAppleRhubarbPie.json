I personally used the rhubarb that we had frozen, so I found it a little watery after taking it out of the freezer. I used cornstarch as recommended by other comments to thicken it, and used the oatmeal crumble on top as suggested by another. It was very easy to make gluten-free for my mom simply by putting it in a small oven-safe dish and then baking it for around 10 less minutes. I will definitely make it again!"

I used reviewer pamjlee's crumb topping. I doubled the topping since there was enough filling for two pies. I was a little nervous because the topping spread so much, but it set-up a little like an oatmeal cookie. I also used 1 1/2 T cornstarch instead of 1 T--simply because that's the measuring spoon I grabbed. I will likely make it again because the rest of the family liked it so much."

Ironically, I'd bought rhubarb for a pie and after making one, didn't have enough for a second pie so I thought, \"Maybe I'll add apples!\" I threw everything together, baked it, and then happened to find this recipe which is exactly my own improvised recipe.\n\nI believe I had four stalks of rhubarb, and used three apples; six apples seems like it would really overfill the crust as my pie was piled quite high. I would recommend sprinkling minit tapioca on the bottom before adding filling, to absorb some liquid."

The amounts are not clear, and a baking temperature of 440 doesn't seem right (my pie would definitely have burned if I hadn't turned the oven down twice). I used about 4 Granny Smith apples and no more than 2 cups of rhubarb and that was plenty.\nIt tastes fine but if you are really looking for a good rhubarb pie, stick with the Strawberry/Rhubarb Crumb Pie on this site - it's amazing."

Other than that, it was very easy to make and still tasted good, just not a five star."
