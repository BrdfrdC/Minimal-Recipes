"reviewBody": "For those who are giving a low rating because you didn't toast the muffins first, that's not fair. It's about taste preference, so some people may like it toasted and others may not. Next, I DID toast SOME of the muffins because, again, taste preference for some. One of my kids likes them toasted and one doesn't. I used pizza sauce, laid down the pepperoni on some since one of my kiddos doesn't like pepperoni, and then added a blend of cheese. I take mozzarella, some parmesan, and then shredded Havarti cheese, and I mix them together in a bowl. I add the cheese blend to the top of the pepperoni so it keeps the pepperoni in place. Finally, I baked at 350* for 6-8 minutes since my gas oven is super finicky and likes to go from still frozen to burnt in 2 seconds if you aren't careful. When I pulled them from the oven, I set out some marinara sauce for dipping, cut some of them up lengthwise, and two of my kids dipped them in marinara for extra zip. This is one of those recipes that can be altered based on preferences. Yes, you should toast the muffins first if you don't want them too soft. You can also place in the oven to get lightly browned before adding toppings if you don't have a toaster, as some people don't. These can also be done in the microwave in case that's the only cooking appliance someone has. (This was, unfortunately, a reality for my family a few years ago. There are a TON of microwave options that can make hearty meals if you don't have any other way to cook.) Overall, a great recipe for a quick lunch or snack option. You could even use these as a super quick dinner option by throwing in some garlic bread/knots or breadsticks and a salad. (This can also be adjusted to add sausage, bacon, etc. Muffins themselves are extremely adaptable to toppings used, so use your imagination and create something yummy!)"

I used Rao's pizza sauce (a little pricier but worth it), hand grated from a block of mozzarella vs pre packaged. And finally placed them on this rack I had for cooking bacon so it wasnt against a solid surface. I used the same preheat temp recommended, threw them in at about 150, and waited for the cheese to brown along the edges before pulling them and they weren't soggy for me, even the thicker cut muffins. I think it was about 15 minutes."

If you want them to be more like pizza and taste better then you need to toast them! \n*I remembered this too late and had already followed the directions of this recipe so I let them cool, added more cheese and put them back in the oven for 10 minutes and that helped crisp up the bottom so they werenâ€™t so soggy and made them a little more edible and taste like pizza."

"reviewBody": "Have made similar recipe for 30+years. Most people can eat a regular size pizza. My version: 3 English muffins split on a large pizza pan. 1/4 piece of American cheese on each one. Spoon LG tablespoon sauce over this. Chop up your toppings of choice. I like pepperoni, sausage,and mushroom. You decide how much topping you want, I use about 2T. for each muffin half. A shake of parmesan cheese,and a TBS. or more of shredded mozzarella. Bake at400Â° for 10-12 min. on top shelf of oven. Then broil on high till top browned to your liking. It's a very flexible recipe. Play with it. It's that type of recipe, I love it."

Yes, use Thomas' English muffins so the sauce goes into the cracks. Use good pizza sauce, good pepperoni and cheese and you won't be disappointed. Add some crushed red pepper flakes for the adults if you like a little heat."

Using that and some mushrooms it's a delicious, filling meal. Make them as written if you like (they're awesome!). However, we prefer to toast the English muffins first so they don't get soggy from the sauce."

I baked these on a preheated pizza stone, so I had no problem with soggy muffins. We will be making these again for sure!"

I did follow the suggestions of the some of the other commentators and toasted the muffins first. For my daughter I followed the recipe as it was written (minus the pepperoni because she's not a fan). For mine, I subbed in fresh tomato slices for the canned sauce, and instead of pepperoni I added fresh garlic and some dried basil. SO GOOD. I personally think the fresh tomato version is a lot better than the canned sauce, but both were good and this recipe was definitely fast and easy like it promised."

I think I may have made them once a few years ago too, but I wasn't sure about the oven temperature, cook time, etc., so I pulled this recipe. I did not read the other reviews before cooking, so I did not toast the muffins. Instead, I cooked at 350 for 10 minutes as directed, but then turned the oven to broil for 2 to 3 minutes more. They tasted great - I don't think you need to toast them. We had ours as Hawaiian pizzas with ham and pineapple, but you could use whatever you want. They are very easy and versatile."

It was a huge hit and all the kids loved it. I've tried them with the mini bagels as well as English muffins and both are great. I agree that you need to toast them before assembly."
