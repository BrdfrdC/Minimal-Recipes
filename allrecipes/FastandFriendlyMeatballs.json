Following a reviewer’s advice and my own addition this was a 5 star recipe the second time and gobbled up. I only had 1 lb. of 93% lean turkey breast. I reduced the bread crumbs to 1/4 cup but kept the whole egg and added 1/8 cup water. I also added 2 Tbsp. of parmesan cheeseI. I used 1/4 tsp. ground sage and 1 tsp. each of onion powder, garlic powder, salt and 3/4 tsp. pepper. I also added a teaspoon of fresh thyme overflowing from my aero- garden. I served it with jarred marinara sauce with extra fresh basil , spaghetti noodles and grated parmesan on top. Delicious and still easy!"

I used slightly dampened 100% whole grain bread in place of bread crumbs, added minced garlic (to our tastes) and fresh, chopped parsley (to our tastes). \n\nIn the tradition of my mother, I put 1 tsp of olive oil into a pot in which I sauteed the fresh garlic, then added the meatballs and cooked until nicely browned. I then poured the sauce into the pot, covered it, and simmered it for 30 mins. This adds lots of flavor to the sauce. I also like to add the cooked pasta to the sauce and meatballs. My family loves meatballs and pasta this way. Much faster cleanup...only one pot.\n\nNext time, I plan to make extras for portioned freezing. MORE than YUMMLY!!"

"reviewBody": "This is a basic, easy, meatball recipe that derives it's seasoning from the Italian style bread crumbs. It was good but I felt it needed more seasoning. The review is supposed to be about this recipe. Not the one that folks have added 12 additional ingredients and then gave it a five. \nYep, Italian meatballs must have Pecorino Romano cheese; fresh garlic, fresh onion, parsley (ingredients you will find in the Italian breadcrumbs, but not enough to make this Italian a happy camper.\nSo if you want a basic recipe that you can enhance to your taste, this is great. \n\nPeople, stop saying the recipe is good, but I added half the pantry...... If you had to add half the pantry, then the recipe wasn't good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's now no longer the recipe posted, it's your own recipe you are rating .\n\nPeople look for recipes and rely on ratings to even stop to read the recipe....when the recipe is not reviewed on its own merit, the rating system means nothing."

So I didn't add anything, even salt and pepper, even though my instincts told me I should. Without salt and pepper, or as other reviewers have suggested, combinations of the following: sage, Parmesan cheese, onion powder, garlic powder, etc. Since none of those things are written into the recipe, I assumed those flavors would come from the bread crumbs, but not so. Next time, I'll add some of those spices and a good recipe will be even better."

I used ground beef and added 2 tbsp of Italian seasoning, added some onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and parsley and 2 tbsp water (or milk). I think you could do a lot of different flavor combos with this recipe so I will be experimenting in the future. Great simple recipe. I cooked them according to the directions but I added 5 extra minutes at the end to brown them a bit more."

Great for lunches and dinner add-ons. \n\nI added 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese and grilled some onions and garlic and through into the mixture once it cooled. I didn't find it needed any additional seasoning when using the Italian breadcrumbs, except for salt and pepper to taste. \n\nI generally do not turn them in the oven, and I toss them into a crockpot with either my favorite spaghetti sauce (Paul Newman's Sockarooni) or a brown gravy. They taste better as the week goes on :-)"

"reviewBody": "This a good beginner's recipe. The meatball mix is pretty plain so I added fresh parsley, garlic powder, herbs (oregano, dried basil). I always test the first meatball for seasoning by pan frying it. It was excellent after all the adjustments. I baked the rest of my meatballs as per the recipe directions and I have to say that baking it completely ruined the meatballs. Meatballs are usually pan fried first, which brings out the flavours and keeps the juices in. For me, since these were already turkey and lean, it was not worth saving few calories by baking them instead of pan frying first. Huge difference in flavor."
