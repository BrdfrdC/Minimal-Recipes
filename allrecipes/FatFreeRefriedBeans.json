Mine needed double the garlic as well as cumin, chili powder, and jalapeno. I always like a good bite of acid in my food, so I recommend a little splash of cider vinegar in addition to the dash of liquid smoke (I did not use the whole 1 tsp called for)."

Like others, I used pintos (1 can, drained), 1/2 cup of broth in place of water (following the advice of another recipe, used hot broth to make less starchy), only a dash of salt and pepper, and only a few drops liquid smoke. Also some canned chilis. Sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil (I know, this adds some additional fat), then mashed all the beans in the pot with a potato masher. Could have done with less onion. These would be good in burritos, I think."

Had to add a little water. An electric mixer may be a better choice. Anyway, I sauteed about half cup onions, a clove of garlic, added the somewhat chunky beans, scant 1/2t salt, 1/4t pepper. Heated that then added 1/16t liquid smoke.. They were good, but not amazing. It didn't save that much money from buying them, but I'll know how to do it now."

From the start I cut the salt and liquid smoke down significantly because it just seemed like an awful lot of both. There was way too much liquid for 2 cups of beans, even after trying to cook it down. I added another can of beans (mashed about half) at that point. They were a bit bland so I added a little chili powder and cumin. Turned out *very* tasty. Will make again with modifications. Thanks :)"

"reviewBody": "Prior reviewers have all touched on the points I'll make, but here's my experience:\n\nThe recipe didn't say whether the canned beans should be drained, so I did drain them. Good thing, as the recipe for me turned out to be a bit watery. I cooked it for 2 extra minutes, and still let it stand for a couple of minutes to thicken up a little. thought this was way too salty (since the canned beans already had salt). I may omit the added salt entirely if I make this again. Also, I thought the liquid smoke flavor was way too strong, so I might cut that in half.This recipe has potential, I think, but it didn't work for me with the ingredient quantities as given."

I decreased the salt and pepper as other reviewers suggested and still was surprised by how salty it was. I added water like the recipe called for and it made it edible but too watery. On the whole it had a good flavor and I will make this again with next to no salt in it. I did add a pinch of cumin. Good recipe after some adjusting."

"reviewBody": "I wondered why prep time was 10 minutes. Usually, prep times are underestimated, but it was mashing the beans that took the longest. The confusion on how much water to add to this recipe might be because the recipe doesn't specify whether or not you're supposed to drain the beans. I didn't drain them and added zero water and they were still pretty runny. I used pinto beans also. I've never eaten refried beans made from anything else (here in New Mexico). I agree that 1 tsp salt and liquid smoke are too much. In particular, 1/4 tsp liquid smoke is plenty unless you really like the overpowering taste of it. I liked this recipe a lot better than canned refried beans, but will adjust the seasonings more and maybe add a few others next time I make it. My family did like it though."
