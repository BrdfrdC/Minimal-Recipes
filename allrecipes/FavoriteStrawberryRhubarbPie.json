While he was more interested in a different pie, two others tried this kind for the first time and declared it a new favorite. Since it was getting baked the same time as another pie, this went in for 15 min at 425°, then about an hour longer at 350°. Not at all runny nor geletin like. I cut the rhubarb to about 1 cm pieces and they cooked perfectly inside the pie. I may have used slightly less tapioca, but only because I didn't measure. It was in the fridge for about 4 hours before serving which made it set perfectly."

I liked how simple the ingredient list was, but next time I will tweek it to control the runniness."

Very easy.\n\nThis is actually the \"Favorite Strawberry Rhubarb Pie\" recipe on the back of the instant tapioca box I bought. However, the other recipe calls for 1 cup less of each fruit (I still used 3 c strawberries but had only 2c rhubarb anyway) with the same amount of tapioca, so if you use all 6 cups of fruit as called for here, it might be too much filling and may be somewhat less congealed. 5c fruit total seemed to be a perfect amount for my pie."

"reviewBody": "Delicious, succulent, with the clear juicy flavors of strawberry and rhubarb. I like that this recipe is the simplest of these pies. I skipped the lemon juice because it seemed plenty tart to me - but maybe this is for color. In any case it was so simple and came out beautifully. I used 'French Pastry Pie Crust' and topped it with a simple crumb topping of 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup flour. Perfect summer pie!"

"reviewBody": "I tried this recipe exactly as stated and I found it to be too runny and there was too much of a jelly texture to it. After my ingredients sat for 15 minutes as directed, there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of my bowl. The juices ran all over the baking sheet even though I left a bunch of liquid in the bowl after scooping out the pie filling. I used 3T of lemonjuice since I didn't have a fresh lemon and I'm not sure if this contributed to the runny problem. The tapioca gave it a very jelly like texture which I didn't really like very much. I don't think I'll try this recipe again."

"reviewBody": "Fabulous! The best strawberry pie I've ever had!\nI followed the recipe pretty closely as written, with a few exceptions:\n\nI substituted:\n-- margine for the butter,\n-- Granny Smith apple + 2 Tbs. flour in place of 1 cup of the rhubarb (I was short that cup, so the apple was a good compensation)\n--Also, I baked this as an open-top, rather than a covered pie.\n\nMy husband and I loved it, and I will be sure to bake this again, esp. for parties!"

"reviewBody": "This pie knocks it out of the park, it's simple list of ingredients is the key. Follow just as written! I have never liked anything with rhubarb in it until I tried this recipe for my rhubarb-loving husband. Fresh lemon juice is a must, I squeezed a whole lemon's worth. I also glazed the crust in an egg yolk wash and dusted with white sugar before baking. I added this one to our families favorite book of recipes. Will remake this one again and again for sure. Thank you, Chelsea, for the great share."
