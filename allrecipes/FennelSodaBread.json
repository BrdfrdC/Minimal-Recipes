I did make a half recipe as there were only 3 of us, and paired the bread with salmon. I didn't have buttermilk and used whole milk plus 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar. I did put less sugar as we prefer less sweet (if it were a whole recipe, would have been a scant half cup). I cooked it as directed in a 9x5 bread pan on the bottom shelf of the oven and it was done in about 30 min. I would make this again."

Figured my fennel seeds had been around a few years, so I first placed them within some wax paper and whacked them with the metal mallett to release flavor. Fun project for adult son and I to easily make on St. Pat's Day, and everyone loved the aroma, and taste. I used a 10\" diameter pie plate."

Definitely will be making this one again. Thanks!!!"

The taste was good, the fennel was subtle and I liked it the first day. The second day the crust had lost some of it's crispness and wasn't nearly as good. To salvage it, I decided to toast it which did improve it somewhat. I doubt that I'll be making this one again, but it was fun to try."

I did not have buttermilk, so I added a teaspoon or two of white vinegar to regular 2% milk and let it sit about ten minutes before using it. The recipe certainly didn't seem to suffer because it came out fantastic. I served this hot out of the oven with corned beef and veggies. The loaf was huge, so we ate it for days as breakfast and with the leftover corned beef. If I can find a small cast iron pan, I'd like to try halving the recipe since there are only two of us. Thanks for helping this Irish girl make her first Irish meal."

Mine didn't turn out because I only had an 8-inch cake pan (which shouldn't hurt your rating, just my pride, lol). But, the part that stayed in the pan and did cook was really yummy. Fennel is good for tummy troubles so I was looking for a way to get it into my diet. This was delicious! Thanks for the recipe."

I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and I think that is just enough. We prefer savory to sweet. I also baked it in a 8\" square pan because I don't have a 10\" cake pan and kept my fingers crossed that it would not over flow. Thank you for a terrific recipe."
