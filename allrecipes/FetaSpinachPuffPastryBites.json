"reviewBody": "I used this recipe for a holiday get together. Always nervous to try a new dish with a group but this one was a hit! I used low fat mayo &amp; feta and added chopped pecans. My mini muffin silicone baking dish only holds 20 mini muffins so they had extra stuffing. It took 18 minutes to bake to a good crust. I let them cool briefly on a wire rack before packing to go to the party. I will definitely make them to share agsin!"

"reviewBody": "I love spinach and this recipe looked like a great one to make for an upcoming party calling for us to bring \"finger food\" appetizers. I made a lower calorie version using lite mayo, and fat free feta. It was a fabulous combination of ingredients inside a puff pastry - one party in my mouth! I believe next time I may add some chopped pecans. It did take the full 16 minutes to bake. Simple, easy and tasty! And, makes a great presentation. Highly recommend this recipe!"
