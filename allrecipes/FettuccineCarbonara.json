Cooked the bacon first, and then reserved some of the drippings to cook the vegetables which also included peas. Tore the bacon to small bite size. Prepared 8oz of pasta but still left the cream, eggs and parmesan proportions normally reserved for 16oz. The dish turned out very well, and will be made many more times in the future."

This time around, I skipped the chicken and used turkey bacon and added mushrooms. I just love how creamy it is since I'm a big fan of white sauces.. For me, the sauce is the one that carries any ingredient (so far). Will definitely cook a version of this recipe again. Still 5 stars.??"

The pasta absorbs the liquid rather quickly so serve immediately. Next time I will probably use spaghetti rather than fettuccine to have less absorption. I immediately shared this recipe with family and friends! It’s a keeper. Yummm!"

Next, I cut the bacon back from 1 pound down to 3/4 of a pound but also added four slices of black forest ham and four slices sandwich turkey.Additionally, I added a bag of frozen pea and 1 cup of the pasta water.This made it mine and I’m now adding it to my new cook book!!

After I mixed in the milk and eggs and butter to the frying pan, with the fettuccine, it was kinda like cooking eggs and got eggy a bit. I added chicken, mushrooms, bacon and parsley as well. The outcome was kind of disappointing. Too much egg and not a taste of the cream sauce. It's kind of like eating just plain pasta with chicken, bacon, mushrooms, and parsley. I must of cooked it wrong or something."

They made it with the vegetables I did and added the bacon I can tell you that the leftovers, heated up were absolutely delicious!!!"

Unlike other attempts on my part, the eggs were really easy to incorporate when added to the cream and grated cheese.\n\nHere are my adjustments: Excluded shallots because I didn't have any. Completely drained the bacon/onion mix before adding to pasta. Wound up using about double the cream to keep the cheese from becoming stringy. \n\nNote: For this dish taste its best make sure pasta is al dente and that the bacon gets completely cooked."

The adjustments suggested in that recipe resulted in a truly delicious dish. The texture was not quite as creamy as I would like (the parmesan makes it just the slightest bit stringy but makes the flavor irresistable) but other than that this is a truly delicious recipe. When they say \"restaurant-quality\" they really are not exaggerating. I will certainly be making this again."

I reserved pasta water since this dish can dry out very easily when you add the parmesan cheese when it sits for a few minutes. I like the cream sauce a little looser. The thick pasta absorbs the liquid quickly. \n\nWaiting for the next day of indulgence to make this again! \n\nGet the warm italian bread ready for this meal!"

The cream/ egg yolk/ parmigianno mixture disappeared right into the fettuccine. I would make more of the sauce next time as I cook for my hubby and I only but we like a wee bit of leftovers for a heated up snack the next day, which is why I adjusted to 3 servings. The onion/bacon combo is simply delicious so I will make this recipe again but make more of the sauce so it will be creamy... Easy and yummy recipe; thanks for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "Looking at the various photos, I see that many people have not followed the recipe's (somewhat vague) instruction to use bacon \"cut into strips.\" Instead, they've chopped, diced or crumbled the bacon. I've found that when I'm working with long pasta shapes (such as this recipe's fettuccine), it's always best to add other ingredients that have first been cut into similar long, thin shapes, such as by julienning. Such shapes allow the added ingredients to mimic the shape of the pasta, flex &amp; flow with it, cling to it and, effectively, become entrained with it. Short or chunky shapes, on the other hand, just can't behave that way, and will instead tend to fall away from the pasta. (In other recipes that call for chunky pieces of vegetables, use a short pasta shape instead.) So try slicing the long, raw bacon strips into three lengths of approximately equal length. Then cut each of those strips lengthwise (not crosswise) into three fat matchsticks. (And if any of those strips are all or mostly fat, just discard them.) As for the raw egg yolk that's justifiably giving many reviewers pause, I suggest buying pasteurized eggs, if you can find them."

Will add some red pepper flakes and half the shallots next time. I did like combining the cheese, egg yolks and cream before adding them to the noodle mixture, didn't worry about scrambling the eggs. A couple of thoughts, leave the shallots, onions and bacon to cook down until the bacon browns a bit, this takes some time which allows the flavors to develop. Make sure to use plenty of salt and pepper to balance the sweetness of the shallots. Save some of the pasta water so that when the cheese sauce thickens, you can thin it out a bit. This will become a regular in our meal rotation."
