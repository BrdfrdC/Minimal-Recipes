To me those three additions make this a great 5 star recipe. Could also add finely sliced or grated carrots, too!"

Added onion, garlic, more cumin, less chili powder, and added some cayenne pepper for spice and a tiny bit of sugar to balance it out and cut the acidity a bit. Cooked some diced boneless chicken on the side and threw it in there too. Came out awesome! Yum\n\nPS... It's really good with some shredded Mexican cheese mixed in"

"reviewBody": "I first had fideo about 4 years ago, while visiting a friend in New Mexico. I've been visiting since college, but never came across fideo before when eating out. In any case, I recall thinking it was so yummy, I'd have to make it myself someday. Never got around to it, till recently, I picked up a bag of fideo at an Italian deli, so thought I'd try making it. I looked at a lot of recipes, including America's Test Kitchen's version (too involved), and this one appealed to me the most. I've already made it 3 times, I love it so much! It's not a copy of the one I had in NM (that was a little soupier), but the flavors are there, and it is sooo easy. Since the first time making it as written, I've tried it with diced onions and 2 cloves garlic, and a can of tomatoes for some texture, but I like it as written, and with my mods. I do cut the chili powder in half, just because my BF doesn't care for the taste, but a half tbsp is perfect for us. This is definitely a nice change of pace for a pasta dish."

I used Del Fuerte salsa de tomate (mexican tomato sauce) and some chicken broth I had leftover in the fridge instead of water. I had to add more liquid than called for as it evaporated quickly and the dish came out a little dry after the ten minute simmer. I'd add a little onion and a bit more garlic next time. Do top this with a bit of sour cream it takes it over the top good! This was easy and very fast from start to serving. Thanks tinyant1!"

"reviewBody": "EXCELLENT! I sauted 1/2 onion along with the fideo for about 7 minutes stirring constantly so that the fideo wouldn't burn. Added 2 garlic cloves for 30 seconds. Added 1 1/2 cups chicken broth, 1/2 can tomato sauce, cumin, and salt. After liquid became creamy I added the 2nd half of the sauce as directed.So I really didn't change it up that much. Just added personal tastes. I will definetly use this recipe again. Oh..when I ate it I had shredded chicken with white corn tortillas on the side. THIS ONE IS A KEEPER!"

"reviewBody": "My pantry was very bare, but by some weird coincidence I actually had a package of fideo noodles and the other ingredients for this. I made it like the recipe says except used real garlic and also chicken bouillon instead of salt. I added a can of black beans to make it a main dish and had to use another half cup of water. It turned out surprisingly well! I will make this again, both without the beans as a side dish and with the beans as a meal since I can keep the ingredients in the pantry. Thanks!"

Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T. Really good and reminded me of the authentic Fideo a family member of mine made.\n\nP.S. This recipe is truly as easy as it looks. Prep time IS 1 minute."

"reviewBody": "Used coriander leaves instead of cumin because I was out &amp; used whole green chili peppers in place of Serrano peppers. Added about an 1/8 tsp. garlic salt as another suggested. I cut the chili powder down to ½ tsp. from the ½ tbsp. called for (for 2 servings) it was still pretty hot. I thought adding about 1/8 cup of onions would help sweeten it up and make the heat a little less noticeable. This did not work, as my mouth and even my esophagus is still burning from just a taste 20 minutes ago. Sorry, this recipe was not for me."

It's very similar to something I had at a restuarant many years ago. Great change from rice. I don't eat pasta very often, but I will remember this one."

The chicken bullion takes out the strong tomato taste and adds good flavor. This is excellent served with pinto beans and pork chili, tamales, enchiladas, almost anything!"
