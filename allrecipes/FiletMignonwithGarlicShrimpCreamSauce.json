"reviewBody": "An interesting twist on surf and turf. Not as savory as I had expected, however this allowed the flavor of the steak and shrimp to really shine through rather than being overwhelmed by seasoning. Actually a fairly simple recipe in execution, but looks so fancy on the plate (and is so rich in composition) that it makes you look like a gourmet genius. I paired with some fancy roasted baby potatoes and prosciutto wrapped asparagus for an intimate Christmas dinner for two. (It was a hit.)\n\nUpdate--we had half of each of our fillets left over the next evening, but no more sauce. I had no shrimp left but some mushrooms and two slices of prosciutto. I added three minced mushrooms and two minced slices of prosciutto to the garlic and shallots in a new batch of sauce, and a dash of salt and it was nearly as tasty as the original shrimp sauce!"

We used a Rib eye steak instead which turned out better for us because we had left overs ;). If your on a time crunch and cooking for you and someone else i recommend getting a pound of pre peeled shrimp. Having the shrimp makes it super easy just to throw in the pan with all of the flavorful goodness... The most important ingredient is the wine. Use something that you know and something that you would have a glass of. My favorite is Kendall Jackson's Chardonnay.."

Next time I will reduce the two tbsp each butter and olive oil to one tbsp each and completely omit the extra tbsp butter added later. We'll see how it goes then!"

Serve the sauce on half the steak, along with the shrimp pouring over into some kind of starch goodness(potatoes/rice). Wonderful recipe! \nOh, I cook the shrimp on it's own in a high heat pan to get get it glazed properly. Best way to cook tenderloin, medium rare every time.....thankyou for the recipe!!\nThe only person that didn't like this recipe, doesn't like pairing seafood with red meat.....imagine that?"
