I sauteed for 3 minutes per side, then later when adding the back to the simmering sauce, I had to cook for about 10 minutes per side in order to increase the internal temp. up to 130 degrees. By this time the sauce was more of a glaze than a sauce. I added another 1/2 Cup of beef broth which helped thin out the sauce. It was still an excellent dish!"

"reviewBody": "I used this recipe for my MIL's birthday dinner. My husband grilled the steaks perfectly. I followed the recipe almost exact. Instead of making a slurry, I stirred in about 2 tsp GF all purpose flour to the sautéed mushrooms and shallots and then proceeded to add the wine, broth, and thyme. I don't think the flour or slurry would have been needed as I did find I needed to thin it out a little more so it wouldn't be as thick. My husband hates mushrooms and didn't try it, but my MIL likes mushrooms and said she really liked the sauce with the steak. I tasted the gravy and it had good flavor despite not making the steaks in the pan. If I ever get to make this for myself, I'll omit the flour or slurry component as I think I'd prefer more of a thin sauce instead of a gravy. Overall, good recipe and I'd love to try it again. Thanks for the recipe!"

I seasoned the meat 30 minutes ahead, and let it come close to room temp before searing. The sauce (to which I added 2 cloves of garlic) was the show-stopper. I also added some Kitchen Bouquet browning liquid to make the sauce a meatier brown instead of purple. I did not use the cornstarch slurry, but added a pat of butter while finishing. (I also used 1c broth and 1/4c wine). I suggest starting the sauce first if you plan to sear, bake and rest. I will make this again for sure. Hubs now says he needs to step up his game!"

"reviewBody": "Hubs prepared the steaks on the grill (to perfection I might add) while I took care of the sauce. I have to admit my first impression was that I was kind of turned off by the sort of purply mushrooms and sauce. I used a good quality, rich beef stock and an even better Cabernet Sauvignon. Wow, this is really gonna be good, I thought. I added the cornstarch but found it really wasn't necessary; the sauce reduced nicely on its own. We sat down to eat and were surprised and disappointed to find the sauce...weak. I expected full-bodied flavor but it just wasn't there."

"reviewBody": "This was only the 2nd time I ate filet mignon. The only changes I made were onions instead of shallot and pinot noir instead of cabernet but only because I didn't have the others. I cooked two steaks but they were a total of 1.5 lbs so I adjusted the rest of the ingredients. We split it 3 ways and I would definitely cook this again. It was awesome. Even my picky husband raved about it. Good Job."

"reviewBody": "Just finished two wonderfully cooked steaks! I cooked mostly to recipe with exception of the thyme, water/starch. I did use all the listed ingredients only used the beef broth instead of water to make the paste. I found that there was much more sauce than we needed (cooked for my wife and I). We had plenty of mushrooms left over. The only complaint my saucier (wife) had was that it needed a little more salt. (I forgot the most important part of tasting before serving...). Overall an eccellent dish and so glad you shared it!! I'm stuffed!"

It was absolutely delicious and both of us were over the moon! I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus, washed down with a nice cabernet. Thank you Muffinmom for such a great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Made several batches of this for a dinner party tonight, and it's wonderful. My methodology was a little different than the recipe: I seared the steaks on both sides, then finished in the oven to medium. When i removed the steaks from the pan, there was lots of yummy brown fond in the bottom of the pan, which I included in the sauce (if you prepare your steaks and sauce in separate cooking vessels, your sauce will suffer for lack of yummy brown bits!). I didn't cook the steaks in the sauce - used only 1/2 cup wine and 1/2 cup stock, let it reduce by half, then removed from heat and swirled in 2 tablespoons butter at the end to give the sauce a little extra rich feel; this also allowed me to omit the cornstarch and still have a nice, rich sauce."

Pan sear the roast in a skillet, finish baking it in the oven. Great with roasted new potatoes with garlic, italian herb and melted cheddar cheese on top and steamed fresh asparagus. \n\nFor the roast cut a garlic clove in half rub the roast with that and salt, pepper to taste."

I ended up using canned mushrooms and dry thyme, but it was a wonderfully tasty dinner served with green beans and twice baked potatoes. The sauce made the recipe. Definitely a company's coming kind of meal. Yum."

I would've paid a lot in a restaurant for this and not complained 1 bit. The color of the sauce didn't look appetizing at first, but as soon as I tasted it I had no more concern.

I pretty much follow the recipe, except I let the sauce reduce much longer for more flavor (until very reduced because it looks like a lot of sauce) and then just add a small pat of butter. Thank you so much - we love it!"
