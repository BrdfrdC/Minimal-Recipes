Then for medium rare it is cooked 3 minutes, turned and then cooked for 2 minutes then taken of the heat and rested for a few minutes more to allow the juices to develop. Also, served with a mushroom sauce/gravy made with actual mushrooms in the sauce then poured over the top. Served with a light salad on the side and not over-taking the flavour of the steak."

I cook mine in a hot cast iron skillet just a couple of minutes on each side. Ever since I discovered pre-made Balsamic Glaze in a bottle I use this and put the wine in a glass!"

After removing the filets from the pan, I added 1TBS butter and 3 TBS brown sugar and reduced the sauce as noted by other reviewers for another 2-3 minutes. I served the sauce as a side instead of pouring it over meat. Delicious! I also rested the meat by removing it from the fridge 20 minutes before cooking and again for several minutes during the sauce reduction. Good tips from previous reviewers!"

However, after I have removed the filets from the wine and vinegar sauce, I add just a touch of butter, about a tablespoon or little less of brown sugar and some rosemary (some may not like the rosemary) I cook that for just a few minutes. It thickens up and the brown sugar cuts the vinegar taste a bit. Great dipping sauce."

I served it with Hasselback potatoes and green beans, and it went well with those as well.\n\nOne thing I did differently - I wanted to add a little twist to it, so I added a small amount of brown sugar while it was reducing. It worked out great. It very slightly blunted the vinegar and added an element of sweetness that took it to another level. However, it would have worked out great without that as well."

"reviewBody": "What a special treat! I used another reviewer's suggestion of a spoonful of brown sugar in the sauce; this was a good idea since I think that balsamic can be pretty tart, and because I knew that the sugar would assist in the sauce caramelization process. I also made 2x the sauce, based on review suggestions. That was also a good idea, to make sure there was plenty. I don't have a cast iron skillet, so I pre-heated my stainless steel oven-proof skillet in a 500 degree oven, and also pre-heated the gas burner I was going to use on the stove-top. That way I get a serious sear, and it didn't take much time to reduce the sauce. Followed the recipe with these changes. Great for special occasion (Valentine's Day), as good as a grill house (without the grill :)."

I was serving 6 steaks so made it with a cup of balsamic and a 1/2 cup merlot and six tablespoons of brown sugar. It took about 20-25 minutes to reduce from almost two cups to less than 1/2 cup but it was worth it! The reduction was thick &amp; syrupy and out of this world delicious and pairing it with melted Gorgonzola on the steak was a HUGE HIT! Served with roasted veggies that were used to sop up every last drop of the glaze. I told all my friends and family about this recipe because it was so easy and soooo delicious! I'll be making the glaze in large quantities next time since it keeps for over a month in the fridge."

Rule number 2. let your steaks get to room temperature. It makes a huge difference. The flavor of this recipe was wonderful. I served with with Easy Lemon-Garlic Scallops and steamed asparagus. DELISH!!"

The very hot pan causes a lot of spatter, the sauce/glaze then burned to the pan. \nSecond try, turned off the heat at first flip-less of a spatter, but noticed the glaze beginning to scorch again. Added some water to slow the process, which helped. \nNext time I'll thin the glaze a little from the beginning."

"reviewBody": "Excellent recipe! I quickly browned the steak in a little high smoke point oil (1-2 minutes each side) which I then poured off and added the balsamic vinegar and the dry red wine. Since I like my steak rare and I was afraid that covering and cooking it would result in well done meat, I quickly concentrated the sauce at medium high heat until it was bubbling and syrupy with the meat in it. Done! Take it off the fire and let the steaks rest 5-10 minutes in the warm skillet. I added two pats of butter during the concentrating of the sauce but that was probably overkill and next time I will try without it. As recommended by others,I doubled the amount of the sauce because it is so good. But PLEASE, PLEASE don't add sugar to the sauce. Balsamic vinegar is rich with natural sugars and once the acetic acid is boiled off you will find it is already quite sweet!"

"reviewBody": "I always read the reviews on recipes prior to making it. I'm an accomplished cook, but do like to see what others liked, or didn't, in efforts to avoid problems. And I often agree with others, about rating a recipe when you tweak it here and there, and yet, here I am. :) \n\nI used a venison tenderloin, because this time of year, we have a well stocked freezer. I brought it to room temperature, sprinkled with fresh ground pepper, salt and roasted garlic powder, and let it set for about 40 minutes to so. Then placed on the grill. Braising a tenderloin of any kind just toughens the meat.\n\nI sauteed some shallots in a little butter, then removed and added a good quality balsamic vinegar and them hemmed and hawed about a red wine v. Marsala that another reader suggested. I went with the Marsala, which was a great choice, as the slight sweetness really balanced the vinegar. For the reader that found the vinegar overwhelming when cooking, yes! It smells really venaregy (is that even a word?), but, but once the sauce reduces down, it's to die for.\n\nI served the tenderloin with shallots, sauce and a side of steamed green beans and wild rice. This is a great base recipe that will definitely find it's way to our table again."
