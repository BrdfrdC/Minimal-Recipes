"reviewBody": "My wife is filipino and she has made this many times for me but I never knew the recipe. So I looked this up and made it for her. She laughed when I told her how I made it. She said you don't put in banana ketchup, the secret is the filipino style delmonte sauce and sweetened condensed milk! That's how it is so sweet. So if it tastes strange to those who have had filipino spaghetti before that may be the reason why and maybe switching out some of those ingredients. And of course the red hotdogs are a must... as an American that freaks me out. I wonder if there a reason they are red or is it just dyed."

I made this last night using all beef, chunky sauce with mushrooms &amp; peppers, and Vienna sausages (I was already at Albertsons &amp; didn't want to drive to Seafood City). We went back for seconds. When my toddler gets older, I'll try this with the hot &amp; spicy banana ketchup and/or sriracha."

"reviewBody": "My husband is Filipino and really likes this spaghetti. Made a few changes to make it a bit more authentic, like a previous reviewer said. I used tomato sauce instead of spaghetti sauce (the spices in pre-made spaghetti sauce are definitely not Filipino). American hot dogs are indeed too salty for this recipe. If I don't have the red Filipino hot dogs from the Asian market, my husband also likes uncured hot dogs since they have less salt. I left out the water, but it still came out a bit runny, so next time I think I'll use some tomato paste along with the tomato sauce like previous reviewers suggested. All in all, a good recipe that will be made again with stated modifications."

"reviewBody": "This recipe needed a little improvement. For authenticity purposes you must get the red asian style hot dogs from an international market. If unavailable, use Nathans all beef hot dogs or Hebrew national all beef hot dogs. Regular American hot dogs will ruin the flavor of this dish as they are much too salty. (The all beef american hot dogs listed above are a great substitution-not only are they much less salty but they have the red color reminicent of the asian hot dogs.)Also,don't use spaghetti sauce. Use two bottles of Jufran Banana ketchup and 8-10 ounces tomato sauce. Omit the sugar. Only add the water if sauce needs thinning out."

For authenticity, buy the pink hot dogs they sell at the Asian market (same place you have to go to find banana ketchup)."
