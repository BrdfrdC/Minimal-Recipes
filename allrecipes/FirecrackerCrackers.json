"reviewBody": "I’ve made this recipe numerous times, with and without the chili powder, and the menfolk in my family prefer no chili powder. I have also made it with oyster crackers and that’s a hit. Once, I only had half a box of regular Premium saltines and half a box of Keebler Club crackers so I just threw them all together and made the recipe (no chili powder)...my husband was crazy about that batch! He wants the Club crackers solely in the next batch so I’m making those this week. In one batch, I added a packet of Zesty Italian dressing mix in with the Hidden Valley Ranch, for another dimension of flavor, and it seemed that the women we had over liked those...maybe because the spice level seemed smoother? In any case, this recipe is being made repeatedly, especially this month &amp; next when my husband takes them to deer camp....his new favorite snack!"

"reviewBody": "I've made these exactly as the recipe states and they're really, really good. I've also tried them using cheese-it crackers and they were amazing. The only thing I usually do differently is I bake mine at 250 for an hour and turn them every 15 minutes. This also makes it so that you don't need to wait til overnight to remove them from the bag and cuts back on the oiliness. You can also get away with using a little less oil if you're patient enough to mix the crackers around a lot more. I like to add cayenne powder, garlic powder and onion powder and increase the red pepper because I like them spicier. I've added 2tbsp of MSG to the mix and it really kicked the flavor up a notch, you just have to be sure the people you're sharing with don't have a sensitivity to MSG. This is a great recipe and you'll love the results. I like to bring these to potlucks in little baggies for everyone to eat then or take home. Thanks for sharing this recipe, I'm going to keep on making these forever."

I am a little wimpy on heat so I did cut the red peppers back. The crackers have a nice kick, they did stay crisp. I did turn the bag every 5 minutes for an hour as recipes called for with perfect results. I'll make this recipe over and over. You won't be disappointed.Thank you, Doeye."

You can adjust the red pepper flakes to make it as spicy as you want and I normally at least double the amount.

I don't know, but it doesn't matter because these crackers are delicious! I have made them a few times now. I like to use chipotle chili powder in place of the regular chili powder. Use these as a side dish for cold beer and football games. Seriously, you won't be able to stop eating these, even though your mouth is on fire."

Oyster crackers work great, as well as Cheez-Its. I also agree with some others here that Club crackers are better than saltines. The recipe I use also calls for cayenne (red) pepper to taste... 1/4 to 1/2 tsp just gives it that extra spicy kick. Great for superbowl parties, too! You can put just about anything in there, kind of a Chex Mix variety... pretzels are good, and wheat Chex as well. Chicken in a Biscuit..Soooo good. Have fun with it and experiment."

"reviewBody": "I had some of these at a party for my stepmother and they deserve their strong reputation. The crackers won't get soggy whatsoever (it's witchcraft), but they're intensely flavorful and have a bit of a kick to them, which is of course adjustable. Two things: the ranch dressing is full of sodium, so opt for reduced or zero sodium crackers. Two, they can be a bit greasy to handle, so if you're serving them by themselves, you might want to have tongs and plenty of napkins beside them so nobody gets greasy ranch hands (ha! I said ranch hands!). Oyster crackers would be a better choice for soups. I recommend this recipe!"

A nice blend of flavors, which I didn't find too spicy at all. They were quite salty though.
