"reviewBody": "Great base, however I started with onions and celery in rather more butter than it called for. Cooked the potatoes separately in a small amount of water. Made a roux with the flour in the butter, onions, and celery. Added salt and pepper. Then when onions were clear, I added the potato water, but held out the potatoes. Added a cup of heavy cream and stirred it in, then 2 cups filtered water because it was a little thick. Then added more salt and pepper. Then potatoes. Then cream of mushroom soup because I did not have mushrooms. Took a leftover filet of Covina and cut it in chunks and added it. Added a little more salt and pepper. And some onion powder. Then stirred and put the lid on and let everything heat up. My four year old gran loved it! Be sure you get enough salt and pepper. And its thick and creamy. I didn't fancy condensed milk. Also cooked some bacon and crumbled on top. I thought it was delicious."

I chopped up the bacon and cooked it in the stock pot, then added the onions, celery, mushrooms and 1 TBSP of butter to the bacon and drippings, and cooked the mixture together until the vegetables were softened. I used 1.5 TSP of Old Bay seasoning and added two tablespoons of dry sherry which was a nice enhancement. I used two cans of evaporated milk but next time I will use only one - the second can really wasn't necessary. Will definitely make this again!"

I love mushrooms, but this didn't seem like the right home for them. I also think it needed a LOT more seasoning than it called for, so make sure you taste before serving."

I bought a pound of frozen raw deveined peeled shrimp and threw that in frozen before the cod. I also doubled the Old Bay seasoning and added some cayenne pepper. Because I only had one can of evaporated milk, I used a cup of Half and Half. Everyone liked it—even those not keen on fish. Will definitely make again as a welcome change from chicken soups and beef stews."

"reviewBody": "After reading many of the reviews, I decided to make a \"montage` based upon this recipe. I decided to add clams and creamed corn to the recipe and replace the Old Bay with a \"Chilau\" powder I recently purchased via Facebook.\n\nThe first curve ball I encountered was when I opened the Cod. We've been buying our groceries via Quicklist, and I did not check the fish when it arrived. Instead of receiving the 2 lbs I requested, I received about .85 lbs. I guess that was all they had. Well, we quickly thawed a pound of frozen shrimp to make up the difference. I followed the cooking instructions, adding the corn, clams and shrimp about 5 minutes after the fish.\n\nI probably used 2 tbs of Chilau powder, which is already a stronger flavor than Old Bay. It was great in this role.. it also brings a subtle heat with it. Because of all the extras, I used only one can of the evaporated milk.The texture and consistency was great. Not soupy but not pasty.\n\nThis was outstanding. My wife (who is from Maine) gave it 9 out of 10 stars. I think the recipe here makes a great base and you could probably make any kind of seafood-based chowder with this."

I did use a few alternative ingredients to bring down the sodium mg, so I had to add a little more seasoning to make up for it. I highly recommend this chowder. I'm not a beginner cook, so in terms of ease, it wasn't too bad, but if you're a beginner, I would work up to this recipe. Not saying you can't do it, but there could be some points of frustration."

If there is any leftover tomorrow I’ll try to freeze it just to see how it thaws. If it thaws well, next time I’ll double the recipe so I can freeze quarts for later meals."

I used 16 oz of half and half instead of the evaporated milk. I'll definitely be using this recipe again! The possibilities of combinations of seafood are endless. This time, I used cod, salmon and crab."

I did not have mushrooms (they seemed wrong anyway) or clam juice (used water). Took other reviewers suggestions for Worchestershire and Sirracha but after it was all together and I determined what else it needed - for me. I think the seasoning as listed would be fine for many but as with All Recipes it is great to adjust to personal taste. Now wish a had a nice crusty loaf to go with this! Next time I will be prepared."
