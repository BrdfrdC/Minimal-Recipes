"reviewBody": "It's a really good recipe. I've been making beer battered Baja style fish tacos and burritos for years and have never had anyone that didn't absolutely love them. I made this recipe primarily to try the white sauce. It was decent but I'll tell you my secret. I never tell anyone the secret ingredient before they try them, only after. I use regular thick whole fat greek yogurt! Usually Fage brand if you can find it. I spread a thin to medium thin coat inside the tortillas. This particular brand reminds me of a really thick sour cream but with that tartness to it that gives a WOW reaction. Don't go putting big scoops on the tacos like you might with sour cream."

"reviewBody": "I am also from San Diego, I went to high school next to Rubio's #1 when it first opened in '83, and I have enjoyed 15-20 trips to Baja will many scrumptious fish tacos, which are a favorite of mine. This recipe is very good but not the most Baja style authentic, which is both very good and only mildly bad. It is great in the case of the sauce (definitely use crema/sour cream), which is similar but packs a much better flavor due to the added dill/cumin/oregano. It is fantastic. Using crema I made several spice variations with and without the cumin and dill and it was best as written with the slight addition of 1/2 Tbsp sugar and 1/4 tsp MSG. The batter is good but not great in my opinion and not authentic: it was too puffy and bread-y and hid the flavor of the fish. So I also did a taste test with this other beer batter recipe that turned out far better and more authentic: 2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon Mexican oregano , 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1 teaspoon yellow mustard, 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon, 1 cup beer, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1 cup all-purpose flour. I also added 1/4 tsp MSG. I also cut the size of the fish pieces way back to 1 - 1 1/4 oz pieces so they did not crowd the tortilla, cabbage, salsa and guacamole. Even without the corn starch these were very crunch. With my changes this was 6 stars!"

A Teaspoon for four servings - really?\nFifty percent mayonnaise and fifty percent plain yogurt equals a heavy handed sauce that overwhelms any fish flavor remaining after copious seasoning.\nI gave it two stars for listing the ingredients as a starting point, and because it didn't come across as authentic to the Old Country. The diferential to achieve five stars will be more balanced proportions."

I used fresh oregano and fresh dill, instead of dry, since I had them in the garden.\nAnd I did it with haddock instead of cod, because that was the best offer that day, and the fish that looked better.\nAnd, a major one, lemons instead of limes. That could be considered a sin for this, but limes are not allowed in my kitchen for the moment, and lemons did fine.\nAnd the most important conclusion: It came out great. One of the best fish tacos I have ever had."
