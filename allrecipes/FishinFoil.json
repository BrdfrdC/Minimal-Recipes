It turned out great my honey loved it! Personally rockfish is not the tastiest. It’s kind boring fish not tasty but the extra ingredients made the fish delicious. I also added chopped garlic. I will make this recipe with steelhead or salmon next time. Thanks for a great and easy recipe."

I added sliced onions and fennel and some more seasonings to the fish before wrapping in the foil otherwise it was too plain (I can see where jalapenos will take care of a alot of that issue). The cooking time and method was spot on and the fish came out flaky and moist and delicious. Will continue to add and modify in different ways but always use this method."

It was very easy to make, and it is robust enough that I was able to add different vegetables to the packets for some of my family members and it still turned out good. I used lemon juice instead of sliced lemon since some other reviews said the slices were too strong. I also added dill (first time ever in a recipe) and I highly suggest others try it. It definitely kicks this up a notch! I used jalapeños in some packets, and bell pepper in other. Finally, I suggest seasoning both sides of the fish. I found that when I only seasoned one side, the fish I used came out a little too fishy for my taste. I also live inland, and I have to buy frozen fish, so that might be why mine needs extra seasoning."

After removing from heat, added garlic pepper and a bit of cajun seasoning. Brushed both sides of fish with oil mixture, added 1/2 slice of lemon, fresh jalapeno and onion. Huge hit with husband and 8 year old son! Next time I'll add more onion to the packets. Served with asparagus and rosemary crusty bread."

It was very easy to make. I added some fresh basil and Greek oregano from our garden and some sliced sweet onion. I did not find there was too much liquid."

When I cooked it I cooked a whole trout(small) instead of fillets because I don't know how to cut them. The skin came right off and the bones came out easily and in tact. thanks for the recipe"

I followed this recipe but also added a bunch of chopped red onion to the bundles and fresh garlic cloves stuffed in the cavity as well as a sprig of fresh dill. I was skeptical about all of the strong flavors coming together but they did and I told my husband he had to go fishing more so I could make this dish again:) Thanks!"

When done, I put the fish with jalapeno's over white rice and squeezed more lime and added fresh cilantro to give it more of a Caribbean flavor. It was delicious."

The only reason I'm not rating this recipe lower is that the fish filets themselves really did cook up nicely, perfectly flaky. I think therefore that this general cooking method has a lot of promise, but I will look around for a different variation."
