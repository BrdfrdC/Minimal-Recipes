"reviewBody": "A really good ice cream recipe. The base was really easy to make. \n\nI followed another reviewer and added peppermint extract and mini chocolate chips to mine. However, the chips sink to the bottom, so you'll have to stir it after a few hours when the mixture is softened to really disperse the chips fully. So, if you add anything like chips, nuts, or fruit, be sure to stir the mixture again before it completely hardens.\n\nWhen it comes to freezing, it really depends on your own freezer. If store-brought ice cream hardens in your freezer, then this will to. I have a second standalone freezer that freezes ice cream rock solid, whereas the freezer with my fridge keeps ice cream a little on the soft side."

We added peanuts, crushed cookies, peanut butter chips for some crunch :-) \nOnly recommendation I can make is if you add all the extra heavy ingredients then you'll have to stir more than once passed the 2hr mark otherwise everything sinks to the bottom.\n\nWe recommend after 2hr stir, 3rd hr stir again, 4-6th hr stir again but flip over this time and let it set for the night."

Taste the mix before you freeze it and add more or less for what you like. The stirring step after 2 hours is important for the texture.\nI only whipped the cream until it was a bit thick and not stiff peaks so the other ingredients would blend in easier."

Some of the other posters noted the ice cream came out hard, but it didn't turn out that way for me. It was smooth and creamy. I suspect it's a matter of how well you whip the cream and fold in the milk mixture. Folding can be difficult. As others have said, use real vanilla and not imitation. This will give you full flavor. I'm going to try to some other flavorings next, including one made with chocolate ganache."

I HAVLED the peppermint extract to 1/2 tsp. - and it was still a strange taste. I will make this again with this variation - but will use pure MINT extract next time. The peppermint would have been good - but with red food coloring and crushed peppermint! I served the mint variation I made on top of warm brownies....but would have been much better with MINT extract. Thanks for the base idea!!!! Will use when I need a special topping for those special desserts - as well as a true peppermint variety around Christmastime!"

You could add cocoa or any flavored extract to change the base flavor, aswell. What a wonderful and versatile recipe! I've done this both with and without a machine. Without a machine I found it froze up a tad bit icy (texture was a bit off) but in the machine it was smooth and creamy. I've also made this using light cream to cut calories and noticed no textural difference when made in the machine, however, it didn't quite turn out when I tied it without the machine. Either way, it always tastes great!"

Tastes better than Cold Stone Creamery or Marble Slab ice cream stores! Can't wait to try more flavor ideas. Maybe some Dates and chopped maraschino cherries!"

I went strictly by the recipe except for using 1 tbsp vanilla bean paste instead of extract and I also added in crumbled Oreo cookies, which was great because they still stayed crunchy, unlike store bought ice cream. I took this ice cream to a party and everyone loved it! I will definitely make it again, in different variations."

"reviewBody": "Best &amp; easiest ice-cream EVER!! My partner is an ice-cream person, and loves this recipe. I made half with chopped strawberries and honey (instead of vanilla extract), and the other half with chopped chocolate, mint extract (instead of vanilla) and a few drops of green food coloring (although it wasn't necessary). The strawberry got rock hard I think because of the strawberries, but I just had to remember to take it out of the freezer 20 minutes before eating it. I used low fat milk, and didn't think it had too much fat. DELICIOUS, can't wait to keep trying different flavors. This is a great basic recipe, go wild! :)"

After 6+ hours, it was a bit better, but wasn't close to what I think of as ice cream. My husband and daughter ate some anyway and said it tasted like the soft-serve at Sonic and suggested that we add things to it to make it like their Sonic Blasts. I'm not sure if it's worth the effort to try again...I feel like I'd be better served to buy an ice cream maker."
