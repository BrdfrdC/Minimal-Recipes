I thought it tasted great, was inexpensive, and easy to make. I didn't change anything in the recipe except I purchased two cans of biscuits (8 each) rather than the three (5 each). I had a lot of dipping sugar/cinnamon mix left over so I guess I will be making it again soon.\nOne thing I did differently, I used a chef knife and a cutting mat to quarter the biscuits and didn't have any trouble or need any water."

I messed up and threw brown sugar in the ziplock bag so I just tossed in some white sugar, added the cinnamon and because I had too much I put half of it in a bowl for the next batch I'll make later. Used Pillsbury Buttermilk Grands (2 cans) because irs what I had here. I layered the sauce and the pecans between the tiers of biscuits. I cooked it for 30 minutes. Last 15 minutes in the oven I covered the pan with aluminum foil, and I put the bundt pan on a cookie sheet to prevent overflowing onto the oven floor. It's phenomenal! Husband isn't a fan of monkey bread but he loved this."

I now dampen all sides of the biscuit with my wet fingers so that the sugar-cinnamon mix sticks better and the syrup forms more easily. Now I get perfect sticky-ness."
