"reviewBody": "This is a beautiful flan with a great texture - smooth and creamy, but firm enough to cut with a spoon. I added a tsp of good quality vanilla, but it wasn't necessary, if you prefer the sweet eggy flavor. For ease of preparation, I heated the milk in the sauce pan with the caramel residue, which dissolves the caramelized sugar into the milk, adding to the custard's flavor. This recipe is a keeper. By the way, if you're going to bake the cups in an aluminum pan, you should sprinkle a little cream of tartar into the water (NOT the flan) to keep the inside of the pan from oxidizing (turning dark). I adjusted this recipe for 6 to fill 8 small ramekins, but I left the caramel at 1/2 cup sugar."

Like another reviewer said, it tasted like egg; it tasted like watery eggs and milk to me, blah. If you thought this was good, don't settle, keep trying other recipes because there are some you might like even better out there. What I don't understand is people giving a recipe 4 or 5 stars and then adding and changing a multitude of items to the point that it's not the original recipe."

The sugar returned to liquid and my partner declared it a winner!\nI will make it again as there are so few ingredients, it's easy to make and it is a winner"

"reviewBody": "This was one of the easiest recipes to follow. I am more than glad to have this recipe by my side that really came out to the best final touches. I would recommend this to anyone who just has eggs and 2 percent milk, and no evaporated and condensed milk. There was an altercation to my recipe that I had prepared with this one, which was that I added Chocolate Caramel coffee creamer to my milk, and added cocoa powder with the sugar that was for the caramelized topping. This is just a generic flan recipe, but it was the basic one. If you want to make a different kind of flan, like the Mexican-style custard, or even a cream cheese flan, this really wouldn't be the recipe to go ahead and start on. Also, be ready to make sure your flan is cooked right, in order to be able to set it on the platter correctly. If you use PAM spray all over and coat with it on your metal or glass pan, the flan comes right out in perfection. Really glad I found this recipe, did not let me down and I would do it again."

That being said, it is a new favorite recipe for my family and I will be more careful next time.\nI made this the first time for a party of 20, in multiple batches. Burned myself in first batch. Second batch was much easier to deal with because I knew what to expect. When working with the caramel, pour small amount into the ramekins, then swirl to cover sides when done pouring. It is a little more forgiving than you would think. OR&gt;&gt;&gt; instead of the caramel, sprinkle brown sugar to cover the bottom of the ramekins. You can turn it out and use the torch to caramelize or leave as is and eat from the ramekin."

I think I did make a slight error in that while I was melting the sugar, I think I let it cook a little too long. I had stirred the sugar, which created sugar clumps, and in order to get the clumps to dissolve, I had to cook it a little longer. I wonder if you're not supposed to stir it?? Anyways, it still turned out fantastic! The only adjustments I made was to use half &amp; half, as I had exactly 2 cups that needed to be used up, and I added a tad bit of vanilla. This makes a beautiful presentation on a plate with fresh berries on the side. Thanks for the recipe!"

I did add about a small spoon of vanilla extract and a bit of condense milk just to make it more flavorable. I also added one more egg just so it can be more dense. although I had some trouble with the caramel base, after I baked the flan, 1/3 of my caramel was still hard.

The only thing I would add for this recipe (for people used to eat commercial made flans!) is putting some vanilla extract or seasonings like cinnamon in caramel. The pure egg custard flan is perfect for children and people who trying to eat healthy(by simple ingredients) with no additional heavy cream in the ingredients list. Also, next time I make it for kids, I would omit caramel part for them??"

To add \"flavor\" to your Flan, use \"light\" flavors, remember this is a very light dessert. Use a little vanilla, almond, orange, anise or other type flavoring. I use the skin of a Lime after incorporating the sugar when \"scalding\" the milk. I also completely chill the milk prior to adding the 4 \"whole\" eggs. Never failed me yet. Good Luck."

I used 3 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs and 2 cups of 1 percent milk. Other than that I followed the recipe. Turned out great!! U can definitely make more than 4 servings out of this!"

I doubled the recipe and used 11 packets truvia and unsweetened vanilla almond milk instead of sugar and milk. . Very nice! Of course it would be wonderful with cream or half n half (and if you are on the \"belly fat diet\" I guess that would be ok) I used my own sugar free maple syrup instead of melted sugar and it was nice. Next I'll try melting truvia to see what happens. Basic flan that helps the dieter get by with sweetness and protein."

I'm a new cook so I wasn't clear on carmelizing the sugar ( I added 2 tablespoons water and a drop of lemon)\n\nThe recipe is so easy and still one of the best flans I've ever eaten. Thinking I'd messed it up anyway after I added the sugar to the dishes I added a tablespoon of amaretto to two of them. All four turned out amazing. \n\nI will be keeping this recipe for sure. Thank you."

Be careful not to overcook the sugar... I did in one of them and it came off with a wee bit of a burnt flavor to it. The only thing about doing big ones is that you have to be super careful taking them out of the pan. One of mine fell to pieces... but the family still devoured it :)"

It was a risk trusting a recipe that didn't call for any of the usual dairy fats, but this worked very well and came out deliciously. \n\nADD A TEASPOON OF VANILLA EXTRACT. That's my only tweak. Really, it's good for what it is!\n\nCaveat - It's a great recipe if you don't have the ingredients to use a different recipe. If you have more time to think ahead or are thoughtful enough to keep things like condensed/evaporated milk or heavy cream around, use a different recipe."

First, I have a bottle of caramel syrup from a Cuban market in Florida and used that instead of cooking the sugar. The syrup is perfect for flan, and very simple. For the custard, I used one extra egg yolk and added a teaspoon of vanilla after reading reviews here. I only had 2% milk, and also added about 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. The flan was quite good, came out of the ramekins easily and had set up nicely. I plan on keeping this recipe for whenever I want to make flan but don't have the usual ingredients on hand. Thanks!"

Adding hot milk to eggs is not such a great idea either. You have to be really careful or you'll end up cooking the eggs with the hot milk. Caramel is the easiest thing to do. Use the microwave!!! Add some water to the sugar in a glass container and heat it up in high for a few minutes (until you see it turn that beautiful amber color). Have done it countless times that way, believe me."
