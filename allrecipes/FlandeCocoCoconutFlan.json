Having never made this before, I was confused when the caramel went super hard in the glass plate before I added the custard, as I thought it would 've stayed liquid. But I was relieved at the end of the baking time - it did become a liquid again. I baked in the oven at 350C in a water bath, took about 10 minutes longer but really gave it a nice smooth texture. Will make this many more times!"

"reviewBody": "This is a good basic recipe for flan, but if you REALLY want intense coconut flavor, make the following changes: #1 - substitute sweetened condensed coconut milk (such as Coco Lopez) for the regular sweetened condensed milk and #2 substitute coconut milk for the condensed milk. As the last step, sprinkle some sweetened shredded coconut over the top of the flan before covering and baking. If you follow these alterations, you will end up with a flan that has an extremely intense coconut flavor."

I figured since the condensed milk is filled with sugar, adding another 1/2 would over do it. I also added 1 tablespoon of white vanilla extract and added 1 cup of fresh shredded coconut instead of 1/2 cup. Although I did not follow the exact instructions in this recipe, I am still grateful for having found this one!"

"reviewBody": "My favorite coconut flan is the one on this site by Milly Suazo (Coconut Cheese Flan). However, that one calls for cream cheese and I was making a flan for a friend who doesn't care much about cream cheese. So, I decided to give this one a try. I wanted the coconut flavor to be noticeable so I did as many suggested and replaced the evaporated milk with a 14 oz can of lite coconut milk and omitted the extra regular milk. The flan came out good but I wasn't wowed by it. Everyone else seemed to enjoy it a lot. I think the coconut flavor didn't stand out as much as it could have. Also, flans are made in a water bath, please don't skip that step. I've made hundreds of flans over the years and for the last 15 years I have always made the caramel in the microwave. Put the sugar and some water in a Pyrex cup and heat on high for 10-15 minutes until it turns amber. Handle with care. You can use that same caramel to make decorations for the flan. Wait until it starts to harden a bit and drizzle it on top of parchment paper. When it dries up (in a minute or two) you can lift up the decoration and use it to top the flan once you have flipped it and it's ready to be served."

"reviewBody": "I used 1/2c coconut créme coffee creamer, and therefore omitted the extra half cup sugar, milk and coconut. It provided enough coconut flavor, and there was ample sweetness from the condensed milk. I had to drink some milk to wash down all the sweet! The \"caramel\" was a failure. It didn't taste altogether burned, but it certainly didn't give my flan any flair. I baked in a 9\" pie dish, but there was more milk mixture than space in my dish, so I put the remaining extras in a 9\"square, and put that in a water bath since it didn't have caramel in the bottom. When I inverted the square, it didn't come out, Duh, so I cut it down the middle, and lay it in a plate with a spatula. The pie plate did invert easily. Between the two, they are okay, but because of the overcooked sugar, i did prefer the square."

I made this recipe once before and followed it more closely. Both times it has turned out well. There is another recipe for flan on this site I enjoy more though. It adds cream cheese to the mix (which I'm sure you could do here). It is less authentic of course, but very creamy and less eggy in flavor."

"reviewBody": "First time making Flan fun, making Flan the first time for others to enjoy, nerve racking! Smiles on guest faces and compliments... Priceless! I read through the reviews first. I'm glad I did. Adding the 1/2c sugar to the custard would have been way too much! As is was the flan was quite sweet. When I made the caramel I had started the oven and put the pan that the flan was going to be assembled in on the oven vent to get hot. When the sugar was melted to the color I wanted, I poured it into the hot pan and tipped it to evenly spread the mixture and set aside to cool. I made two versions of the flan. One with condensed milk and evaporated milk for a plain flan and topped it with some dark chocolate peels and a raspberry sauce. Flan 2, I used the condensed milk and coconut milk, with the shredded coconut in the mix and then topped it with toasted coconut peels. Several people asked for the recipes and couldn't believe I've never made flan before! Had to admit that I was so nervous when it was time to turn the flan out onto the serving plates with so many people watching! I thought for sure the caramel was going to stick to the pan!! But all the Oooo's and Ahaaaa's said it all though! Thanks for a great recipe to work with!"

I substituted the 1/2 cup milk with its equivelant of heavy cream. This made the flan creamier. I also bake my flan in a water bath in the oven. This helps the texture of the flan. Thanks Esther for a great recipe."

"reviewBody": "Served this flan to the family after a very spicy dinner of Chile Colorado and 6 of us ate 3/4 of the whole thing and then the kids fought over the last piece - it was delicious! Swapped out the evaporated milk for coconut milk, left the sugar out of the egg mixture, added 1 teaspoon of Mexican vanilla as previous reviewers have suggested. I put 1/4 cup water with the sugar for the caramel mixture - this will help control the sugar browning process. Poured the caramel into a preheated 10\" x 1.5\" round pyrex dish with straight sides. I cooked the flan in a water bath. Be sure not to use a good dish towel for this as it bled the color out of a good towel. Next time I may try it with out the water bath method as it adds a lot of work. Also I forgot to pre-heat the water for the water bath and this extended the time of cooking to almost 90 minutes! Once cooked I let cool for 15 minutes and then ran a knife around the outside edge. Since we were going to eat dinner in about 2 hours I put the flan in the freezer for about an hour and then moved to the refrigerator. After dinner (about 3 hours after the flan came out of the oven) I put a serving plate over the top of the pyrex dish and then inverted it so the flan came out on top of the serving dish and out of the pyrex. The caramel flowed beautifully over the top and down the sides - it looked perfect. Not only was I surprised how good it all came out, my family was equally impressed and I am now considered Chef Extrordinaire!"

My husband is Cuban and he says it's JUST like his mom makes ; ) I made a couple small modifications as well: I don't add the 1/2 cup sugar nor the 1/2 cup milk to the custard mix and I use only 5 eggs. Straining the mix through a fine mesh before baking makes the texture MUCH nicer......yummy!"

This recipe is very similar to traditional family recipes I have tried before, but the coconut took it to another level. Since other reviews indicated that the coconut taste was mild I decided to use one cup of shredded coconut in in addition to substituting the evaporated milk for coconut milk. I also added a teaspoon of almond extract and did not use the 1/2 cup of sugar in the mix. It turned out great and was very surprised at how easy it wast to make! Will def make again. One tip, I melted the sugar in a nonstick pot and it took way too long to brown (35 min), I will use a metal pot next time as recommended in other recipes."

I had never made flan before, so I followed other reviews and used a water bath and made sure not to over-cook the sugar.\nUPDATE: I made this again using cream of coconut instead of evaporated milk and frozen shredded coconut and it was so good! Much more pronounced coconut flavor."

"reviewBody": "Two \"firsts\" on one day (yesterday)- cracking a coconut AND making flan! A great success - a great recipe. I read and followed some other's notes: used canned coconut milk in place of evap. milk, used half heavy cream and half 2% milk for the 1/2 cup of milk, added about 1 tsp Mexican vanilla and about 3/4 tsp coconut extract (only because I happened to have some). I sprinkled about 1 T. of the finely shredded coconut over the top before baking (next time I'll try toasting it first). I did bake in a water bath to ensure even cooking, and perfectly done in 45 min., as per the recipe. Another good trick, as someone suggested, is to place your empty baking dish in the oven to warm up good before you pour in the caramel - it coats smoothly and beautifully with no effort!! I'm sure it would come out just as wonderful using the evap. milk. The most difficult part is WAITING to eat it! (No one waited 9 hours....and now it's ALL GONE!)"

"reviewBody": "Overall, the flavor and texture of this recipe were excellent. I made it for a luncheon at work, and it was very popular. This was my first time making flan, and it took me a good 30 minutes to get the sugar melted and get everything assembled. I had some clumps of sugar that did not want to incorporate into the caramel sauce, and I was afraid of overcooking it, so I gently broke them up with a fork and they melted right in. I substituted coconut milk for the 1/2 cup of regular milk, and added 1 tsp. of Mexican vanilla. Next time I will probably leave out the 1/2 cup of sugar. A useful bit of information would be the proper size of the baking dish. I used a 2.5 quart 8\" diameter Corningware dish, and I think it was too small. I had to bake it an extra 20 minutes to get the flan to set. I think the extra cooking time caused some problems with the caramel. When I turned it out the next morning, there was still a lot of the caramel stuck to the bottom of the dish, and it was hard like candy. Fortunately, there was just enough liquid caramel to salvage the flan."

I didn't have a lot of luck with the sugar syrup the first couple of times I made it, so...the name of the game is improvisation! Maple syrup or carmel latte syrup. Pour into the bottom of the pan before you pour in the coconut egg mixture! When you invert the flan, if you don't end up with enough glaze, just pour a little more over the top, and everybody's happy! Enjoy!"

I know because the leftovers that stayed in the frige for a few days were even better and more beautifully permeated with gorgeous caramel color than when I first served it. I, too, had trouble with the caramel hardening too quickly so I kept microwaving it in short bursts to get it to flow over more of the plate. Turns out this wasn't necessary since the flan is watery enough to liquify that layer to perfection as it sets and it oozes nicely around the entire pan."
