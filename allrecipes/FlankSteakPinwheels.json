I marinated the beef for a few hours rather than overnight (which was fine since the marinade is quite salty on its own), used panko crumbs instead of regular breadcrumbs and omitted the salt in the garlic paste. The marinade was good so I will try it again with fresh herbs in place of the dried Italian seasoning. Afterwards, I heated the leftover marinade to kill any bacteria from the raw beef and reused it the next day to marinate cubed chicken for a stir-fry."

Substituted grated parm for the feta, and layered some provolone on the meat before adding the stuffing. I thought the marinade was very good and the flavor of the dish as a whole delicious. I needed to bake it the full hour at 350. Next time I would try at 375. My one issue was that the meat was very \"chewy,\" even though I pounded the heck out of it. Perhaps it was just the luck of the draw on the piece of meat I used. Will definitely make again though"

The frozen spinach just made it meh, will switch to fresh next time. Will also cook a little longer, the cheese and spinach didn't meld together well and just crumbled out. Was fun to make, will definitely try again with the above changes."

I wasn't sure about the garlic paste process (how do you use the blunt end of a knife without putting your hand on the sharp side?), but there was plenty of garlic flavor from just spreading crushed/chopped garlic on the steak. I mistakenly used 1/4 cup lemon juice instead of 1 tbsp in the marinade, and it still turned out fine :) Looking forward to making this again!"

"reviewBody": "I halved the marinade ingredients because the flank steak weighed a little less than a pound. I marinated it overnight, which seemed too long as the meat seemed to \"cook .\" I dont have a meat mallet, so I butterflied the steak by laying it sideways and carefully slicing in half. I should have followed my instincts and used a hammer + waxed paper, because it was still too thick to be easily rolled. So ... don't skip this step. Adding salt to the garlic to make a paste was unnecessary, it's already got salt from the soy sauce The breadcrumbs didn't add anything; I'd skip them next time. I used fresh spinach leaves, which made it harder to roll. Frozen or lightly sauteed would be better. It did not slice up into beautiful pinwheels, that was my fault! All my b****ing aside, this tasted pretty good! Give It a whirl."

Spread that along the steak and added spinach leaves and fresh mozzarella slices. Rolled it up, tied some twine around the disks to keep their shape and grilled it for 5 mins on each side. so as not to lose the cheese, I placed foil down first. We let it rest for about five minutes. Probably should have waited 10 but we were so hungry!! It was nummy!"

Just my preference to reducing the salt which was a little too much for my taste. I find that people will always reach for extra salt and pepper if they want That little extra. Reducing the salt gives everyone a choice. By the way, these pinwheels freeze exceptionally well and are available to pull out for a quick dinner or for an impressive meal for unexpected guests.

I altered a few things - I sautéed fresh spinach and then chopped it, I sautéed the onion for about 4 minutes in cooking spray so it was tender and I only added 2 tablespoons of bread crumbs. I also added about a teaspoon of roasted red chili paste because I had it in my refrigerator and I thought it would add more depth of flavor. Because you need to marinate the steak overnight it requires some planning but it is absolutely worth it. Enjoy!"

I showed the butcher the recipe on my phone, and He sliced dhe flank steak into two very thin layers and I believe he put it through a tenderizer. He showed me to lay the two pieces end to end overlapping a bit so we could roll from the bottom layer. We marinaded it in a ziplock rolled up like he said so that we could just unroll it the next day on the pan. He gave us some twine. Fun easy cooking project. We used more spinach than advised and goat feta. Soooooooo good. Not a crumb left. I wish I could eat it again now!"

"reviewBody": "I confess that I have never made, or purchased flank steak until I saw this recipe, so I was curious, bought some flank steak at Costco and marinated the steak exactly as the recipe called for, but only for about 6 hours. The only thing different I did was to place about 8 cloves of garlic and 2 tblsp of olive oil in a measuring cup and microwaved it for 1 min. and then mashed real good before spreading it on the flank steak. I sprinkled a little bit of Goya Adobo (my all time favorite seasoning) over the spinach and then added Kirkland (from Costco) Oven-dried Orgnanic Roma Tomatoes over the spinach and sprinkled generously the feta cheese over that, rolled it up, secured it with tooth picks and baked it for about 50 min. OMG! my husband, who God Bless him eats anything I put in front of him, had that look in his eyes, like many years ago, when it wasn't the food he adored, said \"this is awesome!, OMG this is so good! what else I can I tell you folks, it was a great night!"

"reviewBody": "After pounding and poking, I marinated a flank steak for 30 hours in exact ingredients per recipe. The marinade did nothing to tenderize the meat. While it looked absolutely beautiful out of the oven after slicing through (I posted on FB!) the steak was so tough, I couldn't get past it (didn't over cook it; was beautifully pink and 145 per recipe.) The steak came from my local family- owned supermarket where I buy all my meat as the butcher shop there is reliably good with their product. Had this steak been more tender, I would have bumped this recipe to 4 stars. Don't think the extra effort is worth it unless you want to impress company with the aesthetics."

My only change and I think an important one, is the cooking time. My oven tends to be hotter and I cooked it only for 25 minutes and it was perfect. 1 hour would have ruined it. So I would suggest people check the temperature throughout."

I did use 2 cloves of garlic when I made the paste (we love garlic) and opted for fresh spinach instead of frozen. Had no feta, so used parmesan/ romano/ asiago blend. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend cooking this in a cast iron skillet. It seared the bottom of the steak and made it that much better. \n\nFantastic!\n\nI served this with steamed broccoli and homemade mac-n-cheese."

My favorite variation is with whole green chilies stuffed with cream cheese and then wrapped in the flank steak. Its great in the crockpot with a whole jar of green salsa on top cooked on high for 3-4 hours. Served with the cooked sauce as gravy. Any variation of this is great though!"
