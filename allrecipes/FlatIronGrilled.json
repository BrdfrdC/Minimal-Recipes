Other than that I made it as is and it was absolutely delicious. It was extremely tender and almost melted in my mouth. I had never cooked flat iron steak and expected it to be tough. Those who have reviewed it and said it was tough either didn't cook it right or had a bad cut. There was no way this was even remotely tough. Even my 10 and 11 year old raved about it and begged me to cook it again soon. Thank you for the recipe."

It was tender and the seasoning gave it a really good taste. I could not grill on the grill, so I just cooked in the oven slowly. Very good!!"

"reviewBody": "Wow! My hubby took one bite into this steak and went berzerk -- he declared it the BEST fajita meat he'd ever eated. It was *that* good. The only variation I made to the recipe was to decrease the brown sugar by half. Other than that, the only thing I did differently was to \"grill\" it in the oven @ 400 for about 20 minutes on a panini grill, rather than cooking it outside. Although this recipe is not designated a \"fajita\" recipe, we found the flatiron steak with this marinade worked perfectly for that. Thanks for this -- we highly recommend it!"

But instead of moving it to the oven, we turn down the heat on the grill to about medium and cook for an additional 4-6 minutes on each side."

"reviewBody": "Very nice flavor .... but grills vary in temperature so, for me, this timing resulted in rare beef. Next time I will cook it on the grill 4 to 5 minutes per side then into the 400 oven for 10 minutes. the Flat Iron beef is really a great choice and is quite tender but must be seared to seal in the flavors and should be served at least medium rare."

"reviewBody": "Flat Iron Steak is cut from the shoulder of a steer and is the second most tender cut after the tenderloin. It is often described as having both the tenderness of a ribeye or strip steak while still having the full-flavored character of a sirloin or skirt steak. It has a large band of connective tissue running down the center that must be removed - hopefully by your butcher. Searing steak on the grill or stovetop (in the right size pan) and finishing in the oven is a very common method of preparation. Finishing the steak in the oven prevented the wonderful crust on the steak from burning on the grill. Excellent recipe, this is a keeper."
