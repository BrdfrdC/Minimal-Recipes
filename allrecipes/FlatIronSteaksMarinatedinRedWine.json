It needs a little kick of something and definitely generous amounts of salt and pepper, maybe more mustard...very bland. Needed ketchup to enjoy which was disappointing because a good steak never needs ketchup. Won't try this recipe again."

I've made it twice; the first time to the letter, the second time I heated the olive oil with the herbs in it to infuse the flavors more. It definitely gave more of a rosemary taste, but I'm not sure it was worth the extra pan :)"

"reviewBody": "This steak was tender and flavorful. I often use wine/olive oil marinades, throw in a few herbs an viola! I didn't measure the mustard, and am sure I used at least 1-1 1/2 tsp. I also used a couple of T. of olive oil and threw in a few shakes from the Spike bottle. I started with a frozen flat iron steak and marinated for 4 hours, grilled on a fairly hot BBQ grill for 5-6 minutes each side, sliced thinly. It was yummy!"

And 4 min/side left our 1-1/2\" steaks purple rare inside (and to John W: that IS how I found out the steak was underdone. I'm warning others to check before they take the steaks off the grill...)."

Marinated the steak for a little over 1 hour, and sliced it against the grain. We are ketchup and Hienz 57 people and neither of these condiments were necessary. Which is very unusual for us. Definitely a keeper. I served it with sliced tomatoes out of our garden and homemade potato salad."

Will use again especially for that recipe. We marinated it for about 5 hours and it had just the right amount of flavor, not too strong and not too mild. Thanks for the recipe!"
