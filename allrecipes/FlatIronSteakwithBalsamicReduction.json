I was a little worried about the balsamic reduction because it smelled SO pungent at first, but once it was down to the syrup stage it was FABULOUS. Preparing it in the same pan as the steak gives it a hint of the pepper. The kids really like this though they felt the steak was a bit too spicy with the peppercorns. Next time, I may do some without the pepper."

I made this per the recipe but I recommend brushing the steak with olive oil and coating with peppercorns and salt then let it sit in the fridge for an hour or more prior to cooking.

The balsamic vinegar sure smelled potent during and directly after cooking but it tasted just fine on the steak. Thanks"

I think the \"too vinegary\" reviews may have been caused by not allowing the balsamic to reduce enough, because it was very sweet tasting if allowed to reduce about as much as the recipe says (by 1/2). I used 3/4C of balsamic like other reviewers, so perhaps that was it. Anyway, very easy and good weeknight dinner with sweet potatoes and corn!"

(we smooched them first to get extra water out). yes, very balsamic-y, but we love that. we used 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1. AMAZING!"

Purely by circumstance, I had the steak seasoned and ended up not being able to cook it that night so it sat covered in the fridge for a day and a half so the pepper flavor in the meat was excellent! I'll do it intentionally next time. Wonderful recipe. Thanks for sharing it with us."

"reviewBody": "I don't eat meat, but this was loved and devoured by my gang! I did this just a tad differently in that I reduced the balsamic in a separate sauce pan which ended up taking about a half hour to get to that sweet, syrupy stage. Once the meat was done and sliced I drizzled on the sauce. Rave reviews in this house Kmommyz and everyone here sends a hearty thank you!"

"reviewBody": "this was good. i seared and cooked the steak, removed from the pan and sauteed shallots and garlic for a minute or so. after pouring in the balsamic vinegar, i added about a half cup of coarsely chopped grape tomatoes. cooked that for about 15 minutes, and then pressed on the tomatoes with a spatula so they'd give up their juices. reduced a bit more, then strained through cheese cloth. used some of the reduction for a salad dressing, used the rest as directed.\n\nsimple, elegant dish. the reduction is quite pungent, but sweet and compliments a rare steak."

"reviewBody": "I must say the balsamic vineagar is very strong, almost too strong for the meat. I added mushrooms and onions to the vineagar mix which ended up being the best part. I also agree with another reviewer, four minutes on each side isn't enough...of course it does depend on the thickness of the steak. I served this with baked potatoes and putting the balsamic mixture/onions/mushrooms/ was the best part. I'm not ready to give up on this recipe, but it needs some tinkering."
