I followed the recipe except using an onion/garlic/pepper blend that was close, no doubt, to the recipe intent. Next time I might add some onion to the mushrooms and try sour cream, but this recipe is a keeper!"

This adds an extra kick to the entire dish. I season heavily before searing so the flavors are incorporated into the sauce. This is our favorite meal."

Some changes that I made include doubling the mushrooms (to 1 lb.), adding chopped onions to the sauce and using venison instead of beef since we've got a whole freezer full. you can't go wrong with this wonderful review. thanks for sharing!"

First, I used deer tenderloin instead of beef and second, I used port wine instead of burgundy because, again, it's what I had. I also substituted the onion powder with a whole onion because I like the texture it adds to the sauce; I just sauteed them with the mushrooms. What a great recipe! Thanks so much for sharing this with us. It has just become a family favorite."

Also, I used Merlot instead of burgundy. This is a really excellent recipe. Normally I don't like flat iron steaks, but this put a whole new light on it."

The recipe lists ingredients of heavy whipping cream and chives, but nowhere in the instructions did it state how and where to use these items as of 25 March. I'm not the savviest in the kitchen, so I added the heavy whipping cream to the sauce shortly after adding the butter/flour mixture and simmered and stirred for about 5 minutes. This seemed to work well. The sauce thickened and the flavor increased. We all had seconds!"

"reviewBody": "This is a nice recipe for flat iron steak. I did, however, cut back on the amount of liquids in the sauce (to 1/2 the stated amounts) and skipped the flour entirely. I prefer my sauces without flour and just cooked the sauce down to the proper consistency. I also added a splash of dry sherry as we really like that flavor in our mushroom sauces. We did the steak on the grill (along with another steak we had done asian style) and it turned out fantastic."
