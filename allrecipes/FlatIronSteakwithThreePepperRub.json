When sliced thin and across the grain, each bite is seasoned perfectly, flavorful and tender. With my cut I cooked it on the grill about 3 minutes per side and had a very juicy medium rare after letting it rest about 5 minutes. Thanks for the recipe :)"

Since I was used the rub for one steak, I used a couple of tablespoons to add to the peppers and steak strips with a 1/4 cup of water to make a sauce out of it. Turned out pretty good. I will defiantly be using this rub again."

Grilled over Mesquite wood chunks and served in corn tortilla with fresh guacamole, black bean-corn-pico de gallo, and lime. Key when cutting Flat Iron is to cut on the bias. Doing this makes meat very tender. Also, don't forget to let it rest up to 5 minutes after taking off the grill to retain juices. GREAT RUB!"

"reviewBody": "I took my jaccard tenderizer to it on both sides then sprinkled with the rub as listed. I had a 2 lb cut and it was at least 1 inch thick so I knew it would take longer than reccomended to cook. It marinaded all night and into the next evening when I brought it out to sit on the counter for 1/2 an hour. Brought grill up to 600 (hot) slapped the meat on and brought her down to med-high around 505-515 degrees for 6 mins on the first side and flipped. It took about another 9 mins to bring the thing up to 143 internal temp (near instant read thermometer). Took it off and foil tented for 5 mins and it was still pretty warm so I put it on the cutting board and let rest another 5 mins. Diagnal cross grain slices produced excellent medium cooked yummyness! Only thing, a little too spicy for my daughter (7 YO) who is a total spice wimp. Thankfully, I made an extra double batch of the rub for whatever comes next! Very good! Oh, the chipolte chili powder cost me like 7 bucks but MMMMMM good!"

Decided to try this recipe and am so glad I did! I used all of the rub on a 2 lb. flat iron steak that I cut in half (to grill quicker) prior to seasoning. We all loved rub! After letting the meat rest covered for 10 minutes, I sliced the beef on an angle against the grain. It was cooked a bit less than medium and so tender and full of flavor. A definite keeper in this house! Thankfully I bought 3 steaks and still have 2 more to enjoy! When I've used them up, I will definitely try this rub on other cuts of beef that I can get locally."

I made up a second package of thin-cut sirloin tip for burritos this week, using the rest of the green chiles for a cheese sauce. Thanks for giving me another easy dish to add to my files!"

Pre-packaged fajitas are loaded with salt so I tried this twice so far - once with flank steak and once with porterhouse steaks pounded/flattened - they both came out great! I let the spices sit on the flank steak overnight and I think it was a bit too long. A few hours seems to be just fine - which is what I did with the porterhouse. This is what I will be using to make fajitas from now on. I made it for a house full of people and they all loved it."

I'm not a big \"measurer\" so I wasn't exact on my measurements. We rubbed everything on really well. We were only able to let it set about 4 hrs before grilling. I didn't have any Chipotle chili powder, so left that out. I added a little extra brown sugar to off set some of the southwest taste. I also mixed up some garlic and butter in a skillet til soft (not melted), then rubbed on the steak while grilling. OMG, the flavor was incredible. This was the best steaks we've had in a long time! This will definitely be a normal rub when we want one, instead of a normal marinade! Thank you for a great recipe!"

I don't like things that spicy anyway. I grilled the steak and it looked as if it was going to be really dry but after letting it rest for about 10 minutes, it was out of this world. The flavor was better than any store bought rub could have been and it was almost as tender as a filet. My family will definitely be having this many more times. Thank you!!!"

What I did was mix as directed, except that I cut down on the salt by half, and omitted onion and chipotle powders becacuse I didn't have those, and instead used extra cumin and added a hot curry blend. I also subbed molasses instead of brown sugar, again necessity. Lastly, I used a sirloin, bone-in steak. \nBut honestly, with all that - it was FABULOUS! I plan to keep this in as a common rub for beef - it was just phenomenal."
