I have kept these in baggies for MONTHS without losing flavor or crispness. I have also used soy and herbs as flavorings. \nUsing dark flax or light flax or blending the two works great, and could serve to differentiate which spices are used in each flax combo. I tried to attach a photo, but one was too large and one was too small; and I never could find the Goldilocks cracker photo that would work!"

"reviewBody": "These are healthy, hearty and crispy - but I recommend planning to consume them right away (especially when they are still a little warm). They will lose their crisp overnight but can be re-crisped in a toaster oven. I mixed in a little Trader Joe's \"everything\" bagel seasoning as I had no onion or garlic powder. It worked out well as it also added some Sesame seeds to the mix. Just don't add too much, these are best delicately seasoned with a hearty-flavored cheese or spread."

I esp love them with goat cheese or vegan cream cheese and a few capers &amp; cucumber slice. I add a cup of raw sunflower &amp;/or pumpkin seeds to the dough. Be sure to cook than until they are crackly when you break one out of the middle of the pan. Today I tried using a rolling pin to flatten them to avoid thicker middle pieces. Hoping they don’t stick to the parchment! I suggest trying a few shakes of black sesame seeds for cuteness."

I decided to make these ridiculously simple crackers as I had never heard of Flackers nor have I made crackers before. I followed the instructions, no changes, adding my own blend of herbs and spices, and they are delicious. I plan to make another batch adding chia seeds, but the flax seed alone are great. Next time, I will try some different herbs. Now, how not to eat the whole bag ..."

I only had 1/2 cup of flax seeds, so I added 1/4 cup of sesame seeds and 1/4 cup of chia seeds, and they came out well. The only problem is that they go stale within a couple of hours, but as Chef John mentions in the directions, they can be put back into the oven to re-crisp."

The first time, I followed the recipe exactly, and they were delish—-crispy, mild, and perfect for the dip I’d made. The second time I used spicy Mrs. Dash and caraway seeds instead of the original seasonings, and they added a whole different set of flavors! Next time I want to try sesame seeds. There are so many ways to change this simple and healthy recipe! I used it for friends with diabetes as well as those who are gluten free."

Although I like them fine as is, I am going to add rosemary and sage this time around. As you get older, ya just can't eat what you could when you were younger and need to modify. This recipe is great for that! Thank you Chef John for your take on this recipe."

I could still cut the pieces roughly into rectangles. I didn't have onion powder so I ground up dried onion. I'm still not sure about the taste. I will have to try the recipe again."
