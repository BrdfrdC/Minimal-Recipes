"reviewBody": "This is amazing bread! I’ve made it twice now. The first wheat recipe from a cookbook I tried was a huge fail. It didn’t rise at all. So, I read all 400+ reviews on this bread before I made it. My final decision was to make recipe and add 1 tbsp. Vital wheat gluten and 1 tbsp. Dough enhancer and an extra 1/2 tsp. salt. I used flax meal, not whole seeds. My bread machine directions are liquid first (I put the softened butter pieces and honey in 80 degree water, flour, flax meal , dry ingredients, then make a little pocket at the top for yeast, dough enhancer and vital wheat gluten. I couldn’t find the size setting in recipe so I went with 2 pound. I added the full amount of sunflower seeds after dough mixed for 10 mins. Perfection! I’ve even made it for neighbors now."

This makes a stiff dough that can be hard to knead, but it is so well worth the effort because the end result is a terrific tasting, hearty bread that slices beautifully, toasts really well, and freezes well. This may become the go-to bread that we use for every day, and not just special occasions."

Like many reviewers, I do not own a bread machine, so I made it the artisan way, which is always quite fun and extremely satisfying. I also reduced the amounts of sunflower and flax seeds to 1/4 cup each, adapting to my family's tastes and preferences. Additionally, I added 1/4 cup of potato flakes and 2 tablespoons of dry powdered milk. This bread rises incredibly high! I will definitely make it again and again and again!!! :-)"

I can't have dairy so I sub out refined coconut oil for the butter and it turns out perfectly every time. The texture is very soft so for spreads like cream cheese etc it needs a heavier toasting to hold up. Stays fresh for about 5 days on the counter and 10 days in the fridge"

I just finished making this loaf, and it is delicious. I did include several seeds to simulate the loaf we could not buy anymore. I was not trying to change the recipe but to duplicate what we could not purchase anymore. Aside from sunflower seeds, I included walnuts, pecans, and pumpkin seeds. It looks, and tastes great.

I also followed what some of the reviewers said about using veg oil instead of the butter (we were low on butter and I wanted some to go on the toast I wanted to make with it in the morning). The bread is fluffy and I was able to slice it thin enough for pbj sandwiches without a mess of crumbs. This recipe is going to become our weekly loaf because of how tasty, versatile, and easy it is to make. I used the white bread, 1.5lb setting, with medium crust, and just measured everything into the bread maker and pressed start :) you don't even need special flour, I just used all purpose flour."

I also added a half cup unsalted pumpkin seeds.\n*2 cups warm water with 6 tbsp honey dissolved, then added 2 1/4 tsp yeast, proofing for 10 minutes. 2 tbsp melted butter and 1.5 tsp salt. 3 cups whole wheat flour and 2 cups bread flour, 1/2 cup ground flax seeds (used a coffee grinder), 1/2 cup unsalted sunflower seeds, and 1/2 cup unsalted pumpkin seeds. Kneaded on low using Kitchen Aid with dough hook for about 10 minutes. Let it rise, covered with a dish cloth, in the microwave with just the hood light on for heat for about an hour. Punched it down, divided into two parts and put into greased loaf pans. Rise for another 45 mins, then bake (in convection oven if possible) at 375 for 30 mins. Perfection!"

The loaves were about as big as the loaf pan, and didn't rise out of the pan like I prefer. If I made this again, I would increase all of the ingredients beyond the helpful review quantities by 25%. This would then yield two nice big loaves. The bread is delicious! One more note, it took me about an hour to completely bake the bread to perfection."

"reviewBody": "This dense, seed-rich bread is my favorite - year round! I enjoy it warm, right out of the bread machine, but toasted in thick slices - it's heavenly - and my guests always agree! I prefer 1\" slices, buttered lightly, and golden toasted in a skillet on the stove. Wrap leftover loaf tight and it will store in the fridge for several weeks. Modifications: I add a smidge (1/4 t.) of yeast and sometimes add 1/4 cup cooked, cooled cracked wheat which necessitates the addition of 1/2 cup flour, more or less. But I'm sure that any failures (insufficient rise) I've had with this recipe are because of yeast quality."

"reviewBody": "I've made this recipe several times. It's long on great texture and a bit short on flavor. So to experiment, I used 3 tbl butter, 1 1/2 tsp salt, 4 tbl honey and because it comes out a little flat, I used 2 1/2 tsp yeast. And I used a bit more water. It was a bit damp after the proof but it shaped up w a little kneading and some sprinkled flour. Because it's more moist, give it the full 35 minutes at 350. I took it out at 30 and it wasn't ready. Success? Closer. I may try molasses instead of honey next time. It certainly rose nicely and the additional butter creates a more moist loaf. Oh, I also used toasted but not salted sunflower seeds. I'm not sure that difference was detectable. I was out of pumpkin seeds. I used half cup flax seeds and half cup sunflower. And a quarter cup quinoa. The flax seeds may be mostly bio unavailable, as one reviewer noted, but I do like the texture difference they offer."

"reviewBody": "This was a pretty good wheat bread recipe. I had everything, but had to sub flaxmeal for the seeds . That worked fine. I am just not a fan of the seeds whole. I also used white whole wheat. My sunflower seeds were unsalted and roasted. For some reason the bread machine recipes never suggest warm water. Out of habit I used warm water, and about 105~110 degrees. On the cycle, suggested, it took 3 hrs and 25 minutes in my Zojirushi bread machine. This bread tasted like whole wheat bread and had that healthy flavor. However, it was soft and had an almost buttery aftertaste. Cutting it with my Presto bread guide I got 17 slices at 129 calories each."

When the bread machine signaled it was time to add the sunflower seeds, I was worried because the dough seemed SO sticky that it was having a hard time even moving the ball of dough around. I helped it along for a minute or so after I first put added the sunflower seeds, but eventually said \"forget it\" and decided to let it do its thing. It somehow worked out, and created a beautiful, rich loaf. This bread TOASTED is like heaven on earth. YUM! Will definitely make this over and over again."

This recipe seems to be the perfect combination of flour, liquid and oil. I like how it turns out soft but hearty. So, I plan to try this recipe but change it up for rye bread. Instead of all the whole wheat flour I plan to use 2/3 cup of rye flour and 2/3 cup of whole wheat. I'll add a teaspoon of caraway seeds in place of sunflower seeds. Instead of honey I'll use molasses. Hoping it turns out right."

Set breadmaker for dough; my breadmaker instructions say to put these in at the start of the 2nd knead cycle, which was 30 minutes into the dough process. Let it rise in a greased loaf pan and baked at 350 for 25 minutes. PERFECTO! We changed what we were eating for dinner so we could have this bread with it. We are in love with this bread and will be making it again. I know it will also be great as toast with jam on it~ Thanks for a great recipe!\r\nBy the way, my grocery didn't have whole wheat bread flour available, so I just used regular bread flour for the whole amount of flour - no problem. Did not change any of the other ingredients - perfect as is."

"reviewBody": "This bread is FANTASTIC! I just bought my Zojirushi and this was the second bread I've ever made. I did it from start to finish in the machine and it turned out great. I was debating the whole time whether I wanted to finish it in the oven, but now I'm glad I didn't because I honestly don't think it needed it. The texture wasn't like typical bread machine breads. This bread had an awesome thin, flaky crust, and the texture of the bread itself was really light. The sunflower seeds add a delicious, nutty flavor to the whole thing. A few minor substitutions, instead of the flaxseeds I used 1/4 cup flax meal for nutrients, although I did toss a tbs or two of whole flaxseeds because I like the crunch. I also added 1/4 cup King Arthur fiber, and some KA whole grain improver. I ran out of bread flour so I had to use all purpose, it still tasted great though. I added a little bit of KA 6 grain flakes for added flavor and texture. As per so many recommendations here, I used canola oil instead of butter. This really turned out great and I would highly recommend. I even gave this to my (honest) chef father who doesn't typically like wheat or \"healthy\" type breads, and he even loved it. We buy multigrain bread at the grocery store to have as toast for breakfast every day, but this has totally replaced that. I'm so happy to have such a great recipe and know exactly what is going in my bread, definitely no preservatives!"
