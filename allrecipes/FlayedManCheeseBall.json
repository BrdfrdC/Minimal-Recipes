I think it's important to spray the mask with pam before adding the Saran Wrap like the recipe states. It helps hold the plastic wrap in place for the details etc before packing with the cheese mixture. It was so quick and easy to make. Turned out perfect."

"reviewBody": "This came out so cool. The hardest part about it was finding the mask. All of the stores had the plain white mask that stopped at the forehead but I found the correct one at AC Moore. The most important thing to remember about making the flesh is that you have to use proscuitto, not ham as I saw on another site. The proscuitto should be sliced super thin like authentic italian deli's do. Also, in addition to putting the initial blobs of cheese over the eyeballs, push the cheese mixture into the nose before filling the head the rest of the way. I made two of these and the first one had a flat nose that I had to play around with to get it to look right. The second one came out fantastic. They were a big hit at the parties. Lots of people taking pics on their phones. Unfortunately, nobody wanted to be the first to cut into it and ruin it so it sat for quite a while, untouched. You might have to be the first one to cut into it after all of the pictures are taken."

I put toothpicks into the olives while I packed the cheese in, so I could keep the olives straight. But...don't worry, you can straighten them out once it's flipped onto the plate. I also shaped the lips with a toothpick once it was flipped out of the mask because they didn't come out too well. I combined the cheese ball part of the recipe with another dip mix. I put the cream cheese, green olives and cheddar into my food processor. I then added a packet of Cugino's \"Garlic Schmarlic\" dip mix. So delicious! People are still talking about it, and were posting pics all over social media!"

Similar to other recommendations, I added the eyes after I had flipped it onto the plate. That made it easier to place them. I set it out to get room temp for about 40 minutes before everyone ate into it. It was a perfect consistency by that point (otherwise this style dip is rather firm/thick right out of the fridge). Thank you for sharing this very creative idea for a recipe!"

I made some changes with my cheese ball because I absolutely hate the taste of olives. I used the three cheeses listed but added a packet of green onion soup mix, minced garlic and a little worcestshire sauce and it tasted pretty good. It was a hit at the party. I posted it and my sister just asked \"Why?\""

I also only used one 3-oz package of prosciutto, and I had one slice left (and I bought the bigger mask of the two sizes the store had). I’m guessing it made about 3 cups of cheeseball mixture. It definitely was a conversation starter at the party!"

"reviewBody": "This was the gruesome hit of our Allrecipes pre-Halloween party. One of my co-workers scooped out an eyeball right away and ate it. Sick. The cheese mixture was exactly the right amount for the mask, and it firmed up nicely and held its shape. And it tasted really good! Tips: 1) It's tricky to position the olives so they don't get all wonky when you add the cheese filling. Next time, I might add them afterwards. 2) I used the edge of a spoon to emphasize the outline of the lips. I think that made it extra life-like. 3) The next time I make this, I might download a photo of the musculature of the face, and try to copy that with the prosciutto. Because that's how I roll. 4) This isn't just for Halloween; how about a Game of Thrones or Walking Dead viewing party?"

I used my food processor and my stand mixer to save time and my wrists,so it was pretty quick. I must note that some people were really intimidated by this dish, some didn't want to look at it and others were afraid to cut into it (they went for the eyes first). The presentation just gets more gruesome from there. Those who were brave enough to eat it loved it and took pictures of it."
