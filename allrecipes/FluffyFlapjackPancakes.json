I think I could have dropped it more, but for the time being we enjoyed these. I used olive oil due to the fact my Hubby seems to have this obsession with it right now. These came out great."

"reviewBody": "Noticed that others weren't getting fluffy results. I always sift the dry ingredients together first. The instructions say to mix the batter until it's thin. I really think you should be gentle with the batter and allow some lumps. When the batter starts to bubble, gently scoop it and place it in the pan. You have to use the batter right away, or your pancakes will be flat. Also sub'd 2T melted butter for 1/4 c. of Canola. Vanilla would be a nice addition."

I would try less sugar and add some vanilla, or use buttermilk if I were to make them again. I normally use a recipe (it‚Äôs more work though) that separates the egg and you fold in the whipped egg whites last. That makes a lighter fluffier pancake for sure."
