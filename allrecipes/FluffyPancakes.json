I used lemon juice instead of vinegar to sour the milk and, as I always do with pancake or crepe batter, I let the batter rest for 30 minutes before cooking. Batter was thick and bubbly and made light, fluffy pancakes. Also made them substituting spelt flour for about 1/8 of the AP. I'll probably play around with various proportions of various flours. Great basic recipe!"

And if you're adding frozen blueberries, microwave them for 20-30 seconds first to defrost them, otherwise the batter around the frozen blueberries doesn't cook at the same rate as the rest of the pancake."

Absence of oil in the recipe? Who knows. Lots of varaibles..."

When you finish stirring and the batter starts bubbling up don’t stir again! Just scoop and put in the pan. You want those bubbles for the fluff. These remind me of my grandmas pancakes. I always double the recipe because it really doesn’t make very many!! This is my go-to recipe for the rest of my life."

"reviewBody": "My sister recommended this recipe so I like it, but I feel my adjustments might help some who are finding this too sour. 1. At least double the recipe. This hardly makes any, and doubling will allow the 2nd (and more important) adjustment to be easier to measure. 2. Instead of soured milk, use buttermilk. So instead of (if doubled) 1 1/2 cups milk and 4 Tbsp vinegar, use 1 3/4 cups buttermilk. 3. If you can get cultured buttermilk, it's even better!"

As well I cut the salt back to only half. No one could tell the difference. Fluffy, fluffy, fluffy! Loved it!"

I helped them spread out a bit with my rubber spatula, but they still stayed nice and fluffy."

I changed the “sour milk” recipe after reading one comment stating it gave a lingering weird aftertaste I also add extracted vanilla and powdered cinnamon so thankfully my first batch was delicious! Makes 12 pancackes if you use the 1/4 measuring cup. My family now loves homemade pancakes for breakfast they taste almost like iHops which we love!"

It doesn’t have the weird, acrid tang aftertaste a lot of pancake recipes do. If you’re feeling froggy, throw a tsp of vanilla extract into the mix, it’s 👌. If you say you can taste the vinegar you are doing something wrong."

These turned out looking really big, puffy, and beautiful. I got 6 - 4 inch pancakes from this recipe. I did have to add a little more milk because I live in a dry climate and flour here is always dry. This recipe is so easy! I did add about 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the batter. Everyone thought they were great. This will now replace those chemical laden box mixes. Thank You!"

It takes 3 batches from original recipe to fill pan and you can put whatever toppings you want on top. 375* for 15min. Still, the fluffiest pancakes!!! Yumm!"

"reviewBody": "This was not a good recipe at all. I'm not sure where all of these glowing reviews came from but be cautious. That is why I'm writing this. I don't typically leave reviews but this was WAY too off. The batter was way too wet and I knew it would be based on the ratios but I gave it a try anyway. I didn't get the vinegar taste that others were talking about and I also didn't get the dense batter they spoke of either. I followed the recipe exactly at first. To salvage this recipe I added 1 more cup of AP flour, 1/2 cup of sugar, doubled the baking powder, added a pinch more of salt and vanilla. After making all of these changes then they were fluffy and edible when before they were rubbery and flat."
