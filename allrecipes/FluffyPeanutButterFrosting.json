I have never had an issue with graininess...if it starts getting hard to mix, I add a bit of milk. It's never as smooth and shiny as chocolate or vanilla buttercream but it spreads just as easily. I always use Jif...I don't think natural peanut butter will work. I make it vegan by using vegan butter and unsweetened plant milk. Heaven."

"reviewBody": "Here is how make it fluffy. Temperate is the key. In a cool kitchen, start with room temperature peanut butter in the automatic mixer. Mix it a bit to cream it and prepare it for the butter. Add the butter but don’t use warm butter or soft butter. Use cooler than room temp butter but not just out of the refrigerator. The butter will soften gradually. Once incorporated fully add 1/3 the sugar fresh out of the fridge will keep the oils from separating also, a tablespoon very cold milk right off the bat. Do that a second time and judge yourself if you need more milk on the final round. What we are really doing is playing with the temperature of the butter within the recipe. Letting the friction of the mixing peanut butter melt the butter then cooling it again with cold sugar and milk is a delicate dance but can make the creamiest and fluffiest. Refrigeration recommend anyways because there’s milk in the recipe. Hope this helps. I’ll send pics when I got a better cam. Good luck"

"reviewBody": "Wow! This recipe is a winner! I’m my kitchen aid mixer I started by creaming the room temperature butter until nice and fluffy. I then added the peanut butter until it was nice and smooth and I could no longer see the butter. Very slowly I added the confectioners sugar. I would pause and scrape the bowl intermittently. It then became nice and whipped. I slowly added the milk one tablespoon at a time. In the end I only needed two tablespoons to achieve the consistency I wanted for spreading on the cake and piping. If you follow the recipe and are patient with the mixing and whipping of this frosting I promise the results are magical! It was delicious! And the saltiness in the peanut butter and I also used salted butter helped cut the sweetness of my chocolate cake."

To make it more spreadable after beating it, I added a couple tablespoons of heavy cream. I haven't frosted my cake yet, but I think it will be fine."

I made 1 -1/2 times the recipe because I wanted to frost 2 dozen cup cakes. I made this in my stand mixer and had all the ingredients at room temperature. After I added the first two cups of sugar, the frosting looked light and creamy, but when I added the third cup of sugar (remember I increased the recipe quantity) the frosting became much too hard--more like making buckeyes than frosting. As directed, I added more milk, a tablespoon at a time, and suddenly the recipe curdled. No matter how much I beat it, it was a horrible greasy mess and a waste of my time and ingredients. Nasty."

Wonderful recipe I am adding to my regulars. Added a little 1/4 PB cup on top for my daughter's equestrian bday, would look cute with oreo cookie sprinkles too for dirt but had none on hand. Thanks so much for sharing."

I don't like super-sweet icing, and this recipe hit the spot.... just the right amount of sweet, light &amp; fluffy, flavor reminds me of Reese's. I used it to ice chocolate cupcakes (great combo!), and it covered 22 cupcakes well. The consistency piped easily. The recipe was super-easy to make, exactly as written. One thing I will add, in response to the people with flops..... I followed the advice of a professional baker, who said she ALWAYS uses WHOLE milk in her icing, and that the milk and (REAL) butter MUST be room temperature. It's a simple thing, but this makes a real difference!"

But this recipe pleasantly surprised us. The few changes we made were:\nPeanut butter and sugar in a 1:1 ratio- so basically we didnt want to make it too sweet and so we halved the sugar.\nThis change made us use not more than 1-2 tbsp milk.\n(And this might sound funny but we used crunchy peanut butter. We love it.)"

This covered a 9 inch layer cake perfectly with no leftovers (bummer...it was so good I could have sat down with a spoon and bowl lol!). My granddaughter totally approved of this for her first birthday cake, as did other family members, including my peanut butter loving hubby :)."
