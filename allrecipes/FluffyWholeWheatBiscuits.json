Some were actually nearly 2 inches tall and so yummy."

I did a square cut as to avoid scraps. Only ended up 9 biscuits but for the 2 of us that was just fine for a Sunday morning. Husband had at least 2 maybe 3. He buttered the top and did not add his favorite jelly. This will now be a permanent staple in my Sunday morning breakfast rotation. May try to somehow double the recipe to increase more biscuits."

"reviewBody": "These biscuits are absolutely delicious! I have never made a biscuit that had whole wheat in it. I also liked that these were made with butter over shortening and only 4 tblsp of fat. I made a mock buttermilk with 2% milk and about a 1/2 tsp. of so of vinegar. For the whole wheat I used Gold Medal white whole wheat flour (a lighter tasting whole wheat made with a lighter colored grain). The batter looked a little wet so I stirred in a scoop, maybe a 1/2 cup or so of AP flour extra. I lined my square baking pan with heavy duty foil, sprayed it with Bakers Joy, and patted the dough into a nice even square. I gently cut the square in half, each half in half, then cut across the other way into 3 (to get a total of 12 biscuits). Found square biscuits were so much easier than round ones which are messy and over-work the dough. I think they are softer this way too, because the biscuits are kept together. I believe I got this method from AR Kentucky Biscuits. It worked great with these too. I will definitely make these again, they tasted like a really good thick very soft biscuit. Baking time was 17-18 minutes. Thank you!"

I did end up making these as drop biscuits. A little crumbly if cutting, but I'd much rather it be crumbly compared to too firm. Overall, very good!"

"reviewBody": "These biscuits turned out far better than I expected. We were out of all-purpose flour so I only had 3/4 cup. To make it up, I used 1 1/4 c whole wheat flour. I doubled the amount of butter and used a whole stick instead. This was an excellent decision. \r\nLike many other reviewers stated, this is a wet dough. However, I moved forward, turned it out onto the board, sprinkled it with flour between each knead. It firmed up nicely and made gorgeous biscuits with flaky layers. \r\nSomething is wrong with our oven so the bottoms were a bit dark after 10 minutes. I'd put them on a higher rack next time but I'm sure we're the only people with a 1960-something gas oven that heats 50 degrees higher than the thermostat!"

"reviewBody": "Giving this three stars for taste &amp; texture ~ agree with another review that I could not roll out this VERY sticky dough. Added more flour while attempting to knead &amp; made the last biscuit the size of three due to frustration with the dough. To my surprise ~ they came out quite nicely...the sticky ones and the drier dough ones.....even the large one. Perhaps using 1 C. White Whole Wheat Flour (along with the 1 C. All-Purpose Flour) made a difference, so I will attempt another trial using 1 C. Whole Wheat Flour next time. Good next day as well ~ did not dry out!"

My whole family loves biscuits but I always felt horrible about all the white flour and crisco. I tried a couple others but while I liked them my husband always complained that they tasted a little too healthy. This is perfect. My husband loved it (and so did everyone else). He said he couldn't even tell the difference. The biscuits where light and fluffy and just like we love them. 10 stars in my book!"

They rose beautifully, were tender and delicious. They were pretty bumpy on the top since I barely kneaded them and too sticky to pat down, but they were so good nobody cared. You can get away w/all whole wheat flour, but be sure it's pastry flour or they can get pretty tough."

"reviewBody": "For goodness sake, don't just dump the liquid in while making your biscuits as different humidity levels will effect how your flour absorbs the milk. I'm assuming the submitter meant the 1/2 cp to be a general guide. I whipped up half a batch in less than the time needed to gather the ingredients and use 2T less milk than called for. Just take your time and feel the dough with your hands. These were lovely and baked up beautifully. For hubby, I'll probably cut wheat flour to 1/3 cup and use a bit more white flour - but again, personally, I thought they were spectacular. Only cutters I had were 2 1/4\" and 3\" so I used the smaller of the two and came out with exactly 6 biscuits. Will definately make again and tysm for recipe!"

I was to lazy to roll them out and use a cookie cutter, so I rolled everything into a log and divided into 6 equal pieces. I rolled each piece into a rough circle and baked in a ceramic pie plate. They were fantastic! It takes longer to bake this way... after 12 minutes I reduced the temperature to 350 and checked them every few minutes until they were lightly browned. I think overall they were in the oven about 20 minutes. I will definitely be making these again!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe my absolute favorite! It is so versitile and the buiscuts come out flakey and taste just like buttermilk biscuits. I have made these several times and they always turn out wonderful. This is a very wet dough and I usually need to knead some flour into it. An important tip for makeing biscuits: knead the dough as little as possible! These turn out muh better when I knead the dough only a few times and pat the dough out gently with my hands to get the right thickness. They do take about 12 minutes to cook, but it depends on how thick your biscuits are. I have also tried this recipe with all white flour for picky eaters and it turns out just as good! I usually make a double batch (one whole wheat and one regular) and after I cut them out, I place them on a cookie sheet in the freezer for an hour or two, Then move them to a freezer bag. Then when I need biscuits, I just pull out a few whole wheat and a few white flour ones. I cook them as normal and I dont have to add any cooking time. They are so conventient and easy to make!!! I have also replaced the talespoon of sugar with honey and noticed no difference in taste, but though dough was a little bit wetter. These buiscuts are not sweet, so if you like sweet biscuits, add more sugar. This is definately a wonderful recipe I will kep around!!"

We don't use a lot of dairy, so I used soy milk in place of the buttermilk, and they still came out very tasty. They were very tender and fluffy, but also a little flat. I think when I make them again, I will roll them out thicker, maybe double the recipe to make a dozen. I don't know if they came out flat because of the altitude, we are at 7,000 feet elevation. I will definitely make these again!"
