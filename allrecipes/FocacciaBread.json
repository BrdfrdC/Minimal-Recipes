I bump up the seasonings just a bit and I definitely proof the yeast with the water, sugar and salt before adding it to the dough. I let it rise for 20 minutes, punch it down and form it back into a ball before letting it rise another 20 minutes. I just put as much cheese on it as I feel like at the moment lol"

I added fresh herbs from the garden (parsley, sage, rosemary and... basil) to the yeast during the final stages of my bread machine's mixing cycle. I also used fresh garlic, rather than dried. I used the baked bread with another terrific recipe on this site, Grilled Mediterranean Vegetable Sandwich. Update: after a very long absence, I made this again. It's still a favorite. However, I made a dumb mistake and baked the dough directly on parchment paper. It caused the bread to fuse with the paper! ðŸ˜¯. Next time, I'll follow the directions and bake it on a greased baking sheet."

I was making two different dishes, one was spicy, and I thought the plain focaccia would compliment that dish better. I couldn't have been more pleased! It was so easy to make, and I got a lot of compliments. The only thing I did differently in the prep, was digging in with my fingers when shaping it, and sprinkling olive oil liberally on top, not brushing. \nI made them early in the afternoon, baked them, cooled on a wire rack, put a thin dishtowel over them, and then lightly reheated them before serving. Delicious!"

Went great with all. It's quick, easy, and I used my rocker knife to slice it into bread strips. Or just tear a chunk off. One note, the first time you make it, watch it so the cheese on top doesn't get too brown. Gonna be a regular for me!"

We have made it into different shapes, we have made it into breadsticks by rolling it out before putting it into the oven we also have done biscuits by, rolling little balls of dough and cooking it. The biggest hit with this bread ( other than by itself with soup ) is homemade pizza. I make a pizza shape and cook it for 10 minutes then take it out and put sauce and topping on and cook it for another 5 minutes. It truly is delicious and a definite keep for the rest of my life. Leaving it in the oven (or other warm place) for a couple hours really helped how it turned out and rise before I cooked it in the oven. It is really simple and fun to make with, common spices and quick timing. Our family loves it!"

Unfortunately (rookie mistake on my part) I used milk straight out of the fridge &amp; think that's why my bread didn't rise at all the first go-round. I gave it 20 more minutes to rise in the unheated oven with the light on &amp; it got a little puffy, but not much. Then I punched down the little bit that had risen, flattened it, dimpled it, drizzled oil &amp; salt on it &amp; baked it in my cast iron skillet.\n\nIt came out fluffy &amp; delicious with a crispy bottom, and it was a big hit with the family, but the texture was like a scone or biscuit, not focaccia. I am left wondering if it was a yeast issue or if maybe using bread flour would have given the usual texture. I also noticed the dough was quite dry as it was mixing, so maybe that had something to do with it. \n\nNext time I make it I will add some oil to the recipe, use bread flour, &amp; make sure to let the yeast bloom, rather than adding it to the dry ingredients."

The taste was ok, texture not what I wanted. Made two batches, one dough was stickier and came out a bit softer, but still more like a biscuit. I'm using SAF yeast."

Once your water/yeast/sugar mixture is nice and bubbly (it was about 5-10 minutes for me), add it to your dry ingredients- this will help immensely later on in the recipe. Also, as a few other users have mentioned, after you punch down the dough after letting it rise, let it sit and rise again for another 30 minutes. :)"

I used 2.5 teaspoons of Italian Seasonings instead of the seasonings in the recipe due to what I had in my pantry. I should have watched it closer because 15 minutes a a little too long. Luckily it was not burnt but it was certainly very close to burning. I cut off the edges and my kids (5,8) ate almost the whole bread."

The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it omitted using warm water with the yeast and letting the yeast prepare.

Next time I will press it a little thicker for the final product."
