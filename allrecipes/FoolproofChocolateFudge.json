Try drained and chopped maraschino cherries mixed in, or add instant coffee, almond extract, cherry extract, mix in pnut butter early for pnutbutter fudge."

My husband is the only family member who likes nuts in the fudge,so I do half with pecans (roast them for 15 minutes @ 325 with a pinch of salt for extra flavor ) and the kids like mini marshmallows. \nI’ve made this for so long,people just expect it. This fudge recipe along with Eagle Brand 7 layer bars are perfect small but sweet treats"

"reviewBody": "Note the 2nd positive review: \"I use one bag go milk chocolate chips and add 1/2 bag of semi-sweet also. This leaves a very nice creamy texture. Here's a little tip that everyone loves. Freeze the remaining 1/2 bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips. At the end of stirring, pour in the frozen chocolate chips, give the mix one good, quick, final stir, pour into pan and refrigerate. (I like it cold!) The mixture is hot enough to melt part, but not all, of the frozen chips. It will leave tiny chocolate chunks throughout. Want another tip? After preparing as I did above, add one cup of peanut butter to this recipe before the final stirring and refrigerate. Mmmm!! (If adding the frozen chocolate chips, always add them last to prevent them from melting totally.) Having trouble getting it out of the pan? Line the pan with foil. After it sets, simply lift it out, remove the foil, and place the fudge on a dish or cutting surface to cut.\""

The second time I was short on semi-sweet chips, so used two cups semi and one cup milk chocolate chips. Be sure to use good quality chips, as the chocolate is the main focal point. With the second batch, I did not stir the nuts in, but after pouring the fudge in the pan, I sprinkled the top with chopped pecans and toffee chips, and pressed it in so it would stick, before placing fudge in fridge to set. I placed each square in a mini baking cup and stacked it on a pretty tray. Everyone loved it! No one knows how simple it was to make ;D"

I do add a bag of reese's peanut butter chips for peanut butter chocolate fudge (gently fold in the peanut butter chips). This is especially good if you don't like the typical sweet fudge. *I also line the pan with tin foil instead of wax paper, works great."

Melt stir till smooth and pour in 8\" foil lined pan. Meanwhile, melt 1 c caramel bits with 1 T half and half. Pour over fudge in pan and swirl with a knife. Sprinkle with a bit of coarse sea salt. Just gilded the lily a little :)"

Stir again and done.I make this every year. Everyone looks forward to it every Christmas. To get the fudge out of the pan easily, line the pans with plastic wrap. After it cools you can just lift it out by the overlapping edges of the film."

I tried it with butterscotch and also white chocolate chips, but it never set up enough to cut into firm squares with those. We ate a few pieces and ended up throwing it out. Too bad, because I was going to give it as gifts."

I used chopped pecans and melted the chips and milk in a pyrex in the microwave, worked wonderfully. I sprinkled a few crushed peppermint pieces on top after spreading it into the dish for a lovely mint touch (good for Christmas). I also lined my dish with foil, leaving some hanging over the edge and sprayed it lightly with oil. It was a snap to lift from the dish, put on a cutting board and cut into any size piece desired!"

"reviewBody": "This is the recipe for fudge my mom made and we've loved through the years. I add 1 cup milk chocolate chips and 1 T of corn syrup to make a smoother taste and texture. I like to make half a batch just with nuts and half a batch with rum-soaked raisins and nuts. \nTwo tips: \n1. I line a glass container with aluminum foil will extra foil on the edges to help lift the fudge out.\n2. When the fudge is lightly set I take a pizza cutter and cut my pieces then let it set fully. When I'm ready to serve it, it is already evenly scored and it comes apart neatly.\nThis is a wonderful, not too sweet, fudge to make with children, too."

Never really loved the grainy texture, the sticky knuckles of trying to get the marshmallow out of the jar, stirring for long periods over a hot stove waiting for the right temperature, only to have it sometimes not set up or set way too hard.\n\nNot this recipe. Super easy, prepares fast, sets up fast, no question as to whether it will set properly, and it is SO SMOOTH. Versatile too, as you can add any nuts, or even 1/2 a cup of PB for chocolate/pb fudge."

"reviewBody": "This is simple, almost foolproof and it be altered into so many different tastes - just use your imagination. I almost always reduce the chips to two cups. Most of the time I use a mixture of 1/2 semi sweet and 1/2 milk chocolate chips. I vary the additions (extracts, spices, fruit nuts, cereals) whatever occurs to me at the time. I have used white chips with lemon, orange or maple extract. Pour it into a bigger pan and top with batch chocolate fudge. YUM! Yep, you are only limited by your imagination. Personally I think this so much better than the popular Fantasy Fudge made with marshmallow crème and cocoa."

"reviewBody": "The second time I made this recipe, I made two batches. I used a 9x13\" pan. I used dark chocolate, ghirardelli 60% choc. chips for the first batch. I spread it on the bottom of the pan. Then, I made a batch with ghirardelli milk chocolate chips,and spread it on top of the dark. The two types of chocolate, layered like that, with the contrasting flavors of dark and milk chocolate in each bite is tantalizing to the taste buds! My family and neighbors love it! I do have some problems with the dark choc. mixture becoming grainy. Will try 16oz. instead of 18 next time. The milk choc has been perfect each time.\nSuggestions on why this is happening are most welcome!"

Next time I will try one cup milk chocolate as other's have suggested, just to try the difference, but I thought this recipe was great as is. Soft, shiny, perfect textured fudge that tastes like it took a lot longer to make. I will make again for my work's bake sale fundraiser this month."

It gave the fudge a lot more flavor. I also recommend swapping out half of the semi-sweet chocolate chips with peanut butter chips. These add a lot of flavor and are a different kind of fudge. I will definitely be making this fudge again."
