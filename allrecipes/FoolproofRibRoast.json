I made it with sauted mushrooms and made au jus out of pan drippings by deglazzing the roasting pan. this was the 1st time I have made rib roast I am impressed with this recipe , follow 5 lb guideline and the recipe you won't be disappointed.

I was very scared to try it the first time, didn't want to ruin $60 worth of rib roast but the recipe worked great. I use the same 'rub' that I use on steak, this is how I do it, first rub the meat with a mixture of avocado oil and Kitchen Bouquet, then dust with garlic and onion powder and celery salt, and finally pat on Montreal Steak mixture. Makes an awesome crust, yum!"

The simple rub is a big plus - nothing to detract from the fine taste of an expensive cut of beef. As others have mentioned, the size of the roast makes a BIG difference! If your roast is not around 5 pounds you will need to make adjustments in timing. It would be really helpful if this recipe addressed that issue."

Once the initial hour is up, I leave it there until about an hour before we want to eat, then turn the oven on 375. Once the oven reaches 375, start timing. For medium rare cook 20 minutes, if you like it more on the rare side 12-15 minutes, well done 35 minutes, then take out and let set 20 minutes. We like medium rare so I take it out when meat thermometer shows 115-118, but I have also just used the timing method when a thermometer was not available at a VBRO and it was still perfect!"

"reviewBody": "I use this recipe every time I cook my rib roasts. I generally cook 8-12 pound roasts. A few tips as I have used many different recipes and have used this method at least 12 times. First a big roast needs to be out of the refrigerator 3-4 hours before cook time. Second ( this is the most important note to remember) After preheating the oven and cooking at 375 for the hour and shutting it off, the temperature climb’s for at least three hours. You must I repeat YOU MUST pay attention to when the temperature stop’s climbing to the point of going down one degree, at that moment you must turn it back on to finish cooking. If you don’t your internal temperature will not be accurate and you will end up with a well done rib roast that’s only good for stew or soup. I learned this the hard way. You can also cook baked potatoes while preheating and sitting as long as they are on the sides of the oven and not directly under the roasting pan. Enjoy and wow your family and friends."

That said, I roasted exactly as directed, and after the total time called for (1 hr + 3hrs + 40mins) and the probe thermometer showed 120 degrees. I took it out as it smelled done. Rested it, and carved, and was done to a med rare as we prefer. My suggestion would be that if you roast to 145, you'll have a med well to well done after roasting."

Instead of turning my oven off, I drop it to its lowest setting and start checking the temperature every 30 minutes, starting after 1 1/2 hours.\n\nEarly on, I ended up with roasts that were VERY rare to medium-well. Keeping the oven on lets me check it, but replaces the heat lost from opening the door. Plus, even though ovens are supposed to keep the heat in them, not every oven is made the same so they won't hold temperatures the same. Keeping it on low seems to take that part of the process out of the equation."

Slightly overdone. Next time for this size roast (2 ribs) I would cut the first cook time to 30 minutes, turn off oven for 2 hours and check the temp. It was still delicious using this recipe for the first time. I also used The Spice House’s English Prime Rib Rub. I highly recommend"

I made it exactly as the recipe states. It was a little over 5 pounds and it came out absolutely phenomenal. We had it for my son's birthday dinner and everyone loved it!"

It rested for 3 hrs ( with a taped shut oven!), then I reheated for 45”. Tested for about 15” and then we carved it. Rave reviews from our company, and I feel like an expert! Thank you! \n\n I also had added 8 scrubbed and foil wrapped potatoes to the oven, and that worked perfectly as well...."

I combined all the spices as recommended, added dried rosemary, stirred the spices &amp; used ~ 1/2 on the roast &amp; added some to the beef broth in the pan. I can’t wait to do this again!

The other recipe that is similar is Chef Johns \"perfect prime rib.\" Less steps! You have to do a little math but no second warm up and no meat thermometer required. Also I used Penzys North Woods spice blend. WOW so good!"

Our son is a Professional Chef and he said it was fantastic. \nToday I still had a nice size piece of the prime rib, I sliced it into thin strips and put it aside while I made brown rice, cooked fresh veggies in the wok then made a light orange sauce. Last was to put the strips of beef into the wok and stir lightly (no heat) the veggies warmed the beef. It was super tender and we actually have leftovers! Hubby has already packed his lunch for work tomorrow. \nI highly recommend this method, it’s fool proof!"

But we prefer more on the rare side. Edges were cooked medium. Sitting another hour I'm not sure how much more it would have cooked. We used a 5 lb roast exactly as the recipe calls for."

This will be our go-to dinner for the holidays from now on. So simple, but so delicious."

However 45 minutes before we were ready for the meat, at 375 put it back in, and the last 5 minutes threw in marinated mushrooms that I marinated not store bought, it came out amazing. Thank you"

I let it sit in the refrigerator over night (10 hrs). Then I removed the roast from the brine, pat it dry and followed the recipe exactly. My whole family loved it. My 4 yr old ate a huge piece and husband went back for a 3rd helping. We'll definitely make this again."

My husband does not like his meat “bloody rare” so I just adjusted the times for a medium rare. Having a temperature probe would solve any timing issues for how you want your meat cooked. I will be purchasing said temperature probe plus a wire v-rack to place roast upright."

After reading other reviews I figured this would be a slam dunk but I ended up having to put slices under the broiler to get them up to medium rare which resulted in a big delay and my sides getting cold and soggy. Next time I think I’ll start it at 475. 375 just doesn’t cook a big roast like that."
