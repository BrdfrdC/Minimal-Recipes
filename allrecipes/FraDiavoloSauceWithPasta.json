I used canned Marzano type and some red pepper stewed tomatoes as fresh is pretty expensive where I live. A definite great choice for the menu rotation!"

Cook that down a little then add tomatoes and I used a small can of tomato paste. Once that cooks a few minutes I added about 1/2 cup white wine and crushed red peppers. We love spice so I added 3 tsp of red peppers, we want our tongue to burn! I let that cook down for about 20-30 mins. I started the pasta and dried out the shrimp with paper towels. Once most of the water was gone from the shrimp, I seasoned the shrimp with cayenne pepper and salt. I added the shrimp to the sauce and allowed to cook. Once the pasta had cooked for 5 mins, I added a splash of heavy cream and oregano to the sauce. I let that cook down until pasta was done and added the parsley. It was spicy and delicious!"

Since fresh tomatoes aren't good year round and canned are often cheaper, I use two cans of salt-free diced and one can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes. I cut the red pepper to about 1/4 tsp., add 3 tsp dried oregano, 1/2 cup white wine, and double the shrimp. I love the flavor of the sauce when its cooked down and my husband always comments on how good it tastes. Shrimp dishes can be tricky and this one always comes out right! Thank you for sharing Marbalet!"

After the sauce cooked down, I thought I'd like a little more, so I added a couple more cups of fresh tomatoes that I had planned to freeze. We like spicy so both my husband I added a little more crushed pepper, but spiciness is a matter of taste. This will be a recipe I make again. Hubby LOVED it! I am looking forward do making it when I have time to make homemade pasta."

After I sauteed the shrimp, I added them to the sauce, which had been simmering for 30 minutes and also added about 1/2 tablespoon of white truffle oil. I also added bok choy and green onion to the sauce originally. It was STUPENDOUS. Husband left no survivors."

"reviewBody": "I suppose it would be 4.5 only because I did make a few very minor adjustments...and people say how can you rate something accurately if you've altered it. I don't feel my adjustments were major enough although just enhanced just a little for what I know my preferences are...I added maybe 1/4 c of white wine and about 2 tbs of chopped fresh basil to the sauce. I did choose to use a can of crushed tomatoes like many others and had half a can of diced tomatoes left over so added that-I don't see that altering the flavor. I tasted the sauce after it cooked about 30 minutes and loved it! My rating is based off that. I then opted to add maybe 1/4 tsp of sugar to see the difference since some mentioned it. Only because I had a taste for it and to stretch the seafood flavor (couldn't buy scallops but used 3/4 pounds of shrimp) I added a can of minced clams. That took it to 5 stars for me, but bottom line it's a great recipe and if I ever have fresh tomatoes I may try that way :)"

"reviewBody": "Easy and delish! I modified it by heating extra cloves of garlic and then added 1 large link of SoyRizo (brown it) + 2 fresh quartered vine tomatoes. Cooked the tomatoes down and added the canned peeled tomatoes plus 1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes (I love a moderate heat on the tongue). Cooked spaghettini and added the fresh parsley and shrimp per the recipe. This resulted in a thick and hearty sauce - stick to your ribs kind of sauce that worked very well with the thin spaghettini (bonus if you get a nice Italian loaf to sop it up with). Pair this with a crisp Vinho Verde or Dry Riesling and you've got yourself a winner! If it was fall or winter I would have served a nice semi-dry, fruit forward red wine."

I also used the diced tomatoes with garlic, basil, and oregano and added red wine to the sauce. Finally, I mixed the sauce with the linguine instead of topping the pasta with the sauce. My family said it was the best dish that I've made in awhile (and I'm a pretty good cook)! This will definitely be in my recipe rotation."

"reviewBody": "This was very good, especially considering how few ingredients and the ease of preparation. My family doesn't like big chunks of tomatoes so I just dropped the immersion blender into the sauce pan for a few seconds, giving this a bit more interesting texture. I didn't have any scallops but threw in some frozen tiny langostino instead. I had large tail on shrimp so let those sit in some boiling water for a few minutes and tossed them in at the end so they wouldn't get rubbery. I think any seafood would be great. Added the red wine per other reviewers, a tsp or so of sugar and some italian seasoning. This would be a terrific recipe for last minute guests, too, since I keep these ingredients on hand and it really looks and tastes like a lot more effort than it is. All the kids and hubby commented on the great dinner. Thanks for a new go-to recipe!"
