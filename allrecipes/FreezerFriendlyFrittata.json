"reviewBody": "Delicious! Super cheesy and packed with flavor. It did seem like a lot of mushrooms at first, but it all worked out. The only thing I suggest is mincing the onion very finely, as it was just slightly undercooked, and I ended up baking my frittata for an extra 5 minutes. These are very hearty portions and make a filling breakfast. I even cut mine smaller (16 squares instead of 8) and the smaller size works well for me, with a side of toast. I take a slice or two out of the freezer and let thaw overnight in the fridge, then reheat at 60% power for about 1.5-2 minutes. Iâ€™ll definitely make this again!"
