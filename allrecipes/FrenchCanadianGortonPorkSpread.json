"reviewBody": "I made this recipe, but instead of using pork pieces, it's best to get your pork from the butcher and have them run it through the grinder on fine (twice). Place meat in the pot, add seasonings and pour just enough water to cover the meat. As the water boils down, continuously add more water. My mother would do this for about three hours. Then finally, keeping a somewhat watery (but not soupy) consistency, pour into bowls and place in fridge to cool. This makes it more like a smooth pate'. Spread it on hot toast or toasted French bread and it's the absolute best!!"

"reviewBody": "As a French-Canadian, I grew up on this stuff (more often called “creton”), and make a big batch every few months, but especially around the Holidays. I love it on toast with mustard for breakfast, a pretty traditional way to eat it. It’s mostly made with *ground* pork, but I decided to try this method using pork butt. I do have to point out that you don’t want LEAN meat at all - you must use fattier pieces to help the meat congeal once it cools so it turns into a spread. When meat is too lean, the spread doesn’t hold together and is crumbly. If using this recipe, I suggest putting the simmered meat, along with a bit of the liquid, into a blender for a few pulses to get a smoother, easier to spread, consistency. I found the flavor a bit bland - I am used to much more flavor, so I suggest adding more cinnamon and cloves. Allspice and nutmeg are other common ingredients you can add in. Milk is also often used instead of water, which helps the final texture. It was nice to try this recipe, but I will stick to my mom's."

"reviewBody": "just something missing. not enough tang to the taste. doesn't spread smoothly as it should. crumbles and falls apart. not easy to spread but the batter came out as smooth as can be. family used half pork butt and half ground beef. maybe the fat from beef gave it the needed consistency it needs and the flavor it is missing. it is not a very good recipe if i must experiment to get it up to par, but it is a good recipe as a starting point."

"reviewBody": "In Quebec cuisine, cretons (sometimes gorton or corton, especially among New Englanders of Quebec origin) is a pork spread containing onions and spices. Due to its fatty texture and taste, it resembles French rillettes. Cretons are usually served on toast as part of a traditional Quebec breakfast."

Delicious on white bread fresh from the bakery or bread-maker with gulden's brown mustard. I couldn't even spell this, but I found what I was looking for and am going to make it Christmas Eve."

"reviewBody": "I made this for a potluck and flavors are so much more complex than the recipe implies. People scarfed it down and it was one of the first dishes to be cleaned out. One thing that I would appreciate with the recipe is a little bit of acid. I tried splashing some cider vinegar but after sampling it seemed dangerous so I stopped. I'll play around with it a little more and figure out what I like: white vinegar?, wine?, citrus?, ??? But it's still pretty awesome as it is."
