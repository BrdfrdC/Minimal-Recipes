Different regions will vary. Mine uses 50/50 beef and pork (1 lb each), Boil in water with 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cloves, salt to taste. Boil and break down. Serve with Strawberry jam. I'm not fond of the turkey seasonings in this one but to each their own."

There is no binder for the filling. There is no means for it to stick together. It's just a pile of cooked ground meat.\n3. I drained the meat before putting it in the crust, but there still was some residual moisture - as such - I ended up with a soggy bottom crust! \n4. While reviews reveled in the 2nd and 3rd day flavors - mine waned. I still could not cut a clean slice of pie. It completely fell apart - and nothing rivaled the very first day when pulling it out of the oven fresh. \n\nI want to save this dish - please !! Looking forward to any advice!!! \n\nRed"

"reviewBody": "Yum! I didn't have any clove, so I used my clove essential oil. It was mild enough, I couldn't taste it, which I think I prefer. Next time I will have to try with ground clove, though. I had tried another from here a couple of years ago, and I found it too strong of the allspice that it called for. That one I'm sure I used all pork for. I'm not sure what the point of the water was... I pulled my filling out of the water, and just included a little of the water in the pie. Next time I won't use the water. I didn't find it too salty, as many have complained of (maybe some of the salt stayed in the water I didn't include). I think I prefer this with the beef/pork mixture. I also brushed egg white on before baking so it would brown nicely. I like some of the ideas to add some vegetables, so I will probably do that next time, as well. But, I was happy with how this turned out, overall."

I've made it with mashed potatoes as a binder but our pies always had finely diced potatoes and that's the way I prefer it. A mix of meat is fine, beef and pork are common but we also added venison if we had some from hunting season. The cloves are probably the most important spice to me!"

I should have read the reviews first, since many recommend potato or egg as a way to keep the meat together. I'll still try this again with one of those, since the flavor was so good."

I tried this recipe and it was very good; a little different from Yvette's though (again, I'm thinking it's the ground beef). We have this around Christmas time every year. My husband is from California and had never heard of this. First time I made it he ate 1/2 of the pork pie! I like mine with a some gravy and just veggies on the side."

I doubled the spices and added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I didn't have ground cloves so i added 3 whole cloves while cooking and removed them before filling the pies. I will definitively make this recipe again!"

Everyone raved about the meat pie and they are now requesting it for this Thanksgiving. :-)"

"reviewBody": "Yummy, tyvm for sharing! This is my third time making the recipe and this time I used an extra 1/2 lb of pork because we like deep dish style pies so just upped all the ingredients about 25%. I (reluctantly) added about 3/4 tsp of cinnamon as some reviewers suggested and have to admit, it added to the already abundant flavor of the filling. My only suggestion would be to add a tbsp or two (as needed) of unseasoned breadcrumbs for binding but don't add too much - the last time I overdid it and the filling came out a tad dry but still tasted great! Personally, I like a filling that holds together. I made the crust using butter flavor Crisco - perfect every time."

I grew up eating my mum's british meat pie (beef, carrots, onions, gravy....) so this was my first taste of Tourtiere. \n\nI really liked the flavour of the meat but I agree with some of the reviews that it was a little on the salty side. If I make it again, I'll cut down on the salt."

(I live in Germany right now and they sell packages of fresh soup vegetables in the supermarket. This includes a few carrots, some Leeks, a wedge of celery (is this only sold in Germany? Never seen it in America) and maybe some broccoli) instead of adding cinnamon, I used creole seasoning and the flavors worked together beautifully!"

Because I was serving a large crowd, I doubled all of the ingredients and baked it in a 12\" pie plate which fit quite nicely. I tend to roll out my pastry to be quite thin, so was still able to use the pastry sold for 9\" pies. There was not even a shred of this left at the end of the night. Highly recommended!"

The portion I had left that was usuable was quite salty so I am guessing if I had used it all it might have been too salty. The recipe says to spoon the meat into the pie crust, I don't think the recipe was meant to have all the water and spices in it."
