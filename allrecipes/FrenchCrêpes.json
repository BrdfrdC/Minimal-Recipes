She was a true french cook: threw everything in a bowl without measuring cups, just \"about a cup of this, a couple eggs, cup and a half or so of milk, maybe some water, shake of salt, a little sugar...\". My way of cooking for sure. This recipe came out quite close to what I remember her crepes being. I put in some vanilla to jazz it up, and used my biggest pan to twirl on. I would have liked to have gotten them a bit thinner, but next time I'll know. Very good and authentic crepes--thank you."

"reviewBody": "This is basically how I was taught by my mom to make crepes and she learned from my dads mom. They are from the island of Guernsey in the English Channel nut my dads side was French. The only thing different is my mom taught me the crepes had to be thinner than pictured, lacy like doilies. My grandma and mom always made alot of them. They were eaten with my grandmas recipe for French beef stew and doughboys (big round lumpy flour dumplings that were put in the stew. The plumped upon there and also helped thicken the stew.) Then with the remaining that weren‚Äôt used for dinner were used for dessert. My mom love butter and sprinkled sugar on hers I like raspberry preserves on mine. This gets made when ever I go to my kids homes to see my kids and grandkids. 1st request for me to make. Michelle (Barbe‚Äô) Fischer."

I used 1/4 cup for each crepe and quickly angle the frying pan to have the flower mix spreading and even out the whole pan. Photo was my French crepes breakfast, filled with fresh picked strawberries, homemade strawberries jam/syrup and PC chocolate syrup. YUMMY"

"reviewBody": "this is by far the easiest crepe recipe I've come across. I don't have a stand or hand mixer so I just throw everything in a blender, the batter came out perfect. when you pour in the batter, make sure is away from the heat, tilt the pan and try to make the batter distribute equally throughout the pan. It takes practice to be perfect. Also another key is your pan retains heat, and every stove is different. I found that for medium-high heat for my stove and pan combo was way too hot. I ended up started at medium heat, after maybe 4 crepes I had to turn the heat down to medium-low.\nAll around 5 stars recipe I'll be making it as a breakfast meal prep for the week. Happy cooking!"

To get it perfect I make a few changes to the process.\nFirst I mix the eggs alone, then add the milk. I make sure the milk is room temperature, it always makes it better! \nThen I add in the rest of the ingredients. \nOnce mixed, the batter gets better the longer it sits so if you have time try and leave it for at least 10/15mins.\nThe biggest problem with this recipe is that my family eat them all so quickly there's hardly any left for me!! \nThanks for a fantastic recipe!"

In light of having more time at home during the pandemic, I decided to give this recipe a try. As it turns out, crepes are super easy to make! I found that using a ladle to scoop up the batter worked best for me, even if it was more than the cited two tablespoons. I ate mine with Nutella and fresh fruit, and my husband and son enjoyed theirs with a mixture of eggs, sausage, and cheddar cheese. Will definitely be making these again!"

The first morning, we had crepes with spinach, mushroom and tomato filling with white cheddar sauce. The second morning, I made them smaller and slathered with them homemade plum butter, and the third morning, I had enough batter for only four small crepes, topped with the same spinach mixture as before. I followed the recipe exactly except I put everything in the blender as other reviewers had suggested. Thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe is excellent - and versatile. Great as-is for a sweet filling (I like a little more sugar - personal preference) (or to eat plain - SO good) To make it savory, I leave out the sugar, add parsley or other herbs then fill with ricotta cheese, prosciutto, bacon, ham, etc. VERY easy but as others mentioned, if you are having trouble it's most likely with the pan and the temp. I use a setting just below Medium on my gas range, a small pan which I mop with olive oil every 3-4 crepes and just keep rolling the pan until the batter sets - flip it when it loosens from the pan and cook the other side for just a few second - 'voila! Excellent! (and everyone will think you're an accomplished french chef!"

Eggs, milk, then flour and salt, then olive oil. They came out better than ever, and soooooo easy. \n\nBecause we don‚Äôt do dairy, I use unsweetened almond milk and olive oil in place of butter and milk. Works fine. I don‚Äôt add sugar anymore because I usually pair my crepes with a mix of sweet and savory. The sugar way is fine too. \n\nThis recipe has been the right mix of flour, egg and milk for me always. I am French and learned how to make crepes in France, but this is an easier recipe but still gives me the result I want. \nI like that you don‚Äôt have to wait on the batter either (I was taught to let it sit for an hour). I also store the batter and cook crepes up later with this recipe. \n\nI use a few drops on olive oil on my nonstick pan and swirl them around with a paper towel and that way have no issues with stickiness."

I did add a little vanilla as I was making a breakfast/dessertish crepe:) For the size of my crepe pan, two tablespoons was not quite sufficient. I used 1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) and felt that they came out just right and for those of you who felt they were too crispy, it may be that you just need to add slightly more batter to the pan. The crepes were flavorful and easy to work with when putting in the filling. This will be my go to recipe for crepes in the future."

The crepe is spongy and my daughter commented she could actually smell the egg in it. The batter stuck to the pan and was difficult to get to cook evenly. I think if one egg was omitted this would be a much better recipe."
