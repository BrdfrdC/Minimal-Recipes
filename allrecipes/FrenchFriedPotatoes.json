"reviewBody": "To add to the ocment about frying twice, one way to prep and be ready on the day is to follow the recipe up to the first frying, then fry for around 6 or 7 minutes at 350 (note the oil temperature will plunge, so keep the burner on maximum). Then take them out and blot dry as soon as you can. Freeze. When you want to make the fries heat oil to 375 degrees, then pour in the frozen fries (they'll bubble a lot, but you've already driven off most of the water, so it won't be too bad). 6 or 7 minutes later, perfect fires. And by prepping, the final stage takes such a short time."

I don’t have time for hours of soaking, drying, frying at home temp, reheating oil, frying again..... there has to be a better way. This is it! The sugar water concoction seems to do the trick. These came out absolutely perfect and crispy with only ONE trip through the fryer. Perfection!"

I will use this recipe again, but adjust cooking time."

"reviewBody": "Previously I had mediocre results with my french fries. Then I saw the curing in sugar instead of vinegar. Then I read the McDonald's recipe and wasn't crazy about the addition of corn syrup on top of the sugar. I read this recipe and wasn't surprised that users weren't getting stellar results from the absence of blanching. So, going along with Cindy Chaney's knowledge and my failures I used only enough hot water to completely dissolve the sugar then added the rest cold water and set in the fridge for the 15 minutes. Removed and patted dry and returned to the fridge while my oil heated to 375. I then blanched the potatoes for exactly 2 minutes. Removed and patted dry. During that time my fryer was able to recover it's 375 temp so that 6 more minutes made perfect, restaurant style french fries. And didn't taste the sugar at all! I gave this recipe 5 stars because with mine and Cindy's knowledge of french making, I've finally come up with a recipe that makes stiff fries without having to over cook them to get restaurant texture french fries."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is excellent. I'd like to add that you can substitute salt or soda for the sugar. What actually transpires when you soak the potatoes in the sugar/salt/soda water is that the water is more dense with the additive. Water tends to move from an area of less concentration to an area of greater concentration. In other words, the water is somewhat leeched out of the potatoes to try to equate the amount of water between the two. When fried, that will make the potatoes crispier because there is less water."

I went with the cold water 1/3 cup sugar instead of the warm and had the time to let them soak for 2 hours. I cooked them in two batches, the first was cooked twice around 2 1/2 min each time and the second was cooked 5 min straight up. The first batch came out extremely crisp, had that perfect light brown color and tasted fantastic, the 2nd batch came out a bit lighter but were just as good, I had no preferences between the two.. I WILL make these again and again and keep them as a staple in my household for years to come. Thank you for this recipe :)"

"reviewBody": "Delicious. I had to make fries for more than 2 people so I doubled everything. Water sugar and potatoes. I soaked the potatoes for about 2 hours and then drained them and dried them a bit with a towel. I went with the hint of blanching them for a few minutes and then pulled them out of the oil. Once all the batches were done I could quickly get them crispy and brown. This took about 3 to 5 minutes per batch for the amount I Deep fried. They were so good my husband said that if there had been a five gallon pail full he would have still ate everything there. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I agree With another poster that the warm water is used to dissolve the sugar. I did this with one cup of warm water and then added the rest of the water as cold. I also put a layer of ice cubes over the potatoes as they were soaking. Then when it was time to take them out they were nice and cold."

"reviewBody": "These fries rock!! I had planned on making them last night, but after peeling, cutting and soaking in the sugar bath-our dining plans changed. So.... they held in the sugar bath in the fridge till tonight. Patted them dry, fried them up, salted them and polished them all off! I even greatly increased the amounts of potatoes but my family of 5 did not even leave a spud rubble! I am a believer in the sugar bath now! Thanks for a great recipe! (Oh, and I cut them quite thick-they were better than the county fair fries!) Yum!"

I find using vegetable oil like this recipe calls for is the best. I use it too. It's light and not heavy like olive oils and others can be. I also use a Westmark Potato Slicer and set it to make the fries thin like Mc Donald's fries except I leave the potato peel on. Mc Donald's removes the peel. The real secret is the sugar water. Trust me you will not get fries that taste sweet! Not in the least bit! In my 40 years of making them I have yet to be able to put my finger on exactly what the sugar does but I think it helps keep the fries light and not oily, fry up crisp and taste absolutely perfect! This recipe is worth all 5 stars and more!"

(325 degrees) After they were blanched, we would let them cool, then refry them at 375 degrees til golden brown. The secret was in washing them, and drying them. The bottom of our sinks were covered with starch, and thats what we tried to get rid of. After three washes, there was little or no starch left."

"reviewBody": "This is my go to recipe for homemade french fries. I usually soak in sugar water for at least 1/2 an hour or overnight in refrigerator (water should be clear) and then drain and absorb as much of the water on a reusable drying mat and allow to dry as much as possible. I keep one just for these fries. Always do a long fry (about 6-10 minutes depending on how thick your potatoes are cut- we prefer large wedges) and then just before you're ready to serve, refry till golden brown, about 2 minutes. not sure if it matters whether you do long or short fry first, but the long fry first makes most sense if you're doing fish AND chips. I've done both with great results. Prefrying the potatoes ahead of time helps speed up dinner time. Perfect and delicious every time! I cook for 5 hungry kids so anything I can do ahead helps. \nTo save paper towel, line a large platter with folded newspaper under a of couple of pieces of paper towel.\nAlso, a large cast iron pot for frying is best. You can sustain the temperature of the oil better and fry larger and fewer batches. \n\nFor those wondering what to do with the leftover oil, let it cool, strain or pour into a covered container and store in the fridge for your next time you need to deep fry something. I find reused oil actually makes the food taste better and it browns the food better as well. I add fresh oil to top up because you will lose some each time you fry and you have to get rid of the brown bits which causes the oil to go rancid."

Make sure to use the large \"russet\" potatoes as suggested. They are the best for baked potatoes and fries. The fries are actually quite easy to make to. I just fried them in my mini deep fryer one batch at a time. The timing is very precise to about 5-6 minutes per batch. Make sure to have a salad or something else, because these are hard to quit eating."

I still soak my fries, but i use salt water , then rinse, and a finally use a salad spinner to help dry them. \n\nI then use my fryer at 320F and fry for 5 minutes, drain on paper towels, and cool until close to room temperature.
