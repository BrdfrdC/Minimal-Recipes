Would recommend baking for a little less time (maybe 7 mins.?) as they came out slightly crispy (good thing I like them that way). Had a bit of trouble with the buttercream (tasted a bit buttery), but added a bit of raspberry jam and it worked well. Overall, really liked the recipe and had great result for a first attempt; will be making again! :)"

I used this recipe, but watched YouTube videos to learn the pointers and how to fold the ingredients. After piping on to parchment paper let it sit for 40 minutes before baking. Making sure to bang the pan on the countertop to get the bubbles out before baking.\nOverall good recipe. The flavor is good. Not too sweet."

My macaroons cracked (all of them) and the 50 rotations of the spatula is not enough. You need to specify that the consistency should be ‚Äúglue‚Äù like as long as the air from the egg whites is not pushed out. Thanks."

These are delicious, I used lemon extract instead of vanilla for the filling to add a little punch of flavor. I also learned that I should let the batter rest for 20-30 minutes, the first batch I put in the oven cracked, but the second batch didn‚Äôt, so I‚Äôll be keeping that in mind for the next time I make these!! If you‚Äôre an amateur baker who is terrified to try Macarons, don‚Äôt be!! These rock!"

Very helpful!\n\nOne note: The filling in this recipe was a little too buttery for us, so we turned it into a normal buttercream by doubling the powdered sugar. We then put vanilla extract in 1/3, almond extract in 1/3, and cocoa powder in 1/3. \n\nThey don't look perfect, because it was our first attempt, but they taste heavenly!"
