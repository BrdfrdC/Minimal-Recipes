I used 2 cans beef consume instead of beef broth, used just a bit less than 1/2 cup butter, and sautéed the onions until caramelized. I also didn't have any swiss and was anxious to make it so I used a slice of provolone with some shredder mozzarella on top - worked great."

I used yellow onions rather than sweet, used 4 cans of beef broth rather than water and condensed soup, added a shake of Worcestershire sauce, and added about 1/2 tsp of salt. I used Gruyere cheese, which was a little thick and chewy, but still good. I loved it myself and was asked to make it every Wed night for dinner. :-)"

Taste and test throughout making it to add/subtract ingredients as YOU feel needed. \n- Use a mandeline to ensure the onions are cut very thin and consistent.\n- Let it sit. Let it sit and stand for at least a few hours, to really infuse the flavours. \n- Brown the onions! That's where all of the deep flavour comes from."

"reviewBody": "Nothing wrong with this classic recipe, but two things I do: I think a key ingredient to french onion soup is thyme. I slowly brown/carmelize the onions over an extended period of time. This yields better flavors. 10 minutes will not do it.\nA few other 'ideas'? I'm into spicy foods and will often throw a couple of bird's eye peppers or similar. On occasion, I'll add bacon for a bit of a Canadian twist. But if you do, do so after you've finished cooking the soup. Otherwise, it will tend to cook the bacon flavor right out and simply leave the soup just a bit saltier than it already it was.\nFinally, consider making an extra effort on the bread. Cut or break into appropriate sized pieces and throw into a bag with a bit of olive oil, thyme, pepper, etc; and shake it like a polaroid picture. Then bake in oven until dry and crunchy. Keep these on hand for the next few days to throw into your soup as required."

I can't wait to make it for a potluck because people will be blown away. So easy, so delicious. Best ever and I've had TONS of french onion soup."

I had made this recipe years ago (an ex-bf engulfed it), and decided to try it again due to my Parisian nostalgia. I tweaked the recipe a little: substituted one quart of beef broth for the water and broth called and used olive oil instead of butter. It came out even better than I remembered!"

"reviewBody": "Great café quality and taste! However, I do have a few tweaks... \n1. Use two 10.5 ounce cans of beef consommé instead of condensed broth. It's easier to find in the stores and will get rid of that water and wine taste others have complained about. Do be sure to add the water and wine as directed though, as with consommé, it is really needed. \n2. Cook the onions on medium heat for a good 40 minutes. \n3. Simmer the soup for at least 20 minutes, if not more. \n4. Toast eight slices of bread (so as to put two in each bowl) for 5 minutes, flip them, and toast the other side for another 5 minutes. \n5. Mozarella works better than Swiss, and only use half of what the recipe calls for. \n6. On an upper rack, broil the bowls for three minutes (or until it is browned) on a low temperature instead of baking.\nAll in all, this is a great recipe that was well worth the tears."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is fabulous! \nThe only problem I had was that it's very hard to find condensed broth, so I added 3-5 organic beef bullion cubes ( it depends on who I cook for) to the broth. I have read other reviews, and they say to skip adding the water. That's another option as well, but I prefer adding the bullion cubes instead. I also added one whole stick of butter (salted or unsalted ...that's up to you) and I sauteed the onions longer as in 30 minutes or so.  Also, if you don't have french breach, any kind of bread will do depending on what you or your audience will like.  All in all, this is a great recipe and very easy to make!  \nPS... I soak my onions in cold water so that they don't make me cry too much!  \n(Peel before soaking!) :}"

I made a few changes: 1/2 butter, 2 yellow onions which made about 4 cups when sliced, I browned them slowly as other reviews said (well worth the time!). Since I don't eat beef I used 4 tsp Better than Bouillon Vegetable paste dissolved in 4 cups of boiling water. Added some minced garlic before the flour and used 2 tbsp whole wheat flour. Didnt have red wine so I used white with a tbsp Worcestershire sc. Added croutons and baked...sooo good! Will make again"

"reviewBody": "I have made this over two dozen times and it is great, but I have a few tweaks. First, use 5 tbsp of butter rather than 4. Next, use 3 full cups of water. Next, use a full cup of red wine. Finally, use French bread rather than a baguette and cut your slices thick so that the cheese does not dip into the soup. I also find that 10 minutes for the cheese to melt is way too long. By that time the cheese has been bubbling for a few minutes already. 5-8 minutes is a better amount of time, depending on how bubbly you want your cheese. As a side note, French bread is much better than Italian bread because French bread is drier, which is good for this. I also slice a few thinner pieces of bread for dipping. Great recipe."

"reviewBody": "Very happy with recipe. As there are 6 different types of red wine; I used a Shiraz (or Shirah). It has the deepest flavor of the reds; not sweet at all. I used 4 vidalia onions and no flour. I pressure canned the soup after I tried it. It took over an hour for the onions to turn brown, so be warned. I didn't make the crouton or cheese, I'm allergic to milk. Followed the recipe to a T; except for the flour. Very impressed, thanks for posting!"

Much Much better this way. And never Red wine! The tannins kill all the sweetness we worked so hard to bring out. White wine, a bit of congnac but not red wine."

"reviewBody": "First thing is just ten minutes of cooking the onions is not near long enough, you need to cook the onions over a medium heat until the are golden brown (caramelized), this can take awhile, but it is what gives flavor to the onions. I added some minced garlic right before adding the flour. I also cooked my onions in a mixture of bacon grease and butter.\nI bought a generic beef broth since I had no fresh left in my freezer...what a mistake to buy a big store's generic broth, I actually tasted it before using it and it pretty much tasted like water. So i added a cube of beef bouillon and a good dash of Worcestershire sauce. I used only the broth, if I added water it would really be lacking flavor. \nAlso the bread at the end needs to be quickly broiled until golden brown on low under the broiler and not baked for another ten minutes, or it gets mushy. \nIf I make again I'll only use some fresh beef broth or beef consume. My onions were great all by themselves, I used fresh thyme from the garden to spice them. I had some yellow, some red and some sweet."

I also happened to have some sweet italian turkey sausage that I needed to use up. I cooked the links while the onions were cooking, crumbled them up and added them to the soup at the end. I let the sausage flavor soak into the soup on the stove for a few minutes. It was really good and made a more hearty meal. Also instead of putting the bowls in the oven at the end, I just put the bread with swiss cheese in the oven alone for a few minutes and then placed the bread slices on top of the soup before eating. But that was just because I wasn't positive if my bowls were oven proof or not."
