"reviewBody": "Need a really good beef stock recipe. Today at the store I started reading labels on all the liquid and other kinds of stock and broth, they all contain among other things, lots of sugar, if not the first ingredient it is in the top. I don't like my beef or chicken dishes sweet unless I want them to be. Could not find a single one without some form of sugar or sweetener. I found it incredible. How do diabetics manage to avoid sugar when it is in so many products? Thank you for the recipe."

"reviewBody": "I made the beef stock from leftover prime rib bone which I made from an Allrecipes dish as well (Christmas Prime Rib - very good). The stock turned out very rich and flavourful; so the soup was excellent. The key is the stock. I did not add parsnips as I don't have them on hand and they seemed weird for stock. I also used Asiago, cheddar and mozzarella cheese which is what I had on hand. Pretty good alternatives too! My family sopped up the soup with Sweet Dinner rolls I made this morning - also from Allrecipes - very good and easy with a bread machine."

"reviewBody": "In my quest for the perfect onion soup, I came across this recipe. I am sorry to say that it just did not work for us. It is far removed from the classic french onion soup that we all think of. It was time consuming, which I can handle if the rewards and effort pay off. I think that the parsnips were too strong in the stock. I was attracted to this because it sounded so healthy with all the veggies. The color was lacking even though I browned the beef first. I think that some amount of red wine is vital to rceipe or it is just not french onion soup.\nI will continue on my quest but do thank you for you spuring me on and for a good stock for vegetable soup."

I puréed them in my blender, and made a cream of veggie soup that we had the next day. It was awsome! Thanks for this wonderful (and wonderfully flavored) recipe. This is definately a keeper!"

Bubbles barely break the surface. Time consuming but worth it. In a pinch there are a couple of new \"bold stocks\" in a box that work very well."
