I did make a few changes, I used yellow onions, did not add sugar (who needs the extra carbs)?! Besides, the port makes it truly scrumptious. I did use 50oz of beef consommé, added a splash of liquid smoke, and let the extra liquid cook off w/the lid removed for about an hour. I’m sure my changes only slightly changed the results - it was delicious!!"
