Long ago I found what I considered my favorite pancake recipe and this is definitely up there with it. I did have to use gluten free flour due to an allergy. These are worth trying and we'll be making them again!"

I followed directions to get a sense of the recipe even though many reviewers said to up vanilla and spices. The pancakes were so light and fluffy with a great taste. Will now use this as my go to pancake recipe, but not expect a french toast experience."

Next time, I will add 1-2 teaspoons of vanilla, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg because we love more intense flavors. The pancakes were great; however, the only drawback is my family wants me to make French Toast now."

"reviewBody": "These French toast pancakes have a good texture and are moist. My kid (9 years old) said they were the best she's had in a long time. The spices you need more then just a pinch for the flavor to come through and about 2 tsp to a tblsp of vanilla. The sweetness was good with just the tablespoon of sugar they taste like pancakes and not cake. Which is great if you like to add syrup or whipped cream. I'll hold onto this recipe and make it again for my family. Maybe next time taste it using different spices like cardamom."

"reviewBody": "These pancakes were OK, but I felt they were lacking in flavor and could find no similarity at all to french toast. In looking at the reviews, it appears as if many tweaked the recipe, and that might account for the submitter’s comment that they would be darker in color. The color on mine was exactly the same as any other pancake I’ve ever made. Doubtful I’ll make again, but if I did, I definitely would add more than a “pinch” of nutmeg and cinnamon and a “dash” of vanilla, as they were simply lost. I followed this recipe to the letter and ended up with 7 pancakes, so keep that in mind when you see the number of servings listed. However, I will say that the texture was spot on."

I also used a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg. It was a bit to watery at the start and the added flour thickened it up nice. The flavor was great. Like others stated, they came out a little flat. But hit the spot nicely. Well done."

My kids enjoyed these but I found the aftertaste a bit odd, can\\t put my finger on what it is."

And, while I did up the amount of vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg overall these turned out really good. This is definitely a nice twist on two classic breakfast dishes. Great topped with butter and real maple syrup and served with some OJ and fresh fruit."

"reviewBody": "I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical as I read this recipe as to how it would taste like french toast with a \"dash' of cinnamon and vanilla. While it's a bit of a stretch, there were definitely bites reminiscent of french toast (though, I did add a health \"dash\" of both cinnamon and vanilla and skipped the nutmeg). They had a nice cinnamon-y taste. This made 2 large pancakes and 2 medium sized pancakes. For my second pancake, I added some chocolate chips as I'm a big cinnamon/chocolate fan. That was nice, too. THANKS for the recipe!"
