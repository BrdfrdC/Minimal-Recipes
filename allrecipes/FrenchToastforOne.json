"reviewBody": "- Took more than 2-3 minutes on each side. - It was more like scrambled eggs on a toast. - As soon as I put it on the frying pan the egg separated from the toast and I had a layer of white egg on the bottom of the toast. -After cooking it was not as moisturized as needed. It needed more quantities of all the ingredients. - I had to drench it in honey to cover the egg taste. - It doesn't make a mess which is good. - I topped it with some strawberry to make it taste better. There are definitely better recipes than this."

"reviewBody": "Just the the way I like making French toast, with no sugar added to the egg mixture. I didn't measure out 1 tsp salt, just used a dash. I don't think a tablespoon of oil is needed to cook it in, just a teaspoon. Other than small personal preferences, this is a perfect recipe for 2 thick slices of bread or 3 thinner slices."
