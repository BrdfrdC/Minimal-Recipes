I substituted a gluten free flour mix and lactose free milk as I currently have digestive issues I used sweet cherries so I added just a 1/4 cup of sugar to them.\nI also substituted brown sugar throughout as that's what I had on hand. The end result looked and \ntasted good, but the flour mix made the batter rather thick and somewhat hard to pour and reach the ends of the pan. I removed some of the melted butter so I could gently spread the batter a little. Next time I make this or something similar, I'll either try adding a little more milk or a different version of this flour mix brand."

"reviewBody": "The hardest part it pitting the cherries. I don’t have a pitter, so I used the bottle and chopstick method. I found that putting the bottom of cherry upward and pushing the seed out through the top of the cherry into the bottle didn’t take as much of cherry with it. The recipe sure is fast and easy. I gave half to my neighbor, who also loved it. I made it a second time and made a mistake. I checked on it at about 42 minutes and it looked like it was about to burn. I took it out and it was edible but not as pretty as the first time. Whoops! Realized I had used baking soda instead of baking power. Was a lot harder to clean the dish too. Made again This time I used 3/4 cup sugar in mix instead of 1 cup. And mixing with the cherries used 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup of sugar. Still good. Just not as sweet. Cooking in my oven at 350 degrees, it was done in 46 minutes. Definitely have your vanilla ice cream with it! This is a very easy fast recipe . Thank you for sharing."

To compensate for this I cut back on sugar like others suggested, but also made a lemon frosting to drizzle over the top when done - this added the tartness I was missing to complement the sweet, and cherry and lemon flavors pair well in general... To make the lemon frosting I simply added lemon juice to some powdered sugar and stirred it up."

Stayed up talking to my roommate while pitting the cherries, and together we waited eagerly in the results. It was delectable, but very sugary! Next time I may try to reduce the sugar content a tad. Absolutely will be a next time. Cheers"

I did increase the cherries to 4 cups; however, I think next time, I would maybe use 3 cups and cut some in half. I also added, per other reviewers, cinnamon &amp; vanilla extract to the batter and cut the sugar in both the batter and the cherry mixture. Cooked perfectly in 50 minutes; removed and sprinkled top w/ brown sugar and put under broiler for a couple minutes to caramelize. I used 13x9 baking dish; maybe, next time I will use smaller dish for it to be thicker. Was delicious served warm with vanilla ice cream. This would also be a great recipe for blueberries or peaches or apples."

I had to pour off about a quarter cup before I served it. Also, it took more than an hour to bake. Again, I think I must have done something wrong, though I did follow the directions. The cobbler tastes good, but doesn't look like the picture, and it's more cake than cobbler."

I also, doubled the cherry amount to 4 Cups instead of the recommended 2. I read all the reviews beforehand, and changed up my recipe assembly slightly. After melting the butter in the preheating oven, I added my 'coated' cherry mixture to the butter, with the cherries now being begun as the starting layer of the dish. Next, I drizzled the batter over the cherry/butter mixture. It baked a perfect 60 minutes in my oven. In the last 10 of the 60, I scattered brown sugar atop the mixture and baked. It was excellent! The finished dish was a perfect ratio of cherries to caramelized crust consistency. It was SO easy. I will definitely be making it again."

I had all of the ingredients on hand already and it worked perfectly. My only complaint was that it becomes very gooey and sticky on the bottom of the pan, but that also means that it's extra sticky and delicious! A little whipped cream or vanilla ice cream and you have a sweet treat!"

That having said, I did make some changes to this recipe. First, I doubled the amount of flour, cherries, milk, and baking soda. I kept the amount of sugar the same but it could have used a tablespoon or two more. Second I did stir the cherries just a bit after pouring onto the batter to make a more even consistency. I kept the baking time the same, and it turned out near perfect. I have no idea how the original recipe would turn out with all that butter and only I cup flour. I would not try it that way, I will continue to double the flour, milk and fruit"

When the skillet and oven were nice and hot she would put a stick of butter in to melt for about 5 minutes, then add the batter and then finally the fruit on top, never stirring. The batter bakes up all around the fruit. So glad I found this recipe, thank you for sharing!"

It came out great except there was way too much butter. This must have been due to the 9x9, but judging on how much butter there was I think there would have still been too much even with a 9x13. So yes, this is a great easy recipe, and of course it tastes good because its drenched in butter and sugar."

Hats off to the chef! That said, I have a question for everyone. I use frozen sour cherries I get from Michigan and of course, four cups of frozen cherries is way different from un-frozen and when thawed, there is a tremendous amount of liquid. I fear using all of the liquid from the defrosted cherries in the recipe worruying it will be runny, but some is necessary. Any ideas on how to adjust this matter so it works best?"

Next time, I will just double it all. I may also cut the bigger cherries in half. I added cinnamon and vanilla to the batter as suggested and used half brown sugar and half white sugar. Doubled, this made a thick, full cobbler in the 9x13 and is packed with cherries. After reading the edges get almost deep fried due the butter, I gently mixed just the edges after pouring the batter in. My edges were crisp but not tough or fried. Overall, it's delicious and I will be making again."

I halved the recipe and used coconut oil instead of butter, as I'm lactose intolerant and typically substitute coconut oil for butter in most recipes. Because I was trying to use up past-their-prime cherries, I had more than a cup - more like 1 1/3 cups. I used a glass pie pan. I've never used cherries before in a cobbler, and I was very pleased with the result."

My baking pan was slightly bigger than the recipe recommended, and the crust was a little thin. The next time I make it, I think I'll double the crust ingredients to make it thicker.
