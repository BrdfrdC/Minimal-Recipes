Still was very yellow and murky so I couldn't see the kiwis at all. Next time will use apricot jelly, my old standby. So basically I kinda used the filling recipe but nothing else. I did use all the photos for layout of the fruit!"

Only the baking of my crust took longer like 30 minutes before it turned to golden brown. I also use lemon juice because I didn't have orange juice available.

As recommended by another commenter, I made an extra 1/2 recipe of the cream cheese layer. I also substituted the baking soda and cream of tarter for baking powder as that's all I had on hand. It turned out lovely! Quick to make (just add in some time to let things cool before adding the next step), very simple, and everyone loved it. Will make many more times!"

"reviewBody": "No matter what the name - the basic recipe is very flexible - making it easy to swap out or switch out ingredients or parts like the crust. Despite a rather long list of ingredients you can make a respectable dessert quickly with substitutions. I've tried it as written, with a graham cracker crust from the store (quick but crust can get soggy), with different fruit choices, adding lemon juice and zest to the filling instead of vanilla, and with jam or jelly and water microwaved a few minutes for a glaze. Every time I make the dessert it's never quite the same as it depends on time available and the ingredients on hand. It is very good summer dessert when fresh fruit is abundant."

Found that I needed more cream cheese than it called for, so I made it 1 1/2 times the recipe which worked great. I used aluminium foil pizza pans, as I didn't have a round pan and I found this recipes to be more impressive in a round than a square pan. The crust was baked on a single pan but had to use three to give it more stability when putting on the fruit and the glaze. It's a definite make again."

"reviewBody": "First, if you're going to make any kind of fruit \"pizza,\" clear your schedule. Start to finish, including waiting for things to cool, this took 3.5 hours. We didn't like the crust at all. I was suspicious to see that it called for 2 C of butter + oil in proportion to only 2.25 C of flour. It was too \"short\" and had a rather bland flavor, NOT like a sugar cookie at all. Next time, I'll probably just make half of a sugar cookie recipe. Next came the cream cheese layer - it was good and had just the right depth on a 15\" pizza stone's worth of crust. Next came the fruit, which looked GORGEOUS but took forever to prepare. Then the BEST part of the recipe - the glaze, which was delectable! I used a very small silicone basting brush to glaze the fruit and it worked much better than a pastry brush. All in all, I'll make it again, but with the above alteration to the crust."
