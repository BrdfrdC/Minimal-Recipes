Don't serve right away, chill it a couple hours with the plastic wrap right on top to prevent browning. The pits have nothing to do with it other than the spot it's touching the guac. Just prevent the top from being exposed to air."

"reviewBody": "Ultimately Hubs and I loved this - but that wasn't without playing with the amounts of certain ingredients significantly. I used twice as many avocados, for instance, while at the same time cutting back on the onion and chilies (I used jalapeno). Six cilantro leaves seemed like kind of an odd measurement so I disregarded it and just used what looked right. Worcestershire sauce was a new and different addition for me. I've noticed it in other guacamole recipes so I thought what the heck, I'll give it a try. The flavor it gave the guacamole was interesting and just slightly different. All and all, if you add the ingredients \"to taste\" rather than following the recipe precisely, this is a pretty darned good guacamole recipe."

This guac is not what you'd get in most restaurants or pre-made from a grocery store. The \"other\" recipe is more like those - good, and most people would probably prefer it because it's quite mild. This one is different in appearance and much spicier than the \"other\". I prefer this one, but if I were going to prepare guac for a party, I think I'd do the same thing again and make both."

Often I'll increase the serranos and not use the hot sauce. I usually quadruple this recipe and serve it in a parchment lined molcajete I picked up in Texas years ago...nice presentation, especially over a bed of salty tortilla chips."
