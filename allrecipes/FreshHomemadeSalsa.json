I don't like cilantro (I did still include a little), and even though I warmed and rolled my limes and used a citrus juicer, they had very little juice; so I used half of a lemon for additional juice and tang. I blanched and peeled my garden Early Girl &amp; Lemon Boy tomatoes, because the skins are quite tough. And lastly, I used 2 teaspoons of salt, because I love it salty! Thank you for posting."
