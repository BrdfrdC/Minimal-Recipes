I used avocado oil in place of the butter to saute the vegetables. I'm not a fan of garlic powder so I used fresh. I also added the rice to the vegetables and allowed it to brown, more flavour. I used a splash of wine to deglaze the pan and allowed that to cook off before adding the water. This was served with pan seared salmon and roast cauliflower. Thanks!!"

The flavor was very good and had a wonderful mushroom flavor that infused the rice. I didn't have any chicken bouillon, so, I used part chicken broth and part water. I also used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. The only thing I would do differently is add something a little fresh at the end like some fresh parsley or a sprinkle of green onions.

However, I bumped up the flavor by using fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, using shitake mushrooms, chicken base rather than bouillon, and a good glug of white wine. I skipped the salt, which wasn’t necessary because of the bouillon or chicken base. This was excellent, actually. And elegant."

"reviewBody": "This was very good rice, but then I love mushrooms! I wish I would have seen the line at the end of the recipe that I could have added garlic to it because that would have been a nice touch. I followed the recipe except to use the red, yellow, and orange peppers rather than the green pepper called for. Thank you for a nice side dish!"
