Penzey's Pie Spice instead of separate spices listed as I find it is a good blend of cloves, cinnamon, star anise, ginger and vanilla. I also added the pie spice with the sugar as one comment mentioned so it blended. WIll definitely make this again!"

"reviewBody": "Scrap the nutmeg and substitute ginger in the same amount. Also, the pears make the dough VERY wet, so you may need to extend the cook time if you're even a smidge over the 3 cups of pears they recommend. Might not be a bad idea to soak up some of the pear juice with paper towels before mixing with the sugar actually. But the flavor and texture is fabulous. Walnuts worked nicely in place of pecans."

Also note that the batter is VERY thick, and you can't quite \"pour\" it as mentioned in the recipe. Don't worry- it still bakes wonderfully!"

Cut back sugar to 1.5 cups (raw sugar). Added spices and black rum to the pear mixture for about 30 mins. Had enough for 6 big muffins and a very small loaf. Only baked for 40 mins or so. Made confectioner sugar, milk, vanilla and black rum drizzle. Delicious but will add more spices next time. Great holiday treat!"

I chopped the pears up pretty tiny and probably used a bit more than the recipe said just because that’s what I had- the recipe was pretty forgiving tho and the bread turned out delicious and moist with an incredible ginger pear flavor. I also used one whole egg instead of two egg whites and that seemed to work just fine. Definitely something I’ll be making again! I might use 2/3 cup sugar instead of the full cup next time but I generally prefer things a little less sweet."

The changes I made are not ones that would affect the chemical composition of the batter or anything.\nI made it for my kids who don’t like nuts, so I left out the pecans, and subbed vanilla (1tsp) and almond (1/2 tsp) extracts for all the spices. I also didn’t have vegetable oil in the house so I used melted butter for the fat. The finished cake is so beautiful and delicious."

I used all the most common modifications suggested: I used whole eggs instead of whites and a teaspoon of ginger (which I prefer to nutmeg - but I did add a dash of nutmeg). I also soaked the pears 1 T of dark rum and a tsp of vanilla along with the sugar. I did not add nuts, however, since I was using it for mini bundt cakes. The recipe was exceptional in the bundt cakelet pan. In fact, I used three other recipes from the brand website and this was the only one that worked in all of the cakelet shapes. I was surprised because I thought the pears would throw off the shapes, but they looked great! Lastly, I did use a combination of Bosc pears and Asian, all peeled, and cut no larger than 1/2\" pieces. The Asian pears remained a teeny bit firm compared to the others, which gives the cakelets a fantastic texture."

This is a keeper!\nFor an extra attractive cake, I made a vanilla glaze. Received 3 unsolicited compliments for the tasty cake at a large family reunion.\nJuly 2019 update: Made recipe 6 times. One recipe can make (6) mini loaf pans or (2) regular loaf. Just adjust the bake time."

I made a rum glaze and drizzled it over the cake after it cooled slightly - OMGoodness! This has become my all-time favorite cake! I think it's a very forgiving recipe, and many changes can be made to fit your preferences. I had a bumper crop of pears this year, so I'll be in the process of freezing a whole bunch of pears so that I can make this cake all winter long!"

My husband is diabetic and the substitutions make the recipe slightlyl less carbs for him. He can have a little peice every now and then if he leaves off a bread or starch at his meal. He love it by the way. \nFamily visiting our farm today loved it also. I am freezing some of the rest of the cake and I am sure it will freeze well. It is very close to the same recipe I use with apples.\nI will make this cake again"

Found this recipe and the reviews convinced me to try it. So glad I did. After reading the other reviews, I substituted ginger for the cloves. I also left out the nuts because I don't like nuts in my cakes. The other thing I did was used half the oil and then used apple sauce for the other half. I do this with most of my baking to cut down on the calories. It came out perfect! It took exactly an hour and 10 minutes, and it was moist and flavorful. A huge hit!

I used Harry &amp; David Royal Riviera pears because i had them and needed to use them up. Before prepping I had read many of the reviews to get a sense of the ease of preparing and the balance of flavors. I had read I believe it was several reviews that referred\nto it as \"spice cake\". I have to say I didn't find it all overbearing in the combination of spices; in fact. I will increase the cinnamon and add nutmeg next time I make it. I will continue to make it as it is a delightfully moist cake."

I read a review where someone did this since they could never figure out what to do with the left over egg and so I did the same. I also sprayed the bundt pan and sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon (again following other reviewers directions). The results were great..I will do it again. I took a piece home and put in ziplock bag placed in fridge and had it with coffe 6 days later. It was still super delicious. My daughter said we should always have this cake/bread in the house."
