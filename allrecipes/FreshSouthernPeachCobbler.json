Instead of 1 tsp of lemon juice, I used the zest and juice of an entire lemon. I also sprinkled a pinch of nutmeg over the peaches, along with the Cinnamon, and then also added it to the topping. Make sure to add salt to the peaches as well as the topping. The previous comments mostly talked about it being dry, and not much taste. Hope these added tips help."

However, if you have anyone who has texture problems in your household, don't let the peaches go unpeeled if you use fresh peaches instead of canned or frozen---that was the only reason why one of the people here didn't like it."

"reviewBody": "Decreased sugar to 1/4 brown plus 1/4 Monk Fruit with no other sugar used. Thumbs up on that one. I used very ripe seasonal fresh peaches. I've made this recipe several times now. Once with walnuts thrown in, excellent. Once with a complex spice mixture: cardamom, ginger, nutmeg, coriander, cinnamon -- very good, once with caraway and poppy seeds in the peach mixture (they would be better in the crust). I really understand the caraway flavor now -- it added a bitterness that didn't turn me off but reminded me of an old trunk. Ha! I won't use it again. Also one time I used 2 tablespoons of Chia seeds along with the cornstarch which turned the juices into more of a preserve or thick sauce. I double the topping because it's not enough especially if I have really juicy peaches. I substitute 1/4 of flour with wheat bran for more fiber. Because I lower the sugar so much, add the wheat bran, this isn't a dessert as much as a huge fruit serving. I feel it's really healthy, especially paired with cheese or cold roasted chicken."

Also, in order to achieve a crispy crust over the entire area,I used more boiling water to thin out the mixture for an even spread. Although the bake time is increased darkening could happen,but is easily remedied by covering loosely with aluminum foul."

"reviewBody": "I've made this recipe twice now, though without the spices (personal preference), and it's come out amazing and delectable both times. I had been looking for a recipe that was decidedly southern and had a cookie-ish, pie-ish top; and this is it! The last time, I sprinkled the top with just brown sugar and, oh my, was it even better - a tad crispy with that deep caramel flavor. I've been getting great local peaches, which really makes it special, since it's such a simple recipe without the spices. I recommend trying it my way once, as it lets the fruit flavor truly shine."

She held out for the cobbler😊 I used this recipe, divided into four dishes for baking and sharing with family (I probably almost doubled the recipe - that’s a lot of fresh peaches!). It was wonderful 🤩 Long story short, Everone Loved it and it sure didn’t last long at our house! I am definitely using this recipe again, an again, and again…😊"

Thank you so much for this recipe this is going to be my go to for peach cobbler."

"reviewBody": "I was on the fence whether to make this recipe. Mainly because I've never made a cobbler with a drop batter as this one. But I figured fresh peaches deserved a new way...and it really did not disappoint. I think my only mistake was in the amount of peaches I used. Fresh Georgia peaches off the Peach Truck can be quite big compared to our store bought. This created quite a bit of juice and not quite as sweet as I expected but the top was excellent. I added a little crushed chili pepper to add some kick because my crew loves the combination of spicy and sweet. I also added fresh pecans. I took the suggestion of making a 1/2 batch more of batter which allowed me to cover the whole pan in batter. If I am to make this again with fresh peaches I will follow the recipe on thin sliced peaches. I left them larger and I don't think the sugars and spices absorbed as well as it would have had they been thinly sliced. Also because they were no thinly sliced some of the peaches still had a texture to them like half cooked peaches...not a bad thing, just not what I expected. The lack of 5 starts is really because of my own mistakes, not the batter itself. The batter...definitely a keeper."

The only way to not like this is if you wanted to some other texture. I appreciate the sweet, cakey texture bc I always eat cobbler a la mode so I don’t make my filling as sweet to balance. The dough is a great balance so I don’t feel the need to add anything else. It’s faster and doughier than my usual pie crust. My peaches and this dough may very well new best friends."
