Let me say however, this recipe makes 1 pie, not 2. \nAlso, for those that say that it didn't set up, when using cornstarch as a thickening agent what ever you are making must boil for a couple of minutes. Just adding boiling water or bringing it to a boil won't work. Rule of thumb with this recipe is boil until clear, remove from heat and stir in jello."

I combined the cornstarch, water, jello and sugar in a saucepan- brought to a boil over med heat, then once it reached a boil, I let it cook for 5 more min, whisking often. Make sure you let the glaze completely cool before pouring over the strawberries. I used a 9\" pie pan and about 4 baskets of fresh strawberries. I made a crust out of shortbread cookies and topped the pie with fresh real whipped cream!! DELCIOUS!"

She spread softened cream cheese over bottom of the cooled crust. I also cut the strawberries in quarters and then spread them out over the cream cheese. The gelatin mixture was only a thin layer, but gave just enough to complement the other ingredients. Topped with real whipped cream. It was a huge hit for hubby's 70th birthday and took him back to his younger years."

I always make two pies and serve with whipped cream. Fresh taste."

I pulled it from the heat and added jello as soon as it started showing signs of thickening because, foolish me, I thought adding jello would ensure it would be quite thick. I was worried it might become too thick and would be difficult to add to the strawberries. Now it's just a sugary soup mess in the bottom of the pie shell."

For 1 pie do all the same but 2 tablespoons of strawberry jello.\n\nCook the sugar, cornstarch &amp; water until it's clear. It's not going to be completely clear - rather not white anymore. It will bubble slightly &amp; then get it off the burner. It will be thickened fine. Then add your jello. All should be well unless you took your berries out of the fridge &amp; tried to use them cold. They will weep &amp; you'll end up with a mess."

The pie is good for if you want a fresh dessert that is not so many calories. This Jello mixture though did not fill 2 pie shells, not even close. I ended up finishing the pies and then having to quickly make more of the mixture to be able to fill the gaps in the pie shells/ cover all of the strawberries. The strawberries are plenty for 2 shells, just double the Jello mixture when you're making it."

I bought a shortbread crust and added a small jar of lemon curd on the bottom as other reviewers had recommended. The lemon added another dimension of flavor to go with the sweet of the strawberries and sauce. Used the creamiest whip cream in the can. WOW. What a great recipe. I will be trying the diabetic version someone added, for my mother. She is going to love this too. Thanks for sharing this recipe, Janice! :)"

"reviewBody": "This makes a great pie! This recipe is so simple and fresh! I only needed one pie so I halved the recipe. Even though I halved it, I used the whole 3 oz. package of gelatin along with a little more sugar since its winter and the berries right now aren't very sweet by themselves. Making the filling a little sweeter really made up for the dull winter berries and you couldn't tell that the berries weren't at their peak season. The filling amount wasn't enough to fill the entire pie shell up all the way. But it was still delicious. I may double the filling next time. Such a great, light, and easy pie! With a large dollop of whipped cream on top and you have an excellent dessert! Thanks for this great recipe! I will make again and again!"

Maybe if I'd allowed the pie to sit out and warm up just a bit, it wouldn't have been so firmly jelled. Next time, if I use this recipe again, think I'd add just a little more water, but that is such a hit and miss operation. Just don't think I'd use this recipe again. It was pretty, though!"

Next time, &amp; there will be a next time, I will put 1/4 tsp more cornstarch in the mixture to be a tad bit firmer, as I would like.\nI did use heavy cream to make whipped cream for the topping instead of the whipped cream in the can or cool whip. \nI give this recipe 5 stars because it's a refreshing dessert for these summer days."

I had to go looking for a recipe for my daughter in law this year. \nI combine the ingredients a little differently though. I mix the jello, cornstarch and sugar in the pan and add cold water. I stir it until the corn starch is desolved. I bring it to a boil and allow it to boil for 3 about minutes or until it's clear. After it's cooled I pour 1/2 of it into a bowl of berries. I pour that into my pie shell and then pour the remaining glaze over the entire thing.\nI've given this recipe away so many times and I'm still approached evrery year to make pies for people.\nI've always used the standard Crisco pie crust but my daughter in law wanted to try somethng different so she's using the \"French pastry pie crust\"\nTo be continued..."

Strawberry pie is one of my hubby's favorites, and this was my first time making it as a surprise to him...he raved!

I would use this as a one pie recipe, especially if using the 9 inch crusts.\n\nI replaced all of the sugar with Splenda for one batch, and while it does set up normally it has a strong aftertaste. I'd recommend mixing the sugar with Splenda in a 50/50 ratio."

I followed the recipe and because I could fit the berries together more closely, didn't find it necessary to double the gelatin sauce. It was perfect. Because I made mine the day before, I spread a little soft cream cheese over the bottom of the cooled, baked crusts before filling to keep them from getting soggy. Turned out perfectly. Will use this recipe again and again! Thanks!"
