"reviewBody": "I've received the following compliments using this recipe: \"This is amazing!\" \"This is the best pumpkin pie I've ever had.\" \"This is better than my mom's pumpkin pie.\" This pie is sooooo good. I made a couple of adjustments: 1. Pre-bake the crust. I recommend the Marie Callender's pie crust baked for 12-15 minutes at 400 degrees F. 2. Mix in a blender using the \"milkshake\" setting before adding the pumpkin, then use with \"puree\" setting when you add the pumpkin. 3. Instead of a cup of sugar, use a 1/2 cup of demerara sugar and a 1/2 cup of maple syrup. 4. Add a 1/2 tsp of ground or fresh ginger. 5. For a more \"traditional\" color, add 2 drops red and 3 drops yellow food dye. 6. Line the crust with foil to prevent the crust from burning. Have a happy Thanksgiving, y'all!"

"reviewBody": "My sugar pumpkin ended up giving me 2 1/3 C puree, which made for the most filling I could have possibly fit in the pie crust without overflowing. I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the sugar to 3/4 C for one pie BUT it came out less sweet than I would have liked (maybe differences in sugar pumpkins) and next time I would follow the recipe exactly and use the full amount of sugar. \n\nI'm attaching a pic - I tried to put foil on to keep the edges of the pie crust from getting too brown, but the foil touched the pie and messed up the top. I smoothed it over the best I could. I think next time I will egg wash the cutout in the center of the pie so it gets more color.\n\nI took it out at 45m (mostly because I was distraught at how I had messed up the top of the pie and wanted to try to fix it) but the inside was a little gooey and it could have gone for 10m longer."

My 5 year old wanted seconds! It took about 20 minutes longer to cook the pie than stated but besides that I followed everything exactly. Next time I may use a little less pumpkin in the recipe (my pumpkins yielded almost 6 cups of puree, so I had a little of the mixture left over which I froze). Also, I did cover the crust for the first 40 minutes. I can't wait for everyone else to try my second pie on thanksgiving."

Only difference was my pumpkin took far longer to become tender than stated when roasting. I also put the pumpkin in the food processor and pulsed it until smooth after cooking and prior to adding other ingredients. Then simply added the remaining ingredients and pulsed it a few times to mix. Easy peezy. Into the thawed shell. It did get a tiny bit browner than I would have liked, when custard was not completely set."

"reviewBody": "Absolutely Amazing!!! I followed the recipe to the letter. I have been making pumpkin pie for 20+ years and have always been proud with how much everyone loves \"my\" pies. However, I was looking for a new recipe to try (one that didn't use canned pumpkin OR sweetened condensed milk) with a new flavor and this one was it. I believe it is better than my previous recipe.\nWhen I served this pie one of my guests told me it was the best pumpkin pie she had ever had. I have to agree with her. I will make this a few time more to make sure I've got it down to a \"T\" and then I will be submitting it into a local pie contest.\nMy sugar pumpkin yielded 2 1/4 c. pulp. I did have more filling than my pie dish would hold so I cooked the rest of the filling in a ramekin - delish."

"reviewBody": "All at Thanksgiving agreed, this is the BEST pumpkin pie we've ever tasted! I made half the recipe, and made it gluten-free by using a GF crust and omitting the flour. I used half the amount of sugar (so 1/2 c. for one pie) and substituted dark muscovado for the demerara, which gave it a richer flavor. (You could use a high-quality dark brown sugar.) I baked it in a 9\" tart pan at 425 degrees for 20 minutes, then lowered the oven temp to 375 and baked another 25 minutes. Planning to make another using light sour cream. I agree with the others--will never use canned pumpkin again!"

It was still sweet, probably because the squash was sweet itself. So please try with less sugar than the recipe suggests, you would save lot of carbs."

I loved the use of heavy cream and sour cream rather than the typical evaporated milk component; the texture of this pie was sublimely silky and rich. I halved this recipe for one pie and reduced the sugar by half again and it was plenty sweet enough for us. This WILL be my go-to pumpkin pie recipe forevermore. I used pumpkin purée that I roasted, puréed and froze previously so this recipe didn't really take much time to make at all."
