I will most certainly be making this one over and over again. I must confess that I had to make a second batch of this because I couldn't stop eating the first one. It is Soooo darned Good!!!"

I left out the peppers, because I do not like spice and can't handle it that well, but the lime and salt still brought a nice flavor to the salsa. I also used the recommendation from another review to use a minced clove of garlic, which is a nice touch. I realized that there wasn't much though, but soon realized I used Roma tomatoes instead of the normal ones. Despite the ratio being a bit off, it still tasted fantastic."

We already ate a jar\" I never get compliments. I made it with one chili, as the baby is breastfeeding. Also put in a little fresh garlic, as suggested by many. I made it again for the neighbors with red onion and it was really good. You can put this on chicken, fish or an omelette with avocado if you are vegetarian, and I think you can probably add mango, pineapple, cucumbers or whatever? I also chopped the tomatoes over a strainer and bowl, to control the juiciness, as they were juicy . My favorite summer recipe now."

Also did about 2 tablespoons of lime juice and added a garlic clove. Pulsed in food processor til it resembled chunky salsa. 3 large tomatoes and half an onion and fistful of cilantro made 32 ozs."

I also bumped up the salt, just a wee bit because it needed a little something extra. I only had roma tomatoes, and found that I basically had to double the amount of tomatoes because it looked like cilantro salsa! I did not even wait to chill it, started eating it right away. Have it in the fridge right now, bet it tastes even better after it is chilled. Enjoy!"

"reviewBody": "The recipe is simple and has potential. Healthy, quick and should've been tasty. However, there is an excessive amount of salt. It really only needs half the amount listed or less. The peppers are intense too. I put 3 in instead of 5 and its still got an powerful kick. Obviously the peppers are dependent on your personal preference, but that is not noted in the recipe. I think if you called this Intense Salsa it would be a much better name."

"reviewBody": "I'm being generous with my two star rating for this recipe if prepared as written. It's very good with significant tweaking, but by the time you get done doing so it isn't even the same recipe. First off, I cut waaaay back on the serranos - obviously. And I used jalapenos rather than serranos. I wanted to be able to taste this, and you wouldn't be able to if your mouth was numb. Secondly, in my view 1/2 c. each of both onion and cilantro and onion was far too much. It tasted like, well, cilantro and onion. I needed to add more tomato (which I seeded and chopped) to get the balance I thought was right. This recipe, then, is a good reference tool if you're wondering what the ingredients in fresh salsa are - but not for measurements. Make this recipe as written at your own risk. Make a couple of reasonable changes and you've got a fine salsa."

I also put the chopped tomatoes in a strainer to let a little of the water drain off (about a t.). 3 serrano peppers with seeds seems to be the optimal number. You can somewhat get a sense once they're chopped up how hot they will be by how hot they smell."

I love spicy salsa, and this was definitely spicy enough with just one chile. I served the salsa as a topping for fish and white rice, and it was delicious!

Just goes to show that peppers from other areas can be hotter or milder. Also the smaller the pepper the hotter it will be. If unsure cut the pepper in half cross ways and touch lightly to your lip you will then know the heat level of the pepper in question."

I usually make it with 2. Once I used 3 and we could barely eat it, and we like hot. Also, you MUST remove the seeds from the peppers, and I strongly suggest wearing disposable gloves when chopping the peppers. Serrano chiles are required. Jalapenos do not give the same flavour or heat.\n\nDoes not keep long. Best if consumed the day it is made."

I added a tablespoon of olive oil and a teaspoon of salt and one of sugar and cut back a little on the cilantro (personal taste) and used ten roma tomatoes. These additions mellows it out a bit and the oil enhances the flavors. It still has a great bite.\n-\nWhat a great stand-alone or base recipe for customizing. Lots of liquid. Great to chase down your morning eggs with. \n-\nNext batch I'll seed the tomatoes and use jalapenos for a milder version. Thanks again."
