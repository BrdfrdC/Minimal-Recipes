I have a freezer full of roasted tomatoes that I have been trying to use up and this recipe was perfect. I used a food mill to remove the seeds and skins from the tomatoes for a smooth texture and used Better Than Bouillon instead of broth because my heirloom tomatoes were so juicy they didn’t need more liquid. I added the garlic plus fresh chopped basil at the end for a spicier flavor. The herbs and tomato flavor was amazing. My husband used it like tomato sauce for his chicken Parmesan and even had seconds! It’s a keeper."

"reviewBody": "I have used this recipe, and others that are similar. There are a couple of easy ways to make it better. Tomato seeds are bitter, so take a minute to scoop them from the cut fruit. I almost always take time to roast my tomatoes first, and will often make it with a roasted red pepper. I just burn the pepper on my gas stove until it is black, toss the pepper in a plastic bag when it is hot and let it cool. Wash off the black and you have a fresh roasted pepper. If you want a bit of heat, I also roast and freeze jalapeños and grate a little into the soup. I know there are purists and that is terrific for you. Others will make changes to fit their own tastes. This is a great base recipe that can be personalized easily. For example, I can't use salt, so I use garlic and other herbs in its place. I will sometimes use roasted sunflower seeds or pumpkin seeds it in to add body and make it thicker. I could eat this every day, and think I will have it for lunch today. Thanks for the recipe."

I froze leftovers in an oversized muffin tin for later. The only change I will make upon preparing this the next time is the salt. I will hold off adding until I've had a chance to taste; the 1 tsp made the soup too salty."

Additionally, it is a great base if you want add a can of Rotel, or basil, or whatever else suits your fancy. Everyone had a bumper crop of tomatoes this year and I've made 7 + batches of the original recipe of this soup in the last 30 days. The last three batches I froze. My one recommendation is to make the soup a few hours ahead if you can; it is absolutely delicious when the flavors have settled in.... Thank you for a great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This is the fourth time I am typing my review. It keeps disappearing before I finish. If it doesn't work this time, I give up! I made this recipe several times, each time making larger amounts. Yesterday, I made 12 quarts. My intent was to pressure can this soup for future use. When I did some research to find out if I would have to add acid to each jar, and if this would change the taste, I learned some interesting facts. Because I used flour for the slurry to thicken the soup, flour is an ingredient that cannot be safely canned, even in a pressure canner. Also, I would have needed acid to keep the level high enough for the soup to be shelf stable, but you don't want the acid level to affect the soup. So after reading this, I guess I have no choice than to freeze most of my soup. I prefer canning because of the convenience. I don't like having to remember to take it out of the freezer for when I think I want to eat it. So in the future, I guess I will follow the recipe omitting the slurry, salt, and sugar. Then just add the acid and salt to each jar before processing it. If anyone out there has processed this recipe like I mentioned in the above paragraph, please let me know if it works, and is shelf stable for a good amount of time. Thank you for reading and perhaps commenting. Again, this recipe is DELICIOUS!! Marsha"

Only modifications I did was to put the cloves, 1 garlic clove (cut in half) and 4 fresh basil leaves in a sachet, so it was easy to remove after the tomatoes and 2 slices of onions had simmered for the 20 minutes. I also removed most of the onions before using the immersion blender. I used a mix of Amana, Mennonite orange, Black Crim and Rainbow (red) tomatoes all fresh from the garden! Sooooo yummy, definitely saving this recipe!!"

Watch the video - very helpful. I have an immersion blender and then poured this mix through a colander over a heat resistant bowl pressing with the back of a wooden spoon until it all dripped through. Perfect and will make again as this uses up my surplus ripe tomatoes. Thank you for this recipe."

Came up with 4 cups of tomatoes and ran them and the onion through a sieve. Should I have measured the tomatoes AFTER sieving them. Followed the recipe exactly. My soup is bland and watery. The leftover soup in the refrigerator has separated into a half inch of ? above the tomato soup. Advice? OK, I just finally watched the video. The printed recipe says 1 slice onion. Obviously it should say 1 SLICED onion, not 1 slice. First mistake. I hope I can figure out something to make my leftover soup taste better....."

For our taste, it only needed half the salt and sugar the recipe called for. I used salted butter (all I had) to make the roux, which could account for it. I also added a little black pepper at the end because that's how my kids like it! I can honestly say that I have no intention of EVER buying canned tomato soup again!!! P.S. The cloves set it off beautifully!!"
