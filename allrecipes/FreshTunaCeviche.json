"reviewBody": "I've made this dish several times and wanted to give the ones that tried it and didn't like it a few pointers. Use Thai chili pepper or a hot Asian/South Pacific pepper instead of jalapeno. You can find them in Asian markets. Also, I would never marinate the tuna over the 2-3 hour time frame before eating. You don't want the tune to lose its texture completely. This is a very popular dish in South Pacific island countries like Micronesia. Enjoy!"
