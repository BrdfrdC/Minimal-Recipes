I followed the recipe exactly as written including the crust. This recipe is very good and the only reason I didn’t give it 5 Stars is bc I had a decent amount of dough left over and no filling. I plan on making these again w my personal tweaks &amp; I would for sure share this recipe w others. Thank you for sharing!"

Made dough exactly as printed. Filling not so much. We wanted the chunks. There just wasn't enough per ratio to the dough. So my recommendation is to double the filling and fry away. Also we did a mixture of powder sugar and cinnamon sprinkled on top.... between 3 people they are all gone. Defiantly will make again."

That was great because you could taste the apples more and the texture was better.\n\nThis is definitely a good recipe and is very easy to make! \nTry it! :)"

I drizzled a vanilla glaze over and should have dipped them like the Hostess ones, as it would have been better with glaze all over instead of just patches. The made plenty of filling but I have to double the batch because they don't last long. I have also used various canned fruit pie filling with fabulous results. These reheat well in the microwave and are just as good the next day."

I usually avoid frying because of the mess and smell but this recipe's one cup is certainly do-able, and since I cooked it in a big pot I had no splatters to clean up. Definitely not for everyday, but a fun and tasty splurge."

The salty taste with the puncy cinnamon of the apples is wonderful. We also use chunky applesauce &amp; sometimes the home-made apple brandy butter we have on hand as the filling with a few choped pecans for an extra special surprise!"

The ratio of apples to crust was perfection, so there isn't much of a need to change this recipe at all. STILL...because I'm always tweaking things, I did add a tbsp butter, 2 tbsp flour and more spice to the apples (1/2 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp nutmeg) while they were cooking. The results were tender, fragrant, tiny bites of bliss! A must try!"

So really, I suppose I'm just reviewing the crust...which was average, worked fine but nothing exceptional. Next time I'll do a donut glaze, powdered sugar didn't really seem like the best fit for a topping, but definitely needs sweetness on the crust..."

I had my 7 year old son do the pastry and it was a breeze for him, so easy to work with. I did add a bit of sugar to the pastry mix to sweeten it up a bit but other than that, we followed it exactly as written and it worked perfectly. I refrigerated the pies but a bit before frying, so we would have the whole lot rolled and filled before heating up the oil. Always a good suggestion to keep short pastry cold before using. Thanks!!"

"reviewBody": "I gave it 4 starts because the filling was great! I read lots of reviews on this one &amp; did make some modifications. I used brown sugar (1/2 c) rather than white, used cornstarch w/ lemon juice to thicken (1 TBS each - could have used a little more) and went ahead &amp; used the Grands biscuits as so many others suggested. I would not recommend using Grands buttery flaky biscuits though. I thought their flavor really distracted from the flavor of the filling &amp; did not complement it at all. And even thought I rolled them out as thin as I could, a few seconds later they would draw back up, thicker than I wanted. I also baked them rather than frying - the edges did not stay together! When I flipped them half way thru in the over I tried pressing them together again on the opposite side, but for the most part that did not help. I can't imagine what would have happened had I tried to fry them. Next time I will try a different variety of biscuits or will try to make the dough from scratch using butter instead of shorting."

Remember to turn down the heat after a while, so your last couple pies don't end up cooked on the outside but raw on the inside! I ended up with 12 pies."
