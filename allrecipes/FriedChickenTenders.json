Took the advice of others and I seasoned the chicken itself using Lawry’s Seasoning Salt, Garlic Powder, Black Pepper and Red Pepper Flakes. I smothered chicken breasts in mayo, then refrigerated and allowed it to marinate for a few hours. I then floured, dipped in eggs (used heavy whipping cream instead of water), then the bread crumbs and pan fried in the stove. VERY juicy and tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. Would definitely make this again. I loved it!!!"

I really don't like to cook but I'm in need of a variety of dinner ideas so I wanted to try this recipe based on reviews. Excellent! Next time I think I'd add a bit more salt cuz I like my tenders with a bit of saltiness. I also pounded my chicken to try and make it all equal size so I wouldn't burn it like I've done so often."

To make about 10 strips you only need a cup of the Italian bread crumbs. It was delicious! I used a frying pan and added enough oil to cover each chicken strip on about med-high heat. It fried quickly and it was delicious. The breading did fall off a bit when we ate it though."

"reviewBody": "I have always loved fried chicken tenders and this is the perfect recipe!!! - some quick help tips are, you dont have to use tenders, you can use chicken breasts, boneless or debone at home (deboning your own saves $$ and thats all tenders are, the \"filet\" cut of the breast thats been deboned and they charge an arm and a leg for) then cut into strips. put flour in a zip lock shake a few pieces at a time, lay them out and when done then dip in egg and -- italian bread crumbs are great, but if you're out: try crushed corn flakes, ritz crakers, saltines and my favorite, croutons and put those in a zip lock as well shaking just a piece or two at a time to cover. lastly, for those of us who dont trust deep fryers, you can use a skillet - but to make a bit less greasy and this will work for your deep fryers too- put tray of breaded tenders in the refrigerator for 1/2 an hour or so, get them a bit cold. I also use a mesh splatter cover on my skillet - by the way.... this way makes great regular ol' Fried chicken too!"

"reviewBody": "I suppose if you wanted to completely obliterate the taste of the chicken you could add more spices but, as is, the recipe is delicious. Prep is really quite simple. I cut up 2 large B/S breasts to add to the package of tenders to make up the 24 pieces and after putting the flour into a brown paper bag, added the chicken tenders, closed the bag and shook it until all pieces were lightly coated. Proceeded from there to egg wash and then bread crumbs. Frying a few pieces at a time ensures the oil will remain at temp and all pieces will come out crispy. I made the sauce early in the day while chicken was thawing. I can see using that same sauce with chicken wings. We loved it and I'm certain this will be an encore presentation! Thank you for a great recipe!!"
