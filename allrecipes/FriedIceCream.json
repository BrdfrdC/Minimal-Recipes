I did two coats of egg white and cereal, freezing in between, and then I froze the finished balls overnight before frying. This way, they did not fall apart at all while frying. Do it this way, and you will have amazing results. My family absolutely loved it!"

"reviewBody": "I would suggest not using bryers ice cream because I found for some reason that their brand of ice cream melts faster which is great for regular eating. It was really simple to make too. Really make sure you make the egg whites really foamy. The only thing I didn't really like about this recipe was the cornflakes because you freeze them and then fry them and it creates a stale/soggy texture. Maybe use vanilla wafers like other reviews say. You could always just take vanilla ice cream and coat it in the cereal and eat it like that but it is more traditional to fry them."

I then rolled them once more in egg, then the lightly crushed cornflakes and fried them. Finally, I topped them with caramel. No disasters, happy family. Kids have asked this one to be put in “the rotation.”"

Watch carefully as it cooks or it will melt before your eyes! 15 seconds is too long!\n\nWonderful topped with honey!\n\nTried coating some with Cinnamon Toast Crunch rather than the corn flakes &amp; cinnamon. It was fantastic!\n\nWill certainly make again. Tastes just like Carlos O'Kelley's fried ice cream which is my favorite!"

"reviewBody": "I enjoy fried ice cream very much. It is one of my favorite desserts. Although this recipe is very similar to what you would get at a Mexican restaurant, I've found a way to make this dessert without frying it and with much more flavor. In a medium heat skillet, I combine 1/4 cup butter, 1/3 cup flaked sweetened coconut, 1/3 cup chopped pecans, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon and 1/2 cup flour. I stir everything until crumbly and golden brown. Then, I let it all cool down. I make the ice cream balls and roll them in the crumbly mixture and put them in the freezer covered until ready to serve. Then, I drizzle them with honey. I think this way is easier and has a lot more flavor."

And I didn't test the temp. Now my house smells like a deep fryer! I fried flour tortillas in oil and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. Added a spot of whipped cream as a sort of nest for the ice cream ball. I had frozen the ice cream balls for 3 hours as directed. I coated them with egg and them dipped them in the crumb mix (I used crushed corn chex). I did deep fry the balls but my oil was too hot and it just made it a burning, stinking mess! Once I turned down the heat, it was better, but still messy. So they crumb mix was only partially fried as I would dip quickly in and out and not get the whole ball fried. But they tasted delicious and my whole family loved them!"

"reviewBody": "This is restaurant quality. A couple changes here. I used Rice Crispies cereal instead of corn flakes and used chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla. These are just what I had on hand and they worked perfectly. I let this chill overnight and it was perfectly whole. I went for the max amount of seconds, 15, and its way too much. I found that it should be 10, if that, so that is the only difference I'm making next time. Also, I did no measurements. Just poured plenty of cereal in a ziploc bag, sealed out the air and crushed with my hands til it was fine and sprinkled the cinnamon after frying. Like anything being fried, I find that double or triple coating helps maintain consistency. Last thing...a reviewer advised to chill after frying. You should opt for this if you want a more firm ice cream but if you want it warm and slightly melted, eat immediately. It's good either way. Feel free to experiment as well! This was lots of fun and very yummy :D. Update 10/20/09: 2 coats and 10 seconds cooks these babies to perfection and doesn't melt your ice cream. Also make sure your egg is beaten well otherwise its a gloppy mess. I will definitely be making these again and again, ty!"

That way, when you add the balls, the cold plate keeps them from softening for a couple of minutes. If you follow the directions &amp; heat the oil up as specified, only fry one ball at a time (the coating came off when I tried to do two but I was using a small saucepan) &amp; only fry for a few seconds ...they'll come out perfectly. Like JENNIFER72_00 , I made tortilla bowls but I sprinkled them w/ cinnamon sugar before baking. I drizzled them w/ white chocolate syrup, caramel syrup &amp; toasted coconut after placing in the \"bowls\" &amp; then garnished w/ whipped cream &amp; a cherry. Lovely presentation &amp; fantastic taste...was the perfect finish to a Mexican meal. Thanks for the recipe!"
