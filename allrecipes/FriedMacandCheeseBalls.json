I used provolone, cheddar, and a Mexican cheese blend instead of the cheeses called for. Didn’t refrigerate or freeze for the called for times either and they still came out well. As long as they are cooled until moldable and frozen until relatively solid you should be good to go before frying."

I added A little gouda, garlic powder and salt and pepper to my cheese and mac mix and added garlic powder onion and onion powder to my crumb mix for extra flavor. I only refrigerated for an hour and freeze time definitely needs to be shortened! I froze mine for 45min and still they were to solid for the fryer. My oil was a tiny bit high, so i left them until browned then threw them in the oven at 350 for a good 5-10 minutes to ensure they were hot in the center. They came out perfectly and so incredibly delicious. Out of all the ones ive tried including restaurants you have to try these"

"reviewBody": "I've never had an issue with these being still frozen or even cold in the middle. A cookie scoop is smaller than an ice cream scoop, fyi. Mine come out about 1 1/4\" in diameter after breading. What I do is refrigerate the mac and cheese, at least a couple hours. When I scoop them, I bread them immediately, then freeze them. That way I can keep them in a baggie in the freezer and cook as many or few as I want with no prep. I deep fat fry in 350 degree oil for about 5 minutes, until the outsides look dark but not burnt. I've tried them with flour instead of breadcrumbs, and with no coating at all, and this recipe is the best way in my opinion."

I changed up a few of the seasonings and added a bit more salt and sugar for tasting. I also added a hint of nutmeg. If you choose to add nutmeg, only use a small amount because it can become overpowering. other than that, my balls turned out great!\n\nI did not have any bread crumbs so I substituted using stove top stuffing in which I blended with a little bit of flour."

The cheese sauce with that is a lot thicker.. I then added a package of cream cheese and two cups of cheddar jack cheese.. This made it really thick and easier to ball up! I used smoked paprika and doubled the spices in the bread crumb mix... I kept the balls of Mac and cheese in the freezer for four hours before placing them in the egg wash and frying them... After frying I baked them in the oven at 350 degrees for ten to fifteen minutes to get that hot gooey center! My boyfriend and roommates ate them up like crazy.. Including my roomie who is a professional chef! When I presented them I dusted them with Parmesan cheese on top to add to the flavor and they looked so pretty!"

If I were to rate it based on some mods, I would give it a 4 or 5.\nI did not have any issues with the balls being cold in the middle. Im guessing that the people that had these issues made their balls were too big, left in the freezer way too long, or not fried in 350 oil.\nAs is, the balls came out ok. I added way more cheese than called for and all the spices, but little to no real flavor. They are probably good enough for kids. For a more grown up version that has more flavor, try the following.\nBacon adds a lot of flavor and needed salt. Onion powder or the real thing does wonders for cheese. You will also get some amazing flavor by adding Rotel. I would also recommend doubling and even tripling the recommended spices."

The original intent is to freeze the outer portion/crust/mantle to enable and then coat and fry with ease. Just a thought. Another option, fry them once, return them to a parchment paper lined cookie sheet, then warm until serving!"

Spread the mac 'n cheese mix about 1/2\" thick across the entire sheet. Freeze for 1 hour. Remove, cut into squares or triangles with a pizza cutter, then return to freezer to finish setting up. Not balls, but a very even cooking surface nonetheless"

I didn't bother making pimento cheese, just used 2 cups cheddar and added some mayo to the mix (1/4 cup maybe?). I think I'm going to try using plain bread crumbs next time, the Italian seasoned ones are a bit too \"much\" for my liking. Made about 24 like recipe says but I only dredged and fried 8 and left the rest in the freezer for later."

"reviewBody": "I've made this recipe a few times and everything turned out fine. However, last night I was having a hard time forming the macaroni &amp; chs into round balls. I used crushed Ritz crackers, garlic powder, pinch of salt, paprika, chili powder. I added some of this mix into the macaroni &amp; chs. It was a HUGE help. The mac &amp; chs stuck together. I put them in the freezer. I'll defrost the mac &amp; chs balls for 45 minutes today and then fry for 5 minutes. I let them cool down for 10 minutes and serve. Everyone loves these. Thank you so much."

"reviewBody": "So far, I'd give it 4 stars - the biggest downside is the lengthy time of prep. My 9-yr.old daughter was jonesing for fried mac and cheese after having a restaurant version this summer. This was a fun way to get her in the kitchen; measuring, stirring, counting, and telling time. (We are just now to the \"freezing\" stage.) I can't yet comment on the taste , but I do think it would be helpful to know what size scoop/disher everyone is using. After reading the \"frozen in the middle\" complaints, I choose my smallest disher (#60)... the balls are pretty small. Maybe the ones that didn't cook through are just a tad too big? Just a guess... We'll see how these turn out!!"

I froze the cheese balls for *just* 2 hours and fried them for 5 minutes per batch (at 3 minutes the middle was slightly frozen, 5 minutes was perfect). The recipe is time consuming, but really easy - and a big hit with the boys! Thanks!!"

"reviewBody": "We really enjoyed these! I fried them for 4 minutes and they were cooked through. The only problem I had was that the egg froze quickly before the crumbs could stick after the initial dip. I had to dip and roll twice, but that worked out great. I froze the entire batch (uncoated), then used half the egg and crumbs to coat half the batch. I'll make the rest in a day or two (or an hour or two). Since I have leftover pimento cheese spread, I may make another batch and keep them frozen. From freezer to fryer is pretty quick. Thanks for submitting this recipe, Erin! It will be enjoyed again and again!"

Not good eats and it's almost time to eat:( Yes, I did Exactly the way the recipe calls to do it! I made, I froze,I fried and am Mad!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Posted 6-16-09 @ 4:30pm. UPDATE: I had leftover refrigerated mac n cheese. I remembered what Scotdog said in her blog about recipes that don't work and some of the reasons why. So, I redid the rest, with new lard and it Still didn't work! By the time the outside was done the cheese was melting and now I have a pot of melted burned cheese!I did love the taste of the mac n cheese though.Next time I'll just stick with casserole style.:(:( &gt;&gt;&gt; posted 06-16-09 @5pm"

"reviewBody": "You know it's so interesting to read about the frozen middles because it was the first thing that crossed my mind before I even started to make the recipe. This is what I did. I fried according to the recipe (about 3 minutes) and nuked them straight away (time depends on the power of your microwave - should only take a few seconds) So the frozen middle wasn't a problem for me. Now for what I think of these. They were good but for some reason I felt at first that I enjoyed my mac n' cheese more without all this extra effort. Although, I have to say...I started to really enjoy them later down the line! I had these with chicken nuggets for a quick lunch. Good recipe and I can see potential in changing the flavour to suit your personal taste by using different cheeses, etc. Thanks for sharing."

"reviewBody": "These are really good. I made my own pimento cheese minus any pimentos (kids would never eat them if I did). These are rich and the ultimate comfort food, I made them as a side dish but next time I will make them as a main dish. We all loved them and I will be making them again ;) Thx for the great recipe!! Something I forgot to add is I skipped the fridge step as the cheese cooled it off enough to just scoop with my large cookie scoop and drop on wax paper. I also dredged them in the egg and breadcrumbs twice to get a nice coating. I cooked until deep golden brown. I made the full recipe and froze half. They DO NOT reheat well just like any mac and cheese."

I love adding diced jalapeno or maybe some different cheeses. Although I must say, when it comes to adding the pimento cheese spread, I recommend that you NOT use the Kraft version. Use the fresh spread that's usually in the dairy or cheese isle. My kids and fam love this dish any way that I prepare it!! Thanks!"
