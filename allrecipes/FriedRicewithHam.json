If you add green onions at the beginning, they will be nondescript green mush when served. Add them just before removing from heat. Also, if you cook the eggs beforehand as an \"omelette\", you can roll up and cut into nice little strips to add at the end. Otherwise eggs just clump and make dish heavy."
