I didn't remove the center and it did not taste bitter. I prepared a beer batter with 1 cup fine harina flour, 1 egg, onion powder, black pepper and 1 can of beer. Will definitely make again, maybe with cream cheese and chevre. Served over fresh pasta and marinera sauce."

Would make it again, but will wait for them to cool a bit before biting into one. As a result of my impatience to try one, I'm currently sporting an unsightly blister on my lower lip."

I don't normally have self rising flour so I made it with all purpose flour, baking powder and salt. Perhaps that is why it took about 3/4 cup of water to get the batter the right consistency."

"reviewBody": "Nothing at all wrong with the recipe; I just couldn't get over the fact that I was eating a flower from outside that recently I had shaken the bugs out of. Although they were washed, and they fried up beautifully (I switched around the filling in mine), they just kinda turned my stomach, although I did choke down 1 and a half of them. My husband ate the rest. I am an Earth-child, and a gardener, and a lover of Nature, but something was just so off-putting about eating these, and I have eaten dandelions right from the yard, and feverfew leaves right from the plant. I think it was the insides of the blossom that threw me - they didn't look at all appetizing, and when the blossoms were fried, they reminded me of a fried soft-shell crab, which I hate, because it's the whole thing. I know, I'm weird."

"reviewBody": "These were awesome! The goat cheese/Gruyere combo was tasty without overpowering the squash blossoms. I had to add more water than specified to get the batter the right consistency for dipping, but if you eyeball it you should be fine. \n\nThe final product was almost like tempura in texture/richness. It was great. I might try replacing the batter with a lighter flour dusting another time just for comparison. I dipped the final product in tomato sauce as I saw suggested on another site, and it was a great counterpoint to the richness. Great recipe."

It was the perfect appetizer to serve before the meal! Crispy outer coating and creamy on the inside from the goat cheese mixture. I also chopped up some leftover Italian parsley and added it to mixture for a little extra flavor. Fantastic recipe!"

I substituted a hard mozarella for the gruyere, and did a simple coating of egg followed by cornstarch instead of the batter (to make it gluten-free). I also added a clove of mashed garlic to the cheese mixture. I served them with avocados and green chile salsa. They were absolutely delicious. I will definitely make these any time I have squash blossoms. It isn't a hard recipe, it just seems hard the first time, and it is very much worth it."
