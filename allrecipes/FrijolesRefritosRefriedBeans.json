It needed a little more salt but these are way better than beans out of a can. I will definitely make this again."

Nothing fancy, nothing fake, just great beans. \nI did use oil to re-fry the beans as instructed and that was great but lard would even be more authentic and oh so, delicious. \nI had both Oaxaca and Cotija cheese available for topping. \nNote: when re frying, scoop out the beans without a lot of juice - you can add a bit more bean juice if needed but there will be a lot of extra bean juice in the pot."
