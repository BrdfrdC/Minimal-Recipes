Reading this, I am blown away how one can use an entire 16oz of acini de pepe 40oz of cannned pineapple, 33 oz of mandarin oranges, all the other ingredients &amp; serve 10!? I had to take out one heaping cup of noodles &amp; it was still over powering on the noodles. I also add strawberry, fresh pineapple, maraschino, cherries, &amp; I only ever use the white marshmallows because I want the fruit &amp; noodles to be the star of the show. Came here for measurement recommendations- regretted it lol. Well now I have some in the freezer hoping to thaw out for next time."

You can even cook the pasta ahead and rinse it very well with cold water and store in frig, then loosen it up with a fork so it is not clumped and make the lemon sauce when you are ready! Be sure to add the marshmallows last minute and it keeps a few days in the frig!"

For the amount of pineapple to mandarin orange, it overwhelms the orange. I would be inclined to substitute rice for the pasta. Old recipe from way back was just crushed pineapple, rice, and your choice of whipped topping. No additional sugar, and definitely no marshmallows. Beef up the texture a bit by adding some pecans or walnut pieces to the recipe."

This is how I make it, and I make this ALOT."

The pineapple flavor was too much compared to when I've bought this salad at various delis. I was making this specifically because I crave it and buy it at the grocery deli all the time and thought I could make it myself. Using the pineapple juice was too much I think. Another reviewer suggested not making the custard mix at all (first 7 ingredients) and making instant vanilla pudding instead. If I make this again, I'll try that. There's not enough whip cream either. I doubled it (after completing the recipe the way it's written first) it's still not right. Be very careful NOT to over cook the pasta. You'd rather it be slightly under done than over."

This makes a lot and is great if you are having around 20 people."

When my neighbor told me what she put in it, I immediately cringed at the thought of eating Cool Whip. I learned the hard way that this recipe we went to a neighbors house for Thanksgiving dinner a few years ago and they served this treat. I loved it from the first bite. When my neighbor told me what she put in it, I immediately cringed at the thought of eating cool but needs the texture that Cool Whip's artificial, chemical nature brings. (No really, I don't like ?Cool Whip - it's on par with Cheez Whiz and Pringles LOL)\n\nThis is always a hit and I am often asked for the recipe. The first year I made it my 7 year old nephew turned his nose up at it. His mom has taught him that most foods that are white, especially if they are unknown, are \"disgusting\" because they might contain mayonnaise. I told him to try it, and if he didn't like it I would give him $100. He said he trusted me, tasted it, and immediately asked for more. His brother would have said he hated it, no matter what it tasted like, and asked for the money. \n\nBy the way, I noticed several reviewers say that they leave out the coconut, I couldn't imagine this without it. The coconut flakes add a texture and flavor that really adds to the flavor. Try real coconut. Most of the \"coconut\" you find in the store is some processed near-coconut, but the real thing is available."

I followed the recipe exactly but for the whipped topping I used TruWhip (no partially hydrogenated oils) instead of CoolWhip.\n\nThe other thing I should point out is that you need to make sure to use 3 quarts of water when cooking the pasta and not the amount of water that is listed on the back of the pasta package because the other liquids (e.g. pineapple juice) in the recipe make up for the reduced water content. This wasn't obvious to me at first. Otherwise, the recipe turned out perfect and I ate it every night for a week!"

The only difference is the addition of pasta, and the sub. of whipped heavy cream for the Cool Whip. \n This is loved by everyone that tries it, I have never seen a different reaction in 35 yrs. of making the recipe. One \nEaster I didn't make it and the family rebelled, so I never made that mistake again.\n This salad HAS to be in the fridge at least 24 hours for the flavors to develop ! As far as the suggestions by others to substitute vanilla pudding for the cooked egg,this would cause the loss of the best part of the dish ! Also, if you leave out the marshmallows, you lose the lightness and fluffiness of the dish. Coconut also caused the texture to change."

It makes a boatload of salad and takes time to prepare (there are quite a few steps to do it right), but I've never had anyone turn their nose up on it. You can also freeze it, but the texture is different. I've even made it with quinoa instead of Acini Di Pepe. That freezes better. I've taken it to outdoor potlucks with crushed ice around the bowl. It also makes a good side dish with Christmas ham. Pineapple and ham were made for each other."

Leave them out and put in more pineapple. \n\nThe sauce is very important so keep the basic idea and quantity so the salad isn't dry. I'm going to try it today using OJ concentrate though.

"reviewBody": "Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! Each time I make this salad, it's eaten right up! The taste is wonderful. Like a previous reviewer, I do this in two stages. I follow the recipe, but combine the pasta &amp; egg mixture in a separate bowl and refrigerate overnight. In another separate bowl I'll also combine all of the fruit and refrigerate. Maraschino cherries are a must!! And I always add in pear pieces. Before serving, combine the fruit mixture with the egg mixture, and then add the cool whip. I've also learned from trial &amp; error that two (8oz) containers of thawed cool whip is best! You get a more substantial fruit salad, and it's creamier. I also always use the mini colored marshmallows. I leave out the marshmallows if I don't have any on hand, and I've never used the coconut, because not everyone likes it. You can't tell a difference either way. The salad is still wonderful with or without those 2 ingredients. Other than a tweak in the stages of the recipe and the addition of one more container of cool whip, you can follow the recipe and it will turn out. It's always best when made a day ahead, NEVER make it the day you're going to serve because the pasta won't have soaked up the egg mixture enough and won't have substance. And it's always best when chilled thoroughly. This will keep for several days in the fridge, but trust me, it never lasts that long. I always have to make double batches."
