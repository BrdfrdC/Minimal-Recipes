It comes out a pretty pink and you don't see any strawberries. There's no problem cutting it when frozen. Can be done either way. You need a very large pan to combine the whipped cream with the strawberry mixture! It is delicious!"

I ended up throwing the first batch away and down sized to an 8x8.\n* The chopped walnuts are much too large and hard to cut preventing you from making presentable portions. Much better ground up.\n* The strawberries sliced and frozen are also too hard to cut, and bite comfortably. I agree with other reviews. They should be ground up and incorporated into the cream and egg whites."

I would also cut the strawberries smaller as the sliced were a tad hard when frozen. I also added some fresh on the finished dessert. I also cooked the crumble a bit longer to make it a bit crispier. 15 minutes didn't do it so it was more like 18-20. It's so good."

That version (and this is how I make it) says to place the sugar, egg whites, sliced or chopped strawberries and lemon juice in a bowl and beat on high for @ 10 mins. Although it takes less time on a stand mixer, it will whip up nice and fluffy and the berries break up so there are no big chunks. Also, I've always made it using the entire crust mixture on the bottom of the pan, then put sliced berries on top of each serving. Delish!"

Saw that liquid was gathering in the bowl so just before I folded the strawberries I drained them. Used a little more whipped cream (by 1/4 cup, plus a little sugar) to lighten the mixture. It is a gorgeous, delicious, concoction. Didn't like that it took so many bowls but it was a hit with everyone. Glad I now know how to make a great crumb mixture. I'll use the leftover crumbs when serving plain ice cream."

"reviewBody": "LOVE it!!!!!like homemade ice cream cobbler... Super delicious- it's like a refreshing tangy slightly strawberry thin cobbler.\n \nThe only few things I would tweak is that it really doesn't make that much filling- I wanted/expected really thick bars- but its more like a thin even layer. Also I think it's not enough strawberries for me. Next time I will add more strawberries or some strawberry nectar. Also -I didn't get the pretty pale pink color others did; which kinda bummed me out. \n\nI took a couple other suggestions and diced the berries thin/small, cut down on the lemon juice and I increased the crust by 1/2. I definitely recommend at LEAST a 1/2 increase- since I had difficulty covering it with even that amount- but I also wanted a double crust or sandwich feel. If you just want a bottom and sprinkled top adding the extra 1/2 should work. I also added vanilla to my whipping cream and I really like the added flavor. \n\nAll in all next time I make it I will double the filling and double the crust and maybe even put in a smaller container. I think the 9 X 13 is not necessary. (but again I want thick filling) \n have fun with this recipe!!! oh and it's MESSY to make."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe but I underestimated the time I needed to make it. Made the mistake of putting \"crust\" on a (too)small cookie sheet to bake - it took a lot of time and stirring to get it done right. Next time I'll find my biggest baking sheet or divide in two. Still not sure it ended up as intended, but it got a little brown and was crispy so I thought that was correct. You can't \"pat\" it in pan if you cook as I did (until it's crispy); however, I just dumped it in pan and evened it out and by the time we ate it, the filling had softened the crust up just perfectly. As far as the strawberry filling goes, I did chop the berries up and then I mashed about 2/3 of them into even smaller pieces. The rest I left as chopped &amp; added at end. I also had trouble with the egg whites/lemon mixture beating to stiff peaks with my portable mixer; took me at least 10 minutes. Finally, I took out about half of what I had beaten out of the bowl and added another egg white - that worked better. Then I just kept adding the first egg/lemon back in very slowly until I got soft peaks. Maybe next time I will beat the egg whites for awhile and add the lemon juice slowly towards the end. I did double the crust - good suggestion by someone else. Nice taste; really refreshing and worth the effort. I took it out of freezer about 10 minutes before serving - soft, but kept its shape and cut well."

I don't know of anyone who's tried it who doesn't just love it! I have given it away for years to people myself! But I use chopped almonds in place of the walnuts. We love it with almonds. I also use a partially thawed package of frozen sliced strawberries (15 oz) in place of fresh strawberries, whip them with the egg whites, and it works just as well."

I made it in a 9 x 9 pan, to have a thicker crust - 4 days ago - and there are still left overs in the freezer. Very odd in my house. We will move on and try other recipes."

I had to taste it to make sure it was ok for them but after that, I decided to make something else and keep this for us. It was so delicious and easy to make. I did decide to chop the strawberries instead of slicing them but I followed the recipe otherwise. I would also like a thicker crust--it was so tasty! I will definitely make this again."

I did modify the recipe a little based on my preferences and other reviews : increased 1 1/2 times the crust amount, mashed the strawberries and replaced walnuts with pecans. This will be my \"go-to\" recipe for summer. Delicious!!"

I also doubled the crust/topping and it was just the right amount for a 13x9 pan. Also from the reviews, I chopped the strawberries rather than sliced...A bit messy, but worth it! Even my 8 year old who won't eat anything that doesn't have chocolate gobbled it up! This one's a keeper, thanks!"

It was light, and just the right amount of sweetness, but I think personally it might have had a bit too much crust. I chopped my strawberries instead of slicing, and they came out great. Thanks for the recipe, will likely make again!"

I didn't put any of the nut mixture on the top.... we just left it on the bottom. And we used pecans instead of walnuts. Great desert no matter which way you make it! :) Oh, I also let the strawberries thaw before I blended it in. That worked out so nice. I didn't have to cut them up beforehand. They blended in really nice."

"reviewBody": "4.5\r\nstars. This is a very interesting and tasty dessert. I had no problems\r\nmaking it. Followed other people suggestions I sliced strawberries\r\nfiner. I used confectioners` sugar, so didn`t have a problem with the\r\nsugar dissolving and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, because we didn`t like\r\ntoo sweet things. The crust itself is very tasty and compliments the\r\nfilling perfectly. The filling is good too. You can my this and keep in\r\na freezer as an ice cream. This dessert is like a great strawberry ice\r\ncream torte. Actually we liked the dessert but the reason I say just\r\n4.5 stars is that I am not sure the dessert will become a favorite in\r\nmy house. We, especially my mom, like, but don`t enjoy frozen desserts\r\n(except an ice cream). Althought this recipe would be a great thing for\r\na hot summertime weather (maybe I just chose not a right season and the\r\nweather to make it). But I will try this dessert in the summer and will\r\nhave it in my mind for an appropriate occassion."

I feel as though you could even double the crust! \r\nMake sure that you whip the eggs and lemon long enough as well as the heavy cream, otherwise you will have a hard time with the dessert setting up. \r\nWill make over and over again!"

"reviewBody": "Absolutely delicious! I wanted a thicker crust so I increased 1 1/2 times the crust amount ( 1 1/2 c flour, 3/4 c br sugar, 3/4c chopped walnuts and 3/4 c butter). I finely chopped up 2 c. of fresh strawberries and sprinkled 1T of white sugar over the strawberries to help make it more sweeter and release its' red juices. When I folded the strawberry mixture into the whipped cream, its' juices made a pretty pink color. And when I poured the filling over the crust it made nice pink and white swirls throughout the filling. I froze this dessert for at least 8 hours before cutting into it. Once frozen solid I had no problem cutting into the squares. I placed a dollop of homemade whipped cream from this site,\"Sweetened Whipped Cream\". This dessert makes a pretty presentation with flecked strawberry bits in the pinkish hue filling. The strawberries are definitely sweet and juicy. The filling itself is light, fluffy and creamy. I like the crunchy toasted walnuts in the crust as well as the topping. It adds a nice texture to the dessert. It is not too sweet -just right. The crust ended up being the right amount for this size dessert and I am glad I increased the amount. We all enjoyed this cool and creamy dessert. Frozen whipped cream blended with chopped strawberries and topped with a crunchy walnut topping, is a refreshing and perfect way to end a hot, humid day here in Hawaii!"

While the crust is sooo yummy, it dominated the dish, so the next time I make it I think I'll make as written and see how it tastes. Also, I chopped the strawberries fine but they were still icy so next time I will mash them up. I have to give it 5 stars though because it's easy to make and tastes great!"

"reviewBody": "I am shocked that so few people have tried this recipe...it is truly fantastic, and quite simple to put together. After reading the reviews, I made a couple of changes...I chopped up my two cups of sliced strawberries to make them finer, as one reviewer said that the sliced strawberries got very hard when frozen and made the dessert hard to cut. This was a great idea...the strawberry juices got into the fluffy mixture, turning it a pretty pale pink color. And I had no problems cutting the frozen dessert. Also, I cut the lemon juice to about 1 tsp.; I may add more next time, as the dessert was pretty sweet. I had a bit of a problem with the meringue portion, as my sugar didn't dissolve, no matter how much I whipped it. When I added the strawberries, though, the sugar dissolved just fine and the dessert came out fabulously well. My family absolutely loved it..the only complaint they had was that there should have been more crust. So next time I may make 1 1/2 times the crust portion, to make a thicker crust. Thanks for sharing this recipe...it's a keeper!"
