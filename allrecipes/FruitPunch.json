I served it in the same kind of glass beverage server, didn't bother with any fruit chunks (don't need little hands in the punch!) but it comes out a pretty color and super, super easy. The sherbert is a great way to keep it cold without watering it down while we were all in the ceremony."

I put the chilled pineapple juice with some Hawaian Punch Strawberry Lemonade in the blender, poured the mix in a bowl then added more of the Hawaian Punch and the scoops of the Orange Sherbet. At the end added the Ginger Ale. Exactly how the recipe shows. Since it was for Halloween, I added monster eyeballs. Got lychee, red cherries and raisins. Put the cherries inside of the lychee, and the raisins inside of the cherries. Everything looked and tasted great! The eyes didn't float though, will upload a picture as soon as I can. Enjoy!"

I've made changes here and there delpending on what I have at hand or what's on sale and found that you can add a can of frozen OJ to this. You can also leave out the pineapple juice if you use the OJ it just isn'a as sweet and If you don't have fruit punch tropical punch kool aid works just as well and for an adult party addind some wildberry schnapps or coconut rum is delicious. This also makes great smoothies if you have any fresh or frozen fruit"

I used others suggestions and brought the ingredients to the party (The hostess confirmed that she had a punch bowl) and through it together rather quickly. I also went on the suggestion of using champagne. We threw in a whole bottle and it tasted magnificent. I wasn't looking to \"wow\" anyone but this punch did just that! So easy and so many compliments! There were only about 20 people and it went really quickly since everyone went back for 3rds and 4ths! I will be using this recipe again and again. Thanks!"

"reviewBody": "Delicious and so easy! I have made this many times and everyone really enjoys it. I use Hawaiian Punch, store brand ginger ale and Dole pineapple juice. Most recently I could not find plain orange sherbet and ended up using orange cream sherbet from Edy’s and it worked out well with that too. It was very pretty. For people who said it didn’t look too appetizing I think you may want to avoid rainbow sherbet to avoid a gray mix in the end and use a bright red fruit punch like Hawaiian Punch. Also as stated in the recipe make sure to stir in the sherbet and let it melt a little for good flavor."

I have the same punch bowl that is in the photo, and I found that it only fit half of the recipe at a time - be sure to either know your punch bowl's capacity or go half to begin with (you can always add more later). Good thing I eye balled it before combining! Wonderful recipe, wouldn't change a thing. Five stars!"

Last year I had to make four bowls full and easily kept the ice cream and juices cold between refills in their containers on the back porch in the snow!\n\n(LATER)\nMaking this yet again for a holiday party!
