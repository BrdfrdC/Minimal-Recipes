"reviewBody": "I appreciate reading other people's experience using a recipe, so here's mine. I had to use ingredients on hand, and I omitted the sugar because I've never thought a smoothie needed added sugar. I gave it a high rating because the ratio of ingredient types worked well. I used plain unsweetened Greek yogurt, apple cider instead of the pineapple juice, frozen strawberries, and since I increased the recipe by 50% I used one fresh banana plus a handful of frozen banana. No changes to other ingredients. Using frozen fruit makes it thicker, but it was still smooth, and drinkable (no spoon required). Good enough to add to my recipe box. Without the pineapple juice, I felt it should be labeled Strawberry Banana Yogurt Smoothie."

"reviewBody": "I thought this tasted good. Pretty similar to the type I used to make when I first started making smoothies. It kind of tasted like a melted strawberry shake and I used a frozen banana. After I tasted the recipe I added about 8 ice cubes, as I always do with smoothies, because I prefer them icy cold. I also subbed the sugar with 1 packet of Truvia. Lately, I have been throwing vegetables in them also, and added a handful of shredded carrots, but that was only to get some veggies in. It tasted great as is."

"reviewBody": "I'm actually agreeing with everyone thus far? That never happens. LOL. There was just enough juice and yogurt in this to keep the strawberry subtle and not get too over-powering. (I don't like banana or strawberry either one to get too over-powering and like other flavors to sort of \"calm them down\" - yogurt works well for that.) It mixed up well and was easy to drink. But not a wow, so a 4."

"reviewBody": "The flavor of this smoothie was very appealing. I changed nothing, only adding in a few blueberries. I like that it primarily uses pineapple juice rather than orange juice, which usually makes a smoothie too tart. I would recommend using frozen fruit to make it more refreshing (but additional liquid is needed if you do that). Tip* if you use very ripe strawberries, it cancels out the need to add the sugar. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
