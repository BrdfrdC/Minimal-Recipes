"reviewBody": "This fudge has a distinctly different texture than the old-fashioned fudge you cook to soft-ball stage and then beat, but it's also much faster to make and got an equally or more positive reaction from the people I gave it to. So who am I to complain if my friends and family enjoy the easier option? Some modifications you can try: 1) Toast the walnuts. I'm surprised this wasn't explicitly part of the recipe as it's an easy way to enhance the walnut flavour. You can even do it in the microwave. 2) Make it on the stovetop and brown the butter before adding the chocolate. 3) Add 1 tsp vanilla and 2 tsp espresso powder for a hint of mocha flavour. 4) Sprinkle coarse salt on top after spreading it in the pan. Or do all of these at once! I tried that and it was delicious."

It separated and there was no blending them together, no matter how much I stirred. I put it in the 8x8 and dabbed many paper towels to absorb the oily butter on the sides and top. I guessed once it was refrigerated it would be hardened butter. Be interested to see what happens when it sets.🤷‍♀️"

I would definitely try it again with milk chocolate chips like others suggest. Also agree to melt butter before putting it with chocolate. One thing that did work was melting caramel and adding a little cream to swirl it in. If I had had more of that, the semisweet chocolate would have been ok since it’s sweet."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe. I use it every year Like others I felt it was too dark chocolate for me. I tried half milk chocolate and half semi sweet and it was still too dark for my taste. I used milk chocolate and it turned out great! On these directions and many others it specifically says, \"do not use milk chocolate\" It's because milk chocolate has less cocoa in it and doesn't set as well as dark or semi sweet chocolate. I'm not a fan of the chalky fudge, traditionally served so this was a perfect consistency. important note. It will taste as good as the chocolate you use. If you chose cheaper chips then, yes it will taste like a bar of cheap sugary chips. Use a premium chocolate. I use Ghirardelli."

"reviewBody": "Not awful but not worth the effort for mediocre fudge. A couple problems:\n- It is so much more complicated making it in the microwave than using a double boiler. DO NOT BURN OR BOIL THE CHIPS , this is easier to prevent on the stove top in a double boiler than in the microwave. \n- it tastes a little too dark for my and most peoples liking. I would recommend using 50% milk chocolate chips, or some kind of flavored chips like butterscotch etc.\n- the dir should say to melt the chips and butter first and then add in the s.cond milk (again this is easy on the stove top)\n- if you have to use a microwave, use the widest bowl possible. If your bowl is deep but not wide, the middle bunch of chips will never fully melt. \n\nIf you don’t have a proper double boiler, you can put a smaller pot inside of a larger one and it does the trick, ok it’s a bit angled"

Tinfoil lined pan is a must for easy use.\nI also tried white chocolate and added flavours and colour: the additions lost the stability to use a fudge but made a delightful dipped chocolate filling instead. \nFor fudge I’d recommend sticking to the original chocolate or chip flavours.\nWe found this last week and are already up to 4 batches"

I used 1 cup each of semisweet, milk chocolates, and dark chocolate chips and everyone absolutely loved them! Last time I made them, I made 1 batch with semisweet chocolate chips and 1 with Reese's peanutbutter chips. I put the chocolate part in the pan first then the peanutbutter on top and swirled then together and they were so freaking delicious!! Oh, and every time I make these I line the pan with parchment paper first which makes them so easy to get out and cut and cleanup is a breeze!!"

I used a scale to make sure I still had the right total weight of chocolate. Ended up being 1lb semi sweet, 4oz milk choc.\n\n2. Instead of microwaving, I did stove top over low heat, stirring constantly. Butter first, then added all the milk, then slowly added the chocolate until everything was well mixed. Then folded in the nuts as normal. After an hour in the fridge it was just firm enough to cut slices, but the texture was more like half-baked brownie batter than fudge. Within 10 minutes in the freezer it was the perfect fudge texture. Maybe it just needed more time in the fridge. We were overeager!"
