I agree with some others, though, that the added sugar wasn't necessary. I went ahead and tried it but I think I was a bit too sweet I made it today for some kids I'm babysitting and they loved it-had never had finger jello before."

"reviewBody": "I've always added the hot water to the mixing bowl, so this is the first time I've read about boiling it, and it worked like a charm. No need to add the sugar. I used 4 Knox gelatin packs, and it was fine, but next time I will add 5. I probably should have cut down on the water a little bit, but that just occurred to me now. Melting the Knox in cold water was new to me also; I used to add hot water to it, and it required mixing, and it seems to love cold water! I also added mandarin orange to my orange jello, and it set well. Turned out yummy!"

It's fun to make special shapes for holiday celebrations - something special just for the kids (and adults too)!"
