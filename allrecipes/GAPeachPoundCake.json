With these changes my cakes should be a little lighter. I was able to make them in 6 mini loaf pans and will only use 1/8 cup of flour for the peaches. I topped my loaves with sparkling sugar before baking. Next time I will coat the pans with sugar after I spray them with cooking spray. I now call mine CO (Colorado) peach pound cakes. This is the season for our very delicious Palisade peaches."

I don't change anything in the recipe and I don't add a glaze, although I have served it with a dollop of whipped cream or a small scoop of ice cream. It is always a big hit and is my husband's favorite cake (he is a cake fiend, so that's saying something). It is a great dessert when you are having a crowd for dinner, but I often make it for the two of us because it is so good and keeps well. I have kept leftovers in my glass covered cake plate for as long as five days and it has stayed fresh."

Baking has become my pandemic therapy - but I have never gotten anything that even remotely resembled the picture. It’s a very moist cake but the big surprise here was the crispy crust. I may have gone a little overboard draining the peaches. I always try to follow the recipe exactly and I did here except I just threw in pecans because it just seemed sacrilegious not to. I will be making this regularly!"

With peaches I found it to be very bland &amp; tasteless. I hesitated making it because, altho I love peaches, they are very mild, but the reviews raved about the taste so I figured why not? \nNot….\n I will try it with other fruits offering more taste.\nI’m curious to try with blueberries or lemon, pineapple or all 3 together perhaps."

Don’t add too much fruit, or you’ll have a soggy mess. I like to make mini bunds and bake them for about 35 minutes. You will love this cake."

"reviewBody": "True confession. I made this twice. The first time it turned out quite heavy, dense, almost a solid pudding-like interior with a pretty cake-like exterior. I did a little research and found what probably accounted for the outcome. I had used my electric mixer on stir speed to cream the butter and sugar (I always substitute Stevia for white sugar, though I used granulated sugar to coat the floured pan, of course). The stir speed worked fine for the eggs and vanilla. So far so good; but I had kept it on constant stir speed while adding the flour mixture. Then I added the peaches. This was entirely too much stirring for the flour which I found produces a glutenous, gluey cake, precisely what mine was. Moreover, I should have taken the \"fold in the peaches\" direction quite literally. So this all comes from being a neophyte baker.\n\nSecond time I made it, I corrected both mistakes. I still used the mixer, which was fine. But I carefully avoided over-stirring the flour, and then folded in the peaches by hand. The batter was stiff, so the peaches had to be folded in with a large wooden spoon. The result: a wonderful pound cake. \n\nMaybe some other newbie will profit from my mistakes. Lesson learned."

It was perfect, moist inside and a nice crust on top. The batter is quite thick when you put it in the pan. I thought something might be wrong, but it was not. I will definitely make this again. Served warm with homemade vanilla or peach ice cream and it would be heaven on Earth."
