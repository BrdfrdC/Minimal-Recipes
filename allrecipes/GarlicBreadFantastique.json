I used unsalted butter and I felt the amount of salt called for in the recipe was good, so if you are using salted butter you may want to reduce the salt ."

I did not add the sage because I don't care for Sage flavor. Also, initially I thought it was a little on the salty side as well. As I've seen in several other reviews. But I added a little bit extra mayo and that totally took away from the saltiness of it. I was shocked. But it worked like a champ.\n\nIt was amazing. I made it up early and cooked it down a little bit and then let it cool and harden up again. That way I spread it on to the loaves of French bread like regular butter. It was so good! Getting ready right now to make some more of it up for a crab feed tonight for dipping the crab in. Love it love it love it!"

Well I was wrong. I put too much of the cheese mixture on the bread and it made it soggy. So I will serve it again tonight and I will be sensible about the about of cheese mixture I put on the bread and it should be \"fantastique!\""

"reviewBody": "This is utterly amazing. All those times I thought I made garlic bread before were just hollow attempts compared to this recipe. I took a chance and almost left the mayo out because I thought it sounded weird, but that may seriously be the secret ingredient for greatness. For everyone who thought it was too salty, remember that Parmesan cheese is salty and depending on the butter you use, that might be salty too. If you're using salty cheese and butter, definitely cut back on the amount of extra salt you use. I recommend mixing all the ingredients except the salt, tasting it, and then adding extra salt accordingly. Do yourself a favor and make this. It's incredible."

It is the only garlic bread I ever make anymore. Thank for the amazing recipe!"
