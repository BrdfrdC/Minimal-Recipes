From there, used cheddar jack instead of processed cheese. Avoided cayenne. Cooked the shrimp from frozen and as another reviewer mentioned, it created more juice than otherwise. I drained the excess juice. Did not add extra salt to anything. The combination was marvelous even if I ended up peeling shrimp after cooking, and I will definitely add this to rotation!"

The only change I've made is I don't use garlic flavored processed cheese. Instead, we use cream cheese &amp; cheddar cheese in equal parts to make the amount that is called for in our number of servings. We have decided we like a little more cayenne pepper than it calls for &amp; less lemon, but that is personal preference. Once we tried as others suggested in using part of a can of diced tomatoes, but we won't anymore. It is much better using the roma tomato that the recipe calls for."

I used Land o' lakes butter with olive oil and sea salt to sautee some minced garlic and throw my shrimp in I also used Mrs. Dash garlic and herb seasonings since the butter was salted. Right at the end of cooking the grits maybe the last 2-3 minutes. I poured in a half cup or so of half and half and added my mild cheddar and provolone cheese. Excellent!! Thanks!"

It still needed the addition of the fresh peppers and possibly, like some others said, a dash of hot sauce. I also cooked my grits in chicken broth instead of water. I imagine had i used water this would have very little flavor."

"reviewBody": "For those on the fence about grits, I must advise using chicken broth to cook them and despite the package claiming that they're quick, be prepared to babysit them a bit and cook slower. The texture is much more appealing.\nLike others, I had no idea what garlic flavored processed cheese was and after much scouring on the internet have concluded that it is a discontinued product and any substitute can only be remotely found.\nI do not like Velveeta flavored dishes so in an attempt to duplicate (and a little desperation) the descriptions of this elusive cheese I bought Alouette Garlic &amp; Herbs spreadable cheese and used half the container (3 oz) and about 4 oz shredded cheddar. The flavor was very good. The shrimp mixture is great and wonderful over the grits. Make sure the shrimp are patted dry before cooking. Any excess moisture dilutes the flavor.\nMy rating is based on inclusion of ingredient that seems to no longer exist.\nMy own preferences include adding 1/2 cup of half &amp; half or heavy cream when you add the cheese. Helps texture if you have eaters who are grits shy."

However, if you really want to make it special, FORGET the cooking instructions for grits on the bag and do this; (1) Use Quaker Quick Grits, (2) for each cup of raw grits, use five cups of water, 1/4 Tsp. Sea Salt, 1 Tsp. Real Butter,(3) Bring water to a rolling boil, add salt and slowly stir in grits, immediately turn to low and continue stirring of a minute or two, place lid on pot, continue cooking on low heat for thirty to forty minutes stirring frequently to avoid lumping and sticking.

However, I did not like the shrimp spooned over it. I just did not like the combination of flavors. I have never had true shrimp &amp; grits before, so cannot say if this recipes tastes as it should. I just personally didn't like the flavor combinations. I have had Etouffee over plain grits, which a co-worker (ex-chef) had made and it was wonderful! I thought this may be similar, but just didn't work for me. I will make grits this way again, as the cheese and garlic was divine! :)"

"reviewBody": "This was great. I took a few of the suggestions and left out the processed cheese and instead used cheddar cheese. I added in powdered garlic when cooking the grits (very slow with 2 parts water and 2 parts heavy whipping cream to 1 part grits). I also added in about a teaspoon of cayenne because I like heat in my food. Last I only used one tomato and prior to adding the shrimp I sauteed five heads of garlic.\n\nI'll make this again for sure - it was delicious."

"reviewBody": "Fairly quick to get on the table on a busy weeknight. I will make this again, but will definitely tweak next time. First off, I'm not a lover of \"processed cheese\" at all, so I'll either use less than 6 oz next time, or substitute Alouette cheese spread. Like the majority of reviewers, I also used chicken broth and a little half and half for the grits, which was nice. I used the frozen shrimp tonight, but I'd prefer raw shrimp next time. I'd even like to experiment with some turkey sausage and extra veggies. I'll also use 2 roma tomatoes, diced, instead of only one. The lemony, garlic sauce was very good, but I did toss in some parsley and chives for color. Husband inhaled this and I honestly didn't think he'd dig this dinner. Overall, an easy, tasty dish to serve without a lot of prep work or fuss."

"reviewBody": "Being a northerner, this was first attempt at making AND eating grits and shrimp, although I have wanted to do so for some time now. This recipe looked just up my alley and I was not disappointed. I used regular Velveeta and added some garlic powder to the grits (instant) because I could not find the garlic-flavored cheese. I also took the liberty of adding some sliced sweet onions, strips of bell pepper and sliced scallions as I had these on hand and wanted to use them up. The end product was very tasty and my additions made the dish a bit more colorful. Everyone loved it and I will definitely be making this again."

"reviewBody": "My husband and I tried grits at breakfast last week for the first time. (Originally from IL, land of no grits...) They were a little bland, but good with salt and butter. Had them again at the next breakfast out and I decided to try this recipe since I had seen the dish on a cooking show about New Orleans. It was delicious!!!! Really, really great! I read the other reviews (from the Southern gals) and cooked the grits in chicken broth and added about a 1/2 cup of half and half at the end. Also used 1 cup of shredded cheddar instead of velvetta. This was to die for! It made the ones from the breakfast restaurant seem bad... It was creamy, cheesy and delicious! The hubby loved the tomato/garlic mixture the shrimp was cooked in and said that could go on one of his homemade pizzas as sauce. He kept hovering over the stove sniffing as I was cooking so I finally put him in charge of stirring. (If you can't get rid of them, put them to work!) We will definitely make this again. I'm using the leftover grits as a side dish to baked chicken tonight. Oh ~ I also added extra garlic to the shrimp mix (we love garlic) and will add an extra pinch or two of cayenne pepper next time. Thanks for posting the recipe!!!"

"reviewBody": "I've had shrimp and grits appetizers in upscaled seafood restaurants down here, but never made it myself. I just made my grits according to my box directions. I did use my homemade chicken broth in lieu of water, and added some half and half to get them extra creamy. I couldn't find a garlic cheese, so used Monterey Jack and a bit of cheddar. I grated the cheese so it would melt better. I also used canned tomatoes since the market didn't have any good tomatoes and it turned out just fine. I did add some green onions and fresh garden parsley, and seasoned the shrimp with Old Bay, paprika, and a dash of cayenne and of course the fresh minced garlic. This was just so darn delicious. So creamy and cheesy and shrimpy...how can you go wrong. Mine was even better than the restaurant's. Thanks AWEAVER."

I have never used lemon juice in my shrimp and grits, but I liked the twist it gave the sauce. The only thing I did different was to use a 1/2 cup of light cream along with 1 1/2 large chicken cubes to 3 1/2 cups of water (my grits called for 4 cups of water to 1 cup of grits) and I skipped the cheese altogether. I also added about 1 tbsp of cilantro to the shrimp and crumbled some turkey bacon on top just before serving. Muy delicioso."

I don't really modify the shrimp portion of the recipe, except for adding a little extra garlic and some turkey sausage (since shrimp is so expensive). I make this weekly and my family loves it!"
