I did 3/4 cup of butter, a cup of chicken broth, and only 1/2 tbsp of seasoned salt. I also made it with caramelized onion, broccoli, and chicken. Big hit."

I suggest not putting the entire teaspoon of seasoned salt, but just sprinkle to taste b/c I found that I only needed a fraction of what was called for. This would make a great side dish or I could even see adding some grilled shrimp to this for a great, light summer meal. This is a definite keeper for us~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)"
