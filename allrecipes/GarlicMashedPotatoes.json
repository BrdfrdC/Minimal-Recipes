One little change and that is peeling and quartering the two cloves of garlic and cooking with the potatoes. Although I did mash the garlic with the potatoes, its flavor was still subtle, and I would add at least one more garlic clove in the future. These potatoes were creamy with perfect consistency, and although an indulgence, I most definitely will make again (just not too often!)."

"reviewBody": "A great recipe! I used half and half instead of milk and doubled the butter. I also roasted 3 cloves of garlic and added a raw clove also. I should have stopped at the 3 roasted cloves! I love garlic but 4 cloves was a little too much. Next time I will use just 3 cloves of roasted garlic. I also toasted the sesame seeds in the oven briefly. They had a neat \"nutty\" flavor. Thanks for a great recipe!"

Next time I will mince the garlic just before I whip the potatoes. I also added 1/2 cup fat free milk and 1/2 fat free sour cream and that really made it creamer. Next time I will add butter buds. It's a yummy recipe so I will defiantly make it again. I made this again the next night and whipped minced garlic into the potatoes and the taste was awesome. I used 2 cloves of garlic."

I boiled the potatoes in low sodium chicken broth, used skim milk, and used 1/4 cup sour cream and 2 Tbsp. of Butter Buds. in place of the butter (kinda trying to make them a little \"healthier\", but not sacrifice too much flavor!) and doubled the amount of garlic. They're freaking delicious!"
