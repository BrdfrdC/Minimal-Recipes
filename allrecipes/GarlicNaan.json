I first tried the cast iron skillet until it got white hot, but that ended up being too hot and it burned right away (apparently I thought I was blackening fish!). Then I just used a regular frying pan, butter, and it worked just fine, though I flipped it a few more times to make sure it didn't stick. The bubbles blackened and it turned out great. This is a new staple/favorite for our family."
