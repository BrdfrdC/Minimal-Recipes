Since I used those instead I didn't have to wait for the rise time. Browned beautifully and no problem getting it out of the pan. In addition to the spices in the recipe I also added 2 t. Momofuku Savory Seasoning Salt and additional garlic powder. Will make again."

I swoped all onions and herbs for my own combination of italian herbs, i added two spoons of crushed garlic over and above the powder garlic and I brushed it with a butter garlic amd herb mix when it came out the oven because my family likes soft crusts. But even then the cheese wa soft in between the individual buns etc. I so used a rectangle cake tray but it still came out pretty and delicious."

Then when we went to our annual cabin get together I brought the dry ingredients premeasured. The dough had thawed and I assembled quickly. Beautiful it went great with my premade lasagna and with a little freezer dinner prep the weekend before I had a easy dinner for 10 without missing out on the visiting. I followed the recipe except using fresh dried chives and sprinkling mozzarella in the layers. What a hit. Everyone raved. It is a staple in my box now."

I sprinkled cheddar cheese and Parmesean then on them &amp; more butter then I put the 2nd can of biscuits on top. Added more cheddar &amp; Parmesean and drenched it with butter. I sprinkled extra garlic powder on top. This was the best garlic bread I've ever tasted. The ones at Red Lobster can't compare. Thank you."

Opposite to what some people said, I actully ended up with extra dipping mixture and poured that mixture over the bread. I think that's why I had to bake it for longer, but it made it super tasty. I used vegetable oil instead of butter to make it healthier. The bread tasted best when it was fresh out of oven. It tasted slightly oily the next day, but still delicious. For the healthier eaters out there, choose a healthy bread dough makes a difference."

I also used a parmesan romano cheese mix. Came out smelling delicious and did not taste too garlic-y. \n\nBecause I did not have a bundt pan, I used a crock-pot (just the removable ceramic part) and cut the bread into slices. I did not have to grease the pot and the bread pulled away from the walls without any problems. \n\nNext time, I will have to make the balls smaller so the butter and cheese gets more distributed throughout the bread."

"reviewBody": "I found this recipe to be simple and delicious...with a few modifications.\n\nFirst, make sure to grease the top edge of the pan, even on the outside to keep the rolls from sticking (as they will rise above the top). Also place a piece of foil in the bottom of the oven to catch spills.\n\nI used Rhodes frozen dinner rolls and only one egg, omitted the salt, added a stick of butter and a tablespoon of minced garlic (in addition to the garlic powder), made sure to chop the green onions and parsley extra fine, and used 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan, 1/4 cup Colby/Jack and 1/4 cup Mozzarella cheeses. I blended all ingredients together in one bowl and dipped each ball into the mixture -- there was just enough.\n\nAfter baking for 20 minutes, I placed a piece of foil over the top of the pan and baked 15 minutes longer than the recipe calls for.\n\nSince the recipe doesn't specify what you do after baking I did the following:\n\nRemove pan from oven, immediately inverting it onto a plate, loosen the rolls from the pan and allow it all to sit for about 10 minutes before removing the pan from over the rolls. Sprinkle the top with 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan and lay a piece of foil (loosely) over the top for about 10 minutes so the cheese will melt. Allow to cool completely (uncovered).\n\nI found it best to slice individual cake-sized pieces to create a cheese swirled bread. I served this with my own version of the trending \"Pizza Casserole\" and it was a huge hit! I will definitely make it again!"

The pizza dough was crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. The dough sucked up all the juices and flavours, it was amazing!!! It stuck to my bundt pan but I think I didnt grease it enough...will make again!!!!"
