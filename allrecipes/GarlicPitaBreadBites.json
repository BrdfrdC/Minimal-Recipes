I first cooked the garlic in a little butter and then mixed it in the other butter and ingredients and microwaved in a butter bowl. I also used fresh garlic finely chopped and a lot more than suggested here. The timing was perfect with 10 minutes. After all was done, I typed it off with finely chopped tomatoes and scallions. Yum!!"

I'm excited to find a recipe like this with better flavor than pre-baked pita chips, but also much cheaper too! It's a win win :o) The only thing I would suggest is double the ingrediants since I didn't have nearly enough sauce to drizzle on the pitas (Maybe half butter and half olive oil) I will probably make this using olive oil spray and garlic salt sometimes to save calories. I'm serving it tonight with spaghetti but I can't wait to try these with hummus and other dips too!"

I always seem to find pita bread on the clearance rack so I know I'll make this quite every now and then for a fun weekend snack. Next time, I might try this with EVOO and maybe double the ingredients for the garlic brushing sauce."

In fact, they were gone in minutes. I am going to make another batch to determine which I like better, but a totally easy and awesome recipe to make."

"reviewBody": "Very good, and easy. I put in olive oil simply bc I didn't want to bother with melting butter. I also just kind of dipped and brushed the pita with the garlic mixture, then baked. They took more like 20 min to crisp up--I baked about 10-15 min on one side, then flipped over and baked some more. However, I had pocketless pita so mine were twice the thickness the recipe calls for. Thanks for the recipe idea!"

At first it seems like there won't be enough sauce to pour over the pitas, but the flavor is VERY strong and you don't want too much, trust me! They were a little too crunchy for me, so I will take them out of the oven sooner next time, also I didn't cut the pita's in half because I wanted them to be softer and not like a chip. They were very good, I didn't even use a dip. Very good flavor."

Then I use an italian spice combo on the light side, add garlic powder and then top with parm. I do not bake, I broil, takes maybe at most five minutes and is supper crispy."
