(A 2 bone roast will easily take longer than 1 hour, probably 3 hours to warm up to room temp). Use fresh garlic, more is better. Use kosher salt and lots of it. Use fresh cracked black pepper. Rest at 125-128 to reach a final internal temp of 135. If someone thinks that is too rare for them, get them to finish it to their liking on the grill. We make our own sourcream and horseradish sauce. Serve with Sky High Yorkshire."

The marinade is super versatile and I use it for tritip roast and brisket too, I just adjust the oven temperature and cooking times for the cut of meat I use. I don't have a picture of the prime rib since it was at Christmas but I make the tritip roast every so often and posted a picture of it. it comes juicy, flavorful, and melt in your mouth tender every single time! I usually marinate the tritip over night. thanks for sharing this gem"

"reviewBody": "I rarely post on AR but use the app everyday for inspiring dishes. I was blown away making prime rib for the first time in my LIFE. Went by the recipe exactly except I had a 7.5 pounder and still used all of the garlic the recipe calls for. I let the marinade sit on the scored roast overnight and took it out an hour before roasting. Set the oven for 475 for the 1st half hour (to prevent a scorched crust) then dropped the temp to 325 roasting 15 min per pound. Took it out and let it sit for 30-40 min while I finished up my sides. It was better than any restaurant I’ve ever had ordered prime rib from. Made an au jus from the drippings (spooning off most of the grease in the pan first) Was a delicious (Quarantined) Easter dinner for my family of 7. Thanks for the recipe!"

Well, we planned on a 6:30 dinner the roast was not cooked until 8:30 because 1 hour at room temperature was not enough to bring it to room temperature.\n\nWe had salami sandwiches for dinner.

One of my guests loved the rareness so I let him have those. This was so tender and flavorful, and I didn't even use a prime cut, I had a select cut. The crispy rub was absolutely to die for. I was a little nervous about making this, as I've never cooked this cut of meat before, but it was amazing. Bought a 5.5 lb and not much was left over."
