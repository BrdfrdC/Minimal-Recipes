"reviewBody": "Great basic recipe! This was my first attempt at making Quinoa. Had to try because of the garlic. Then, I did add onion with the garlic. As it was cooking, I thought it would be great with Romano cheese (that's what I had on hand). So after cooking, I added the cheese with some parsley (for color). My husband and I LOVED it! Thank you so much for the recipe. I am now not afraid to make quinoa. This happens to be something I can eat on my low \"meat protein\" diet."

"reviewBody": "I made this and enjoyed that it was fairly simple to make! From past experience when cooking with just a chicken broth base I know the flavor tends to be on the lighter side so I added a chicken bouillon cube and an additional 1/3 C of water so I could get more flavor into the quinoa. Next time I will add more garlic to get a stronger garlic flavor.\nSomething I might add for anyone who is new to cooking with quinoa is if the packaging doesn't mention that it has been pre-rinsed then you may want to consider rinsing before cooking."

Maybe it’s because I’m at 6700 ft. elevation but I’m going to have to cut it down to 1 1/2 cups. It’s a great start to quinoa though. You can put in chopped roasted red peppers and/or sun-dried tomatoes for extra flavor and cohesion with your main dish. You can add feta or Parmesan too."

Nothing seems to make it interesting. To this recipe (serving), I added one tablespoon of \nbutter and a pinch of additional salt. That allowed me to eat most of one serving. We threw the rest out and will not make it again. Sorry. It probably isn't you; it's the quinoa."

"reviewBody": "This was my first attempt at quinoa...it was so yummy! I had about a quarter cup of diced onions from a different recipe and so I sauteed that with the garlic. I used vegetarian, better than chicken base instead of broth. The quinoa came out delicious all by itself but once completed I tossed in a big handful of baby spinach, a handful of sliced grape tomatoes, half a cup of chick peas, and a quarter cup of crisp corn. I tossed that together and put the lid back on for less than 5 minutes so the spinach wilted then put a crumble of goat cheese on each serving with a drizzle of olive oil. So filling and SO delicious! Quinoa will now be in my regular food rotation."

Hubby thought it was a little bland, but the kids and I liked it a lot. A very nice flavor to accompany any number of entrees. Could easily be jazzed up with some greens or veggies. I think next time I will use beef broth instead of chicken, just to see how it changes the flavor."

It reminded me of the pre-packaged rice mixes and I never use the entire spice pack with them because I feel like that is all you taste. Other than that this was a good, quick side dish."

I Really liked it, my husband not so much. Guess it's not for everyone. Even though i found it took 5 minutes more to cook i gave it 5 stars cause its easy and tasty. Thank you for this recipe, i will be making it again."

He took three helpings!! I used minced garlic from a jar, and it was VERY garlicy (just the way I like it) but I can see that it may be too much for garlic \"likers\", not \"lovers\". I used the mixed Quinoa which gave it some added colour."
