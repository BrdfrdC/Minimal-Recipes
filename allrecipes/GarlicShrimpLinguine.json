Since there is only 2 of us, I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings, and only used 1/4 lb pasta &amp; shrimp. I also used 1-1/2 teaspoons of minced garlic (from a jar). The rest of the ingredients I used 4-5 times more than the recipe called for. Next time I think I will add some baby spinach and mushrooms."

I substituted fish for the shrimp and pan fried it first, cooking the sauce in the pan after. I used angel hair instead of linguine as well as I’m trying to eat better. For those trying to transition to eating better but love their pasta this is a great recipe to help with that transition as there are many ways to modify and add twists such as veggies or other noodles and proteins."

Also, i added a bit of olive oil and added the cheese to the ready dish instead of the sauce. I made the mistake and tossed still half-frozen shrimps into the sauce so it got too watery. I fished the shrimps out after they were done cooking and added a water-cornstarch solution to thicken the sauce. I guess this could be done anyways if someone likes their sauces on the thicker side. it was super delicious and will definitely make again!"

"reviewBody": "Yummy!! Hubby just said “don’t loose this recipe”. This one is so easy to prepare. I omitted the linguine so there was only one pot! We like to have extra sauce for dipping so I amped up the butter, Parmesan and wine and added a little olive oil to begin with and a dusting of seasoned bread crumbs and a squeeze of lemon to finish it. Along with thick slices of Ciabbata bread( it stays fresh much longer than a French loaf) and a side of Asian slaw and of course it included a glass of white wine. The entire meal for two was less than an entree at a local restaurant would have been. Medium shrimp was on sale for $9.99 a lb, (28-30 per lb), everything else was in the pantry, wine was bogo, so was the slaw and there are leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Living on the Gulf Coast we enjoy a lot of seafood and this was a real winner!!"

I doubled the butter and added 2 Tbsp of olive oil, used a half cup of white wine, approximately 4 tsp of parmesan cheese, 6 cloves of garlic to make it more about the garlic than the cheese. After I cooked the shrimp, I added the pasta to the pan and mixed well. Here I increased the fresh parsley to about a quarter cup and tossed everything together and served. Next time I will add some veggies, maybe mushrooms or snow peas."

I did not add cream or thickeners--the garlic/white wine combo was good enough for us. It soaked into the pasta raising its flavor up several notches. I did use 1 pound of pasta as called for. And I did add a carton of baby spinach as suggested by the editors to this page--the added green made it so pretty and supplied some extra nutition as well. Wonderful presentation--restaurant quality!"

This time I plated the pasta, shrimp on top, and drizzled the butter/garlic/wine sauce over. Big difference and a much nicer presentation. I did add a little extra butter and splash over on wine based on what I thought would fit the drizzle on the pasta, but nothing even close to what I was doing when mixing pasta into the sauce pan. Drizzle is the way to go."
