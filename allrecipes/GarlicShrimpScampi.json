Was not sure at all about the bread crumbs so only added 1/2 cup and then 1/2 cup of parmigiana, and a tbls. of dried basal as well as 1/2 cup of 1/2 and 1/2 to the mix at the end. My wife couldn't wait, as she kept dipping the Italian bread in the pan at it sautéed at the end. She is a constructive critic at times but this rendition all she kept saying was. OMG this is so good. The bread crumbs in my opinion did help as it soaked up some juice, it produced a creamy buttery cheesy sticky mix. It may take a year off your life, but some things are worth it!!"

"reviewBody": "Needs some tweaks. First, don't burn the garlic like the video shows. Next, add the wine before the shrimp and cook it down for a few minutes to remove the bitterness of the alcohol. Finally, rather than adding bread crumbs (the thickener) lightly toss the shrimp in flour before adding to the pan. DO NOT overcook the shrimp! Translucent is best. White is overcooked. Somewhere in between is fine for most tastes. Also, add some finely ground white pepper, grated Parmesan cheese, and finely chopped Italian parsley once it's plated."

I also cooked some red pepper flakes with the garlic. When I added the wine to the shrimp I also added some lemon juice. I didn’t use very much bread crumbs because I didn’t want it too think. I skipped the cheese altogether because I’m not a fan of cheese with shrimp. It was very garlicky and delicious. I toasted baguette slices and used the smashed garlic to rub on them.

Add a dusting of kosher salt, black pepper and a little crushed red pepper.\n\nFor something different, I also added 4 stalks of bias cut asparagus, sauteed while cooking shrimp.\n\nThis is one of my all-time quick favorites."

Basil and/or oregano would have worked as well, I think. The butter sauce was soaked up quickly (probably by the extra seasonings and veg), so next time I will use a little less bread crumb and a little more butter because I like a saucier dish. I think sauteing some diced white onion with the garlic or some sliced green onion later would add some additional interest as well. We served with garlic bread and even my son, who isn't big on seafood, liked it."

My wife came hoe to the smell of a touch of garlic that was a pleasant surprise, along with dinner being ready when she walked in."

Served with Jimmbo’s Garlic Knots from this site along with a salad. Will definitely add this recipe to the repertoire!"

Plus as to not dry the shrimp out I let the sauce cook first then added the shrimp to it as it only takes a few seconds to cook thru then I added the bread crumbs to thicken the sauce while it finished cooking . That's what I would recommend works best for a simple delish 5 star recipe !!"

We used 1 pound shrimp and 1/2 pound of bay scallops. The only other thing we did was make couscous instead. Everything was delicious. I probably would double the sauce ingredients to stretch in the future."

I also think adding a splash of lemon juice to give the recipe a bit of tartness would help. I also added some capers, which enhanced the flavor. My family loved it prepared this way."
