They also host a huge BBQ every July, and practically the first thing everybody asks her is if she's gonna make the fudge again for Christmas LOL!!! \n\nAs many others here mentioned.....it's almost impossible to screw this up. (Not sure why some here had problems with it setting up. IT IS a softer fudge, but I've never had any probs with it becoming firm enough to cut and hold in your hand.) Anyway....I do it the same way my friend does it and double the recipe, then simply divide it up into fairly equal portions after completely mixed and press into sprayed plastic containers with tight fitting lids. Then we just cut out whatever size piece we are in the mood for at the time. One other thing that I do is to use plastic gloves and mix it by hand being careful not to stick my fingers directly into the hot butter until it's combined with the dry ingredients. Also.....we use 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream and 1 cup nuts. I gave this to another friend as a Christmas gift this year and she told me later: THIS FUDGE OUGHT TO BE ILLEGAL!!! LOL"

I made the microwave fudge recipe that uses sweetened condensed milk, chocolate chips, and butter. It's fine, but not anywhere near as amazing as this recipe. The flavor and texture of this recipe is, in my opinion, some of the best fudge I've ever had. I've had no reason to attempt more difficult fudge recipes, because I'm so happy with this one."

"reviewBody": "I have been using this recipe since the early 90's and was so happy to find it here. This is by far the quickest and easiest way to make fudge. Anyone that this had a problem with this has tried to do it on a stove top or didn't follow the directions properly. I've found that for a creamier fudge, you can use 3 oz. of whipping cream (Cream being heavier and thicker than milk, you need a little extra). Also, if you prefer darker fudge, you can use the Special Dark cocoa from Hershey's. I've also made peanut butter fudge using this same recipe. Just leave out the cocoa and use peanut butter instead of butter. Another quick and great treat. I saw this recipe on a microwave cooking show on PBS. They actually listed several variations, I just can't recall all of them. One more small hint here. Modern day microwave a far hotter than earlier models. Melt time for bitter in my microwave is just over 1 min. This is important, you don't want to over heat the mixture as it can become very hard very fast. So do a test run to determine how long it takes to melt your butter and go from there. Happy cooking and enjoy!"

Also, use real butter in sticks (not in tubs)... not softened butter or butter substitutes. If you use margarine or butter substitutes, the fudge will be too soft. But keep in the fridge, even if you use real butter."

You do have to work quickly so have your pan lined with foil before you start that way you don't have to stop to do it. I put it in the freezer overnight and tasted fantastic! We'll definitely be making it again in our house."

"reviewBody": "Wow! Amazing that you can make fudge that quickly and easily and have it turn out so good.\n\nI veganized this for my boys who have severe food allergies, using dairy-free margarine and rice milk. The only thing missing was a little salt, but that was my fault since the margarine is unsalted.\n\nI followed others recommendations to melt the \"butter\" and \"milk\" together first in the microwave. I used a whisk to mix the cocoa and sugar, and remove lumps. Then I added the milk mixture to the dry mixture, and continued to stir with the whisk. I added the vanilla, and continued mixing with a rubber spatula. \n\nIt came out so smooth! I didn't grease the pan but used foil instead, as others suggested, which made cutting easy. \n\nThank you for this recipe!! I will definitely make it again . . . And again . . . And whenever I need a quick chocolate fix. :)"

This recipe is simple, quick, and tasty. True, this is probably not a gourmet fudge recipe, but for ease, texture, overall taste, and finished product, it definitely deserves 5 stars! This is also a great starter recipe to add in your own favorite nuts, chips, etc., but my family prefers it plain. We actually plan on making a batch for our Thanksgiving dessert table this year! Thanks for the great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I have been using this recipe for years. A few said it came out a little too soupy and cuts up thin. I have made a few changes and it comes out great. I cut the stick of butter or stick margarine at the 6 Tablespoon mark and I add 2 Tablespoons of cocoa to the 1/2 half cup. So a little more powder and a little less butter and I use a buttered loaf pan instead of the 8 x 8 pan so get thick pieces of fudge. I get all ingredients ready and put the milk and butter in the microwave 2 minutes, then quickly add the 4 cups of powdered sugar (which is the same as a one 1 lb box), the cocoa and vanilla. Stir well. Once it has all been stirred well, I sometimes add 1/2 cup of chopped nuts or swirl a few heaping tablespoons of peanut butter in (don't mix the peanut butter into the fudge, just swirl a bit so it is evenly distributed). Refrigerate until firm enough to cut. I use a thick knife to deeply cut down into the fudge &amp; cut longways in half, then half again, then across into squares. Dig one corner out first, etc."

"reviewBody": "Decent recipe. I made one batch exactly the way the recipe stated. It tasted okay, but the fudge was hard to cut, a little lumpy, and crumbly. I made the second batch with the suggestions of others. I sifted the flour and cocoa together in one bowl, and melted the milk and butter together in another. I then poured the milk/butter and vanilla into the bowl with the dry ingredients and mixed. This fudge came out much creamier than the first batch. The only complaint I have is that the fudge does not come out very thick. I used an 8x8 pan and the fudge wasn't even 1/2\" high. The batter was also very hard to pour and spread - I suspect the recipe needs some more liquid ingredients. The fudge is good, but it defintely doesn't taste like real chocolate fudge. Good for just a sweet bite though!"
