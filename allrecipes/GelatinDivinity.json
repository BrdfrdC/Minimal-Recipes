I thought the mixture was still glossy but it started to get too thick so I stopped mixing. I have never had divinity before but I imagine it being kind of like nougat (?) and this texture was not it at all (likely because I messed up with the mixing). I used 2/3 the amount of sugar and it was borderline too sweet. My daughter loved it even though it was sticky and messy to eat. I would try making this again, or perhaps another recipe, to figure out what I did wrong. Benefit of a doubt, 4/5."

Maybe I didn't beat the mixture enough, it's still a tiny bit glossy but my electric beater sounded like it was going to blow so I stopped. I may add salt next time and create a salt water taffy. PS: I left out nuts for the kids. Overall 5 stars, loved it."

"reviewBody": "I'm giving this 5 stars for ease of preparation and texture, but know that it will taste like jello since you are using gelatin to flavor it. I made a double batch of cherry and had a blast whipping it up and prying it out of the bowl. I used a dry wooden spatula to spread it better in the pan (I used 2 cookie sheets) once it set slightly. The next time I made a batch of cherry, I put several drops of peppermint oil in the boiling sugar mixture. As far as cutting and packaging this candy, I've cut into squares and I've also handrolled small tubes using confectioner sugar coated hands."

I just got finished fighting this out of the mixing bowl and it is delicious! although quite the sticky confection, it is really tasty - reminds me slightly of saltwater taffy without the salt mixed with marshmallows...I guess I'm just a northerner new to divinity, but it is definately an entirely new type of candy to be made in my kitchen. I used sugarfree cherry jell o and it made no difference (obviously, since there's three cups of sugar already!). I'm already considering a batch of lime...\n\nSo I have learned that I don't like divinity after it has set. it's just too sweet for my taste, as well as everyone else in my house."

As a newbie to candy making, I was not too sure about the whipping \"until the candy loses its gloss,\" so each batch I made came out a little different texture-wise. But all the candy was deliciously edible."

I used strawberry banana jello and it was pretty &amp; good. I think I'll try to dry out some cherries and mix those in with the nuts. Oh and since it is humid out here in southeast Texas, I did keep out 2 tablespoons of water."

It is also beautiful to serve. \r\n\r\nSpecial note: When cutting the divinity, dip knife in large glass of cold water. This will help keep the knife clean between slices."

Just a tip, when I make divinity or fudge I turn on my dehuidifier,as high humidity can cause the candy to not set up. This recipe will definitely become a holiday tradition in my home."
