This fit into my Cuisinart ice cream maker, with still about 2 cups remaining, which I will process later. Rave reviews!"

Fortunately i tried the mixture before churning. \nI couldn't taste the peaches at all so i wound up adding about half pint of fresh strawberries and a bit more vanilla.\nWound up being delicious, but even though peaches outweighed strawberries 4-1, it was strawberries we tasted.\nLooking forward to trying this with other fresh fruits."

I also followed someone's recommendation and added 1/4 tsp. of kosher salt. Next time, I think I will reduce the evap and increase the half and half. I am not a fan of the taste of evaporated milk. I pureed the peach mixture in the blender in batches, leaving the last batch a little coarser for texture, and used a one-gallon electric ice cream churn with ice and rock salt to freeze the the mix. Even allowing for blanching, cooling, and peeling the fresh peaches, this was quick and easy to make. It can also be done in stages if you are short for time."

I'd also like a more peach-forward flavor. I blended three large peaches and chopped a fourth one to add some chunks (don't add these until the end). Next time, I will leave slightly larger chunks of peach to add in, but I might also add an extra peach to the mix. But because peaches are so high in liquid, I might cut down on the milk to compensate. This is a great recipe, and I'd like to see it a little thicker and a little peachier."

"reviewBody": "Good! Used frozen peaches (made it in December) and I should have not processed them quite so much....I think some peachy \"chunks\" would have made it better. I have a standard size ice cream maker and it almost overflowed without me adding ANY whole milk! And I only used 2 lbs of peaches....so next time I will probably use 1 3/4 lbs and lessen the half and half. Not super sweet which was how we liked it."

Granted, it was a simple, inexpensive recipe compared to the cooked custard peach ice cream I usually make, but the end product was \"icy\" and not at all creamy. Next time around I might modify it by adding a couple of eggs and cooking up a light custard with the milk/cream mixture (decreasing milk to offset the egg addition)."

"reviewBody": "Super easy ice cream recipe! Just got a new machine (one that does NOT need ice and salt, hallelujah!) and this was the very first recipe I tried. It couldn't be easier....the most time consuming part was peeling and pitting and dicing the peaches. You could easily turn this into any flavor by using different fruits or extracts. My only thought is that after the ice cream froze in my freezer, the next day, it was not as creamy as maybe an egg based custard ice cream would be....it was a bit \"icy\" when first taken out, and then a bit \"watery\" the parts that started to melt. But for a quick, easy ice cream, this one is definately a winner, especially if you are going to eat it that first day. By the way, this recipe makes a gallon of ice cream, my machine I found out will only hold a half gallon, so I stored the other half in a container in the fridge and made it the next day."

I did not add the extra sugar and it was fine :)"

I followed the recipe with everything but the milk, I mixed everything together (I had ommited the peaches though) in the mixer, except the milk, poured it in the container, and then added the rest of my whipping cream, and whole milk up to the max. fill line. After it was done being made, I froze it longer, because reagular ice cream makers, you know never get it like store bought ice cream does, a little slushy, so popped it back in the freezer for another 10-15 min."

Every year when we travel through Georgia, we stop at a peach plant off the interstate to buy tons of fresh peaches to bring home - and this ice cream is almost identical to the one they make at their cafe. The only changes I made were that I used fat free for the 2 canned milks and 1 % milk not whole - all to cut down on the fat content. The batch froze extremely well in our home machine. We made it twice in one week it was so popular with friends and family while our peaches were still fresh!!"

I found it rather funny the handful of reviewers who indicated that this recipe didn't have any flavor. If your ice cream doesn't have any flavor the peaches you used were junk! Probably store bought, pick green weeks ago, no aroma, no flavor, shipped hundreds, if not thousands of miles, mass produced junk! When you're searching for the right peach, pick it up, hold it to your nose and sniff. If there is an excellent peach aroma that makes your mouth water, that peach will be good to eat or use in ice cream, or a baked good. If you smell little or nothing, the peach is junk and you might as well just use canned."

Will definitely make again, and may try changing up the main flavor ingredient as I bet this makes a perfect base for other flavors!"

I added 1 cup of sugar and found it to be too sweet; half a cup is plenty. One word of caution: if you cut your peaches instead of puree them, your ice cream maker may \"freeze up\" as the chunks block the paddle from churning. If you like little peach chunks, puree about 3/4 of the peaches and chop the rest."
