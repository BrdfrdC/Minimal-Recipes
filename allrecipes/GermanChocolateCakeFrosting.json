Next time I am going to toast nuts and coconut as some other bakers suggested as I do believe that will enhance it and make it a 5 star."

It cuts the sweetness and lets the flavors shine more. My stove runs hotter so I need to it low and stirring not constantly but not leaving the frosting cook on it's own either. For me it takes 20 minutes to cook."

Not so - it thickens while hot. Have faith and keep stirring while it's bubbling - a wire whisk worked great. Don't step away from the stove. This frosting tasted great, just like downtown!"

You can taste every ingredient in this icing something about the butter and brown sugar that’s just so yummy. I didn’t have an issues with the icing thickening you just have to take your time and constantly stir while it’s cooking I call being patient while cooking “cooking with love”. I followed the exact recipe and I will be making again."

Otherwise, it is perfect as is. I did follow other reviewers suggestions to cook over Low for 10-12 minutes. Then it thickens as it cools. We have some non-coconutters in the fam so I left out the coconut. I toasted the pecans, too. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!"

I am a professional baker so I have an eye for changes in recipes so I added an additional egg yolk to make sure this would be thick enough to hold in the sides of a cake. \nI cooled the frosting in the freezer stiring every 10 mins until cool then filled and iced the entire 6 inch cake...So far so good, its holding on the sides of the cake but I imagine you want to keep this in the fridge! \n\nThis is sinfully DELICIOUS!!!"

I made exactly as the recipe was written and cooked it at medium. It was just enough to frost the outside of a two layer 9 inch round cake, luckily I had another frosting I intended on using for the filling. Everyone loved it!"

I let it cool down to room temperature before frosting. It has been a couple of hours since then and it hasn't started to \"set\". I suspect I did not let it cook long enough. Good flavor though."

"reviewBody": "This is a great recipe for Coconut/Pecan icing for German chocolate cake. Followed the directions as written, except took a hint from other reviewers and cooked on medium heat. Mine took about thirteen minutes. Someone mentioned the lack of specificity in the directions, that is a title true, but I have been baking for over 60 years so it was not a problem. I would say one thing to look for is the mixture starts to change color, then it is near done. Also remember you are adding a lot of pecans and coconut. Taste is totally wonderful"

"reviewBody": "I decreased the brown sugar to 1/4 C and it was plenty sweet. My opinion is that we use entirely too much sugar which masks the flavor of the foods it sweetens. I only frosted in between the 2 layers and the top (see photo) so if you frost the sides you will need to make more frosting. It looked like it wasn't going to thicken so I put it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes which did the job."

I don't know about you, but when I add milk, sugar and egg together and heat, it's like a pudding... I've messed up enough puddings and custards to know that cooking it for 30 minutes will result it something terrible. I think I spent about 15 minutes in the kitchen putting the cake in the oven, making this frosting and a chocolate butter cream frosting (for those who won't eat coconut or nuts). I had to run kids and my husband could handle taking the cake out. And my frosting was super thick and yummy! It was even thick enough I could really pile it on to be thicker than the butter cream side. Something that rarely happens with other recipes. It's just that good you guys!!! I will never use another recipe."
