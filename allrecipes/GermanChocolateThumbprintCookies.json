What I do as an extra is add a small bag of pudding mix to the mixture for the cookie and it comes out much chewier (we love our cookies this way) however I've made these cookies as is and they come out terrific either way. Happy baking!"

I had a dark chocolate cake mix, so I measured out 3 ounces of that (using a scale, not a measuring cup) and added it to the dough. I then made the recipe exactly as written, and they were delicious! They received rave reviews from family and co-workers."

The cookies did not spread they are perfect thumbprint cookies with perfect amount of filling. I used real butter. I beat the egg yolks until a creamy consistency. I baked cookies 12 min let them cool on cookie sheet for 5 mins then removed to wax paper to finish cooling (I don't have a cooling rack). I got 4.5 dozen. They taste delicious. I will definitely make them again. I think this will be one of my annual Christmas cookies."

I made the mistake by following the instructions for the cake mix and trying to combine it with the homemade topping mixture and melted butter and of course it was too runny so I was left making a cake after all."

I make several types of thumbprint cookies during Christmas, &amp; I always make my \"thumb\" print AFTER they cook. As soon as my cookie sheet leaves the oven, I set it on my hoosier cabinet, &amp; use my All Clad 1tsp measurer to press the indention into the top of the cookie. I quickly work through all the cookies, making the dent, then start over to make sure it didn't \"puff\" back up again. Then, I let them cook, &amp; insert the filling for my thumbprints later. I have NEVER had a problem getting a thumbprint cookie to set up using this method."

I used devil's food cake mix b/c could not find german chocolate and it turned out fine (any choc mix will work I think). Note: be generous with the dollop of topping you put on each cookie - it sets up fairly well. \nI disagree with the user who said these are not attractive - I think they look very nice, not sloppy at all - will be going on the \"cookie table\" at my sister inlaw's wedding next month."

Worked great, and got lots of requests for the recipe. Thanks Carla!"

"reviewBody": "Not sure why so many people have had trouble with these cookies spreading or having to add flour. I made this recipe exactly as written and had no trouble at all. Perhaps people are not paying attention to how much filling to add to the cake mix portion? I didn't get 5 dozen cookies out of it but didn't really try to accurately measure the amount of dough I used either. And though they are not that attractive, German chocolate cake isn't either, so I think if you like German chocolate enough you care more about the taste than the appearance."

I made them pretty much as is...except I only used 1 cup of pecans and 1 cup of coconut because the the nuts and coconut came in 2 cup bags, I decided I would save a cup of each to make another batch! I don't think that made any difference as the cookies were still wonderful. I did add a 1/4 cup of flour per other reviews as I was worried about spread, but I don't think I really needed to. Next time I will not. I think it made my mix too dry, so I added a tablespoon of water to counter the flour I put in. I have a brownie recipe I make that also uses a cake mix, and it seemed to be the same consistency...which is somewhat dry, but moist when baked. Very good, will make just as recipe is posted next time. Thanks Carla!"

I'm pretty picky when it comes to cookies - they have to be soft and chewy on the inside with a bit of a crisp on the outside - that is exactly what these cookies were. The topping - homemade, always go for homemade if you can, it always tastes better - was the perfect amount of sweetness for the not-too-sweet cookie. Together, the topping and cookie, had a fantastic taste, and yet they still tasted good apart. Will definitely make again - though I'll try and figure out how to make them a little prettier."

It is a little hard to shape because the mix is dry but once they bake it all cones together perfect. No need to change a thing! Yummmmmy!!!"

They go flat, like so many of the complaints I've seen. I've NEVER gotten them to look right at home! It has to be a temperature issue, wouldn't you think? I'm determined to figure this out, because my family and I LOVE these cookies! Meanwhile...to decrease the ugly, I'm using a heart-shaped cookie cutter on the flatties I made tonight. :)"

Yes, they come out flat and chewy if you bake per original directions but I'm not complaining. Might try adding some flour as recommended by other reviewers. \n\nThey were sweet, chewy and easy to make. I don't think they are 'ugly' as others have stated. Come on what do you expect from chocolate cake mix, coconut and pecans!"

"reviewBody": "I've made dozens of yummy recipes from this site over the years, but this one drove me to actually write a review. Someone I adore loves German Chocolate Cake, but he also lives far away. :( GCTC to the rescue. At first I snickered at the thought of using a cake mix for the cookie dough. Then I felt a little devilish at the thought of getting away with it. The first batch valiantly gave itself in the name of research. My sister dedicated herself to scrutinizing the cookie batter while her husband choked down the filling. After passing reviews, batch #2 was apparenly abducted by aliens while setting up in the fridge. Batch #3 turned out beautifully, and was packed and on its way to the object of my affection. Without even trying the originally recipe, I followed the pack and added the 1/2 c flour to the cookie batter. I also refrigerated the dough overnight and used a sorbet scoop to portion the dough and a small melon baller to hollow out an indentation for the filling. Save yourself alot of grief and just make a double batch to begin with so half can be devoured \"raw\" and the other half can make it to the oven."

So I put it all into a sprayed 9x13 dish, added the filling on top, and baked for 35 minutes. They are still warm, but I don't think the consistency will even hold up as a \"brownie\". I admit that they are good, but it seems that they are too tempermental! Maybe I'll try again when it's not snowing out!"

They still flattened out a little more than I was hoping, so next time I will up the flour a little more. When the cookies cooled I drizzled the tops with melted chocolate chips that I put in a little zip-lock bag that I snipped the corner of. It made them look GREAT...everyone loved them! P.S. I've also tried them with a Devils Food Cake Mix &amp; they were wonderful! Thanks for a keeper!"

These were the best \"brownies\" I have ever made! I baked them for about 35 mnutes. I just kept checking them. I did end up taking some of the ugly cookies to work and one lady said they were the best cookies she had ever had! NOTE-I am high altitude, about 7000 above sea level, so not sure if they flattened due to that. I may try baking powder next time. (and I did add the extra 1/2 cup or so of flour because they were too sticky to work with). I think I will stick with the brownie version for now!"

"reviewBody": "Excellent cookie recipe! I loved the convenience of using a cake mix for the majority of the cookie dough. The coconut/pecan topping was actually really easy to make from scratch, and not overly sweet like the canned versions. I added 1/2 cup of flour to the cookie batter as suggested by the other reviewers, and chilled the dough before making the cookies and in between batches - they came out beautifully. My husband loves German Chocolate Cake so I can't wait for him to try these! \n\n** I've made these cookies multiple times and found that added about 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips to the batter makes it even better and brings out more of the chocolate flavor! :)"

"reviewBody": "As long as we don't think of these as traditional thumbprint cookies, I have no problems with them whatsoever. My husband is a german chocolate fiend, and his office requires him to bring his own treats on his birthday, so these make an annual appearance since they are easier to handle than cake. Everyone who tastes them asks for the recipe, thinking they are really difficult to make, but they are so easy and soooo good!\n\nI haven't yet tried adding flour to the mixture (which I should be doing anyway since I live at altitude), but I'm going to make a batch this weekend and try it.\n\nOne complaint: I wish the recipe told how much frosting to put INTO the cake mix, not how much to hold out. My husband and I can't stop snacking on the darn stuff as it cools, so it's always a guess as to how much should go into the cake mix."

"reviewBody": "Wow! These cookies are terrific and addictive! Just make sure you read the instructions all the way through before attempting. My topping mixture looked a little curded while cooking, but it still tasted great, so I am not sure if it is supposed to do that or not. Also, I used the pre-chopped \"cookie\" pecans that were extra-finely chopped. This worked great for the topping and didn't leave any annoyingly large pieces in the actual cookie. Also, like previous reviewer, I added a 1/2 C flour to cookie mix and chilled dough for about 45 minutes. My cookies spread, but not in a bad way - they still looked good. Although, the way they tasted, I doubt anyone would have cared about how they looked! Finally, you can use more than a 1/2 tsp of the topping per cookie - I just heaped it on and still had plenty to make 60 cookies from the single batch. Yummy - this is now offically one of my husband's favorite cookies!"

"reviewBody": "I made 2 batches in the same day. Batch #1: made exactly as stated, and put dough in fridge. Cookies spread to 3\", and were flat. Batch #2: I significantly cut the amount of filling I added to the cake mix, hoping the cookies wouldn't be so flat and spread so much. No appreciable difference.\r\n\r\nThese taste great -- unique blend of crunchy and chewy. My guests adored them, and asked for the recipe! But beware: they spread a LOT. Even making them in 1\" balls yields a 3\" cookie. I had a lot of filling left over after Batch #1 and even more with Batch #2 and froze it for I-don't-know-what. \r\n\r\nThe only way I'd improve them would be to somehow make them not as flat. Perhaps adding 50% more coconut and nearly that much more pecans would help bulk them up.\r\n\r\nWhatever, I highly recommend these. They're addictive: be sure to make more than enough for what you need, because you'll end up eating several while they're still warm from the oven. Mmmmm!"

I was expecting a cute little thumbprint cookie filled with the coconut/pecan mixture. Instead, the cookie spread out and flattened completely; I even refrigerated the dough prior to baking. Delicious to eat but not so appealing to look at."

I do belive that store bought filling would be alright but the homemade is so much better. I tinkered with the idea of taking the easy way out and using the store bought and I am glad that I didn't! I ate so many of these! I think I might drizzle a little melted chocolate across the tops of these to fancy them up a little. Otherwise great!"
