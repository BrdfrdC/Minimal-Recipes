Now that I made these, I know why. They were so good. Changes/ Lesson’s learned: These ended up quicker to make then I thought. I used a food processor to shred the potatoes and finely chop the onion. I learned you must have oil on the bottom of your fry pan or they do not fry well( they burn rather than become crispy and golden brown). I added some scallions for color and ate them with regular applesauce and some sour cream. Yum."

"reviewBody": "My son picked these for a school project. We shredded the potatoes by hand on a box grater and put the potatoes in ice water to keep from oxidizing and got some of the starch out. We also grated the onion on the box grater to get them the same size and consistency as the potatoes for cooking. We drained the potatoes in a colander and dried them well then followed the recipe. I added a bit more salt and pepper, but otherwise the same. These turned out delicious- I am a huge fan of potato pancakes and these were crispy, had fabulous flavor and my son was over the moon. Served with applesauce, sour cream and chives. YUM! Will definitely be put in the family rotation."

"reviewBody": "What a great recipe! I used two large Idaho potatoes, shredded and then wrung dry - almost too dry! So I added another egg and a teaspoon more flour, and they were just right. I also added dried Parsley and Chives (as that is what I had), additional salt sprinkled on as eaten, and they were delicious topped with sour cream and applesauce. Thank you for a great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "We loved these! I’ve always wanted a good fried potato or hash brown recipe but had not found it. Now I have a “keeper” recipe! I added a little more salt and onion, plus a tablespoon of dried parsley. I used my fingers to pick up the potato mixture and drop it in the 12” iron skillet, then just pushed each clump down gently. I didn’t really flatten them. They were wonderfully crispy on the outside and potato-y soft on the inside. I had to add a little more oil a couple of times."

I did sift the flour and beat egg separately before adding to the dry ingredients. Used box grater to shread the potatoes and a mandolin to cut the onions quickly. I noted some asked about the potatoes turning brown. My suggestion is to have all ingredients prepped before peeling the potatoes, including having the egg mixture ready to receive the potatoes and onions. I highly recommend using cheesecloth to squeeze water from the potatoes. Enjoy, I did!"

"reviewBody": "This is an easy and delicious recipe. I used a food processor to finely shred the potatoes, one by one. As each potato was finished shredding, I immediately dropped them into a salad spinner filled with very cold water. When all the shredded potatoes were in the water I drained them, rinsed them twice more with fresh cold water, then spun them twice, squeezed handfuls of the potatoes draining as much of the remaining moisture, and dropped them into the egg and flour mixture. Following the remaining directions, I hand formed small pancakes, frying them 3 minutes in medium hot vegetable oil, which resulted in good crisp browning, and fluffy delicious pancakes with a hint of onion. Applesauce is a great accompaniment! Enjoy!"

"reviewBody": "Reading some of the negative reviews, I feel that it's helpful to share what makes this recipe great and what can go wrong. There are no bad potatoes only bad potato preparation.\nUsing 6 medium potatoes is not a standard measurement so some of this is just going to come down to experience with the ingredients. If your potatoes are a little wet add more flour, I added 1 &amp; 1/2 tablespoons more, with just a pinch of baking soda extra.\n Seasonings are really individual and these pancakes are often served with sausages or other foods so I don't feel that this is any fault at all in the recipe. Some side dishes are ment to be served like this to balance out other heavly seasoned foods. If you are making potato pancakes the star of the show then season them!\n For myself I added garlic salt, parsley and peprika. when frying this I liberally added butter and bacon fat ( cause a I had some on hand) and it turned out great. \nI served it with sour cream and ketchup but it can be sweet or savory. One other note is that leaving the peel on adds to the flavor and I mix my potatoes up. I like having russet, red and Yukon gold all together and this recipe benefits from the slightly varied tastes of the different potatoes mingled together."

It's hard to go wrong with potatoes in our family, so everyone ate them, but all agreed that they needed a bit more oomph!"
