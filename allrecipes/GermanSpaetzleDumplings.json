I use a hopper style spaetzle maker and it is worth every penny. Kids love these and a great batter for them to help make."

The only thing I did different was double the recipe and use half the amount of nutmeg because it’s such a potent spice. It was perfect and I don’t recommend leaving it out. I let the “dough” rest for 30 minutes before using my flat cheese grater as the tool. I also watched a couple YouTube videos just to see what the consistency should be since I’ve never made it before and this recipe was spot on. I made to go with chicken paprikash. It was so easy and they are so delicious I will find other uses for this recipe soon!!!"

It can really overpower the dumplings.\n\nMake sure the dough feels like dough and isn't too runny. Mix throughly until smooth and it has a bit of \"stretch.\" \n\nI have a potato masher with perfect sized holes. I spread the dough in small amounts over the holes and push through to the water. Works like a charm.\n\nDelicious, tender and a crowd-pleaser."

I put the batter on that it is went through the grater in a big blob. So, I sort of cut it up in the boiling water so it wouldn't come out horrible.\nThe directions said saute in butter. But it didn't say for how long. I tried it after sautéing it and it had no flavor. I was going to serve it without a sauce. So, I added some extra salt to give it some flavor. If I make this again I will make it as my mom did by putting the batter on a cutting board . Then making a thin line of batter on the board and using a knife cut and push the batter into the water. \nMy husband said to just be readymade stuff and not deal with it. Maybe he is right."

I only added about 1/8 of a tsp and next time I will be braver! I also added more like 1/2 tsp pepper and a Tbls of dried chives. Served with chicken schnitzel and made a gravy of onion mushroom and homemade chicken stock. Excellent! Thanks!"

However I was able to remedy the problem on the fly by dusting the dough with a little extra flour a few times. I believe I ended up using about an extra quarter cup, give or take.\n\nI decided to go more traditional and press the dough out to about 1/4\" with my hand and then cut ~1//4\" strips with a dough knife, which I then cut by eye resulting in pre-cooked pieces of about a cube shape to about a one inch strip. This method results in less uniform noodles with little pits and grooves that hold sauce well - one of the things I really like about this type of noodle. \n\nI tossed about 15-20 pieces at a time into well-salted rolling water and spidered them out once they floated to the top (about a minute or so), and into a colander to drain and cool. The resulting noodle was just al dente', which should be about perfect when I cook them later this evening in herbed (sage, thyme, tarragon) brown butter with porcini."

However, this may be due to the fact that I omitted the pepper and nutmeg as my parents are not huge fans of them. They cooked in about 2-3 minutes, rather than five, with the heat all of the way up and the lid off. In my opinion, they are great raw, but we are planning to eat them with a cheesy sauce. I didn't have a good way to mold them, so I poured the batter onto a cutting board and sliced strips into the water with a butter knife. 10/10 recommend, especially if you're looking for an easy, unique meal."

The flavor is excellent and it tastes really good with the Sirloin Tips and Mushrooms recipe from this website. If you want to vary from the usual side of potatoes, this makes a perfect substitute for them. Serve it with stewed meat or pork. It will change your perspective and definitely will get you away from the usual potato based side. I have a spatzle maker and the recipe sometimes comes out a bit runny. Do not fret, just add flour in tablespoons and test until you notice it becomes firm enough to your taste. My suggestion is to add a few more tablespoons of flour and that will be it. If you want to store them, I recommend doing so after you have fried them to keep them from sticking to each other."
