I'd followed other recipes, but I could never get it right. On this, my 5th try, I got it right. Now I can make it at home instead of buying it from a restaurant."

I made this using a venison roast in place of beef, and left out the fresh chives because the store had none. Otherwise, I made it as written; and wouldn't change a thing! I served it over saffron basmati rice. So unbelievably good--that we ate it before I could get a picture! Thank you for the recipe! I will be making this again!"
