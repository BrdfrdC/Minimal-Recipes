Add flour to oil left in pan to make a thick gravy add turkey drippings to make gravy. She did not use flour was why she got complaints about gravy to thin. . Giblet gravy is not thin in my house and does not need to be. Tastes a lot better. In a pot add giblets, neck, onions, in water boil. I never add the liver but it is your choice. Boiil until done. Add this to the gravy, add egg whites only to the gravy. I love a lot of egg whites in it. Cut up turkey you seared to make gravy and add to the gravy, Simmer and enjoy. Best gravy ever!"

I continued to thicken with increments of 2T cornstarch mixed with 2T water. I did not cut the giblets up to add to gravy. I also added 3-4 drops of yellow food coloring to give it a more palatable color. The coloring gave it a rich turkey gravy appearance. With the changes this will be my go-to gravy recipe for Thanksgiving. Made the night before and just re-heated before the meal."

She taught me so many things... Love the texture being thin and rich, I use the celery tops for the extra bitterness that offsets the richness of the liver. My wife loves liver. I always buy a whole bird so she will get a liver. I eat everything else. It is so amazing how much meat is on the neck bone and makes the gravy so rich and flavorful. Love living where we usually get a fresh turkey never frozen. It is different."

"reviewBody": "Guys, this gravy is supposed to be thin, almost even nearly clear...this is classic giblet gravy not a roux gravy and it is usually for pouring over the turkey if it needs moisture and over good old fashioned cornbread stuffing. If you thicken it, that's to your liking but it changes the original recipe. Maybe it's an aquired taste but it is definitely supposed to be thin and chock full of chopped eggs. I grew up on this recipe and have loved being able to find it again since most gravies are thicker and start with a roux...thanks so much for helping!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe is delicious, thanks for posting it Mary48! If you can't get your gravy to thicken with the amount of cornstarch in the recipe, it's likely because you're not doing it right. :^) I always use cornstarch to thicken (I have a gluten intolerant child, but even before then I used it) because it doesn't lump nearly like flour tends to. The gravy needs to be just boiling, the cornstarch needs to be dissolved in a little water or milk and stirred into the boiling gravy. If you're used to thickening by starting with a roux it may take a couple tries to learn the technique, but it's actually much easier IMO."

We like thin gravy in our family, so I didn't end up adding all the cornstarch and milk, maybe about a quarter of it. I skipped the egg, because I have seen that at someone's house before, and was weirded out by the look of it floating in there. If I can ever bring myself to touch giblets again (ewww), I would definitely use this recipe."

I probably will try again but with half the liquid, chicken broth instead of water and more turkey drippings. I added fewer boiled eggs at the suggestion of others, but I wish I had added more. I was looking for something closer to my grandmother's recipe."

"reviewBody": "This is very similiar to my grandmother's recipe. We are a military family and don't often get to go home for the holidays, so when I found this recipe I thought it would be a great substitute for grandmother's gravy. I did make changes leaving out the celery and onion and milk. I used flour as opposed to cornstarch, and added some Emeril Turkey rub seasoning to the gravy. I am quite please with this stand in recipe. Regardless of whether you use cornstarch or flour as a thickening agent I find that it helps to pour the gravy into a seperate container, and then sprinkle the flour in the bottom of the sauce pan, and then pour about 2-3 Tablespoons of the gravy in the flour, and stir until it's smooth, and then pour the rest of the gravy in continue cooking until thick (obviously continue stirring it also.)"

My grandmother, who passed away two years ago, made giblet gravy when I was growing up and I wanted to do the same for my family but couldn't locate a recipe like hers until now. I love teaching my two girls, ages 4 and 10, to cook and this will be a recipe I will pass along to them. THANKS FOR THANKSGIVING MEMORIES OF YESTER YEAR AND THE ONES TO COME."

"reviewBody": "Very good. Tried last year. Similar to my Mom's recipe, except for the eggs, and I always add the turkey drippings. My family doesn't even know I've added the giblets to it because I learned to use a food processor to really mash them and then add it to the gravy. As this recipe had eggs which we are unacustomed to, I added 2 eggs to the giblets when using the food processor. It came out with a good texture and slighly different tast. I also use WONDRA brand flour to thicken the gravy , as I have found it rewards me with less lumps:)"

I was pretty sad when I first got finished with it because it was so thin (this was my first thanksgiving and I wanted it to be perfect!) but fortunately the turkey took longer than planned so the gravy cooked for longer than planned as well, and it turned out for the best! I like tons of flavor in my gravy though, and this was a bit lacking. It was good for my first try, but next time I'll try adding a bit more depth to it with seasonings and what not."

I am a package gravy gal and have never made gravy from scratch - I do cook quite a bit but gravy has always been something I left to someone else. This recipe was easy and very delicious. I did not chop up the giblets after they were cooked to put them back into the gravy however. I just made the broth from them. I did use more of the turkey drippings and less chicken broth - this turkey was very juicy and the drippings made the gravy richer than the chicken broth would have. This recipe is a keeper and I will definately make this gravy with every turkey. Thanks."
