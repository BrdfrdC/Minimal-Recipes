It's soft with a great outer crunch. We munched on the end pieces without any white chocolate, it doesn't need, but its definitely a pretty touch. I would like the spice to be kicked up a notch and possibly the molasses, but it's truly delicious. Also, to everyone SO confused about oils instead of butter, more often than not biscotti uses oil. My favorite recipe for biscotti actually calls for olive oil, if I'm not mistaken, this is originally how they were made.\n\nWell done!"

When I first got together with my husband I sent these and a few other biscotti to him. When they got there he told me he wouldn’t like these particular ones because he doesn’t like gingerbread and he doesn’t like white chocolate. Long story short, these are his absolute favorite and he asks for them throughout the year and they are required for Christmas every year."

"reviewBody": "READ THE COMMENTS BEFORE YOU MAKE THIS.\n\nI've been making biscotti (from my own recipe) for years. I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try someone elses recipe, and gingerbread biscotti sounded like fun. Here's my take on the recipe.\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n1) Use whatever flour you have available, it doesn't impact the taste all that much. I used 2 3/4c unbleached white and 1c oat flour.\n2) Oil vs butter is a matter of taste. But if you're using a salted butter, drop the added salt a bit to compensate.\n3) The dough should properly be described as sticky, not stiff. You'll need up to 1/2c more flour to get it to hold together, and more for your hands to pat it into shape.\n4) Needs 1/2-1t salt. Without salt, the flavors don't pop and there's no contrast.\n5) I cook with sorghum rather than with molasses. 1:1, just changes the taste a little.\n6) It may sound like a lot of spice, but the amounts listed don't overwhelm the cookie. Don't worry about exactness, and don't bother calculating what 1 1/2 T is. Just eyeball it. You'll never taste the difference.\n7) I added 1t of ground black pepper (Tellicherry, FWIW). Black pepper is underused in baking IMHO.\n\nTEMP &amp; TIMING\n\n8) The temperature listed is way too hot. Preheat your oven to 325°, bake the loaves for the same 25 minutes, then let cool. \n9) Slice the loaves, put the slices back into the oven for 10 minutes per side at the same 325°. Stand them up on the baking pans to cool and dry.\n\nWould I make this recipe again? No. The tast"

"reviewBody": "I have to wonder if the spice measurements were correct, as some of them were listed in tablespoons. Half a tablespoon or 3/4 tablespoon seems awkward. Did they mean teaspoons? Anyway, I made these with a gluten free flour blend, sub cup for cup, but added an extra 1/4 teaspoon of xanthan gum to help cohesion. I subbed gluten free oats for the whole wheat flour. Dough was extremely sticky, even after adding extra flour. I cut the slices thicker, about 3/4\", to avoid crumbling. On the second baking, I had to do at least ten minutes per side. Flavor was good, but very heavy on cloves. Half a tablespoon of cloves is too much. I made a simple glaze of lemon juice and confectioners sugar to finish them."

If the clone is too much for some people just cut back and add more ginger. I wouldn't change a thing though! This was just a trial run, and I want to make some for Christmas gifts this year.

It enhanced the biscotti perfectly. The biscotti was perfect as far as texture and flavor. I made the original recipe as is and was able to make about 2 dozen. Not sure how 4 dozen is possible unless you double the original servings. Either way, I will make again eapecially in December."

"reviewBody": "I also used 1/3 cup of salted butter instead of oil, and I cut it into the dry ingredients, minus the sugar, then mixed the sugar with the wet ingredients and added the wet and dry together. I was a bit skeptical of how crumbly the dough seemed, but just as many other reviewers have said, it firmed up significantly on baking. One thing I did to help with forming the loaves since it was so crumbly was put a sheet of parchment paper on the cookie sheet, then dumped half the mixture on and formed it into a loaf, then did the same with the other half and baked them on the parchment paper on the cookie sheet. I don't think I could have made loaves and then moved them onto the sheet, but doing it this way worked really well. I also baked them the first time for 30 minutes, which seemed to be just right, as they seemed too soft at 25 minutes. I made a confectioner's sugar glaze to drizzle, and am loving them!"

"reviewBody": "Like other reviewers, I added 1/4 t. each salt and pepper, and 1/2 t. baking soda. I upped the spices, added cardamom (just because I like it) used all AP flour and went 1/2 and 1/2 brown sugar and white sugar. Then I folded in 1/3 c. finely chopped candied ginger. Handled the dough as little as possible, dividing it in half early in the mixing and adding 1/3 c. raisins to one half, because DH is a raisin freak. Raisins work, but are not needed, and they make slicing more challenging. Result is pretty, sliced well, and has a decent level of spiciness. Still, mine is not as crispy as other reviewers thought, and I need to up the spices still more - mostly black pepper, I think, and some fresh grated ginger, too. Dough was dry enough to handle that much extra moisture."

Next time I would switch out the oil for butter (prefer it in my biscotti) and add a bit of cream of tarter for the slight bitterness and definitely another 1/4 cup sugar. True Italian Biscotti never uses butter only oil, but we prefer it done with butter. Happy cooking to all!"

Dipped in milk or coffee, they taste like Christmas.\r\n\r\nHowever, mine didn't turn out crispy; they're more dense and a bit chewey. I have another biscotte recipe that calls for doing an initial bake at a lower tempt for longer, and I may try that next time to see if I get a more biscotti-like texture.\r\n\r\nAnd a warning: These really spread out during baking. It's not a negative of the recipe, but I wish I had known that in advance because I would have made my logs narrower."

I didn't follow directions and made into one log due to the fact that I wanted long biscotti. My own error was not baking longer because part of it was undercooked. Not so bad when you have to bake two more times but it made it harder to cut without chunks coming out and still maintain a nice looking cookie but that was my error. The reason for the 4 stars is because it needs more spices. It was a pretty bland gingerbread and needed more of a kick. Would make again with more spices."

Once I had the dough sperated and each rolled out I brushed lightly with vegetable oil and sprinkled with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar in the raw onboth sides. I baked each according to directions, the let them cool--just to the touch-and sliced them with a pizza cutter! (The pizza cutter works great for this!). I then baked them for 7 minutes on each side to make them have the crunchy texture I love. They turned out do beautifully they looked professional! Next time I may go to the extra effort and dip then either dark or white chocolate. Should be delish!"
