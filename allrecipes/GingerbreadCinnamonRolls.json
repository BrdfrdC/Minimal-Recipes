"reviewBody": "I am a fairly confident baker and was excited to try this recipe as I do not have a good go to for cinnamon rolls. Unfortunately this recipe seems like some thing is missing from the ingredients list and possibly some steps were left out. I think it needs more liquid over all and I tried twice to get the yeast to activate. On my second attempt it was looking promising so I moved on to add the dry ingredients and mix those together. I followed the steps but at the end of the mixing I had a very tough dough blob that did not rise and was super heavy and that beat up my kitchen aid. In the end I had to throw it away. I will keep searching for a good cinnamon roll recipe."
