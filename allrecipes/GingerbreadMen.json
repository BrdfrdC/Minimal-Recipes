"reviewBody": "Okay please listen up all of you avid bakers out there! I‚Äôve eaten all types of gingerbread cookies, and these are absolutely the best! I was all over the Internet, trying to find the best recipe (and preferably one without molasses so I didn‚Äôt waste the rest of the jar) to make to give as gifts for Christmas, and this one is definitely it! Now, after reading some reviews online, I found that the best way to modify this recipe was to also increase the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp and add 1/2 tsp cloves and 1/4 tsp nutmeg (per batch). They rolled out like a dream and were SO good, even before we iced them. This recipe will become one of my annual Christmas cookie recipes! A double batch made 32 cookies! I also made them in a Wilson form pan which made them easier and I didn‚Äôt have to roll out (my preferred way from now on) they don‚Äôt spread in a pre formed pan and we‚Äôre chewy and delicious! I‚Äôm leaving this comment so others can feel safe in using their expensive ingredients and not worry that they‚Äôre going to waste them. I promise you won‚Äôt be disappointed, if you follow these instructions! They tasted magical! üéâüòä"

"reviewBody": "I have been making these cookies over 20 years. I recently misplaced my hard copy and had to look online to try and find it, as I could not remember all the measurements. This is the one!!! ( although I use more cinnamon). I did read through many reviews and thought I could try to address some concerns I read as well....\n1- Dough to sticky? Add some flour. Its not supposed to stick to the countertop. \n2- Do you make the pudding ahead if time? No, just dump the box in with the dry ingredients. \n3- Does this taste like butterscotch? No, not at all! \n4- Does this taste like traditional gingerbread? Um, no. ( better, IMO) \n\nAnd some helpful hints: Roll your dough thick ( just over 1/4 inch) for softer cookies and no crunchy hands and feet.\nI live in Denver. I use the shorter end of the baking time."

Don‚Äôt worry it comes together after refrigerating and kneading. I rolled them out between two pieces of parchment paper, no need for flour. Then popped them in the freezer for a few minutes before baking to help them keep their shape. They hardly spread at all. Very mild gingerbread flavor. I would actually add more spices next time."

The dough was easy to work with, but I was rather disappointed with the taste. I prefer a very traditional gingerbread flavor, and these just seemed bland. My daughter loved them, though. I also baked them for 8-10 minutes rather than 10-12 to prevent the edges from burning."

I added a simple royal icing after to add a little more sweetness but honestly they are great as is. Followed the recipe exactly but baked for 8 minutes. I think the full time definitely would‚Äôve burnt them. The dough seems dry after first taking from the fridge just let it rest at room temperature for about five minutes and it‚Äôs good to go. I also split my dough in three batches leaving the batch I wasn‚Äôt using refrigerated because it does get very soft fast."

"reviewBody": "I had to make some sturdy cutter cookies of 3 types that would not all break apart when I flew on a plane to Kansas. Theme was related to Wizard of Oz, so I found cutters and searched for a few good recipes. \n\nThis one became the flying monkeys. \n\nI added some Fireball whiskey and extra seasonal spices. It seems that it was a bit more moist then the original recipe described. So even though I froze them before cooking they spread out a bit. It did not matter. Because fatter monkeys fly better! LOL!\n\nResult was a few broke but not badly, legs are thinner. I used broken pieces for tasting for the silent auction. Total brought in forty dollars to a non profit for the late deafened. This is totally worth trying again."

"reviewBody": "I accidentally added nearly twice the amount of cinnamon and ginger but it turned out really good, so I will continue to make the recipe with the additional amounts. I'm glad I read the previous reviews and knew the dough doesn't ball together. The dough was very crumbly (I used my kitchenmaid mixer) but I followed others suggestions and just packed it together into a ball. Once I smooshed it all up, it stayed together. Rolled out very nice, hardly needed any flour on my table or rolling pin. The first batch was slightly too brown, so I reduced the time in the oven to 9 minutes and they are perfect. Will definitely make again."

"reviewBody": "These turned out fantastic.\n\nSince I am not from America I couldn't get my hands on butterscotch pudding mix, so instead I got vanilla and decided to add the butterscotch flavour with a butterscotch cream alcohol, adding a touch more flour to maintain the correct consistency. I also used nutmeg instead of cinnamon as I prefer it, and the cookies turned out great.\n\nI will definitely be using this recipe again with my previous changes and probably doubling or even tripling the amounts as the batch makes only a few decent sized cookies and not quite enough for a group of adults together or a self-admitted sugar lover, I think the amount goes well if it is just yourself and possibly some small children snacking on them though.\n\nI think a frosting using the butterscotch alcohol and regular vanilla frosting mix would do wonders on these too, with maybe a touch of nutmeg."

"reviewBody": "I wanted to make a simple gingerbread that I could add to my holiday cookies (I never cared for gingerbread when I was a kid but I wanted to try them again) and I am so glad I found this! Once I told people that these were a softer cookie, they were a complete hit. I made DOZENS of them for everyone! I took them to a cookie exchange at my job and my coworkers referred to them as \"ginger crack\" because they were SO good! :) I do have a few suggestions: First, watch the video on here. Use dark brown sugar. Don't over mix your dough or it will make your cookies tough! Chill your dough until it is very firm, and keep it in the fridge between batches. Role your dough out between sheets of wax paper sprinkled with flour (again - don't over mix when you collect your extra dough after cutting). Finally, use parchment paper instead of spraying your pan to make clean up a breeze! Enjoy!"

I cooled the dough but it was still sticky, but I used enough flour under the dough and on top while using cookie cutters so it worked fine for me. \n\nMy kids found it too sticky to work with even with the flour, so they did another cookie dough, but I'm really good at working with sticky dough so I had no problem with it. I will use this again next year!"

It rolled nice after I got it out of the fridge and worked the dough a little bit. I was able to get a good number of cookies out of one batch. This was my first test batch and they were so good that I am using this for an upcoming cookie exchange. It isn't straight up gingerbread tasting but that is probably better since some people don't gingerbread."
