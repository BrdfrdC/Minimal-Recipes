"reviewBody": "I added in a little freshly grated ginger giving the cookies a wonderful ginger flavor. I made half the recipe, using a whole egg therefore the batter was softer than usual and I didn’t roll them in the sugar mixture, simply used my cookie scoop, place them on the cookie sheet and sprinkled with sugar. The sugar pretty much dissolved during the baking process so I sprinkled them with some raw sugar in the end. If you like a soft ginger cookie, you should like this recipe."
