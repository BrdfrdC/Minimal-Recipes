They are perfectly bite-sized that way, too! The only problem I had, which could have been my mistake, not the recipe's, was that the cookies had somewhat of a salty aftertaste. Otherwise, these cookies are phenomenal. I glazed them with the Vanilla Glaze recipe on this site. I will definitely be making these again!"

I was looking for a ginger *snap* cookie. I gave 3 stars because my son likes the flavor. He too, thinks they're too soft, even after trying to over bake them."
