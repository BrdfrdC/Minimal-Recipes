I did add a little bit of sugar to the sliced strawberries ahead of time, to allow the strawberries to release their juices. I dusted each donut shortcake with powdered sugar over top. I think it would also be great drizzled with chocolate sauce. Thank you for the different idea!"

It leaves you wondering why you'd eat a glazed doughnut any other way! And while it's not for those counting calories - it's OK to indulge once in a while (at least you can say you got a serving of fruit LOL). I did drizzle these with a little chocolate sauce to take them over the top but they're fabulous as is - everyone loved these. This quick and easy recipe is a definite keeper. Thanks voraciousgirl! (my husband thanks you too!)"

The glazed is definitely the way to go. It is perfect with the tartness of the strawberries. I made a few other changes as well. I sprinkle sugar on my strawberries and let them 'marinate' in the fridge for a few hours to get nice and juicy. I also made my whipped cream in my isi instead of whipping in a bowl. I added a couple more teaspoons of vanilla to give it an extra yummy flavour."
