I multiplied the recipe, cut back a-bit on the oranges and added some of my own other spices! The taste was incredible.

It takes me back to the Weinachtsmarkt in Deutschland and is a huge hit at parties, with family on Christmas and great for New Years too! I make it in a typical pot on the stove and once the wine is added and heated, I strain it into a crockpot to keep warm. I use a Merlot from Gnarly Head. It tastes great and makes you feel so warm and fuzzy."

Id change very little but found two cinnamon sticks were nice, a little less sugar and a little more water or replace the extra water with orange juice and it'd be perfect. After cutting the orange in half, put the cloves in the orange halves before squeezing the orange as it becomes much harder to put the cloves in when it's already squeezed."

For the red wine: I used a red blend (Llano signature red: Cab sav, merlot, malbec). I thought this was way too sweet. Also, I had mini mandarins, so I used 1.5 of those instead of 1 orange. In my tasting, I thought some almond would be a nice addition. I added a touch of amaretto to the mug, it tasted good. When I make again, I would use 6 tbsp brown sugar and almond slivers, or 4 tbsp brown sugar + 2 tbsp amaretto."

It was not at all like the spiced wine I had at a German restaurant, but I added honey to make it taste okay. I want to make it again with wine I like, because it was the merlot itself that did not taste good. I hoped the spices would fix that, but it didn't."

But that can be easily rectified by making the sugar syrup as in step 1, setting half of it aside, then continue with the recipe as written. When finished, add more of the reserved sugar syrup (or not) to taste. Forget Christmas, this is wonderful all year long! Oh, and to give this a Swedish twist, serve with raisins and/or slivered almonds in the mug. Absolutely divine."

I didn't use sugar, but rather six packets of Splenda. I realized this was about 2/3 the sweetness that I would have gotten using the amount of sugar in the recipe, but I figured I could add more later, if need be. (6 packets were just right.) I did strain the glühwein before serving and then just put it back in the pot and set it on the kosher setting on the stove. After all, I didn't want the alcohol to cook off."
