"reviewBody": "I love this fruitcake! I did make some small substitutions for our personal eating plan but followed the recipe and it turned out amazing, and it’s my first ever fruitcake! To make it booze-free, one of my substitutions was to swap maple syrup for the rum and it worked out very well. \n\nStep 6 seems to be missing an ending however. I didn’t see an instruction on where the fruit was supposed to go so I just dumped it all in. Tasted great, but that might need clarification. \n\nEither way, this is now my Christmas Fruitcake! Plan on making (at least) one every year. \nThanks Buckwheat Queen - long time fan!"

"reviewBody": "AMAZING!!!! Is the quick review. I have a gluten allergy so I am always seeking out gluten-free recipes. I also love fruitcake...the only one in the family who does...so this is mine all mine! I have made this twice in the past month. I spent a half a day going around town to find all the ingredients. It is all a bit pricey but so worth it. Here are a couple of changes that I made when making it. I had a tough time finding cherry liqueur. Finally found it, opened it and took a sip and I didn’t like it at all.....so I used spiced rum to brush on the cake when it comes out of the oven. I over cooked it the first time and it was a bit dry. I got an oven thermometer to use for the second bake. It turns out my oven was 5 degrees too hot so I turned down the temperature for the second bake. When I went to bake the cake I didn’t have an orange but I had a Meyer lemon on hand so I used the juice and zest from that instead. I was afraid it would be too sour with the lemon so I added a couple tablespoons of orange liqueur. The second time I made it, it was done in one hour except the top wasn’t brown so I turned the broiler on high and browned the top (only took a couple of minutes). It is perfect....and delicious. Thanks to the chef who posted this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I have been craving fruit cake for a long time and decided this recipe sounded good even though there were only 2 reviews posted. Just had my first slice of \"heaven\" - it is moist and delicious and I would definitely make this particular recipe again. The only thing I did different was to change up the dates and add currants and prune slices and the candied fruit mix was 1/8 plus another 1/8 sliced graced cherries. I brushed the finished product with grand marnier."
