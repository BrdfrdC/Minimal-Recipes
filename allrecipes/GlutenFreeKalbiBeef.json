"reviewBody": "This was really good! It reminded me of Bulgogi. It was a little bit too sweet in my opinion so I'll reduce the sugar next time. I did make one change. Red pepper flakes have been giving me some issues lately but I still wanted the heat so I used Sriracha. The green onions and sesame seeds get left behind in the bag which disappointed me at first but the flavor is in the meat so it is all good. Great recipe!"
