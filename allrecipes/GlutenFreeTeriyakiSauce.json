The recipe with the added brown sugar and chopped garlic came out really good. The next time I make it, I will add corn starch that was also recommended by someone else."

I would also suggest adding a garlic clove instead of powdered and a chunk of fresh ginger. This recipe works exceptionally well with coconut aminos instead of tamari sauce. Keep this recipe in your kitchen pantry collection. You'll be very happy with the versatility. Thank you for sharing."
