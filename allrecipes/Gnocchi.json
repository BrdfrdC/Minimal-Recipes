Mine came out great after following the tips in the comments (eg don't add all the flour at once, only add enough flour to form a dough that you can handle). I think my dough was a bit wet still because it was difficult to shape the pillows so I followed another recommendation which was to use a plastic bag with the corner cut off to make the pillows. I cooked them in batches and they came out light and fluffy and delicious (I seasoned with salt and a bit of herbs)."

"reviewBody": "Hello all, so two-theee things, first is bake your potatoes in the oven, yes it takes longer but your potatoes stay dry which means you can use less flour. A food mill is the best bet for getting nice pillow like gnocchi . When boiling your gnocchi make sure it’s a rolling boil, remove after they float and immediately into a ice bath, once cool dry on tri folds towels or a microfiber towel. I prefer egg yolks to whole eggs but to each their own. I make 40# of potatoes of gnocchi Tuesday through Sunday. A pastry bag and a scissors work well for consistency and ease."

"reviewBody": "The only reason this didn't get five stars from me was because it didn't work as written (I should have read the reviews first for tips, as I usually do). \n\nI cooked the two potatoes in my pressure cooker, riced them, and added one cup of the riced potatoes to my stand mixer, with an egg and two cups of flour as the recipe called for, using my dough hook to knead. The dough was far too dry and crumbly, and I was worried that adding another egg would make it too wet. I ended up adding three tablespoons of water, one at a time. That was getting it close to the desired consistency. I wondered if a teeny bit of olive oil would help, so I added a teaspoon. Within seconds, the dough was perfect. I rolled each rope lightly in flour so I could feed it through my cavatelli maker without the finished pieces sticking, and it was perfection."

"reviewBody": "First time trying gnocchi and I think the effort could use some refining because they were on the chewier, denser side. I prefer my gnocchi pillowy and soft. The (russet) potatoes were maybe a bit larger than average and took longer to cook. Even at 20 minutes, when I stopped boiling, they didn’t mash too easily, so I think the larger potatoes will generally take about 25 minutes. I also probably made the gnocchi a bit too big, maybe around an inch rather than a half inch. If I tried this recipe again, I would also probably use 1 or 1.5 cups flour rather than 2.Served this with a brown butter sage sauce, which was nice."

I started kneading by hand and it was very difficult until I used a mechanical mixer w/ a dough hook but after that it was great! The pasta came out soft and yummy. Couldn’t have asked for a better first gnocchi recipe! Will be making it again!"

"reviewBody": "I loved this gnocchi recipe. It simplifies the recipe instead of adding a sauce filling to the gnocchi, incorporating the potatoes into the pasta. I added some basic savory spices (thyme, basil, salt, pepper, pinch of garlic powder) to the pasta as well to add some extra flavor. My dough was a little dry, so I added an a couple tablespoons of water, which made the dough more pliable. I also pan-seared the gnocchi after boiling it until there was about of brown crust on the outside. I seared the gnocchi in olive oil, butter, and basic savory spices adding extra flavor. I wanted to preserve the flavor, so I just tossed my pasta in Parmesan cheese."

"reviewBody": "Simple recipe to follow. A couple of things here though, 2 potatoes is pretty vague since potatoes greatly vary in sizes. You may have to pay with the amount of flour because of that. Also, if you bake the potatoes, they give you a much drier potato and will result in a lighter end product. I also like to use a potato ricer while the potatoes are still warm to ensure even texture. These are great though! My first batch was really misshapen so I bought a gnocchi paddle for $5 and then next time they were perfect. Definitely a must try if you like gnocchi! Nothing beats homemade."

"reviewBody": "The perfect recipe!!! Super easy to follow as well. Main thing to watch for is that your potatoes are cooked all the way If you can stick a knife through them easily they’re done! . After mashing them if they seem a little dry try adding the tiniest bit of water that in turn keeps your dough from being dry and crumbly. Also knead the heck out of the dough until smooth and springy . \n\nI also cut my gnocchis smaller. The ones shown were too big for my taste and it made it easier to roll them out on a fork ."

"reviewBody": "This is the second time I have made gnocchi. First time was crazy! So I read a lot of reviews this time. I found a lot of the reviews talk about the moisture in potatoes. So I boiled the potatoes in large pieces some whole. I tried to have potatoes about same size and did not over cook. Took them off when they were soft not mushy.Once done I ran potatoes under cold water. I used a ricer. I added an egg to potatoes and added flour a little at a time and worked it in with my hand.It is such a great feeling when you get to the right constancy. Took a handful of dough rolled so it looked like a snake and cut in pieces. Wasn’t sure some people saying roll on fork. No idea what they are talking about. Next time I will try to be more consistent with the size use a fork and press down on rolls and the pieces the same size. Like recipe boiled dough until it went to top. I had taken olive oil and fried garlic and a bit of onions. Put gnocchi in frying pan for a few minutes I used fine herbs. Delicious!"

This was one of my favorites she served and she usually only made them when her friend who was a Priest in the Vatican would visit once a year! We are a large family and I now know how much work that was and it was always an endless bowl of gnocchi. Blessed to add I now have her big pasta bowl. It takes practice so don’t give up if your first few tries aren’t perfect!"

I served the Gnocchi with jalapeño applewood bacon, sautéed asparagus all in a light garlic sauce. \nA few days later, I tried the same recipe for chicken and dumplings. The only thing I did differently was I rolled the pasta in quarter to half-inch thickness. Using a pizza cutter, I cut the pasta in two-inch strips then boiled these strips in homemade chicken broth. We absolutely loved it!"

If you add maybe an extra ounce of flour you can also achieve a nice fairly fluffy gnocchi. I find unbleached organic flour works really well for these as well."
