This one is a keeper. It’s fast and easy, especially when you feel like ugh and need something filling but low key, cause you ain't going out for 10 days . Ugh. And my husband , a picky italian, loved it. A winner as is. Thank you from my covid hazed brain for this flavorful filling easy recipe. See ya on the other side and stay healthy."

"reviewBody": "MY NOTE: I have made a similar dish a number of times, it's easy, quick and delish. These are my few modifications: For extra taste I used freshly ground mixed peppercorn, and didn't use much salt. I sautéed crushed garlic, finely mince onion, 1/2 tsp. mixed Italian dry leaves herbs, dash of dried red pepper, and sliced mushroom all added while sautéed the chicken. Used good quality jarred pesto. For the sauce, also I used dry white wine au lieu of chicken broth. Follows the recipe and garnished the dish with a combination of crushed garlic, chifonnee fresh basil, fresh minced parsley all from my garden. It turned out flavorful and fabulous! Family and friends asked for the recipe."

I needed to use about 1/3 cup chicken broth. And, I finished the sauce off by mixing in about one tablespoon of cream. Definitely making this again."

"reviewBody": "I admit I made some changes but not really changing the basic flavor profile. First, I only used 1/2 the jar of pesto because the Barilla brand I had was *really* salty. It turned out just right. Second, I didn't have mozzarella balls, so I used a pre-shredded Italian cheese blend that included mozzarella, parmesan, and asiago. Mixed the chicken and gnocchi as described, mixed in the cheese. Then I transferred to a casserole dish, topped with a little more of the shredded cheese and a sprinkling of Parmesan. Broiled it until the top was golden. Perfect!"

"reviewBody": "This dish was very simple to make - thank you for sharing the recipe! We found ours to be very, very salty. Before adding salt to season chicken and cook gnocci, you would be well-served to check the salt content on your pesto jar. I used Trader Joe's pesto and I went to look at the salt content when our dish turned out so salty - it has 840mg (35%) of salt! I looked at another jar of pesto I had in the pantry and it only contains 310mg (13%) salt. Had I used the other brand, I'm sure this dish would have been simple and great!"

Otherwise, the recipe was the as is. I'm not sure if it matters, but all of the ingredients were purchased at a gourmet supermarket. There is a difference in taste when in comes to the meat. Will be making again!"
