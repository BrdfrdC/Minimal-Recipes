Since i do not care for the way parmesan melts, i did not add it into the sauce mix but rather grated it off the block right on top of the pasta. This will become a regular go to for me.

It got nice and crispy in the butter. There is no substitution for fresh herbs! My gnocchi was a bit starchy and stuck together but I may have used too small a pot to boil them in. Great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Thanks for excellent recipe. Used 2 tsp fresh sage because that was what I had and since I was 2 tbsp short of Parmesan, I added some fresh grated Asagio cheese at the end. It worked well, but will definaly try it with just Parmesan next time. We also thought we will try adding prawns and/or chicken for a meal rather than a side."

Because I really really loved it!\" Which I think is a pretty stellar review :) My 2 and 4 year old were unimpressed (but I don't think they even tried it), but my husband and I also liked it. I didn't have two packages of gnocchi so I just made the sauce according to directions and put it with my one package - I definitely think that spreading the sauce over two packages would have been better. This was our first time trying gnocchi and I think it was a success, we'll definitely be trying it again!"

To make it heartier, I cooked several chicken tenders in a skillet (just olive oil, salt and pepper) and removed them from the pan when done. When the gnocchi was done boiling (only about a minute and a half) I drained it then tossed it into the pan the chicken had been in and sautÃ©ed it for a minute or so- toasts the gnocchi nicely and gives it more flavor. Then the gnocchi and diced chicken all went into the butter sauce together. Wonderful light meal!"

I had to use up some dried *gnocchi* type pasta thing hubby brought home (really, just gnocchi shaped pasta), so we didn't get the real gnocchi experience, but we liked them with the sauce. For those saying there wasn't much flavor, I made my sauce (half recipe) early in the morning (goodness knows it's simple enough) and it sat most the day so the seasoning really had a chance to do its thing. Will make again."
