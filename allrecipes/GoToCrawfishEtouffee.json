Be sure and include the juice when adding the crawfish tails. I also use chives instead of green onion. But MOST importantly, I use 4 small bay leaves while cooking!"

However, I got a craving for crawfish enchiladas last night, and decided to make this as the filling because it quicker and easier than it's mor authentic counterpart. I was pleasantly surprised! My fiance never knew I made a \"shortcut\" recipe, and I could barely tell a difference! BONUS: Etouffee is something I never would have thought could be a good thing to make in a pinch, but it was ready in 30 minutes and is a good meal on it's own! If I'm looking to impress etouffee connoisseurs, I probably wouldn't make it, but this will be a regular thing in my house if I need a fast etouffee dinner (and I'm always in the mood for etouffee!)"

It was fabulous, easy and quick. I made some minor adjustments but it turned out great. Used frozen chopped veggies instead of fresh, added garlic (always), extra soup and thinned with heavy whipping cream to stretch the recipe, shrimp I quick defrosted while everything else was cooking, drained ro-tel, variety of Cajun seasonings to taste and did not have parsley or green onion at the time. This will be in our weeknight rotation, for sure!"

I always peel and freeze them. Then I found your recipe, Yay! This recipe has worked great for a quickie meal. I have used Cream of mushroom and Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic (only because I had them in pantry) and both have been awesome. Tonight I added some Mexican Velveeta and served over Angel Hair Pasta. Itâ€™s all good, hubby loves it! Thanks again!"

I put on a squeeze of lemon and some Crystal hot sauce before digging in!"

I used a frozen bag of mirepoix for the veggies and skipped the parsley since I didn't have any on hand (dried or fresh). \n\nThen, I had two extra for dinner show up that I wasn't prepared for. So I added another can of the soup and thinned it out some with some heavy whipping cream so it would feed 3 normal people and 3 teenage football players after practice. The d-linemen gave it a A+."

I've noticed that more often than not, you can only find crawfish tails in 12oz packages now, so I tried it with two (24oz total), and it worked out fine - and saved a bunch of money too as I found them on sale. The pic I have posted was this batch. Also note - the recipe calls for Golden Mushroom soup (not Cream of...) - the Golden has no cream in it and is very different from cream soups."
