"reviewBody": "This was my maiden voyage with stuffed cabbage and I took counsel from friends, family and experts. Used this recipe with changes. I used meatball mix (beef, pork,veal) and also added sautéed green peppers and celery and lots of parsley to the meat mix. I sautéed in oil, not butter. I also used Savoy cabbage because I think it’s prettier. Added green apple and pork chops (thin boneless) on top of cabbage before tomato mix. I used the tomato mix from this recipe and liked it but I would use stewed tomatoes next time (personal preference)"

It’s hand written, AND, since tomato soup has only been marketed for 101 years, it has NO soup in the recipe. Mine, &amp; the dozen other “antique” recipes I have, show a variation of crushed whole tomatoes, sliced or stewed tomatoes (my grandmother has a fantastic antique recipe for stewed tomatoes!!!), and tomato sauce, plus spices such as marjoram, thyme, bay, &amp; always in tomato dishes, two walnut shell haves of white sugar. I’m trying this tonight, as shown, plus some more with a jar of crushed stewed tomatoes in with the soup, because I personally like the chunks &amp; juice like sauce, over the top. I’ll re-post my results tomorrow."

The combination cooked down nicely to not only be thick, but also had exactly the right amount of \"bite,\" presumably from the vinegar in the Ketchup. The only changes I made were:\n- added an egg to help bind it\n- used approx 1/2 teaspoon Garlic Powder (instead of Garlic Cloves)\n- added 1/2 teaspoon Paprika\n- and I seasoned the water right before adding the rice (a little butter, salt and pepper, of course, but also some Paprika and Parsley).\n\nI will definitely make this again. I absolutely loved it! :-)"

The only difference was I added 2 TB of Worcheshire (sp) sauce because I have always put in my cabbage rolls. We also used Jimmy Dean sausage instead of just ground pork and it gave it an extra little kick. I'm sure it would be great without doing these two things so I gave it a 5 stars. Great tasting."

Melt in the pan, and mix with small amount of garlic and butter and onion. I add a can of tomato sauce. Mix together and then pour over stuffed cabbage. It is also a good idea to mix some of the melted salt pork into the meat. By the way, I only use ground pork, no ground beef. Its more tender and flavorful."
