I added more milk till it was the correct consistency -- I wound up using around 2C of milk, NOT 1 1/4. I also added an extra tablespoon of sugar to cover the baking powder taste. That made the batter taste just like box mix. With the tweaks, the pancakes turned out great."

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe several times, and I see people being really critical, so here are some pieces of advice: 1- do not mix TOO MUCH, it definitely is not a recipe for a hand or stand mixer. You are going to fold the ingredients gently. The amount of baking powder can create gluten faster and you will have tostinos instead of fluffy pancakes if you mix too much. 2- use all the ingredients at room temperature, otherwise, they will not mix properly 3- add the baking powder when everything is already mixed. The baking powder could be combined with all dried ingredients, but it is risky if you don't do it properly. It is safer to add it when all the other ingredients are mixed. 4- Do not press the pancake against the riddle. Never add vanilla to a pancake recipe, that is a crime. The pancake gods are watching you. Just don't. It feels like what I am saying is too obvious, but sometimes those reviewers need pancake 101. Just follow the recipe and you will get it right. People can't cook or bake and they just want to be hateful on the internet."

You shouldn't need more than 1 to 1 and a half tsp for this recipe! Way too much milk as well. The whole thing is wrong. I added vanilla, more sugar, more flour, and it still barely tasted alright with lots of syrup! By the time you get it right it's not even the same recipe."

I don’t know how this has so many positive reviews, bots? You can semi save this by adding 1/2 more flour, a 1/2 tablespoon of sugar and 1.5 teaspoons on vanilla. I will add I am an avid baker. I followed this exactly and it was truly disgusting. I should have read the other negative reviews first."

While cooking my first batch, I noticed the batter drying up and not as creamy as it should be. No flavor so I added vanilla it was a little better. I made them mini sized for kids, and they ended up looking like English muffins. If this recipe is old, it's gotta be from like the 1800s before flavor or gas stoves. They don't look cooked all way either."

I also always add flavored coffee creamer (I replaced the 1/4 c. Of milk with the Cramer. So 1c milk and 1/4 creamer. I added cinnamon as well. And green food coloring for my kiddos since it was St. Patrick's day. Tweak to your liking and they will be good."

I used self-rising flour (+2 Tbs baking powder and no additional salt because of the self-rising flour) and swerve granulated sweetener instead of sugar. I blended small portions of batter with a variety of flavors; sugar free peppermint patty coffee syrup, sugar free chocolate Hershey syrup, and strawberry syrup. As I cooked the pancakes, I poured equal parts flavored batter and plain batter. Then I got really fancy and poured the mint patty and chocolate batter together. That was the BEST!"

My usual recipe that I couldn't use because I was out of vinegar, takes one teaspoon of baking powder. This was 3 1/2??? It had to of been the baking powder. Why so much. I added vanilla, like I do every time, and had to dump it all. It was expensive vanilla lol. Lesson learned. Excessive amounts of baking powder in a recipe means stay away."

"reviewBody": "They were great. Everyone saying cold milk in melted butter is a bad idea or bad advice, you are wrong! Stir it fast when you pour in the cold milk and it makes little pieces of solid butter throughout. That makes the pancakes nice and fluffy and tender when you cook them. The moisture in the cold butter evaporates and puffs up! So the person that said they use oil instead of butter then get thin pancakes: it’s either because you changed the butter out and are missing out on that puffing up action. Or your baking powder is old. or you accidentally used baking soda instead of powder. Added tsp of vanilla otherwise followed recipe"

We tried multiple recipes but this one always wins out. My mother in-law loves it so much she saves any left over and eats them throughout the week! Thank you for posting!"

However, to reduce sodium or to have a less exuberant pancake, reduce amount of baking powder. With full dose of baking powder, these could be made in cooking rings and be served as very quick bread with meal. Next time I will add cinnamon for its health benefits."

Not very sweet but I added chocolate chips so it balanced out though clearly I still need to work on my pancake art :) Used slightly less baking powder (the package said 10 grams and probably should have used at least 14 grams), but more from laziness and it was fine! Guessed salt amount and stirred enough to mix together but left the clumps."

Found it was still not a fluffy pancake but tried it while cooking. The pancake was good but missing something. Added half a cap of generic vanilla extract. Turned out to be a little bit better. Rating: 42/100 for original 60/100 for my first edit 68/100 for adding the vanilla ^My opinion though^ 1-35/100 - wouldn't eat 36-55/100 - eat but despise 56-69/100- eat and enjoy 70-89/100 - love 90-100/100 - would probably marry if a real person My mom also likes it! She likes the vanilla added one more."

I think you will be really happy to know that I put in a bit of cocoa powder and the pancakes turned out a nice dark pink and it had the aroma and taste of a hint of chocolate. I've used your recipe last week and followed exactly how you made your lovely pancakes and this week I tried substituting with CAKE FLOUR..omg it is even fluffier than all-purpose. Thank you for sharing this and it will become the way I make pancakes in the future. Bless!"

"reviewBody": "This is the pancake recipe my daughter always begs me to make. Like many reviewers, I add vanilla. I also add a bit more milk than is called for to thin them out a bit (don’t worry, they’re still huge and fluffy!). My “secret” ingredient is also adding a splash of chocolate extract. It really makes the vanilla flavor pop! Sometimes we will also add other additions, but this is how I make my standard recipe. I don’t measure my extracts, but if I had to guesstimate, I’d say I use about a teaspoon or a teaspoon and a half of vanilla extract and a half teaspoon or so of chocolate extract. To the people saying they didn’t like the baking powder part: make sure you’re reading the measurement correctly (if you get distracted and lose count of the three teaspoons like I tend to do, just use one tablespoon, it’s the same, and then do a pinch more) and make sure you’re whisking all the dry ingredients together first before mixing in the wet ingredients so you don’t get baking powder clumping together. I just use a fork to sift everything together. Hope this helps!"
