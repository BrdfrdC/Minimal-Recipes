"reviewBody": "I have made this numerous times now although usually for two people so I adjust the quantities. I don't typically change a thing otherwise although it is a salad so easy to swap an item or two or throw in an extra. I don't think it needs it. What I like about it is that it is so quick to prepare and that it isn't full of lettuce or kale of spinach or any other leaf like most salads available in the grocery store. You don't feel like a rabbit eating this one."

I also served the olives on the side because 1/2 of our kiddos don't like kalamata olives (weird, I know) thanks for a quick and easy yet tasty recipe."

The adjustments I made were to add a small amount of red and yellow peppers, I cut the amount of lemon juice a little and added a little red wine vinegar, and I used Greek Seasoning (that's what it's called) instead of pepper. \n\nI couldn't wait to eat it but I'll bet it's better on day two."

It was very flavorful. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because mine got super watery. I brought it to a BBQ and it was like soup on the bottom when I got there. Not sure what I did wrong. I will try this again for sure!"

Also red peppers are always better than green peppers. Greek or Italian dressing made with real extra virgin olive oil ok, with a touch of lemon juice. otherwise, not bad for \"Gringos\"."

I did split the amount of lemon juice with red wine vinegar and tend to add any extra veggies I have on hand (celery works really well) but can't thank you enough for the recipe. It's wonderful!\n(I wonder how some Louisiana muffuletta olive salad would work in place of the olives........I guess I'll give it a shot next time)"
