I used farfalle pasta and served thinly sliced medium rare ribeye with a light drizzle of the sauce on top. The apple was a nice complementary topping. I didn't use walnuts as that is something my husband doesn't like. I didn't need any additional salt and I put the fresh ground pepper on top of the dish rather than in the cream sauce."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is simply amazing and I have made it three times since originally coming across mid-august! I was looking for a Gorgonzola cream sauce for our steak and mashed potatoes a few Friday’s back (imitating a recipe we once had at a local restaurant). That time just did the sauce and if you cook per the instructions, it does thicken quite nicely. Loved it so much we made it twice since, to follow the rest of the recipe ;) including the pasta, apples and walnuts! Used mushroom stuffed ravioli (brand Rana - refrigerated section). Today, made yet again and added minced garlic to the cream simmer and fresh spinach at the end. Yes, you could totally add chicken! Or sautéd mushroom! Or serve the sauce over chops (include the apple!!) or large, grilled portobellos! I can see all the ways I will use and reuse this recipe! We love that this is super easy to make. It IS very rich and filling (with the pasta) but leftovers have turned out good! Thanks again for another winner of a recipe!! It’s a new favorite that will go on repeat!"

I added Parmesan and a little mozzarella cheese to the mixture as it cooked, added some garlic powder and doubled the recipe to pour over grilled chicken breast on a bed of broccoli. Put it in a tin pan and sprinkled more mozzarella on top and baked at 425 for 30 minutes *ish*. At the same time, sliced potatoes pretty thin and baked with some onion, garlic powder and some pepper. Cooked them until crispy and laid the potatoes on the plate as a base and scooped the chicken, broccoli and sauce mixture and placed it on top. It was amazing!"

When I made this sauce, I used 2.5 oz instead of 3 oz of gorgonzola. I think I will reduce the gorgonzola just a tad more as the gorgonzola is really strong. But, it is a delicious sauce. The entire family gobbled it up! I put the sauce on organic potato gnocchi that I purchased premade at the grocery store. We served fresh apple slices on the side instead of in the dish and it made a wonderful complement to the creamy pasta. I've been requested to make this at least once a week, so clearly, it is a winner! Thank you, Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "This was truly pasta perfection!!! The flavors and textures compliment each other so well with the ultra creamy, zingy Gorgonzola sauce topped with just a touch of sweetness &amp; crunch of the apple &amp; nuts. It seems so elegant yet it's ridiculously easy to make! Found that the true secret to this dish is being very patient while the cream reduces &amp; thickens. It is well worth taking your time. As always we made it exactly as written. Thank you yet again Chef John!"

I served it on butternut squash ravioli, and it was the perfect flavor combination, along with the nuts and apples. Awesome fall supper! Thank you Chef John for another winner."

That made it better than the original dish. It's easy to make and is good enough to serve to company. I used regular cream rather than heavy cream and gnocchi instead of ravioli. I'll be making this again the exact same way."
