For my family: 2 lbs elbow noodles cooked 2 lbs beef 2 lbs bob Evans sausage 2 red peppers (bell) 2 medium or one large onion One bunch of minced garlic 4 cans tomatoes with chilis 1 cup of water 2 tsp Hungarian paprika 1 stick of butter Salt and pepper to taste Chili powder A dash of worcheshire sauce And sharp cheddar cheese Brown the beef. This is critical, for taste. In separate pan brown the onion and garlic in the butter and when clearish and soft add the peppers. When all is soft add to the noodles and the cans of tomatoes and add the water. Legit add all the spices and let simmer for a few hours mixing occasionally. The water added will keep it from burning . Everyone loved it"

I used ground turkey meat because that’s what I had in my freezer and was out of hamburger. Only other thing I did was add a can of diced tomatoes, and also used a can of stewed tomatoes and I added a can of rinsed dark red kidney beans because I remember my grandmother’s having them. I enjoyed it on this cold and wet afternoon here."

Also could use a bit more water. I tried adding a tablespoon at a time and had minimal luck. it tastes great, but it's an insanely thick mess. I'll give it a 3 for now until I can try it done correctly."

For modifications, I substituted one pound chopped kielbasa for the ground beef, added a medium bell pepper (chopped), 1/4 cup red wine, 3 tblsp sugar and 1 tsp garlic powder. For tomatoes, I used 3 14-oz cans chopped tomatoes (including liquid) and omitted the paste. I ended up adding about 3/4 cup water while the macaroni cooked on medium high heat, which took about 15 mins. I like the combination of chili powder and paprika with the other flavors. I will make this again, and I will probably cut pasta to one cup and add in some garbanzo or kidney beans for more fiber/texture. Tasty, quick &amp; easy!"

I made a couple of changes by using the Italian style stewed tomatoes that included garlic and oregano and I chopped up an orange bell pepper instead of the green (to avoid heartburn) Did not use tomato paste as I did not have any but added about a half a cup of spaghetti sauce. For the add'l water I added beef broth instead..it was delicious. I didn't have any special rolls but remembered that I had frozen garlic bread which was perfect! Love that it was plenty for another meal for the 2 of us!"

"reviewBody": "I made the following changes to the recipe: after draining the grease from the cooked ground meat I sauteed the onions and some chopped red pepper with the meat. I added a 1/4 cup of white wine to deglaze the pot. Along with the other ingredients I added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and half a bag of frozen peas and carrots. \n\nAs was stated in other reviews, in the future I will cook the pasta separately then add it to the completed sauce. By adding the uncooked pasta to the sauce, I ended up with a gooey mess of \"almost\" pasta. This is the main reason I didn't rate the recipe higher. I might also consider cooking the peas and carrots first before adding them to the sauce."

My mother cooked this as I grew up learning how to cook from her. \nI saute my ground beef, onions, and green bell pepper together. \nDrain the grease off after the beef has browned and the onions and bell peppers have softened. \nAdd spices 1 tbs chili powder, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp salt..stir until well blended, then add 1 can stewed tomatoes and 1 can tomatoes sauce. After your macaroni has cooked separately in boiling water for about 5 to 7 minutes, drain well...rinse then put into the meat and tomato mixture and let cook medium heat for 20 minutes stirring occasionally."

Goulash is much more like a beef stew with chunks of beef, browned and simmered in its own sauce (add liquid, of course, after the browning). As you can tell, this has been a pet peeve of mine for decades!??"

I added a little worshishire sauce, a little cumin and a little brown sugar (I always add brow sugar to my tomato-based dishes). Mine did not turn out gooey as some reviewer's had. You just have to make sure the meat mixture has enough water in it(1&amp; 1/2 cups) and that it is at a rolling boil before you add the pasta. I had another small pot of water boiling on the stove just in case I needed to add more water, which I did have to add (1 more cup). I had enough leftovers for another 2 servings. It turned out perfect! Thank you for sharing!"

You don't have to cook the pasta seperate, you just have to taste it until its done on a lower temperature. \n Really this recipe shouldn't have the stars it has, folks make their changes and rate the outcome per their changes. I think the person who submitted it should have been more detailed. One would certainly wonder, am I really supposed to add the pasta without cooking it. Take the time to be specific.
