I only had white mushrooms and was only making half the recipe, used vermouth instead of wine and had chicken stock instead of broth (richer) but otherwise followed the recipe. It definitely took longer than 20 minutes for the starches to release and become al dente but worth the wait. I've made several different risotto recipes and this was one of the best."

Doing as such, each time stirring until it is absorbed, I finished the broth and still some rice grains remained uncooked. In the end final \"risotto\" became like a starch. Quite unpleasant. I had a bowl of \"risotto\", the taste is there, good one, but the texture is really deplorable. I through it to the garbage. What a waste of ingredients, time... to getting a big mess!!! I it would be a next time, I will try adding the whole broth, stirring the rice, half cup one after another."

I used all 6 cups of chicken stock. I also added salt to the mushrooms while cooking and added salt and pepper to the rice as I was adding more chicken broth. I added 3 sprigs of fresh thyme when adding broth to the rice and removed the sprigs before adding the mushrooms. Highly recommend this recipe."

"reviewBody": "After being massively disappointed by risotto while on vacation, and knowing I can and have made better, I made this. I've made risotto loads of times before, but I keep coming back to this one. 15-20 minutes is definitely not enough time. You're looking at at least 30 for just incorporating all the broth, but it is so worth it. I snagged some shiitake mushrooms along with crimini because there were on sale. I finished it off with a squeeze of fresh lemon to hit that \"Salt. Fat. Acid. Heat\" that makes a perfect dish and it made it sooooo good. This is a nice, basic risotto recipe, perfect to customize once you've got this one down. Try adding butternut squash instead of mushrooms, or peas with the mushrooms. Try sun-dried tomatoes! Combinations are endless with this as a good base."

It took 4 cups of chicken broth to get to the al dente stage, but I had 6 cups on hand. Homemade broth is definitely the way to go, I'm glad I had some frozen. Also took longer to get the rice to al dente, but I'm not complaining at all! Definitely a keeper."

I can’t confirm how many mushrooms I used…we have a lot of wild mushrooms (chanterelle, etc and I did use a few portabellos) in our area so we used those, but based on other peoples reviews, I did go lighter on the mushrooms. I also added English peas and used a mix of gruyere and Parmesan cheeses. I did use all of the 6 c. of liquid and it cooked 35 min. I could have kept it on maybe 3 min more, but very good. My husband went back for more."

I did not use white wine but I had some prosecco that was in my refrigerator but haven't opened for a couple of days so it was kind of flattened out and I think it worked beautifully it was very aromatic! Basically, everything else we did use except I used a yellow one instead of shallots. It turned out great and we are thoroughly enjoying it! I will say I did follow someone else's notes and did it for like another 8 minutes longer. Turned out great not too hard not too mushy.. perfect!"

"reviewBody": "I think the secret is using really good broth…i used mostly homemade. I also added 1/2 tsp of rosemary to the mushrooms and cooked them until most of the fluid was released and sitting in the pot, about 10-12 min. Cooking time was about 40 min and I used exactly 6 cups of broth. I also cut the butter by half. We think it is delicious and easy. Tip: check Italian food section if your grocery store. The arborio rice was exactly half the price there than it was in the “rice section” of my store."

I'd say it takes closer to 30 minutes. When the rice is done cooking I also add fresh garlic, about two cloves, before adding the mushrooms in. And I also add more Parmesan cheese. It is delicious!"

I didn’t have any white wine so I substituted 2 Tsps of white wine vinegar and that gave the needed acid to balance the flavors. I finished the dish with truffle salt and a drizzle of good EVOO. You can use dried mushrooms with a very tasty result. Two oz of dried Porcini mushrooms worked beautifully for this recipe."

"reviewBody": "I've made this a few times, experimenting as I went. The one thing to me that makes flavour burst forward is fresh minced garlic. I added 1 -2 tsp per cup of rice. Usually, I sauté it in butter before it turns brown, then add the mushrooms. If the mushrooms are sliced at about 1/4 to 3/8 inches, they'll still have some body, which I enjoy. I sliced thinly as recommended, but for me, that means the mushrooms become limp, as I'm accustomed to thinly slicing for Asian dishes, which helps with the speed of stir fry. I also used truffled olive oil when I was sautéing the rice. One thing, if you can find it, (my preference) is for carnaroli rice, instead of arborio. Arborio is harder rice and takes longer to cook. Where I am, I'd have to hunt for carnaroli rice, which is worth it."

Made it with a braised pork and root vegetables, so I could focus on the risotto while that cooked in the oven. Pulled up a stool and grabbed my kindle. Used about 6oz white and 6 oz shiitake mushrooms (what I had on hand), added garlic with the wine, and a splash of half and half at the end. I added more broth at a time and kept it a little moister which prevented it from sticking so I could read more, and stir slightly less."

Then cooked the rest of the way with the lid off. The mushrooms didn’t brown, but they were cooked well, and the liquid that was left retained so much flavor. The recipe says to serve immediately, but I found letting it rest for a little bit to give it a chance to thicken up was the way to go. Looking forward to making this again!!"

I don't like Shiitake mushrooms in risotto due to their strong smell. Sauteing the mushrooms in garlic butter puts this over the top. Bravo! My new favorite dish! Forgot to shoot a pic because we all couldn't wait to dig in. I do like my risotto a bit creamier and less thick than in the video so I added more broth. Othewise, pure perfection!"

"reviewBody": "Delicious but did a few things differently with this recipe! Instead of chicken broth I used homemade vegetable broth from my kitchen scraps (way heartier than you can imagine). Trust me I’m no vegetarian, I’m a carnivore, but this broth was delicious. 10/10 recommend saving you veggie scraps for broth. I also used half of the recommended mushrooms (there’s lots in there I chopped them up small). I had Cremini, shiitake, and oyster mushrooms. Although I love cooking I’m a broke college student and used yellow onion instead of shallot. I cooked the onion much longer than a minute to really soften them and bring out the flavour. Broke college student only had basmati on hand so I used that and it worked perfect, you just have to reduce it longer. I added more liquid than recommended because of this, and used maybe a cup of water as well since my vegetable broth had so much flavour. I didn’t have white wine on hand so I used a mixture of a little bit of white wine vinegar and mirin. Great replacement! When I added the mushrooms back I also added some peas and green onion for some extra texture and vegetable. I only garnished with chives since I cooked green onion into the mixture. My boyfriend is a chef and I wowed him with this dish, as well as with my homemade vegetable broth."
