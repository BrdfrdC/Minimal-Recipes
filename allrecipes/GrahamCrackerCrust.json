I used regular Graham crackers, I started breaking the crackers and when I had most of them smashed up I put them all thru a wire mesh strainer. I used the mortar to finish grinding the crackers. I had my entire crust nice and fine. No big chunks to contend with. It took 3 to 4 minutes to feed all the crackers thru the strainer and very well worth the time."

Come to find out Nabisco had chosen to reduce the number of crackers in a sleeve from 11 to nine, so I had to make the adjustment to get the original great pie crust.\nAs always -- hth, fwiw, and imho....\nkenn \nwar4what@fastmail.com"

One thing I wanted to mention, when I first started making these crusts, I would find my filling would ooze out of the bottom. I realized my graham cracker crust was not evenly pressed into the pie pan. So, now when I get the graham cracker mixture all pressed in, I hold the pan up to the light and can see exactly where there are thin spots &amp; fix them. I use this crust for my cherry cheesecakes."

After making it a couple of times, my family has discovered that we prefer less sugar, but that is our personal taste, not a failure of the recipe."

I should have compared other recipes (which, for the record, call for about 1 tbsp sugar, not 1/3 cup!). It tasted like a super sweet cookie covered in sugar not bad just not at all what I wanted and not at all what went well with my pudding, I scooped out my pudding from the crust and ate it plain bc the crust was way too sweet."

I made a frozen lime pie to put in it and did not think the cinnamon would be a good addition. I will definitely make this crust in the future."

The only adjustments I make it add two tablespoons of dark brown sugar and omit the cinnamon and it comes out just perfect everytime."

I upped the the crumbs to 2 cups, reduced the sugar to 3 tbsp added 1/4 tsp salt, and omitted the cinnamon altogether. Depending on what you're making the cinnamon can be a good addition, just not for everything. \nMixed that together and baked for 10 mins instead of 7. Came out great."

"reviewBody": "So great for using up graham crackers. Don‚Äôt need so much crackers. Even 3 individual serving packets will do. Definitely recommend freezing for an hour before using. The melted butter spreads out all the other ingredients and then hardens nicely to fill out with heaping apple slice while still keeping its shape. Used it twice and absolutely love it. I used foil 8 inch pie dish and worked great. Also tried using apple sauce instead of sugar and also worked great. Also used up old cookies too. No need to grind it fine. I just mashed with hands and kids liked it so much they ate leftover in bowl. This will be my go to for pie crust and will never buy crust again."

Tips: if it came out too gooey, the butter was too warm when you added it. Cinnamon graham crackers make this taste amazing. I used one packet plus half of a tablet. Mixing with my hand and sort of tossing it around with my fingers worked best"
