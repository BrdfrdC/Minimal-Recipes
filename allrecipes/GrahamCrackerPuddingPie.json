We all liked it and plan to tweak it in the future (different puddings, etc.) The graham crackers were a bit too soft for my liking (I understand that's to be expected) - wish I knew something that would hold up a little better. Still a keeper (we too used instant, sped it up a lot!)"

I didn't have as much pudding so I made it in a high pie plate and that worked just fine. I also dumped some mini marshmallows into the hot pudding. Made it more like a S'more pie. Very yummy!"

I thought the crackers would get really mushy, but they didn't - they got soft, but kept their shape and look very nice in layers when you cut into the pie. \n\nI used 2 packages of instant pudding, like the other reviewers, and since they were smaller, it fit in a regular pie dish just fine. I did 3 or 4 layers of crackers, and sprinkled some crumbs on top to make it pretty."

I put two layers (with crackers in between) using fat free vanilla and Lemon puddings. Do not need to use cooked puddings, comes out perfectly with instant and much faster. Took me less then 10 minutes prep."

It has to be made with cooked pudding, not instant! Top with a layer of crushed graham crackers and serve with whipped cream. Yum!"

I added about 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract to the pudding and topped it off with whipped topping. After several hours in the fridge, the crackers were soft. It was fast and easy to make and we all enjoyed it. This would be a great summertime dessert."
