It was the perfect amount to fill the 8\"-square pan which I lined with foil and sprayed with no-stick spray. I followed the rest of the recipe (although halved) except for only using 1-1/4 cups of sugar (it could stand to lose another 1/4 cup) and I omitted the confectioners' sugar. The lemon filling did get sort of sucked into the crust and it was still a little too sweet... But it was pretty tasty! I might make them again. Thanks for sharing, Carrie!"

They tasted good but were SO sticky. Also they were a little too sweet. I did not sprinkle sugar on top of them either. If I had done that I would not have been able to eat them due to the sweetness. Not too bad but has room for improvement."

I feel the finished product is way too sweet. It's very good nonetheless. Next time I will cut the sugar by at least half so that the lemon doesn't get overwhelmed. \n\nI used Fresh lemon juice and served with homemade whipped cream. 1 cup heavy cream, Vanilla to taste and sugar to taste beat until stiff peaks form and serve. 5 minutes with a stand mixer maybe 10 minutes with a hand mixer. Make sure everything is very cold."

The graham crust required no mental adjustment for me--this is how my mom always made them! \n\nBasically because I wanted a really tart square, I added a splash extra lemon juice (regular ole bottled stuff) and did like nora and only added 2.5 cups of sugar. Added an extra tbsp or so of flour to the filling; it seemed a little watery. I also omitted the confectioner's sugar. As I say; I wanted 'em tart. Began eating them out of the pan only mostly cooled--a very good sign! In fact, I was shocked hear my ultra-picky fiance making happy noises while he ate."

When making the lemon filling, I beat each ingredient for about a minute &amp; ended up with a light &amp; fluffy batter. I kept it in the oven an extra 5 minutes with the heat off, to set the middle of the lemon filling more. Will make again."
