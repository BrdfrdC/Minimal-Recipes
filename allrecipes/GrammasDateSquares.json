At 1 point I was going to send my brother to get 2 hockey sticks to beat it back down into the 9Ã—9 pan. It turned out very tasty with 45 mins of cook time. 20 mins on the bottom layer before adding dates, 25 mins at 350 and an extra 10 mins at 325. Yes it turned out OK!

"reviewBody": "These are WONDERFUL!!!! It was like biting into my childhood....I grew up eating ethnic sweets and desserts filled w/dried fruits and nuts. So like others, I made changes too, but, I'm ADDING stars to this recipe review. I dont understand why people take stars away for a recipe they enjoyed but tweaked. TEN STARS here. These were my changes: I used 1/4 cup less brown sugar for the crust, added 1/2 cup chopped pecans, added 1/4 cup more oats (I used quick oats), and added cinnamon and nutmeg, a must! for the filling, do NOT chop dates, there is no need for that extra work. Simply take out the pits, place in a pan and gently warm w/water and 2 tbsp butter, that is key. No more sugar needed. Fold and stir to your preferred consistency, I like my dates soft and spreadable. I used a 9x13 glass pan, coated w/coconut oil, and baked the bottom crust first, 7 min. Then added the date layer and top crust and baked 20 min more. Powdered sugar makes these squares even prettier. I cannot wait to impress my parents. These cookies far exceeded my expectations and I'm so happy I read the reviews. Every baker and every oven is different, but these squares are perfect! Adding to my Christmas cookie list, thank you so much!!!!"

Something to consider when sugar intake is an issue is use I cup of O.J. in place of sugar in the filling plus 1/2 tsp. vanilla and/or rum extract for flavor. For the topping I added 2 tsp - Cream of Tartar, 1 tsp. , Baking Powder along with softened or melted butter. We grew up having these tasty date bars during the holidays."

I used a larger pan (brownie size) and pre-baked the bottom as some other recipes do for 10 minutes, which made spreading the filling easier. I like lemon juice for the bit of tart and vanilla or almond to add to the complexity of the dates. Used less water and no sugar in dates on the second batch. Delicious. Maybe try more oats and swap out 1/2 the butter for applesauce."

I did make a couple of changes. I feel that the dates are sweet enough without the addition of brown sugar to the date mixture. The other change I made was because I didn't have any lemons, almond flavour or vanilla on hand but I did have some rum which I had used for my Christmas cakes. They were yummy with the rum. I have since made them with the lemon juice and they are still great."

We often make minor changes to recipes according to what we have on hand. Also I do understand that people use a recipe as a base and make a number of major changes like reducing fat content or whatever, which turn out really well but then the review and the starts given is no longer the review of this recipe. I suggest to submit a significantly changed recipe in the new ratio of ingredients and new additions and deletions as a new recipe and call it something else: like low fat date square. Or date square number 3 or whatever. Just sayinâ€™"

I didnâ€™t bother chopping dates cause they simmered down and I used a fork to mash them a little. Once off the stove I added a splash of vanilla. I sprinkled unsweetened coconut on top of first layer and baked for 15 minutes to crisp up, then put the rest all together. Cooled in fridge before cutting, then fixed myself a nice cup of coffee and sat back and enjoyed. Hope you get to enjoy too cause thereâ€™s no more left here lol"

"reviewBody": "\"Gramma's Date Squares\" held together nicely. I subbed the butter with VEGAN BECEL (dairy free) and increased the amount to 1 cup to make the crust hold together better. These were very sweet for my taste, and if I were to make them again strictly for myself I would reduce the sugar by at least half; however, they are perfect for company as is. Thank you Mai Forrester for sharing your recipe."

"reviewBody": "It was okay... I read the review and made a couple adjustment. I used a whole coupe of butter, baked the bottom crust for 15 minuets first, skipped the extra sugar in the dates, and I added crushed pecans to the top crust for added protein, oh and I used Splenda brown sugar. So I made a lot of changes. Maybe if I would have stocked to the original recipe it would have been better. It was really sweet but was missing something."

Secondly, it doesn't say to let the date mixture cool before filling it on to the first layer. Thirdly, it doesn't say to cooked the bottom layer for 10 minutes first, but you need to. Fourthly, it doesn't say to put the date mixture in a food processor to chop up that irritating date skin, but it does help quit a bit and improves the texture."
