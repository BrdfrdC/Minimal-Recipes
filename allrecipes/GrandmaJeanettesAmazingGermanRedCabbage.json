After an hour or so, taste and adjust the seasonings if needed. The final thing that makes it authentic is to add some cornstarch to make it a little creamy and thicken the juice a little -- not too much. She was from Weisbaden and this is the way she learned to make it over a hundred years ago."

My mother always sautéed onions with the cabbage so I did too. I don't really care for cloves, so I used allspice. Also I used an artificial white sugar and brown sugar to stay Keto. My mother always added caraway seeds so I added about 2 Tb to the dish. Lastly, garnished with some crumbled bacon and a dollop of sour cream on top to serve. This was so good even though I had to make some changes! I didn't have my mother's recipe, so this one worked out perfect! Thank you!"

I did, however, only have a green cabbage, so used that, and only a Gala apple, so used that as well. I think even the way I made this, it was good, but definitely want to try it the right way next time. Just one more change, followed other reviews and cut down the sugar by 1 TBSP. Glad I did, as I think it would have been too sweet using the whole 1/4 cup. Try this, you’ll love it!"

Had to add a dab more water at first but removed it via condensation on the lid when stirring every 30-45 minutes. I think I may cut out some of the sugar next time; but, I always like to try recipes as written first before tinkering."

I'd shred a whole head of cabbage to make about 9 or 10 cups. \ni used the rest of the amounts called for but will double them next time.\nAlso, it seemed as if there was not enough liquid so I added about 1 T water here and there to make sure it didn't burn. \nMy cooking time was just shy of 1.5 hours and it was perfect.\nthank you!"

"reviewBody": "Giving this recipe 4 stars instead of 5, as I found the recipe almost too simple. I know it seems quite elementary, but there is no direction to check/stir the cabbage while simmering for 1 1/2 hours, which unfortunately resulted in a completely burnt cabbage bottom to my stainless steel pot. I recognize that stainless steel is more sensitive to heat than a non-stick or dutch oven, so I probably should have been more cautious - However, a heads up or extra step in the instructions would have been helpful. The cabbage that survived was quite tasty, and I am motivated to try this recipe again, but for those who may need the notice - Remember to stir here and there while your cabbage simmers!"
