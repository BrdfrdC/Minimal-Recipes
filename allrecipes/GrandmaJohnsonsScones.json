For best results, use cold butter and chill the cut scones well before baking. My favorite is with semi-sweet chocolate chips mixed in. My daughter likes them with cinnamon chips and cinnamon sprinkled into the dough before baking."

After trying to get the dough to come together I finally added a couple tablespoons of milk, and voila. I was worried I had overworked the dough, but the scones were beautifully flaky and delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe. I subbed chocolate chips for the raisins at my sons request and he couldn't stop eating them."

"reviewBody": "Another fan of this wonderful recipe. I've frozen it successfully several ways:\n\nDivided the dough in two or three round discs, wrapped and froze. Pull the disc out the night before and thaw in the fridge before baking. \n\nCut into wedges, flash froze the dough and placed in zip lock bags in the freezer. \n\nBaked, iced and frozen them in packages of two scones for any given morning. \n\nMy favorite: Bake the scones, make a powdered sugar glaze, and place each in a zip lock and freeze. So easy to pull them out and let thaw on the counter and then drizzle on the glaze. They still taste fresh! I like to freeze with a glaze pack in bags of six scones and use as quick gifts for friends. \n\nI find they microwave well from frozen also."

This is now my go to recipe. I have begun experimenting with different fruits and now also using the suggestion to freeze them before baking. So delicious to have fresh scones in just a few minutes. \n\nOne change we both make is to use a 2 1/4 “ round cookie cutter, bake for 17 mins in a gas oven. (Or 2” when a large quantity it desired)\n\nThank you so much for sharing your family recipe!!! P.S. I so seldom make time to submit a review."

"reviewBody": "Thanks to ‘Rona, I’ve discovered a joy for baking and have made several versions of this and they have all always turned out. I’ve never used raisins (Raisins in cookies are why I have trust issues). Mostly I’ve used chocolate chips, but lately I did dried cranberries and dark chocolate chips, another recipe I did heath toffee bits with mini chocolate chips, and a separate batch with soft caramel bits and mini chocolate chips. I tried frozen blueberries once but had to add a lot of flour to get the dough back to the right consistency. I’ve even been tempted to try it without any mix-ins and coat it in sanding sugar and top with strawberries and whipped cream, but I’m afraid my family and friends are getting tired of me helping add to their quarantine-fifteen."

Most of the time I made half batches so I made them more often. I always use frozen butter and cut it into the flower mixture. Sometimes, I split the half batch again and put raisins in half and cranberry relish in the other. The cranberry relish ones are a bit more moist dough, but cook up the same. Thank You for sharing Grandma Johnson's Scones recipe!"

At the end, added orange zest from 2 oranges and 1 cup of dried cranberries (omitted the raisins). Once the scones were cooled drizzled an orange glaze made of 1/2 cup icing sugar, 1 tbsp orange juice, and 1/2 tsp orange zest over the scones. Next time if using a glaze on the scones would reduce the sugar in the scone recipe to 3/4 cup so that they don't get too sweet with a glaze added to them."

I used a plastic spatula but eventually had to switch to a wooden spoon because it wasn't mixing enough. I thought I had put in too much flour at first, but it ended up looking like the video once I switched. I strongly recommend using a wooden spoon at the sour cream and egg step, but other than that they were great!"

My baking time was 22 minutes, so I concur with several other reviews. I found it was important to make sure the scones were uniformly sliced and of the same thickness to bake evenly. I cut them smaller, so it yielded 24 scones, and they’re plenty big. I can’t wait to try these with additional flavors."

Much easier to work with."

"reviewBody": "These scones are amazing. Some tips - the butter needs to be COLD. I use a food processor to cut mine into the flour (put about half the flour/sugar mix into the processor, slice up all the butter into 1tbsp chunks and add them to the flour, then pulse until butter is cut in to desired size). Also, once you add the sour cream and egg, if the mixture seems TOO dry or crumbly, press it into a big mound in the bowl and let it rest for 3-4 minutes. I generally add toffee or cinnamon chips at this stage, then knead dough to incorporate the chips, then roll out."

So yes, I am a regular scones champion, but this recipe brought them over the top. I just wanted to make this batch as plain as possible, I was in a hurry, I checked the pantry and no raisins, my husband was putting pressure as we were to go out... a culinary disaster in the making! but oh my, these were no fuss and sooo gooood!!! instead of raisins I only had a mix of dried cranberries and raspberries, and didn't remember to add them till the dough was ready and packed. Maybe all this heartburn was the reason of the success of this recipe: minimum handling and baking. They were perfect, everyone was marveling on the light texture and the wonderful flakiness. Can't wait to try not all the fancy different combinations (lemon orange, white choc, and cinnamon, apples, and so on) only but strawberry jam and cream even."

I'm on vacation and didn't have cream of tartar and they still turned out great. I will make these again when I get home to see if they turn out much different with cream of tartar. I divided the dough in half, made orange/craisin and chocolate/walnut, both were delicious!"
