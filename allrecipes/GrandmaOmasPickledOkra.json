So I just packed a little over a pound of okra into the jars with 2 cracked garlic cloves, a deseeded serrano pepper, a few slices of white onion, red bell for color, and a couple sprigs of fresh dill. I did follow other suggestions and used half apple vinegar and half regular white vinegar. So, this is the point where they get to chill for three weeks.*** 3 weeks and a few days later and bam! subtle vinegar with a hint of spice and a crunch with a tad bit of okra slime! Loved it!"

Like other reviewers I used apple cider vinegar and white and they came out with a great flavor. The smell of boiling vinegar was the worst part of this, but so worth it (just let the oven vent hood run the whole time)! Crunchy, spicy, and a great snack! Thanks for the recipe :)"

Now I've doubled batched it because I have a big family and that would mean I'd go without; what's the sense of making something if I cannot enjoy it as well??\nI've had pickled Okra before but they were store bought. \nSo I cannot wait till try it tomorrow or Tuesday, since it is sandwich day at work , hoping my southern co-workers enjoy them as well; considering we live in Canada, only an hour away from Buffalo NY."

If you're buying farm fresh or growing your own, you can clean the okra and put it and your spices in a couple of jars as the recipe says, then you can add jars, okra and your spices as needed. This will give you an idea of how much vinegar and water to boil based on the two to one ratio."

The second time I made this, I used the opposite ratio of vinegar to water (2 cups vinegar to one cup water ) and I liked that even more. These only need a week or maybe a little longer to taste delicious. Hubby and I ate a big jar of these in just five days. I was given more fresh okra and also some fresh red peppers (they smelled HOT) so I made another batch of pickled okra last night. We'll see how it turns out shortly :o)"

"reviewBody": "I've canned this recipe twice, last fall and again early this summer when there was plenty of fresh tender young okra available. \n\nMany people don't know, but okra is excellent for the digestive system. \n\n'this recipe is fantastic garnish to a hearty winter meal of greens, beans, jambalaya, or your favorite stew. I have only one suggestion, which came from my aunt, to add a level teaspoon of sugar (or less if you prefer) to each packed jar before adding the hot vinegar mixture. This doesn't change the pickled or spicy flavor to sweet but just mellows the exciting flavor. \n\nInterestingly, people who say they generally don't like okra, love these pickled treats."

The recipe is super quick and easy, even for novice canners. I did not add the peppers and put one galic clove in each jar. My two year old can not eat them fast enough. Who knew Okra could taste so good? You have got to try it!"

"reviewBody": "I didn't bother with the hot water bath as I knew they wouldn't last very long. I just put them in sterile mason jars. I think the recipe needs to be a little more specific about what vinegar to use. I used a combination of white distilled (for the twang), apple cider (for the mellowness) and white balsamic (LOVE the flavor). I think you need to play around with it until you find the particular flavor that you like. I would still probably just buy my regular jarred pickled okra, but this was a fun thing to try for a change. Thanks!"
