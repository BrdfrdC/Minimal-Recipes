"reviewBody": "I divided the recipe in half. The dough takes time to come together, but it is a great dough to work. used kosher salt, also divided dough into 8 and balled it to rest for the first 15. I added a tsp. of baking soda in the boil water bath for a pretzel-like crust. balgels really fillout when boiled. Baked on parchment instead of greasing the sheet. although bland these are a great plain bagel for sandwiches, or addeding in flovoring ingredients before baking"

"reviewBody": "I've made three different bagel recipes and this is by far the quickest and easiest. The flavor is delicious, though not as close to the bagels I'm accustomed to eating. I halved the recipe, made 5 giant bagels, boiled for 50 seconds, put a little coarse corn meal on the tray, did each rise an additional 10 minutes than written and baked for 25 minutes. The bagels are perfectly chewy on the outside, crisp on the bottom, and the right density texture inside. I ate one just out of the oven with butter, and then I pan fried the second and ate with cream cheese! Absolutely delicious!"

"reviewBody": "A bit salty but VERY GOOD! I only had bread machine yeast so I used that and proofed it first with the water, salt and sugar-I read that it works better that way. I also read that self rising flour works better for bagels so I used that as well. The dough was very dry, tough and hard to work with. It also didn't seem to rise during the first 15 rest. They were tough to shape and then hardly rose even after 40 min. They puffed up while boiling, which was good and baked well. Will definitely make again with some changes that are more like the actually recipe lol :)"
