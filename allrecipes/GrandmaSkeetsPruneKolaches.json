I didn’t use the streusel topping for a cleaner presentation and I used Bosc pear filling instead of prune. It was fun to prepare."

I baked them for about 40 minutes. They are crunchy around the edges and top and are soft on the inside. They are delicious! I made a cup of coffee to drink with the first one I tried and never drank the coffee - that good! TY Grandma Skeet, &amp; SCOOBYVC"

She used Solo canned prune fruit filling which is almost impossible to find. I'll use her recipe for the cookie but I'm excited to try your filling."

"reviewBody": "I have made this simular recipe many times as I grew up with these, the difference is before baking we top it with coconut instead of the streusel,then after it cools we sprinkle powdered sugar on it. My mother made the dough by hand, and I too use the bread machine. For the prune filling, I don't follow a recipe since I learned from watching my mother but is pretty much the same, I never used lime juice before but I think that may be something I will try. My daughter loves them and I HAVE to make them every year for her birthday which is in a few days . I just picked up the ingrediants this morning for them, and I always make extra for my husband and me."

"reviewBody": "I have never made or heard of Kolaches before even though my first job was in a Jewish/American bakery. I have tried all kinds of prune danish, buns and rolls. These little things are awesome! The filling is absolutely spectacular. I was afraid it was going to be too spicy as it cooked on the stove- but once blended, WOW! I had leftover so I am saving it for a spread on my morning bagel- It is SO good. I had some troubel getting the dough out of my bread machine- it was really sticky so i had to flour my work surface and hands and i dumped the dough out and ended up cutting my \"eggs\" with a knife molding them on the pan. The dough came out fine. I made some on a metal pan (smaller- cooked 5 minutes longer than recommeded) and some in a casserole dish as another reviewer recommended (big ones- 10 minutes longer than recommended).\nMake these- they are very good."

"reviewBody": "This is a tasty recipe, and the whole family liked it. If I made it again, however, I would make a couple changes: I would make 3/4 the amount of prune filling, as they were VERY pruney. I would use a greased 13x9 pan rather than a cookie sheet to contain the large amount of streusel. I would let the dough rise 20 min before adding the filling (I missed that addition, below, when I made them). And I'd bake them longer -- I'd try 20-30 min, as they were a bit doughey with the current recommended time. I would still recommend this recipe, though. Definitely a yummy way to eat prunes!"
