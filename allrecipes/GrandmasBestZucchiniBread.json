I didn’t do anything to the zucchini to remove moisture. I think they’re good. I’m sure they would be even better with all the oil but I wanted to cut the calories."

I used 1 cup whole wheat flour, 2 cups all purpose flour and brown sugar instead of white. I also used a medium mashed banana instead of oil. It is delicious - very flavourful. I didn’t have 2 loaf pans so I made it in a square cake pan. Left it a little too long in the oven - it didn’t need 55 minutes. Will definitely make again."

"reviewBody": "This was really good and not too dry as other reviewers have suggested. I did not, however, drain my zucchini as others may have. I figured all that juicy goodness was just going to make the bread all that much better. The addition of the dates also adds moistness (and body) to the bread. The black pepper is BRILLIANT! Can't really tell it is there but there is a \"little something\" that makes it different. I made a second batch and used freshly grated ginger (quite a lot actually) and that really pushed the flavors over the edge. You can make this batter into large loafs, mini loafs or muffins. You could probably even do it as a cake (ala Carrot Cake) just fill whatever pans you are using 2/3 full and adjust the baking time accordingly. A keeper recipe for sure."

"reviewBody": "This is an acceptable, not remarkable, zucchini bread. It is not moist enough, and a little more spice wouldn’t hurt either, although I did like the addition of the dates. Most important, I’m disappointed with the loaf itself. While I should have known better than to continue on when the batter filled only about one-third of the pan, I should also have been able to rely on the pan size called for in the recipe. I want a loaf, not thick bars baked in a loaf pan. This was barely two inches tall! A word to the wise – either make a full recipe and make one, 9x5” loaf, or use smaller pans. Or make muffins. Or, since this bread was rather non-descript, choose one of the many, better zucchini bread recipes on this site. (And don’t make the same mistake I did – whatever size pan you choose to use, the pan should be 2/3 full with batter!) Note: If you still decide to try this recipe, add a teaspoon of salt."

I took the recipe with me to the farmers market to get all of the ingredients and I lost the recipe in the store. I came on here to find a recipe that was similar to the one she gave me and this one most resembled the one I lost. This recipe was excellent. I added some coconut flakes and used real ginger because I had no ground ginger and it was great. This is a great recipe it wont let you down. P.S. If you have zucchini that has a lot of water be sure to squeeze the water out of it before adding it."
