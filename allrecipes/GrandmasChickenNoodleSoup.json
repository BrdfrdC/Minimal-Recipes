"reviewBody": "Delicious and easy recipe. I made a few personal preference edits to add more natural vitamins for a healthier soup and a bit more flavor.. I’m sure the recipe is excellent by itself though. Did not use butter or sauté the celery and onions hence cutting down on the fat. I also cooked the skinless boneless chicken breasts (you can use skinless chicken breast with bone) in the 12 cups of water using only 8 bullion cubes and cooked for 1 hour before adding the veggies and spices from Grandmas soup recipe, adding one ripe tomato, 1 potato with skin (in liu of cornstarch), 5 small whole garlic cloves and 1 small turnip cut in 3. I discard the Turnip at the end before adding the noodles, I used 6 ounces dried noodles to keep the soup more brothy. All veggie’s were finely diced (my preference for getting more of a mix of veggies and flavor in every spoonful. Totally cooking time was 2.5 hours, I finely diced the veggies while the chicken breast were cooking so the 2.5 hours included prep time and clean up once all ingredients were simmering together."

I made the following revisions;\n* 1/2 chicken bone broth and 1/2 low sodium chicken broth (bone broth is very nutritious and I made a batch for a sick friend)\n* I added 1 cup of finely chopped baby carrots and an additional 1/2 cup of onions\n* I added 1 TBL of minced ginger and 2 TBL minced garlic\n* 1/8 tsp cayenne\n* I cooked bow tie noodles but stored them separately, I don't like soggy noodles and also wasn't sure if my friend's family had any gluten free people. I did use a rotisserie chicken, made it so easy. \nthis is a hearty, savory soup. In the future I might add some fresh parsley for a garnish."

I will only roast in the microwave with my Pampered Chef stoneware and it comes out crispy crispy brown and juicy. You could also buy a chicken roaster already cooked if you want to save time. The other change I made to the recipe was that I added carrots for flavor. Thank you for the basics for a perfect chicken noodle recipe. Oh and I also don't put the noodles in until ready to eat because if you add the noodles and then refrigerate leftovers the noodles soak up all of the liquid. I add noodles as we eat the soup."

I toss them in and let everything simmer for a while together. Plus I add fresh coined carrots...the more veggies the fresher it feels and hearty! I used spices that I like along with what the recipe says. I will use Sodium-Reduced stock so I can add in salt and adjust as needed. I like to use my nose in the pantry and pick out savoury spices like Thyme, Dill Weed, Rosemary, a bit of Oregano, a bit of Basil, a bit of Garlic powder. Salt and Pepper of course. I say use what you like and if I am not happy with the balance, I will add a bit more stock, let it simmer longer and see how it feels then. And I loved loved loved the idea of using Grocery Store Rotisserie Chicken! Saved me time and money. I used thin latex gloves like you would for cutting Maraschino Cherries and split the chicken bits right down to the meat and throw those in...already cooked and seasoned! The soup freezes not too bad but not for too long. My kiddo likes it fresh but not frozen. Good luck with your soup!"

I brought it to a boil than put it on medium low for about 20 to 25 mintues. Once chicken was cooked I took the thighs out cut them up took out bone and put the chicken back in. I added in the noodles to the soup so they can soak in the flavor. For seasoning I kept the poultry seasoning the same as the original recipe called for, added in Miss Dash Garlic and Herb, and fresh garlic. Next time I think I am also going to add fresh basil and a couple of bay leaves."

"reviewBody": "I followed other reviewers' advice and put in a whole rotisserie chicken for about 15 minutes, then removed it, took off the meat then added it back into the pot. I also added carrots and two bay leaves. I used low-sodium broth, and it gave plenty of flavor without the extra salt. I also boiled the egg noodles separately and kept them separate from the soup, even later when storing leftovers in the fridge. When it's time to eat, just put a handful of noodles in the bowl and ladle the soup over top. I don't like how the noodles become so soggy and saturated when left in the pot, so we prefer adding the noodles to our own bowls right before eating. It was delicious and will definitely make again! Four stars as recipe is written, 5 stars with changes"

I used ho made thick wonderful noodles, 3 green onions sliced plus 14 cup chopped yellow sweet onion. 2 bay leaves. I especially like thickening the broth with corn starch. I had 1/2 chicken breast that did not cook through last night, I cut it into cubes .and I wish I knew how to send a picture. Now I am looking for someone to feed."

I made this for my husband who was super sick and we both love chunky chunks of chicken so I cut up about 6 chicken breasts and browned those with a tiny bit of olive oil and barley seasoned it with Vegeta seasoning. (i don't really measure my spices, just eye ball it) Set that aside. I did make my noodles separate cause #1 I don't like the way it alters the taste of the soup #2 I didn't want it to soak up the organic chicken broth. Set that aside. Sauted a large onion, about 2 cups of celery and like 6 cloves of garlic in a tiny bit of olive oil. Set that aside. Then I brought the 12 cups of chicken broth and poultry seasoning to a boil, then added the sauted goodness and threw in some chopped up green onions and let it simmer til the celery was soft about 20 min. Then I threw in the chicken and noodles, along with some turmeric and a few pinches of salt and it came out pretty good. Once I had it in my bowl I put in some cayenne pepper to give it some kick and a little bit more salt and it was very tasty! Excited to make another batch and see how it turns out!"

I recommend doing separately, for these reasons : 1) soup is cooked to a level of it being hot -not boiling, noodles you would boil to eldente.. The soup should not be boiled. 2) when you boil the noodles you will see the cloudiness in the water, that is starch, you really don’t want that in your soup, you should thicken your soup with other methods 3)If that starch/cloudy water is in your soup it changes the color and flavor of soup 4) The noodles will absorb your soup broth/liquid if cooked in the soup, yes you can add more liquid but this depletes the recipe/intended flavor 5)Noodles are more apt to get mushy when cooked in the soup and the soup have Less broth"
