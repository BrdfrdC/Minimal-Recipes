"reviewBody": "Thank you Grandma! She knew the smoked bacon flavor and the caramelized potatoes and onions are perfect compliments to the corn. This also gets high marks for such a simple and quick meal. Only one way to improve on this is to use fresh corn cut and scraped off the cob, then fried in with the potatoes and onions, then add tbsp sugar at the end which is also in canned cream corn. FYI boiling the cobs gets great stock for this recipe and others! Obviously fresh corn and stock will change the quick and easy by doubling your time. Evaporated milk or a can of cream soup will substitute half and half if you donâ€™t have it on hand. I still say grandma knew how to keep it simple and delicious! Thanks for sharing this keeper recipe!!! ðŸ˜‹"

I like to shred the potatoes &amp; add a chopped green pepper &amp; sometimes a can of chopped chicken. I use 4 cups chicken broth in place of water with the frozen corn, decrease the salt to about 1 tsp, precook the bacon &amp; add it at the very end to keep it crispy. It doesn't need a thickener if the potatoes are shredded. Milk works just fine if you do not have half &amp; half &amp; I don't bother warming the milk before adding it. This is a family favorite!"

I cooked an entire pound of bacon instead of the called for 1/4 cup, substituted chicken broth for water and added some shredded cheddar cheese. It was so good I made it a second time a week later and passed out a container to a few friends who also raved about it. I will def be making this again!"
