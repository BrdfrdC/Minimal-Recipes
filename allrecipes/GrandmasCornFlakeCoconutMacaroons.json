"reviewBody": "These are super easy to make and taste great! They're not your typical dense macaroon though, they're more like meringues with extra chewy crunchiness, thanks to the coconut and corn flakes.\n\nWhipping one egg white in a mixmaster is next to impossible, so I whipped it by hand. The recipe doesn't specify, so I used sweetenend shredded coconut. The final mixture doesn't hold together very well, so you just have to scoop some up with a teaspoon and stack it. The egg white will rise a bit and hold them together well.\n\nI followed the recipe exactly, but used parchment paper on an ungreased cookie sheet and baked for exactly 20 minutes. Mine came out perfectly tan (lighter than lillian's photo), slightly crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside. \n\nI might try with unsweetened coconut (and coconut extract) next time, as they are quite sweet. Will definitely make again!"

"reviewBody": "These macaroons were excellent! I made them exactly as written! But I did crush the cornflakes a little because they were very large flakes. The macaroons were crunchy and sweet. I love the addition of the cornflakes because it keeps the macaroons from being too coconutty. I only got about 20 macaroons from this recipe. I will definitely double the batch next time! Great easy recipe!"
