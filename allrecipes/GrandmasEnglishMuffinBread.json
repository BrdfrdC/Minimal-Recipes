I baked an additional 7 minutes to the recipe -- worked for my oven. I will make this again."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is exactly one half of the recipe I've used for the last 30 years. I make it every Christmas. Tastes great!\nOne difference, the quarter tsp of baking powder should read \"baking soda\". And I'm not sure if a quarter tsp of anything will make a difference.\nThe main thing is making a yeast bread with milk instead of just water.\nForget the bread machine; you can mix it in a bowl.\nOne other change, if you use the full 3 cups of flour, it's really difficult to mix. Use a bit less flour, don't knead the dough, just put it into a greased loaf pan dusted with corn meal. Let it rise and bake.\nToast before eating. Great with just butter or for tuna fish sandwiches."

Two minutes before it was done I put butter on top. Came out golden brown. And little nooks and crannies! Will try muffins next time.\nUPDATE: I made this bread again. Had to bake it in my extra large toaster oven. Came out good again. Used honey instead of sugar and bread machine yeast. Used the dough cycle on the bread maker and it rose up great. I did have to put it under the broiler to brown it."

If you divide it out your bread is going to be about the height of biscotti."

I then divided the dough into six balls, dusted with cornmeal, then flattened a bit. Placed on greased and lightly cornnmealed sheets. Covered with lint-free towels and let rise ~45 min. (They really didn't rise much but they expand more while baking). Baked at 425 deg F oven for 8 min, then turned over and baked another 7 min. I could not wait until breakfast, so I just had a half with butter and jelly. Wonderful texture, crispy outside, softer inside, and better than store-bought! Who knew? Thank you Stephanie and your Grandma!"

Mixed the milk &amp; water in a small bowl &amp; put it in the micro for 2 minutes, put the yeast in &amp; let that sit for about 10 minutes. Then put the yeast mixture in the dry ingredients &amp; mixed it with a spoon &amp; then with my hands. I covered it &amp; let it rise for 1 hour. This dough was really fluffy. I do eventually want to try this in a coffee can, but I rolled it out &amp; it made it 6 english muffins to my suprise &amp; I made the rest of the dough into a loaf. Let everything rise some more while the oven pre heated. Put them in the oven at 400Â° for 8 minutes &amp; flipped for 6 minutes. &amp; well that was too much time for the muffins. I left the loaf in for 5 more minutes. These were really fluffy &amp; I got the crevases in the bread, but it lacks the english muffin flavor. I have made the recipe called English Muffins countless times &amp; although Ive never gotten the crevases, its got that good flavor of english muffins. I think I will try adding a bit of baking powder to my go to english muffin recipe &amp; maybe get those crevases we're shooting for. I love the texture of these though. After making this recipe, I give them each a 4. &amp; I dont have time to change the other review so Im giving a 5."

I rolled out the dough until it was an inch thick, cut out 8 3 inch wide muffins, reworked the leftover dough and put that into a small loaf pan. After they'd raised I put them in the oven for 8 minutes and then flipped them over and dropped the temp down to 375 for another 6 minutes. Don't turn them over before you cook them for 8 minutes otherwise you'll smoosh out the nooks and crannies.\n\nI don't have a bread machine so I mixed the dry ingredients, made a well in the middle and then mixed it all together. It was easy.\n\nThese have the BEST flavor of any English Muffin's I've ever had. Next time I'll add cinnamon and raisins."

I mixed it with my BM, then baked in oven. It turned out very heavy and did not rise alot and was more like french bread than english muffin bread. I will give it another try and see if it is any different"

The bread was denser than I'd like, no nooks and crannies and I didn't think it had any of the flavor of English Muffins. It wasn't at all sour. The loaf was very nice, toasted nicely and was quickly gobbled up. I have no idea what or why I should divide it into two unequal parts, so I didn't."

I used the coffee can idea, and like another reviewer i made the mistake of using a can with a lip. To get the bread out I simply opened the other end of the can with a can opener, cut the bubbly round top off the bread and it came right out the bottom. We snacked on the golden top while it was fresh and the perfectly circular bread has been making sanwiches. 20 minutes in the oven worked for me.***** NOTE FOR BAKING IN CANS WITH LIPS. I found that the cans with lips can be easily rid of the lips with a can opener!"

Very English muffin like. I think the trick is to avoid working the dough as it was full of air pockets and very light once it came out of the bread maker. Also allowing it to rise (turn the oven on and place over the vent burner) is very important to avoid having a dense bread."
