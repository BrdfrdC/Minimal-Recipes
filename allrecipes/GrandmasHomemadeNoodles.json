My grandma's noodles were rolled and cut thick like Reames noodles. That is what we all remember...especially over mashed potatoes. I will try this with the baking powder and see what happens but the recipe sounds spot on as is. My grandma also told my mother that her secret was adding water to the dough. We called them tough noodles."

"reviewBody": "I used to get a turkey noodle soup from a restaurant I worked at back in the late 80's called Bakers Square here in SoCal. It was the only place that make nice thick noodles like these and the mouth-feel was delightful for a poultry soup. \n\nThe comment to use cake flour is def. a good one for these. If you like a clear broth I also recommend making and straining your soup stock and vegetables into a separate pot and boil your noodles in salted water separately. Drain and Rinse them with cold water to prevent sticking together and then keep in a zip lock or Tupperware until ready to place into the dinner bowls. This keeps your broth from getting too starchy and changing the soup into an undesirable milky floury broth."

It readily formed a ball and then I kneaded for a few minutes, rolled it, and done. I did have to add an extra tbsp of milk to get a noodle consistency on the dough. It came together fine without it, but it was a bit dry. To be fair though I think that's more a function of dry winter months than the recipe itself."

After all the work leading up to Christmas this simple meal is one we all love and it is so much easier on the cook than a fancy dinner. I added the baking powder this year and was very happy with the result. Sometimes my noodles were a little tough but the baking powder lightened them up.

"reviewBody": "I was fairly confused by the consistency of the dough initially. I mixed the flour and baking powder, combined everything else in a different bowl, then gradually added the dry ingredients to the wet. What I ended up with was so wet that it wasn't even slightly ready to be rolled. I ended having to add quite a lot more flour before I had a workable ball of dough. At that point the rolling, cutting, waiting, (shorter) drying, and cooking all went fairly easily. The problem was the flavor was definitely much more noticeably floury and the egg gets kinda lost.\n\nI tried two batches, got the same results. Based on reading other reviews, I feel like I must be doing something wrong. It seems like the majority of people had a good ball of dough with very little work. I ended up with a puddle of dough.\n\nGonna try it again, but next time I'm going to cut the milk down to 2 tsp and see what happens."

"reviewBody": "So sorry. I'm about to tell you all the changes I made. Fair warning to all you who hate us recipe tweakers. I tripled this recipe for 7 people. I did 2 medium eggs, 4 medium egg yolks, and 2 small glugs of olive oil (maybe 2 T). No milk. It ended up extra tough, so I added maybe 1/4 - 1/3 cup water. It was SO lovely. The noodles had so much rich flavor from the egg yolks, and I loved how the noodles puffed up from the baking powder. Thanks for the basic recipe to give me the confidence to try making my own noodles for the first time. We LOVED them. BTW, we just served them tossed with butter and salt and pepper, so we could really taste the flavor."

Made the Eggplant Bolognese to go with it. *NOTES* I tried a few different flour combos and with/without baking powder. Did not care for the semolina but may experiment a lower percentage, as I read somewhere that if you're planning to freeze the pasta, adding semolina is best to maintain the integrity of the pasta. Also, the baking powder (optional ingredient) lightens the dough *slightly*, making the cooked product slightly less rubbery. Both ways are EXCELLENT."

For the 2nd batch I added 1 T of milk, keeping the rest the same. Still a bit dry, but more cohesive. Both cooked up well &amp; were indistinguishable form each other in the end. They were a hit!

After 20 minutes sitting on the floured waxed paper, the dough stuck badly and I could hardly get it off to try and roll again. Then, when they finally cooked they got way too thick, Need to emphasize to roll very, very thin. Mine were still raw in the middle after 15 minutes of cooking and didn't even bend like a noodle. Some of the little, thin pieces were great. So next time will be better I am sure."
