Should I cook them longer in the slow cooker? Also, can you confirm that I was to use ground pork sausage (which I did, you know, the Jimmy Dean breakfast kind)? I'm cooking them for another hour in hopes the rice will soften and fluff inside the meat mixture. Any input would be so appreciated! About how many rolls was I to make? The recipe did not indicate.

No burnt hands and the Cabbage leaves are just as pliable as boiled ones."

I didn't have any trouble with the cooking time or steaming the cabbage, but the dish itself had no flavor. Also, I'm left with tons of extra meat mixture that I will now need to doctor up to put into another dish. I would not recommend this at all."

Since I had more beef broth than tomato juice, I mixed a can of tomato past with a of quart of beef broth, to save the tomato juice (due to stay home orders). I overlooked adding the water from cooking the cabbage, which I won't do again. I baked these in my cast iron Dutch oven at 350 degrees. They would have been ready at two hours, but I was on an electronic meeting, so left them in the oven for 3 hours. This is why the extra liquid would have been handy. Still, nothing was burned and the cabbage rolls were amazing."

And I always use Sacramento Tomato Juice if you can find it. I pour it over the cabbage rolls before I bake them. It just adds a special flavor. Some brands of tomato juice and vegetable juice are too sweet for my taste. I really like the flavor you get from the Sacramento brand tomato juice. I make a big batch and freeze the leftovers."

"reviewBody": "Good old fashioned recipe which we usually baked in the oven. I was happily surprised how it came out in the crock pot. The only thing I did different was not use tomato juice. I mixed some canned tomato sauce with a carton of chicken broth. Next time, I will season it up a little more to suit our tastes, maybe use spicy italian sausage instead of mild, but as written, this is very good. We liked it! To the reviewer named punkin...the rice is wet because it was rinsed...not cooked. Also, I did not use the water from the cooked cabbage. I personally don't think it would add any significant flavor but if you need more liquid in the pot, it's right there."

"reviewBody": "To confused Punkin: wet refers to rinsed rice. Depends if you get whole long rice or cheaper version. Also big factor, many methods, times, ways to cook cabbage rolls. Stove top, shorter cook time needs longer time to soften rice. Ground pork (not Bob Evans type breakfast, spiced sausage) should be used. Don’t form very tight meatballs, to let rice expand. Paprika, 1 to 2 T. Mix in filling. Put bigger leaves on bottom of pot. No need at all to save cabbage water. If your V8 and tomatoes WITH juice don’t just cover rolls, add a little water to pot. Bring to just boil and then let simmer about two hours."

I didn't use sausage in the meat and rice mixture, but did add Polska kielbasa because that's what my family did. I enjoyed this meal, and it was not that difficult to make. Thank you for the recipe."
