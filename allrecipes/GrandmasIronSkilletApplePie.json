I‚Äôm always afraid that food will stick to it, but so many people swear by their cast iron so I‚Äôm trying to get over the fear lol. This recipe didn‚Äôt stick at all. üòä I have an easy recipe for pie crust so I made my own, and I used a 12‚Äù skillet since I don't have a 9‚Äù one. It took a little longer to cook than the stated time but it turned out beautifully. I had two pieces. Yum!!"

"reviewBody": "So, while we liked this pie as is, I have altered the recipe a little bit. 1. I only used 1/2 stick of butter in the skillet, rather than a whole one. 2. I only used 1/3 cup brown sugar with the butter in the skillet. The rest goes in the dry mix. 3. I only use 3/4 cup white sugar, plus a tblsp to sprinkle on the top. 4. I add the following spices: 1/4 tsp allspice, 1/8 tsp ground cloves. 5. I mix the dry ingredients in a bowl and then coat the apple slices before filling the pastry. The cloves really add a little something that people really like, but just can't quite identify, until I tell them the 'secret' ingredient."

I cut back on the sugar by 1/3 because I used 7 medium-sized really sweet Gala apples that were about to turn, and as I sprinkled sugar, and saw it pile up, it seemed to be too much. Everything else went super well, just as per recipe! Wish I had 4 more apples in the pie! I will use this recipe again and leave the apple slices bigger for more body. Beautifully flaky, sweet, sticky and delicious!"

Wish the interior crust was a bit more flaky and crispy though although I only baked it for 30 minutes because it was getting late and we were hungry. :) But pretty easy to make as long as the crusts aren't frozen or too cold. I added nutmeg and allspice at each layer in addition to the nutmeg to give it extra flavor. My husband loved it, so I would try again but just leaving it in for longer and definitely including the extra spices."

I think it would be GReAt just as written but I did lower the sugar amounts as others suggested and it was STILL amazing. For those with the bottom sticking to the pan, I did not let the sugar cook in the oven while preparing the apples (as the recipe kinda suggests). I just melted the butter on the stove, added 1/2 c brown sugar, let it melt a little then started the layering. This will be be made again. Probably before the end of the year. Try it!"

TYSM for this ingenious recipe, who would've thought?! I also made some homemade whipped cream and added some liquor to put on top, recipe on this site. My husband was WOWED to the max! Me, too! *used organic Pink Lady apples and basted crust with egg nog!"

When people have tried it I have been told it is the best apple pie they have ever had. I take all the credit even though it could not be simpler. Worst part is cutting up the apples and cleaning the cast iron afterwards. Just make this pie, exactly as written and you too could be a dessert hero."

I also arranged the slices of apples in a spiral on both levels and added 10 minutes to the total baking time.\n\nCame out better than I thought. Next time I'm going attempt thicker apple slices."

Have made 3 times, each time with different apples. I add walnuts or sliced almonds to the first layer of apples. Best pie recipe EVER! My photo would have looked exactly the same as the one in the recipe."

I will try next time reducing the sugar. But I like sweet! Thanks for delicious recipe that I get to use my mom's cast iron skillet. She cooked everything in that thing."

I like it better than regular apple pie. Haven given out the recipe twice already. For my taste, I will reduce the sugar in the layers to 1/4 cup per layer and just a dusting on top next time as it really doesn't need the extra sweetness, especially if serving with ice cream. Will be making this for the Turkey Day dinner. Oh, and it did bake over my iron skillet a bit leaving a sweet oven mess to clean up."

HOWEVER - the bottom crust was limp and the middle crust not even close to being done - just soggy dough; don't see how it could bake completely sandwiched between layers of wet apples. the brown sugar/butter on bottom of skillet was like peanut brittle. would like to make again if i knew how to avoid these problems... i baked it longer than recipe, about 55 minutes. any longer and the top crust would have been burned."
