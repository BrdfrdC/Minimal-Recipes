I thought it would at least thicken when cooled - but didn‚Äôt happen either. I saw a review by another user - who recommended to boil it max 1 minute - so that the cornstarch doesn‚Äôt lose its thickening power. This should definitely be mentioned in the recipe! Will not make again and don‚Äôt recommend."

"reviewBody": "Easy to follow. This was my first attempt at lemon meringue pie, and it turned out beautifully. I reduced the sugar in both the filling and meringue by about 1/4 because I like my desserts less sweet. Next time I'll use an extra egg white or two for the meringue. I only had enough to just barely cover the pie. Tip: place meringue around the edges of pie first, sealing to the crust. Then carefully dollop the rest around the middle and carefully spread to cover. If you drop all the meringue in the middle of the hot pie filling (as in video), it will sink and be difficult to spread over the surface to the edges."

This recipe made the meringue easy, though it certainly takes longer than I initially expected. It came out very well. I made this recipe sugar-free since my husband is diabetic. I used Stevia and was surprised it left a bit of an aftertaste. Going to try again with monkfruit instead. I will say the lemon flavor wasn't as strong as I would haved liked (possible b/c of the stevia). I will add a third lemon next time."

I didn't use milk instead of water and I didn't increase or adjust any other ingredient amounts. The pie came out perfectly!!!!! A light creamy yellow color, not very thick filling layer, but so nice and tart! This recipe is a KEEPER!!"

"reviewBody": "Love this recipe! It is nearly like the one I have used for years. I also make a 4 egg pie but use 1/4 to 1/3 cup of cornstarch rather than a cornstarch/flour mixture. I only use 3/4 cup sugar but 2 cups of water. Lemon juice is 1/3 cup. This is usually 2 lemons but the ones I made the other day took 5 for 2 pies. I also add 2 teaspoons of lemon juice and a shake of cream of tartar to the egg whites for the meringue. I do mix it up differently. I place ALL ingredients in a blender (this includes egg yolks and butter). I blend and then pour into a glass batter bowl. I then microwave on high for about 8 minutes. Whisk after 3 minutes. Then again after 2 minutes, 2 minutes, and 1 minute. Much simpler and I promise you can‚Äôt tell the difference in the finished product."

The lemon curd was delicious and I had some that was leftover in a cup which stayed thick and very yummy, but from the time I added the meringue it began to create liquid (and yes I let the curd cool) the meringue shrank and I had to pour out liquid. Not an easy recipe if following it yields sweet soup."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe! I follow the instructions exactly and it comes out perfect each time. Be sure to use juice from an actual lemon, and be sure to use the zest. To those having problems, remember to bake your shell first, let it cool. Add your lemon curd and put the meringue on while it is still hot. Also, be sure the meringues covers the pie right to the crust so that the pie is sort of sealed by the meringue. And finally.... Do not refrigerate at all until the pie has cooled completely. A lot of time these things are forgotten, and it leads to watery pie or soggy crust."

I would also say you could even do 5 eggs instead of 4 for both the yolk and the merengue. I haven‚Äôt tested this theory yet, but I think it would actually make a nice texture.
