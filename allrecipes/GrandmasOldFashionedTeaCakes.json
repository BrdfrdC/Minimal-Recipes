I made the recipe as written the first time and when tasting they were good cookies but something was missing. I made this recipe a 2nd time I used 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/4 c buttermilk, and the zest of a small lemon and this gave me super tender, soft, southern tea cakes. The orihinL recipe is good and helped me accomplish the flavor I was looking for. My granny didn't write down recipes the buttermilk was the missing link. if you add the milk alternate with flour starting with flour ending with flour."

For the amount of sugar, it needs more flour.\n\nInstead of the nutmeg, I used an 1/8th tsp of cinnamon because nutmeg can be kind of strong.\n\nOverall, this is a good recipe. I wouldn't even say this is a good starter because the tea cake are very good. I' just going from the ones my grandma used to make, that is all\n\nThanks for posting this recipe, I will pass it on to all who say they like it. a1"

"reviewBody": "I had to search around to find a recipe close to what I remember my mom making. This one was close and the first time I made it; I knew it was missing something...lemon extract. So, I included all the ingredients but made a slight change to a couple of the ingredients - 1 TSP Ground Nutmeg, 1/2 TSP Vanilla Extract and 1/2 TSP Lemon Extract. By adding more nutmeg and including the lemon extract in the calculation with the vanilla extract and based on my oven I changed the temperature to 350 degrees and it takes 18-20 minutes per batch to cook. I make sure the edges are slightly brown and then I take them out. Because the cookie cutters are so large today, I took a stemmed wine glass and used it as my cutter, making sure that I dip it in loose flour to avoid the dough sticking to the glass. This made a batch of 40 nice size cookies but, not oversized. \n\nBoth of my sons confirms...They are just like the ones my mother used to make. My youngest son (now 29 years old) is the reason I went on the hunt for this recipe because he talked about how my mom would make special batches just for him...so I had to find this recipe. Thank you RGA"

"reviewBody": "My mother has made teacakes for decades and my siblings and I fight over our share of them (as well as her sweet potato pies). She doesn't actually have a recipe and doesn't bake much anymore, so I thought I'd try this recipe to see how it stacks up.\n\nIn my family's experienced opinion (lol) a teacake should be buttery, not overly sweet, and the nutmeg flavor should be evident. This recipe makes a really good butter cookie, sweet with a great texture, but not so much of a teacake. \n\nI used a little less sugar than the recipe called for and added nutmeg, but still tastes mostly like a butter cookie. I also made a lemon glaze for some of them (lemon juice and powdered sugar) to kick them up a notch. Hubby likes those. \n\n4 stars for a good butter cookie!"

I don't think I would use this recipe again. IF, and only IF I make these tea cakes again, I would use less flour and add either lemon juice or lemon extract in the place of vanilla. I am from the South, and these tea cakes aren't something that you would normally find but they are not bad. Southern tea cakes are really moist and when you bite into it you can taste the moist lemon and vanilla flavors. I also feel there wasn't enough nutmeg in it. But that's pretty much it."

I just took them off the pan immediately and they were perfect. Whatever the case with the baking time, though, the result is quite tasty, with a delicate sweet flavor, and a nice soft and slightly chewy texture."

Rather than rolling outward, which will often cause your dough to crack, roll along the edges, more TOWARD the center than away from it. It is the weight of the rolling pin that thins the dough. Rolling along the edges, inward is less likely to tear your dough. Also, while this type of dough needs to be chilled before rolling, it cannot be TOO cold or, again, it will tear. Persuade your dough with the rolling pin. No fear."

"reviewBody": "Thank you for uploading this recipe. I have been searching for one that taste like the tea cakes my grandmother used to make. This is the only one that suffice. Many of the other recipes I found contained too many ingredients. \nAlthough I was a child, I know my grandmother didn't use a slue of things, just simple everyday ingredients that were in her cabinets and refrigerator. I found the recipe last night and made the tea cakes/cookies today. They are wonderful. Filled with the aroma and taste of a rural southern childhood of long ago. I can't wait to send a batch to my siblings to get their reactions. The only problem I had was working with the dough. I'm not an expert on using a rolling pin. So, after allowing it to harden in the refrigerator, I just handled them as I would a cookie dough. I scooped a bit up in a ball and hand shaped them. What is funny is that the end results were all shapes and sizes, exactly like my nanna's. I guess she had a trouble working with her dough as well. Once again thank you, of all the recipes that I have found on this site. This is the one that is most dear."

"reviewBody": "I hate to spoil the great rating, but these are not quite the same taste as the elders in my family. The amount of nutmeg was only a hint and it leaves this tasting like a great butter cookie. Our family's recipe is more like a mini cookie cake. I wasn't sure how long to keep the dough refrigerated and after a few hours it was too hard to roll. After sitting out for 30 minutes it was ready. Keep the flour handy as you'll have to keep flouring your board and rolling pin unless you use wax paper on top and beneath the dough. This is great tasting dough and I think I preferred that over the actual cookie. Unfortunately, I'll have to keep searching for authentic tea cakes instead of these \"cookies.\""

Ms. Lucy (a grandma figure) used to baby sit me and she made tea cakes that looked and tasted JUST LIKE these! I am almost 50 years old and I've tried many tea cake recipes trying to recapture the taste and texture of Ms. Lucy's tea cakes. Until now, I was unsuccessful. These cookies are absolutely delicious!!!! Not only are they delicious, but I get to savor wonderful memories of Ms. Lucy reaching into airtight plastic container (an empty lard bucket LOL) and saying, \"Sweetie, would you like a tea cake?\" :). Many thanks to the person who shared this wonderful recipe."

(my father was from Mississippi and loved to bake) Through the years I've been searching for this recipes and never found it. Then one day I decided to try again and that's when I hit \"pay dirt\" I ran across this one! Honey, honey when I read the ingredients I knew this was \"the\" one I had been searching for. As stated they taste even better a day or two later. I made two batches for Christmas and my daughters' friends came over and had never had the honour of tasting tea cakes. I don't have to tell you the results. This has been a big hit and also introducing the younger generations to a little of their history to them. Baking from scratch is almost a dying issue - but thanks to recipes like this one - there is hope. I was sooooo excited to find this I called my brother (who also loves to cook and bake) and we both were jumping on the outside as well as on the inside. The key to this recipe is the NUTMEG! That's what makes the unique flavoring. For those of you who are thinking of trying it- you won't go wrong! So for all of you ladies (oooops sorry- gentlemen who love to cook/bake) add this to your recipe box. Like others - make more than one batch (freeze in seperate bags) so when the urge hits, you can have a fresh batch of \"cookies\" anytime. I have a taste for some right now and I have all of the ingredients. I feel a bake on. :)"

Sugar cookies are meant to be iced and eaten alone, tea cakes like this are meant to be dipped in tea or coffee. While the people I gave this as gifts to said they loved these just plain, they enjoyed them far more once dipped in tea or coffee. These cookies absorb most of their flavor from what they're dipped in, so keep that in mind when you make these."

I was shocked with the results after all the glowing reviews. I followed the recipe to the letter and my result was a cookie that puffed after 5 minutes and ended flat, but fully cooked, after 8 min the oven. They had an odd overly egg-y flavor and an undesirable texture. I'm guessing, based on reviews, this is the type of cookie that awakens nostalgia rather than tastebuds. If you didnt grow up with your grandma baking this cookie, try a different recipe. I hate to waste so the only thing I can think to do with the rest of this dough is use it as a shell for a tart or a nutbar."
