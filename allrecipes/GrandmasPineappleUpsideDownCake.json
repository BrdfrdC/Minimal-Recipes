Good idea.I used maraschino cherries and a few broken walnuts. Might try some orange peel next time. Oh yea, there’ll be a next time. We loved the texture of the cake. Still too much brown sugar and butter. Fun recipe to make in a 10” iron skillet. Be sure to cool on a rack for 10 minutes before flipping."

I also added some fresh mulberries and rhubarb pieces around the pineapple which gave it a delightful unexpected twist on flavor and presentation. Was very good! Would give 5 stars if there were some type of oil incorporated into the cake batter, because although mine was not dry - you can tell from the texture it will not be forgiving if over baked."

"reviewBody": "I just finished baking this and added a photo. I haven't tried it, it's for a party tomorrow but I will update after the tasting.\n\nThe baking...\nPretty easy recipe. However, while making the sugar butter I turned my back for a sec to start the dry ingredients and burned it, so I dumped it, cleaned my skillet and started over. The second go, I stirred constantly, but I think I let it cook a bit too long, as the butter and sugar kind of split and darkened. It looked perfect moments before but I was waiting for the sugar to melt a little more. I used it anyway. Smells like some yummy browned butter!\n\nEverything else in the recipe went well. When I put the batter in the skillet it didn't look like it was going to be enough to cover it, but after spreading, it was just enough. However, if the cake is delicious, I may add a half or double the batter next time as the cake isn't as thick as I envisioned. Like another reviewer, I chose to use fresh cherries instead of pecans (and used fresh pineapple too).\n\nTo be continued..."

"reviewBody": "I teach English classes in Guatemala, and students asked to make a cake. Because we have access to fresh, local and sweet pineapple, we tried this, mainly because it doesn't take a boxed cake mix. They cut fresh pineapple, made the sugar butter sauce, decorated the bottom of the cake, and we baked it. They were very impressed by the beautiful presentation, and ate it still warm. \n\nI will make this again, but with some changes. I think it was too sweet and the amount of butter was too much, I think. It was very good, but I will make 1/2 more batter, and use less sugar and butter so that it is more cakey."

Incredibly easy, but bland as well. I think I'll try a different recipe since I'd like a bit more flavor and a less spongy texture. Not bad, though, and would likely be good with strawberries and cream instead of pineapple. I didn't notice until I started making it that this called for nuts instead of the usual cherries. Since I didn't have what was called for and did have cherries, I just used those. Thank you for the recipe."
