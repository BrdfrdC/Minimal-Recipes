Someone said use allspice if you don't have ground cloves. another reviewer said reduce it to quarter teaspoon. I didn't think I had ground cloves so I put quarter teaspoon of allspice in the sauce ingredients which I mix all together before adding to the ground beef mixture. took a sample and really couldn't taste it then I found I really did have ground cloves and added 1/4 teaspoon of those. didn't find it overbearing at all! overall it is a great recipe and I will make it again! Next time I will use all ground cloves instead of mixing the allspice with the ground cloves."

If it's too sweet for some Cooks try adding a cinnamon stick into your mixture which tamps down the sweetness a little bit. As a nurse who runs all day I seriously enjoy smelling and tasting this -- in our break room-- especially on a cold dreary day, when I finally get time to sit down for a meal. Great job on this recipe which brings a flavor party to my mouth!!"

This was a good weekend meal for us, but it takes quite a while to make so I don't know if I could make it during the week. By the time you chop the green pepper and onion, cook the ground been, and then combine all of the ingredients and let it simmer...yeah, that would be a late dinner for us. My husband, two year old, and I all really liked it, and my five year old thought it was just okay. I will probably make this again sometime. Thank you for the recipe, JENNCARLEN!"

I only had about 3/4 of a cup of ketchup, and I think that was fine. I used organic, which has WAY less sugar. Anything sweeter would have been way too sweet for us. We will definitely put this on the dinner rotation!"

"reviewBody": "Excellent sloppy joe recipe!!! I have made these a few times now, but I feel even more compelled to rate this after last night's meal. I made these last night for dinner but realized I didn't have enough ketchup. I found \"in-a-pinch ketchup\" recipe on AR website and made that in place of the normal Heinz ketchup. Wow - the sloppy joes were delicious, and I will use that as my ketchup from now on when making these \"gourmet\" sloppy joes. I did add 2 cloves of garlic (for 2 lbs of beef). We had leftover sloppy joes, so I made sloppy joe paninis for lunch today. I caramelized onions and used pepper jack cheese - excellent flavor combo and turns ordinary sloppy joes into gourmet sloppy joes. Thank you for sharing the recipe!"

That sounded a bit much! I went ahead and let it simmer for 30 minutes and all of the flavors really blended together! It was so yummy!
