The chipotle peppers adds a whole layer of flavor with a hint of sweetness/heat. On each serving I add some shredded sharp cheddar and chopped green onions on top."

"reviewBody": "I used some homemade black bean soup &amp; used 2 cans chopped tomatoes- 1 that I pureed w/an immersion blender. To shorten prep time, I used frozen &amp; chopped onions &amp; peppers &amp; jarred minced garlic. I liked the end result &amp; even more surprising- my non-vegetarian husband liked it too! I consider any no meat meal a success if my husband likes it!\n\n\n\nP.S. This &amp; many other recipes call for a couple stalks of celery. Being the only raw celery eater in my household, it is always difficult to use all the celery before it spoils. I googled freezing celery &amp; tried the recommendations of dropping stalks in boiling water for 3 minutes &amp; then plunged it in a ice bath, removed it &amp; allowed it to drain throughly &amp; froze it in freezer bags. I have used the frozen celery since &amp; it is perfect in this recipe &amp; others. An unexpected bonus is that it is easier to chop when frozen. Do not thaw it before chopping &amp; adding it to your recipe &amp; it tastes &amp; looks like you used fresh!"

"reviewBody": "I had to make some changes from the original, but it‚Äôs hard for me not to when using recipes. This recipe is pretty easy, but I have a preference for using certain techniques and adding additional flavor. I first cooked the onions and (Extra) garlic and Iadded some cut up pieces of sun dried tomatoes (maybe a tablespoon or more), and about one inch pieces of dried California and dried ancho chili‚Äôs to give it a nice complex and slightly smoky taste to go along with the sweetness, also three fresh tomatoes instead of canned. I also added a little bit of water and later some white northern beans. Otherwise I generally stuck to the recipe, cooking probably atleast 4 hours on the slow cooker setting of my instant pot. Came out delicious- it was meant for making lunches, but everyone ate it for dinner and only two portions left. I‚Äôm saving this recipe with my modifications. Thanks!"

"reviewBody": "First, I found that it was very crunchy after two hours‚ÄîI then cooked it on low for a couple more hours. It has a good variety of beans plus the corn, but I thought it needed much more chili flavoring if it‚Äôs going to be called chili and not just a bean dish. I was afraid to do much because we were feeding young children, but I‚Äôd try doubling the chili powder and adding some chipotle for flavor. You could also or alternatively do some crushed red pepper. It‚Äôs not about heat‚Äîit‚Äôs about flavor development. I skipped the celery because I didn‚Äôt have any, but otherwise followed the recipe. I notice the recipe has no salt‚Äîit didn‚Äôt need it. We topped it with zero fat Greek yogurt and some shredded cheese."

I kept the bean combination (shout out to the reviewer who said the black bean soup can be found in the Hispanic aisle made by Goya) andI literally nixed the rest of the recipe. Instead, into the crock pot I added the beans, 28 oz can crushed tomatoes, 14.5 oz diced tomatoes, 1 cup water or vegetable broth, 3 tbsp of Chili powder, 1 tbsp cumin, 1 - 2 chilis in adobo finely diced, 1 tsp garlic powder, 2 tsp salt, 1 can of corn at the very last minute of cooking. THE BEST CHILI I‚ÄôVE EVER HAD."

"reviewBody": "This has been a regular of mine for a long time. Instead of using canned beans I prepare the equivalent amount of dried beans ahead of time using a mix of black beans, pinto beans and kidney beans along with a half tablespoon of molasses in place of the baked beans (this chili can be very sweet as written.) The mix of spices enhances the sweetness of this chili along with the corn. If you are looking for a sweeter chili then this one is worth trying."

I also added extra chili powder, celery seed instead of celery, dry mustard, dried cilantro, smoked paprika, cumin, a few dashes of chipotle Tabasco, and a small can of mild green chilies.

No. However, as a foodie and wine enthusiast who regularly cooks gourmet meals, this is a perfectly nice little recipe for a hectic weeknight in the fall, or a large impromptu gathering."

We underspiced at first and then halfed the batch and spiced over the top with a ton of cayenne pepper, paprika and a blend of jalepeno, oregano, and cheese powder(victorian epicures cheese and jalapeno dip mix). I also thickened and quickened this dish by adding potato starch and a bit of corn starch as thickeners. Sour cream and cheese are both great toppers to this dish.
