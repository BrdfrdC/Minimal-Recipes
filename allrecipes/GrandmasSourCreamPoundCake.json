"reviewBody": "Before trying, I read thru about 100 reviews and changed things accordingly.. 1/4 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp baking soda, 1 1/2 cups butter, no mace, 1 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp almonds extract, beat eggs 10 mins each before adding the next, be sure to butter your pan/dish completely but not clumpy or thick. Coat with flour and tap out excess. If you notice empty spots after flouring, add a dab of softened/melted butter and flour. Be sure to SMOOTH the batter as much as possible after transferring to the pan. Bake on 325 for 1 hour 20mins. Comes out perfect every time!! I've made this for Thanksgiving and Christmas for the last 3 years. It doesn't survive the day."

Perhaps it was a typo? 2 sticks of butter or one cup. Certainly not two cups! Other than that I get rave reviews from anyone who tastes it. In the final minutes of baking I pour a mixture of lemon juice and sugar on top ( 2 Tbs sugar and 2-3 TVs of lemon juice). I make two loaf pans. This doesn’t last long I my house!"

The recipe doesn’t specify salted or unsalted butter, but I assumed it was salted from the small amount of salt to be added. However, I always use unsalted butter, so I modified the recipe by increasing the amount of salt to 1 teaspoon. This is a beautiful cake that tastes delicious. I had to decrease the temperature to 325 about halfway through the bake because the top was burning. Next time I’ll bake it at 325 for the entire baking time. This recipe is definitely a keeper!"

Thanks!\nI’ve made several pound cakes from this site that were very good-but this one takes the cake!\nI did not use mace, nor a substitution. I baked it at 325° \nIt makes enough batter to fill my “Heritage” Bundt pan and a loaf pan. It freezes well and stays so moist."

Another reviewer suggested greasing the pan and then using sugar instead of flour. I did that even though I wasn't using a bundt pan (duh), but the outer crust of the loaf had a wonderful crunch to it that I will repeat next time using the bundt."

I thought I'd done something wrong, and even went to my 82 y.o. mom for advice on what I may have done wrong... it wasn't me, it's the cake. You could tell something was wrong when you dumped it onto a plate. It's so heavy &amp; saturated with butter, it caved in on itself in the middle while it was cooking; I mean there was literally a dent all around the cake. When you cut a piece and look at the inside you can see a different color which led me to think it wasn't cooked long enough, even though I cooked it like the recipe called for. Nope, that was butter. YUCK!!!"

"reviewBody": "I made this cake a few days ago. I took the suggestions from the comments and added the baking powder. I also felt that the cake needed more extract so next time I will add a tbs of the vanilla and 1/2 tbs almond. I cut the sugar down by 1/2 cup as I felt 3 cups would be too sweet. I think if you are going to use a glaze then the sugar can be reduced an additional 1/4 cup ( I don’t like overly sweet cakes)Also, beat the sugar and butter for the 7 to 10 minutes as suggested by others. I think this is a helpful step. I only used 3 sticks of butter as per a few other reviews, it was greasy. I baked at 325 degrees for the suggested time. Cake came out perfect. Moist. Nice crumb. Won’t choke you. Not greasy. Haven’t had a good pound cake in a loooong while and this hits the spot. It’s been 4 days since I baked it and last piece is still moist and the flavor is better. So I would suggest baking this a day or two before you serve it. I am baking another one later. This is a keeper! ( I gave it a 4 star only because of the changes that had to be made)"

This time I only put a tiny pinch of mace since the first time I used too much and that was off putting to people. Another mistake I made the first time was over beating the ingredients- I gently folded in the dry ingredients until just combined and the texture was much better. I don't know what it is, even with those two fixes, no one really ate the cake. In general I much prefer homemade stuff to store bought but this cake doesn't capture the richness or the texture of a store pound cake that so many like. Maybe its the bundt pan? I don't know but I don't think I'll be giving it a third chance."

Must have bake cake at 325\nthe last time because I don't remember top of cake darkening\nlike it did at 350. Will bake again"

Just add a touch of vanilla as this recipe doesn't call for enough. 2 TSP is needed. Add 1/2 TSP Baking Powder. Needed a bit of air. And no way need as much butter. Cut in half. At 350, its 55-60 minutes. Use lower rack. Butter foil and cover last 15 minutes."

The big pan is dripping all over the oven and the small pan fell. I haven't had this kind of catastrophe in years and years. I'm not sure what went wrong. I thought maybe I'd whipped the butter too long but in reading the reviews I don't think that's it. I live at an altitude of 4000+ feet but generally I don't make any modifications to recipes. I'm baffled and very disappointed. Now I'll have to make another. :("

Everyone loved it at our dinner last night. I drizzled a simple icing over it but it could have stood on its own easily.\nI made one bundt cake &amp; had enough batter to make a medium sized loaf as well. Baking time was right on though I turned the heat to 325 for the last 10 mins. I may have reduced the sugar by about 1/3 c.. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers to beat the butter/sugar for 10 mins. It takes that longs to get to the fluffy, light-colored stage. An easy delicious cake. Will make it again. UPDATE: I just doubled the recipe and got 8 tin foil loaf pans of this cake."

I'm not really sure if most folks understand that a really good pound cake is dense, moist and if baked correctly, will emerge from the pan with a lovely buttery and brown crust, which makes it absolutely delicious. Pound cakes are not suppose to be \"light\" in texture, so those who are looking for that type of cake need to look elsewhere. This recipe is FABULOUS!!!"
