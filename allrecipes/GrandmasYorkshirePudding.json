"reviewBody": "I make my Yorkshire Pudding like a pizza, in a big pan. This version rose 2\" out of the pan at the edges, and started to brown at the top before the lower parts were cooked, so I turned off the oven with 6 minutes to go and left it cook with the heat off until the bottom finished cooking. I use the smaller upper oven which isn't as tall as the lower oven, but it should be OK. Cooked, but not burned at the part that rises is the goal. I didn't use salt because I used bacon grease (and vegetable oil). We don't bake in Tucson in the hot months so this might be my last Yorkshire Pudding this year."

The yorkshire raised wonderfully and was light and fluffy.\n\nOther reviews were absolutely right...the tin must be smoking hot before filling with the pudding mixture. It makes all the difference in how well it turns out.\n\nIf you don't have drippings, try substituting butter or shortening mixed with about 1 tsp of beef soup base (powder). Just melt in the microwave and divide as you would the drippings."

"reviewBody": "Fantastic! As an American I was feeling a little pressure to find a great Yorkshire pud recipe. My British husband and his boys loved these! If you don't have enough beef fat or just want some Yorkshire pud to go with a meal, use a small amount of melted lard instead. Also works a bit better if you preheat the muffin tin. Creates much more of that \"blossom\" effect when the batter rises. Do not suggest cooking these in a fan assisted oven as it cooks the outside of the pudding too fast and doesn't let it rise as much for that dramatic effect."

"reviewBody": "This is the way I've always made them, with just two (large, XL) eggs to a cup of milk, not three, and a scant cup of flour. I was surprised when I learned my mother had been adding a couple of tablespoons of melted butter to the recipe--I think this decreases the amount of rise. Beef drippings are great if you have them--you could render some from some hamburger that isn't too lean--I've rarely had a whole cup to use and usually supplement it with butter...or, for the most part, just butter, when I really need popovers/Yorkshire pudding and don't have the drippings. A popover pan is best if you have it, or a rectangle to make it like Yorkshire pudding. Definitely a good idea to briefly heat the pan with the drippings/butter in it (not long for butter or it will burn). They rise very high in wonderful shapes, but I love them so much that I like to take some out when they've just solidified, before they rise and eat them like savory warm buttery pudding--OMG!"

They were nice and soft but still cooked on the inside and nice and brown on the outside. Very easy too. Cooked in a non-stick muffin pan which worked well, no sticking. I did make sure the batter was cold (made it about 2 hours ahead) and heated the oil in the wells before adding the batter. The middles did sink, but still had a nice texture so I don't know if that is supposed to happen or not. Doesn't matter since I really liked it. Served with \"Boneless Garlic and Rosemary Rubbed Prime Rib with Red Wine Mushroom Sauce\" also on this site - delicious. Will become a staple."

"reviewBody": "These tasted great-almost as good as the ones made by friend from Yorkshire! Perhaps it's just my oven, but I thought that 450°F was a bit too hot. The puddings rose beautifully, but they started to turn black on top before the initial 15 minutes were up, so after 12 minutes I lowered the temp to 350°F and baked for only 6 or 7 more minutes-if I had left them in any longer they would have been completely burned on top. They were still a little \"wet\" in the middle. Also, be warned: if your oven is not clean, this much heat will cause a smokey, smelly mess! I had to open the windows and the door to air it out, then just decided to go ahead and run the self-clean cycle since the downstairs already smelled of smoke! Finally, I used the extra drippings to make the gravy to serve with the puds, and it was delicious! The leftovers will be wonderful tomorrow morning with jam!"

"reviewBody": "I have watched the Martha Stewart special on comcast on demand where she makes yorkies about 10 times (no exaggeration) and I've made them before and learned from my mistakes so I have some handy tips. First, make sure to mix your batter about half hour before baking, so it isn't cold. Second, mix very well, until it is smooth, and add milk (I used half and half) just until it's a smooth consistency. I didn't need all of the milk. Third, preheat your muffin tin until it's HOT. Add just enough drippings to cover the bottom. I have a very hot oven, so I baked the yorkies for 10 minutes at 450, then 10 minutes at 350. They rose SKY HIGH, and the texture was perfect. Very light and tasty, complimented my prime rib very well."

My only reason for not giving five stars is because the instructions don't tell you that you absolutely have to heat the oil first. But that aside, this recipe is a keeper."

"reviewBody": "Terrible instructions. Following these will make it impossible for a successful pudding. NOTE!!!!! HEAT THE OIL/FAT IN THE PUD TRAY FOR APPROX 10MINS IE SO THE OIL IS SMOKING. QUICKLY REMOVE THE TRAY AND POUR THE BATTER. (IT SHOULD SPIT IN THE TRAY). NOW GET IT BACK IN THE OVEN IMMEDIATELY. DO NOT PEAK HALF WAY THRU AS THE PUDS COULD COLLAPSE. 3/4 THRU COOKING LOWER THE TEMPERATURE TO LET HEKP STOP THE BASE BEING SOGGY. Hope this helps. ps unlike others at least you remembered the salt!"

"reviewBody": "Yum, these are good! I love Yorkshire pudding but this was my first time trying to make it. Turned out very nice. Instead of a 6-muffin tin, I used a 12-muffin tin (smaller muffins than the 6-pan) and had batter to fill 8 of the cups to 3/4. Also, I used bacon grease and butter instead of beef drippings (just enough to cover the bottom of the tins). I noticed the bacon grease was smoking a bit so I moved the tray to the middle rack - no problems after that. Followed the other directions exactly with no substitutions. The Yorkies rose to 2x their height and were perfectly golden and yummy. Will definitely make again! Some tips: 1) the tray needs to be very very hot! Keep it in the oven for 5-7 min as recommended. 2) make the batter and let it sit for a bit while the oven preheats. 3) fill the tins as quickly as possible and pop back in the oven."

"reviewBody": "Unfortunately I tried to alter this recipe and ended up with a smoky oven and kitchen. I put 1 tbsp of bacon grease in the muffin cups (bacon grease is what I normally use - but probably 1/2 tbsp less) and then put it in the oven to get really hot before putting in the batter. It was really delicious but the grease was all over the oven and I expected the smoke detector to go off at any point. That wouldn't have impressed the guests."

If you are using melted butter instead of drippings, I would reccomend omitting the salt. Overall very tasty and easy recipe to follow."

"reviewBody": "Doubled recipe which made 12.Saved the grease from the roast for gravy. Put 1 tsp. canola oil into each muffin tin and heated in 450 degree oven for 5 mins. Then quickly poured in batter. Took out 5 mins early because it was really browning but I should have cooked a little longer, there were a few that were a little wet. Overall, excellent and tasty. Will use this recipe everytime we have roast beef. UPDATE: first time I have used the drippings from the roast and I tried using the convection setting for the oven and the yorkshires were the highest and the best ever!!! Was it the drippings or the convection method that made then rise higher?? Also cooked way faster this way. 18mins or so. Update:cooked them on lowest rack setting, down with 8 mins left and nice and crispy!!\nThanks, Michele, Cambridge, Ontario"

I had only about 1/2 cup of the beef drippings and doubled the recipe, but I did as others suggested and replaced the missing dripping with melted butter. Boy was it good! Tasted just like the yorkshire pudding's at the popular prime rib restaraunt chain."

"reviewBody": "Last year, I rated this recipe 5 stars b/c of presentation. This year, I'm changing it to 4 stars. If you prepare this using all the beef drippings, it makes a MESS in your oven. So, it's best to have a catch try beneath the muffin pan to catch all the over-flowing fluids. I still LOVE the presentation / taste of this recipe. However, I believe the quantities of the ingredients are inaccurate. This recipe needs adjusting to receive the coveted 5-stars."

I used regular sized muffin tins, and had left over batter. Either fill up 3/4 the way (instead of half way) which worked for me, or use a large muffin size tin. :)"
