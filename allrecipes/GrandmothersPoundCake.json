The texture is dense, the flavor buttery, and it is ideal to be eaten with macerated berries and whipped cream. This is one of the literal simplest recipes any baker could make; I had my 11 year old follow it, with my 4 year old making the measurements, and loosely supervised/directed. I even baked it in different loaf pans, one glass, one nonstick, one stoneware. All still came out perfect. I don't know what the people are doing who are having trouble, but I applaud their effort."

It burned a little on top, but that could also be due to baking it in my toaster oven. This will be my go-to recipe for sure!!"

"reviewBody": "OMG - Absolutely delicious! The only changes I made was to halve the recipe and then add 2 tsp lemon extract (3-4 tsp would be even better) between the egg and flour step. I used a 9×6 loaf pan that turned out to be too small! I assumed that without baking soda this wouldn't rise much but it surprisingly did. I cooked at 325° for 80 minutes. Next time I'll bake at 350° in a larger pan and that should reduce the baking time. Because of the high butter content the toothpick test isn't very effective, I removed from oven when center was no longer jiggly and had firmed up. Definitely beat the butter and sugar for at least 10 minutes, an additional 2 minutes with each egg addition and then the bare minimum after you add your flour and milk. So buttery with a light lemon flavor and a nice sweet crust. It didn't even need a glaze!"

I think next time I’ll turn the oven down to 325 as it got a little too brown by the time the inside was done. Even so the cake was moist and really perfect.

If the surface is browned but the cake is still raw inside, cover it with aluminium foil and continue baking at the stated increments. I served this cake with a cherry filling/compote on the side.

The inner consistency was good, the outer portion is a little crisp (not burnt).... I don’t think due to user error. The regular loaf batch was in for only 65/70 and was burnt on the outside.... this was due, in part, to user error, I was unable to check on it between the 45&amp;65 minute mark. Bummer.

The first loaf was gone and he had to go on a road trip and he asked me to make another so he could snack on it during the trip. I highly recommend this recipe. Also, I live at 5400 ft. and did not make any high altitude adjustments for ingredients. Just keep an eye on your baking time, not sure if mine was less because of my oven or my altitude."

I came on this website searching for a repicie and I chose this one. I read all the reviews and after a few alterations, this cake was delicious even for me. My alterations were: I preheated my oven to 325 degrees. I used 2 loaf pans instead of a bundt pan. Eggs and butter must be room temperature! I used one cup of brown sugar and 2 cups of white and creamed with the butter for literally 20min ( I set a timer). Add one egg at a time, 1 min apart. I used 1/2 tablespoon of pure vanilla and 1/2 tablespoon of almond extract. I also put in 1/4 tablespoon of lemon extract. I used cake flour instead of all purpose flour and sifted 3 times before adding in with heavy whipping cream instead of milk. I baked for about an hour. I waited until it completely cooled. Cake came out light brown, full flavored, and delicious."
