"reviewBody": "I think the smaller canned 10 ct. biscuits are better than using the Grands 8 ct., but they are hard to find now and cost just as much as the others. The pieces are too big, especially if you want to make individual muffin sized Monkey Breads. Still came out pretty tasty though! I put 6 pieces in a jumbo muffin pan and drizzled with the brown sugar butter mixture. Baked them at 350 for 20 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes. Dumped on a platter. I was afraid they were going to come apart, but they didn't! Making the muffin size bread allows for different add-ins based on different preferences. Also, the butter definitely needs to be melted stove top so the brown sugar dissolves all the way."

Outside biscuits that were done still tasted just like a biscuit. I bake all the time and my oven temp is not the issue here. Will look for another recipe that calls for frozen bread dough. As written even if this would have got done the flavor was not good."

Itâ€™s great as written in this recipe but I do find on days that Iâ€™m feeling more motivated that cooking the butter and brown sugar in a sauce pan before pouring over the biscuits helps reduce that granular texture in the brown sugar. I also have to cook for 40-45 minutes or much of the biscuit part is under cooked at only 30 minutes. Itâ€™s possible that may just be my oven though."

Just a tip--I do use a second teaspoon of cinnamon about 1/2 way through to make sure all the pieces get enough cinnamon. \nI made mine in the bundt pan and everything cooked through thoroughly. I pre-grease my pan because I don't like the taste of Pam. Use a sliver of butter on a piece of wax paper and go in and out of every groove in the pan. Works great. Use a rubber spatula to help remove. \nI would highly recommend melting the brown sugar and butter together to keep the syrup from being runny."

Top with remaining quartered cinnamon-sugared biscuit pieces and remaining nuts and syrup. This makes a special and delicious breakfast that my family inhales."

I also use an 8x8 baking dish as I don't have a bunt pan. I made as is per directions the first time and it came out well enough. My only suggestion is once you've added your brown sugar to the melted butter, heat it or place in the microwave for 10-20 sec to help the sugar melt. This really helps the sauce caramelize and not come out still grainy. I also like to double the cinnamon and/or use pumpkin spice in the mix."

"reviewBody": "we love monkey bread, couple of things, you can make your own biscuit mix or use a baking mix recipe for biscuits.. don't have to use pillsbury anything. (I find it expensive - and its just easier to whip up my own) I do add sugar to my biscuit recipe though - couple of tablaspoons so its not so bread like, and then with brown sugar, butter and cinnamon, skies the limit - some apple chopped fine and heated a min or two in microwave before adding. so Many variations, so useful for what you have on hand - even a few slices of banana or small pieces of peaches... will go wonderfully. this is a great recipe and works perfectly - although use your judgement on how sweet you like it - you might wish to cut back a bit on the brown sugar,,thanks for a great recipe!!"

I also add a 1/2 tsp of good vanilla to the carmal sauce after cooking it up on the stove to get a creamy consistancy. No raisins or nuts for us but the beauty of this is you can try different things. I also use the small biscuit dough instead of the grands and prefer it. Family just loves this."

The only thing i changed was to boil butter and brown sugar for couple of minutes to have more caramelized color and poured it over. And i just packed them in a dish and heated for 35 minutes. YUUUM! Thank youuuuuu"

"reviewBody": "This recipe is ok but the dough does not always cook completely in the time of the directiosn. What I do is take small canning jars for my baking container, take the biscuit from the can and cut them into forths, coat the one forth biscuit in the sugar mixture, place 5 pieces of dow into one canning jar, pour the carmel mixture over the biscuit and bake for about 25 minutes. Turn the canning jar upside down on a piece of wax paper and let sit for a couple minutes. What you now have are individual servings of monkey bread. If cooking for 2 like I am, I will purchase one can containing 5 biscuits giving me a 2 day supply of monkey bread. Just reduce the other ingredients for a one can batch of monkey bread."

I did use a good amount of cooking spray in the bundt pan. I did bake for quite a bite longer then the recipe called for i baked mine for almost 40 minutes and it came out perfect. My advise is to keep checking it after 25 minutes to see if the inner layer in done then go from there. Next time i do not think i will pour all of the brown sugar/butter mixture into the pan. the top of the bread came out a little soggy. but all in all a great recipe"

I didn't get a gooey caramel sauce. Mine ended up with more of a crunchy carmelized coating. Also, you still get the texture from the brown sugar since it didn't dissolve. It didn't bother my family because we liked the crunch. I cooked the bread for 30 minutes until is was a dark golden brown. The outside was perfect, but, the bread on the inner ring was not fully cooked. Not sure how to resolve that issue. If I cooked it any longer the outside pieces would have burned."

Then I melted the butter in the bottom of a large loaf pan and added the brown sugar and a tablespoon of milk to make a caramel sauce. I sprinkled pecans and raisins over the caramel and then layered the sugared pieces as directed. When it came out of the oven, I immediately inverted the pan to create a caramelized sticky loaf.

"reviewBody": "I've made monkey bread over the years, normally use the smaller refrigerator biscuits, 1st time using the Grands(R). One thing to watch for in the recipe is topping the brown sugar mixture at the end, please take advice, use a spatula to tuck some of the mixture down beause of over spilling in the baking process OR do what another person recommended she did, was put some of the mixture on the bottom of the pan. I wished I had looked at reviews before completing, would have saved me from burning the bottom of my oven. Other then that, good recipe ended up adding more cinnamon, because towards the last 4-6 biscuits I noticed the cinnamon was no longer ahearing to the biscuits and it was just sugar. But recipe is a keeper and it was quite good."

Then pour it over the biscuits. \nSecond...I would skip the \"Grands\" biscuits and instead use regular Pillsburg refridgerator biscuits (the kind that come in a pack of 4). The \"Grands\" are too big and still taste too savory.\nLast...I would skip the bundt pan and put it in a glass 11 X 17 pan. I read reviews complaining of uncooked dough, and by switching out pans, I had no trouble with the 28-32 recommended minutes."
