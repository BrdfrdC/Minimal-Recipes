I used a can of black beans instead of one of the cans of chili beans, because that's what I had. I added cumin because I like that in chili. I also added a half a can of tomato paste because I had it left over and thought this would be a good way to get rid of it. I was very happy with this recipe."

It tasted like campbells bean and bacon soup... didnt' taste like chili at all, it was soupy, I even excluded the 1 cup of water as reviewers said and still consistency of soup."

I added a little white wine as someone else suggested. I added a bit more chili powder and a little cumin. I used turbinado sugar instead of brown sugar. I used petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed. Thanks for the recipe. I have faith in my ability to cook with TVP now. :)"

"reviewBody": "This recipe was a great jumping off point for chili to feed a hungry potluck croud. I omited the celery (seeing as I didn't have any on hand). Due to another review, I cut down on the water by one cup. Then, when I doubled the recipe - I didn't have enough chili beans, so I substituted some kidney beans (drained) instead. I wanted my chili meaty, so I substituted about a pound and a half of browned ground beef for the second cup of TVP. The result was delicious. I am sure that it would be equally tasty made accoring to the recipe - but I would hold off on part of the water, and see how thick you want it."
