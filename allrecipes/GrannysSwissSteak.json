I subbed a 14 oz can tomato sauce for the tomato juice, and threw in a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes for some zing. I used some sirloin pieces left over from cutting steaks. I used fresh mushrooms, carrots, bell pepper, onions , celery, garlic, and subbed Italian Seasoning for the oregano. I loved all the veggies in this. The onion soup mix gave a perfect flavor. Really a delicious recipe and will definitely make again!"

I then added the sauteed veggies into the mix and then put all that on top of the meat. Delicious."

First, I only used 2 cube steaks since there are just the two of us, but didn't reduce the rest of the ingredients because I like sauce and/or gravy. I decided to use fresh mushrooms and sauteed about half of the mushrooms and onions in the same pan as I fried the steaks in. Like other readers, I didn't have any tomato sauce, so I used a can of tomato soup and 1/2 cup of water and added that to the ketchup. We ate this over rice and it was delicious!"

I also substitued an Onion &amp; Mushroom soup mix for the Onion Soup. We really like mushrooms - so it added some extra flavor. The only other change we made was to exlude the celery. My husband loved the meal - and I loved that we now have 3 dinners worth of food! One serving for leftovers and another to freeze for a lazy night. I served the dish with lightly buttered egg noodles. Yum!"

I have, however, changed the method ever so slightly, in that I dump all the veggies back in the pan with a tad bit more olive oil and saute till slightly browned. I then dump them all atop the meat and sprinkle with the soup mix and oergano. I then mix the juice and ketchup and pour over all. Cover and bake for 1 hour , checking about 1/2 way through to make sure there is enough liquid. Is wonderful with baked patatoes that were put in the oven at the start."

I browned those as directed and then tossed it all in my crock pot for the day on high. I was getting scared as the meat was not getting tender but after about 7-8 hrs it started to fall apart. The flaver these ingredients infused in the meat was fantastic, you would never know it was a cheaper cut of meat. I had so much extra sauce however that next time I will use much more meat. I did give the recipe to my neighbor who hunts as I thought this would be great for him to try on venison to detract from the gamey taste. \n\nThis is not the same kind of swiss steak I have had in this area before(WI) I have never had one with a tomatoe base, but it was very delicious in it's own way. Thanks for sharing."

I don't think that I have ever seen this happen before...lol. He didn't like the taste of the sauce, the chunkiness of the veggies in this one, or the tough-chewiness of the meat. Sorry, but thanks for posting anyway."

I also cut the ketchup down to 1/2 cup and used and extra 1/2 cup of tomato juice so it wouldn't be so sweet. It was wonderful! I paired it with the baked mashed potato recipe and they cooked along side one another and both came out wonderfully! Thanks!!!"

I left out the chopped onion since the soup mix already had onion included. very tasty, kids loved it, (even if they scraped off the \"green stuff\" first), no leftovers so I guess I'll put it on permanent rotation. served with mashed potatos, though I might try buttered egg noodles next. thank you for this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe is excellent. I used the original recipe as a base and cooked it in a large crock pot. Hubby and children loved it. The recipe was doubled. I used 2 - 12 oz cans of V8 veggie juice instead of tomato juice since that is what I had on hand. Cut the ketchup to about 3/4 cup and added 1 can of diced tomato. Sauteed fresh mushrooms in Worchestshire sauce with hunks of celery stalks and garlic powder that I put on the bottom of the crock pot. I did not add additional salt or oregano nor green peppers. There is already enough salt in the juice and diced tomatos. I did use dried basil in place of the oregano and added a couple of bay leaves. With doubling the recipe, I do believe that 1 envelope of beefy onion soup mix is plenty. We served this wonderful dish over homemade mashed potatoes along with a couple of other side items. Just great comfort food."

I made a double recipe, using 1 can condensed french onion soup, 1/2 can water, and 2 8-oz cans of tomato sauce in place of the ketchup, tomato juice, and onion soup mix. I let it bake for 1-1/2 hours and the meat was very tender with a nice thick sauce. Thanks for sharing Angie."

I put the green peppers, onions, mushrooms, celery, tomatoe juice, ketchup, dry onion soup mix all in a blender and made a puree out of it. (If the kids would have seen all of those veggies, they would have instantly hated it!) The kids loved it. I even made sure that they really liked it before I told them what was in it. My 7 year old got THIRDS!! And that's very odd for him!! Thank you so much!!~"

Also, I didn't chop vegetables, but sliced onions into rings. I omitted the ketchup, and used a can of diced tomatoes and tomato sauce, instead, and mixed those with the instant onion soup, before pouring on top of vegetables and meat. Then, I poured about a cup of water over all. I served with mashed potatoes, using the sauce as a gravy. It was absolutely delicious!"

The vegetables need to be finely chopped to combine better with the sauce. Way too much tomato flavor. A little sugar may have cut the acidity or omit the ketchup."
