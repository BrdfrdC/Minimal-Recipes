The sauce at the bottom of the pan darkens as it caramelizes and gives a richer flavor to the darkening sauce. Of course folks can use remade meatballs, I buy 2 pounds of ground beef, season it up with salt, pepper, garlic powder and make the meatballs and toss them into the boiling/simmering sauce, covered for 1 hour then uncovered for 2 hours. Spoon off the fat that comes to the top. Make them a day ahead if you have the time and to take off congealed fat and do a slow reheat so as not to burn the sauce the next day."

I use the Homemade Brand Chili Sauce in its' signature globe-shaped bottle; it's superior in taste. Welch's grape jelly has a more complex depth of flavor than others. I used the classic recipe: 12 oz. of chili sauce &amp; 12 oz. of grape jelly. Moe grape jelly and it's sweetness is overwhelming. Trader Joe's frozen cocktail meatballs or Costco are excellent."

I also use the frozen Italian meatballs from Costco (about 1 inch in diameter). Typically, use about half the bag and, yes, there's always leftover sauce. The only difference is that my recipe calls for the addition of the juice of a lemon. This helps to balance out the sweetness of the other ingredients and the fats in the meats. Give this recipe a try. These meatballs always get rave reviews."

So I put everything in two large skillets and cooked for an hour (the time I had). I then poured both into a crockpot to stay warm while I dressed. Turn out delicious. Meatballs were fine - not rubbery."

This worked out wonderfully. My husband and I ate only these for supper and had more than half to freeze. I will always cook them this way. These would be great on a sub roll.

"reviewBody": "I made these pretty much as written only I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I used a tsp of red pepper flakes. I only used one bag of meatballs and cooked on low simmer on the stovetop for about 2 hours or so, until the sauce thickened up a bit. I thought they were pretty good and my hubby thought they were just ok. I took the remainder of the meatballs out of sauce and put in the fridge. I also put the sauce in a separate container to use later on chicken wings. The next day I had intended to freeze the remaining meatballs (over half of the bag was left). I ate one on my way to place them in freezer bags,...and OH MY!!! They were fantastic cold. I gave one to the old man to try and let's just say they never made it to the freezer. They were that great cold! The wings came out good too but that is a recipe for another day."

One small bag of walmart meatballs. Super yummy! You can actually make this the night before and reheat it, it tastes even better the second day. Add a crock pot bag and it's easy cheesy."

Add 1 jar of chili sauce, a medium jar of grape jelly, a couple of tablespoons each dried parsley flakes and Worcestershire sauce to a crockpot , turn on high until the grape jelly is a liquid consistency. Add meatballs and stir together. Let cook on low for several hours, stirring occasionally. Best cocktail meatballs I've ever had . This is an appetizer that is always at all requested. Enjoy."

Not sure If the price is worth it. I have made great sauces using ketchup brown sugar fresh lemon juice mustard, and sauteed onion celery and red pepper. For a fraction of the price and just as tasty."

"reviewBody": "My number one favorite recipe here! Everyone raves about them whenever I bring them. Making them for a potluck tomorrow due to coworkers asking “are you bringing those meatballs again?” I prefer mine with a real kick though so I add extra cayenne, arbol chili ground, crushed chili, a few of those small chiles chopped (whatever I have laying around at the time), and minced garlic. Trying tomorrow’s batch with Strawberry jam instead for the first time so wish me luck. I do wish they’d fix the ingredients though and even the shopping list seems off. I use the ingredients from the recipe screen for 12 servings but with 3 x 26 ounce bags of frozen Italian meatballs instead which is around 4.8 pounds total. Just enough to fill standard size crockpots. Also, freshly made are the best of course. You lose a little quality when refrigerated then reheated but still tasty enough to gobble down. I feel these could be the foundation to an even greater dish. Last time I made them, a few rolled through refried beans I had on my plate then found their way into my tacos so I just went for it and I did not regret it. Would probably make for a great sandwich or piled on rice. Dare I make spaghetti with them? Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm.............Dare I?"
