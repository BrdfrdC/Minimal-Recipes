It always bothers me when people give a recipe a poor review when they didnt follow it in the first place. I always try it as written when possible then make adjustments. just saying\nmy family preferes cool whip as it holds up better but either way this recipe works better than many . Try it as written"

I did NOT have Creme De Menthe, I had Dekuyper's Peppermint Schapps so I used that instead. So easy it should be illegal. The end result was almost like eating peppermint bark in pie form. This pie is off the hook. Unbelievable. We absolutely loved it."

I'm sure the homemade oreo crust is far better, but I usually just buy the premade crust because I am lazy and it is in a disposable pan with lid so I have less dishes. I also like to add Ande Mints pieces on top (you can usually find them by the chocolate chips) instead of the oreo, then crush some oreo up inside the the marshmellow/cream mixture. Also, 2 hours doesn't seem to do it...it needs at least 4-6 hours, but I usually just wait overnight. It is much better completley frozen"

"reviewBody": "I thought it really lacked in mint flavor, and I'm not even the mint enthusiast in our family. I didn't have any creme de menthe liqueur so I used Creme de Menthe Torani's syrup instead, so maybe that's what contributed to the lack of flavor? Anyway, I gave it a second try for my husband's birthday as he LOVES mint, and ended up added nearly 2T of peppermint extract to the mint syrup which really added to the flavor. I added a dash of syrup to the crumb mixture too. I also cut down on the butter because as much as I love butter, 1/2 C was WAY too much and made it difficult to get it to cling to the bottom. Finally, I didn't reserve any cookie for the top and instead melted some chocolate chips over a double-broiler with some peppermint extract and drizzled it over the top which made it look 5-star and quite stunning. After the revisions, I ended up really liking it, but as it was originally written... not my favorite."

I don't feed my family much corn syrup, nor do I eat it. I decided to live it up for my party, and not worry about it...REGRET that decision!! So, if you think that you are sensitive to corn syrup, I would suggest finding, or creating a different recipe. (My kids want me to come up with one without the liquor for them. Maybe I'll just make it a healthier version for everyone.)"

"reviewBody": "Just a comment on the crust. Homemade Oreo crust is WAY superior in taste compared to the store brought crust. IMHO store brought crust just lacks in taste &amp; texture. Once you compare the two, you'll see what I mean. For a homemade crust you Just need to crush about 24 regular oreos in a food processor and had about 1/4 c melted butter to help keep it together. That's it. A very easy step that will improve your end result greatly. Also a springform pan is a MUST to cut &amp; serve the pie. I used to make it in a glass pie plate and the crust would freeze like a rock to the bottom. The springform pan is a lifesaver! I also drizzle a little Magic Shell topping in chocolate over the top.. My mom has been making this same recipe for at least 25 years and it NEVER fails to impress. A classic!"

"reviewBody": "I would not cut back on the creme de menthe as one reviewer suggested - you wouldn't even taste it then. 1/4 cup is not much as it is. If you don't want kids to eat it then have something else for them - the kids at our party had ice cream, the adults ate the pie and that was only because they were toddlers. I would also not use cool whip as the sweetness would be too much. Real whipped cream was perfect. Follow the recipe and you will like this."

"reviewBody": "This pie was awesome!! To make it easier, I used a prepared oreo crust. To make it healtier, I used low fat cool whip instead of whipping cream. To make it thick, I added one envelope of unflavored gelatin, softened in 1 tablespoon of very hot water. We liked it best frozen. This is definitely a keeper, and I will be making it again!!!"

"reviewBody": "Awesome!!! I only used about an eighth of a cup or more, instead of a fourth of a cup, of cream de menthe, and I think it was a lot better that way. I also put some of the crushed oreos in the mixture itself to seem more like an oreo mint ice cream filling. The kids loved it too. This will become a tradition for us on Christmas. Thanks for the recipe!"

If you're sensitive to having your kids eat something with liquor in it, I suggest trying another minty mix in. But if you're like me and you're mainly making it for yourself, you'll enjoy the taste the Creme de Mint gives it!"
