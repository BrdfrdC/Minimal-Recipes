Someone left a review saying this was disgusting and I’m assuming they messed up somewhere in the recipe because this is a FANTASTIC simple little spice cake."

I didn't make the frosting as I wanted to taste the cake without it. \nThe taste was like a mild spice cake, and I couldn't taste the ketchup. I could smell the vinegar when I started baking it, but the aroma dissipated through baking."

First time in my life I made a cake from scratch. It was terrific and very easy. Very, very moist. Similar in texture to a carrot cake, tastes like a spice cake. Might actually put in more spice next time."

The taste was very pleasant and really surprised them. When I told them what it was, no one believed me - had to show a copy of the recipe. I stuck with the recipe, but saved time by purchasing cream cheese icing. Will be making again."
