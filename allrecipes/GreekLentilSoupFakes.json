I personally double the amount of tomato paste, garlic and all the herbs but it’s not necessary I just prefer it that way. I also add a crumbling of feta or goats cheese on top with the drizzle of olive oil and salt and pepper. I didn’t have red wine vinegar so I used balsamic and it’s amazing! Since finding this recipe we eat it twice a month. Thank you so much for such a beautifully authentic recipe! X"

I know olive oil is healthful, but I am having some digestive issues right now where I can only handle small amounts of any fats. It still tastes great with less oil, so I think people should use this recipe as a starting point and adjust to their personal dietary needs. Thank you for this idea."

I’m South Indian and our cuisine has much in common with the Greek diet, but this is a healthier twist on “dal” (what we call lentils, prepared many ways) with olive oil. I like the very simple seasonings - a break from overly seasoned stuff. I love the depth vinegar brings! I’d love to try this with high quality oil and vinegar, but I just use grocery store stuff."

This time instead of a quart of water, I used 2 cups water, 1 cup of chicken broth and a cup of red wine. Instead of 1 tbsp tomato paste, I used a quarter cup of ketchup and I added a dash of hot sauce. \n\nSo now it's not Fakes, but it does have a more robust flavor. \n\nDo add the recommended olive oil and vinegar on top when served. That helps a lot."

All I had was Balsalmic vinegar, which has been delicious. I did take half of the finished product &amp; blend it in my vitamix—it turned into a creamy texture my kid’s would actually eat. And low &amp; behold after much nose-sniffing &amp; tongue-sticking, 2/3 kids admitted it was yummy as well! Served initially with sourdough bread, I’ve eaten it plain for every meal following. Definitely making again!"

I want to be very clear that while I followed the outlines of this recipe, I used what I had on hand.\n\nI was out of bay leaves, but I added mint. \n\nI added 4 potatoes, cut in small chunks. \n\nI added chicken stock.\n\nI tasted it to adjust seasoning, and then added a healthy glug of white wine vinegar. \n\nIt was excellent. Even my lentil-hating kid liked it."

Adding the vinegar definitely kicked the flavor up a notch. IF you try it without the vinegar and don't like it then I'd encourage you to try it again with the vinegar."

This recipe allows them to shine by complementing the lentil's natural flavor without overpowering it. I used dried basil instead of rosemary, as I personally don't prefer rosemary, but otherwise followed this to a T. It's my new go-to when I want something hot and delicious that doesn't take a lot of effort."

I omit the rosemary (personal preference) and double the oregano instead. I also sometimes add crushed red pepper and stir the red wine vinegar right into the pot at the very end. Otherwise, I follow the ingredients, their quantities and the instructions to a T! Thank you for this wonderful and comforting recipe!"

Drizzled some olive oil and red wine vinegar and served with a whole wheat toasted topped with baba ganoush from this website. So yummy!!!"
