It was great. My daughter didnt care for the texture of the orzo but loved the taste...i think this could also be good using about 3c of couscous in place of the orzo."

I used Marie's Greek Salad Dressing (not too overbearing) instead of the marinade, left out the red onion, and doubled up on the lemon. In the future, I'll probably cut down on the amount of orzo. It's up to one's own taste, and I wanted to make this mostly a salad rather than a cold pasta dish. As others did, I gave it more time in the refrigerator, giving it more time to meld those wonderful fresh ingredients. Will definitely be doing again!"

The combination of the Greek dressing on the artichoke juice was much better. The artichoke juice made it two artichokie flavor."

I am currently eating low carb (kind of a dirty keto woe) and used riced cauliflower(made twice once baking the riced cauliflower and once just straight out of the bag- loved both) instead of orzo pasta. I also used the dressing from Dining Diva- Instead of using the artichoke marinade. Use 6 tbsp olive oil, 5 tbsp red wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 2 teaspoon dried oregano. And did 1/2 black olives and 1/2 kalamata olives. It was amazing and very keto/low carb friendly."

I used leftover orzo, and my small changes were to use kalamata olives instead of black, Greek dressing instead of the marinade from the artichokes, two seeded Roma tomatoes, and a shallot instead of a red onion. I also used fresh herbs from our garden. I cut all the veggies pretty finely for consistency, and it turned out to be a light and tasty early summer meal. you could easily add marinated shrimp or chicken for a heartier version, but this suited us just fine. Hubby and I agree... it's a keeper!"

"reviewBody": "Tastes really good, but it does make a lot - way more than six servings! Like others, I used a good bottled Greek Salad dressing (not a creamy one made with yogurt, but an oil and vinegar based one with feta cheese and Greek spices) instead of using the artichoke brine. I used sliced kalamata olives, halved grape tomatoes, and English cucumbers so that I didn't need to seed them. I doubled the feta, cucumbers, tomatoes and olives, and gave it an extra tablespoon of lemon juice and a splash of white wine vinegar, as the salad dressing didn't seem to have enough oomph. I think that refrigerating it overnight melded the flavors together well. It was very popular at my potluck BBQ!"

I think this would taste so much better with a fresh dressing made simply from lemon juice, red wine vinegar, olive oil, and more fresh seasonings. The lemon pepper doesnâ€™t work here, and fresh oregano would be much better."
