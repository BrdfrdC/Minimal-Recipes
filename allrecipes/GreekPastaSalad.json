Also decreased the red onion to 1/4 of a large onion so that it wouldn't be too overpowering. Added a handful of sliced kalamata olives and extra feta. Dressing is perfect, especially with fresh oregano! Such a delicious and easy lunch recipe :)"

If you use GF go with a smaller noodle. Maybe an elbow? \n\nAlso, in keeping with the Greek theme, I think kalamata olives would have been a better option than the black. I'll switch it up next time."

I added sugar to make the dressing less bitter but I think balsamic may work a bit better than the red wine vinegar next time. Also added some Chili flakes and garlic powder as I thought the salad was lacking flavour."

"reviewBody": "This is a great pasta salad dressing ! My kids love it! I love that the salad part is so versatile, you can add just about any fresh vegetables or left-over veggies you have on hand, however, do not add add any lettuce/spinach, grated (only), shaved is fine, parmesan cheese, chick peas/garbanzo beans or chicken until ready to serve . The dressing is absolutely fabulous on it's own but can also be modified to fit personal taste, occasion or meal. I.E. white wine vinegar instead of red, amounts to fit your taste: Dill, Basil, Lemon Zest, Honey, Dijon Mustard, Salt &amp; Pepper. Also great as a marinade for chicken, but use red wine vinegar. For pasta you can use any you have on hand from angel hair to ziti, or zoodles, spaghetti squash, orzo, or large pasta shells. This is so easy and can accommodate just about any taste. I'm making a 'mom's cookbook ' for my daughter for when she heads of to college in 2 years and this is a perfect recipe for a novice cook. It is a perfect addition, easy to make, able to use what is on hand, adaptable but will still give her a taste of home. I just hope she doesn't get distracted while cutting up the veggies and cut herself Also, for those whose family say they don't like Feta Cheese, crumble it up in to small bits, don't mention it's in there (unless of course they have an allergy) and guarantee they will like it. It is the one addition that is absolutely required to balance the dressing and make it a hit and craveable. Thanks Daniell"

I did have to make a change and use 1 cup of a bottled balsamic salad dressing as my red wine vinegar was way past its expiration date but it was still very yummy. Will definitely make again but with some fresh red wine vinegar next time!"

Sometimes they get too big so I thought about a salad.\nThis recipe gave me the basics. I trimmed by mongo squash and chopped it into cubes. Then added Feta, Kalamata olives, tomatoes, 1/ cuke, basil and Italian dressing. Wow-was that yummy- and crunchy too! I made so much I had leftover and it was better the next day and still very crunchy! \nSo, as you sub zuccs for pasta in other dishes I did the same thing here. Very good!"

Much to everyone’s astonishment, he asked for seconds and then thirds and THEN took a bowl home to have in his lunch tomorrow. What more could one want from a recipe? I think its all in the dressing, a simple mix that is not too over-powering so it allows the flavour of the veggies to shine through. I increased the garlic by one clove and I added a teaspoon of Dijon mustard to the dressing just because I like it in a dressing. The first time I used garlic stuffed green olives sliced, as that is what I had on hand. Tonight I used pitted Kalamata olives but left them whole so that the SIL could pick them out. Good thing to do when you are questioning who likes olives."

I also added about a teaspoon of sugar to the dressing to lower the acidity. I would make this again and prepare it the night before so the flavors can really fuse. This will be a bbq and potluck staple."
