It was wonderful. Will definitely be adding it to my collection. i did have to tweek the salad dressing though, it was too bland. I simply added a tablespoon of rice vinegar with a 1/4 tsp of pepper. I think you have to definitely do the dressing to your own liking. But other than that I was satisfied. The feta cheese adds the perfect blend of flavor against the raisins. Thanks for the recipe."

I didn't have Red wine vinegar on hand which several people recommended. That probably would have helped. Also it's a huge salad, I will definitely half it next time I make it for my family and use only 1/2 of the onion."

I detest heavy salad dressings, or those vinaigrettes heavy in vinegar. This is perfect, and one I'll be making routinely. I thought I had a cuke in the fridge but it turned out to be a zucchini, which worked out beautifully anyway. I used Kalamata olives rather than black, but I'm sure the black olives would have been just as delicious. I like a 3:1 ratio of oil/acid in my vinaigrettes, so I used 6 T. of olive oil and 2 T. of lemon juice. \"Cold and crunchy\" foods are generally not my thing, but this is simply outstanding!"

(Changed it just a bit.)\" Scaled it back to 2 servings, but used all the same ratio and type of ingredients (beautiful salad!) I followed another review's suggestion about adding red wine vinegar and a bit of sugar to the dressing and that brought the SHAZAM to this salad. I will definitely make this again."

The recipe simply has the perfect ratio of ingredients. Each ingredient plays a role and creates a delicious combination. I put some balsamic vinegar on it too. Brilliant stuff."

Also, I doubled the dressing amounts, for the entire salad, added salt and made the feta amount (to taste). I also prefer the Greek practice of serving a slice of feta on each salad rather than crumbling it into the entire salad."

His recipe calls for some fresh sliced mushrooms, half of a red onion and half of a white onion (for some kick). As well, the dressing is a little different... 6 TBSP olive oil, 3 TBSP red wine vinegar, 1 TBSP Italian seasoning and 2 cloves of garlic mashed with a TSP of salt. Black pepper to taste."

I appreciate how HEALTHY the salad is, and that it was very quick &amp; easy to make. Thanks for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "This was good, but for some reason it didn't seem like a cohesive recipe. It didn't feel like a lettuce salad to me, and yet the primary ingredient was lettuce. I wish I could pinpoint what I'd like to change, because I'd love to tinker with this and make it again, but I'm not sure what changes to make. I'm actually thinking of making it into a pasta salad. That said, this was still a tasty dish, and I made the following changes: added a few tablespoons of red wine vinegar and some sugar to the dressing, reduced the olive oil by about a tablespoon, reduced the onion a little, and used kalamata olives instead of black (a great substitution if you don't mind the extra cost). The amount of dressing didn't look like enough, but it was just right.\nUPDATE: I made this with orzo pasta instead of lettuce and I really liked it. Lettuce is healthier, of course, but I'll make it again with the pasta substitution."
