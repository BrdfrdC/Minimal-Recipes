I didn't have Rosemary available, so I tossed in some chopped Basil &amp; used Yellow Gold potatoes too."

I used bottled lemon juice and beef broth because that is what I had and they taste great, but too mushy. I think my oven was too hot at 350F. I wil try again at a lower temperature. The photo shows them after about 30 minutes in the oven."

Everyone thinks it’s just lemon, but it’s not. These are supposed to be soft, not crispy, so if you want them to taste like your best local Greek restaurant’s roasted potatoes, follow this recipe and add the mustard. If you don’t like Greek potatoes or lemon, don’t write a review on how you don’t like lemon and changed it into something else; write your own potato recipe that isn’t a Greek dish."

I never made a recipe that called for all this liquid but I was curious. I baked for 1.5 hour with foil on but still too much liquid. So I took foil off changed to convection at 375. Sprinkled some Parmesan cheese over top and a few more seasonings and it turned out awesome. Just a little bit of liquid left but the 3 men I served this for loved it. I would make if again for sure. I swapped rosemary for Oregano too. It was flavourful and actually a nice change because the liquid keeps the potatoes moist."

This was a huge hit with everyone here."

I added 2 extra vegetable bullion cubes and used extra herbs (1 tbsp each fresh rosemary and oregano). I also put them under the broiler for an extra 5 minutes to crisp them up a little at the end. I would reduce the lemon a touch the next time I make them, but, all in all a pretty good recipe."

"reviewBody": "Delicious pototo recipe! Greek style potatoes are one of my favourites and discovering the simplicity of acheiving that flavour is an excellent addition to my \"go to\" dishes! The modifications that I applied to this recipe are that I first melt butter and add this to the potatoes in the roaster pan along with salt &amp; pepper. After tossing and coating the potatoes with the butter, I then pour over the mixture. It is best to always use fresh squeezed lemon juice when making the mixture! Rather than the individual herbs listed, I use fresh dill and a Greek herb mix from Epicure. I have made this a few times with different potatoes and it always turns out wonderful regardless of which type chosen."

Overall, a good dish but would definitely reduce the lemon juice to half of what is called for, it was way to overpowering. As noted in previous reviews, I decreased the water by 1/4 cup, only used 1/4 cup oil, and increased the baking temperature to 400F. Will make again, but just tweak it a bit more."

"reviewBody": "Delicious pototo recipe! Greek style potatoes are one of my favourites and discovering the simplicity of acheiving that flavour is an excellent addition to my \"go to\" dishes! The modifications that I applied to this recipe are that I first melt butter and add this to the potatoes in the roaster pan along with salt &amp; pepper. After tossing and coating the potatoes with the butter, I then pour over the mixture. It is best to always use fresh squeezed lemon juice when making the mixture! Rather than the individual herbs listed, I use fresh dill and a Greek herb mix from Epicure. I have made this a few times with different potatoes and it always turns out wonderful regardless of which type chosen."

"reviewBody": "I used half sweet potato, DELISH! These were so flavourful! I used chicken broth in place of the water and cubes. Replaced rosemary with oregano (taste preference). Also added the zest of the entire lemon, and instead of slicing the garlic smashed them and left them whole so I could eat those(used 4). Mine baked in 1 hour at 375. The juices were so delectable. I really would suggest cooking them low and slow. I've looked at a few other recipes for Greek potatoes.. But most don't say to cover.. I feel that covering them allows the moisture to soak into the potatoes more.. Also makes them so tender.. And really like the ones you get at your favourite Greek restaurant. I cut my potatoes in half (medium sized) and my sweet potatoes in fairly large chunks and they cooked up just fine. I suggest only using a drizzle of olive oil.. As I believe 1/3 is a tad much. This will become a staple in my house now.. Thanks!"

"reviewBody": "I think the length of cooking time is essential to capturing the texture that makes these truly greek style potatoes. It's a very particular texture you never knew you needed in your life until you've had it or lost it. Since most greek yiayias dont write down their recipes, it can be tough figuring out h ow to make dishes from childhood. These seem pretty close. Every family is different, of course, but these capture the main idea."

Only addition I made to the recipe was par-boiling the potatoes and only cooking them for an hour as I wanted to reduce the cooking time and I feel like they absorb the flavour more. I added some oregano in as well. Other than those slight changes everything else was the same. This comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED its fool proof! it takes so little time to make and the flavour cannot be beat! everyone who tries these LOVES them!"

I'll be looking for a different greek potato recipe."

I think you get a significantly better texture if you don't boil the potatoes, and you could use oregano with or instead of rosemary. It's so worth it to cook them, and baste them the full time."

I had no lemon, used fresh rosemary and italian seasoning. I cooked it at 400F for 1 hour covered and 15 minutes uncovered. Then I added crumbled feta and cooked for 5 more minutes, finishing with a broil. YUM. I picked this recipe over the other because of your use of the chicken bouillon - really adds flavour. Great basis and next time will add onions!"

"reviewBody": "I just made this tonight and I followed Donna's instruction (below) but a little different. I used 6 Yukon gold potatoes, and I boiled them (quartered) with one chicken boullion cube and one clove of garlic cut in half. I boiled them until almost done and then transferred the potatoes to a baking dish (9x13). As for the marinade I used JUST 1/3 cup olive oil, microwaved my lemon for 25 seconds (also made a cut in the skin- it came out pretty hot in one spot, be careful) and then zested as much of it as I could and then cut it in half, removed the seeds and squeezed out all of the juice. I decided it needed more lemon juice so I added some from a bottle (about a tablespoon). Then I used 1tsp ground thyme, 1tsp dried rosemary and half a crushed chicken boullion cube and finally, ground pepper and pink salt to taste. I stirred it good then poured it over my potatoes and stirred them up to coat them. I baked them uncovered for 15mins at 350 then stirred them and then put them back in for another 15mins, until the outsides get a bit crispy :) My fiancé loved them! He says he doesn't care what real Greek potatoes taste like because apparently my version was awesome. Enjoy :)"

I had to triple it, as I was having quite a few guests over, and it took just over 2 hours to cook. That was fine with me, as we had appetizers in the meantime, but I can see that amount of time being an issue on other occasions.\nThe potatoes weren't very lemon-y, actually. I found the rosemary stronger than anything. Some guests mentioned they preferred that, as they didn't like too much lemon flavouring on potatoes. But to be honest I would have preferred a more strong lemon taste. Probably just a personal preference.\nTaking one star off for the amount of time it takes and the crazy amount of water."
