Used it to make 3 dishes, Instead of chicken livers used chicken breasts in the stroganoff, chicken in gyro with homemade tzatziki sauce, and baked chicken breasts with yogurt sauce. The only thing extra is my 5lbs."

You may also wish to try adding some heat by adding one (and only 1) Serrano pepper (they look like really skinny fingers and come in colors of green and red) to your Tzatzeki recipe (chopped finely). But beware of adding too much heat: those rounded and colorful chilis (called Habanero peppers) are way too hot and will ruin your Tzatzek yogurt dip). The only other veggie i would add would be finely chopped onion."

"reviewBody": "Three stars as written. To make it 5 stars, use half the amount of yogurt and use full fat Greek or Mediterranean yogurt. Use an entire English cucumber, 4 fresh cloves of garlic grated on a microplane. Grate the cucumber into a fine mesh strainer, mix it with a tablespoon of kosher salt and let drain in the fridge overnight. Add the grated garlic to the lemon juice and let that sit overnight as well to mellow the heat from the garlic. \n\nNext day, squeeze any remaining liquid from the cucumber and mix with the yogurt along with the garlic-lemon juice mixture. Add chopped fresh dill to your taste or use mint instead, entirely a personal choice. Finally mix in a tablespoon of good quality EVOO. Put it back in the fridge for at least an hour or two to give the flavours a chance to blend. Taste and adjust sale if necessary and add some freshly ground black pepper or mix in some white pepper if you don't want any black flecks in the mix. \n\nMakes a fantastic side dip for Greek chicken brochettes and Greek roasted potatoes."

After playing around with numerous recipes and yogurts (very important to get the right one) this recipe won out. So our favorite yogurt to use is Cabot Greek Yogurt. Beats anything else by a mile! Also a note on the cucumber. After using the shredder sprinkle with salt to let it sweat for a few minutes and then just squeeze out the juice by picking up and squeezing a handful at a time. This way your sauce doesn't get runny. Enjoy!"

"reviewBody": "Awesome recipe. For years we have paid a small fortune to purchase some from our favorite restaurant. Now I will just make it at home. I used plain 2% Greek yogurt, which skips the step of straining and removing excess liquid from plain yogurt. After grating the cucumber on the larger edge of the grater, I squeezed paper towels on top of the cucumber to remove excess liquid and the end result was nice thick tzatziki. I also used less salt. Less is more and you can always add more, but you can’t take some out once you’ve used too much. I did not have too much time to let it sit for 8 hours, but ate it within a couple of hours of making it. It was ALMOST as good as it was the next day, so if you don’t have time to let it sit, don’t worry too much. Thank you for an awesome recipe and thanks to other reviewers for suggestions on making this"

I used 1 tsp. of pink salt and 1 tsp. of course black pepper , left out the fresh dill and added just a pinch of dry dill, left out the olive oil and I strained my yogurt to thicken it. I think in the future I will reduce the lemon juice just a little bit. It seemed to overwhelm the other flavors. The dip does get better with age. I think this is something that is easily adjustable to individual preference. I would have this again but I wouldn't make as much. We had a ton leftover!"

The only change I would make is to leave out either the lemon juice or the lemon zest, because both, I felt, were a little too strong. That being said, this recipe replicates my favorite Greek restaurant's tzatziki. And I was beginning to think I'd never find a recipe so delicious! Love this!! Will make it again and again!"

I only used 16 ounces of yogurt but left everything else the same, except the salt and pepper. I think that 1 Tablespoon of salt and pepper has to be a mistake. I used 1 teaspoon of each and it was perfect. Do not skip the lemon zest; I believe that is what made this so good."

I pressed between paper towels to absorb the excess moisture. The only alteration I made was I didn't have a fresh lemon so I used Realemon instead. Came out beautifully thick - not soupy. Will definitely make this again, and again."

I also seeded the cucumber, diced it very fine, and put it in a colander with the salt. After 1 hour i rinsed it under cold water and dried it on paper towels. She had it with Greek ground meat kabobs and pitas. She said it was the best she has ever tasted, bar none. Mike"

I did make a few modifications: instead of juice from a lemon, I used 4 drops of lemon essential oil; instead of 1 tablespoon of salt, I used four twists of Himalayan salt from a grinder; instead of 1 tablespoon of pepper, I put less than 1/4 tsp. I also tossed in 1 tablespoon of mint. After I mixed all of the ingredients, I took a taste test, and the recipe came out fabulous! It tastes like the restaurant made Tzatziki sauce that I absolutely love! Can't wait to taste it after 8 hrs!"

"reviewBody": "I made Tzatziki sauce for first time and decided to use this recipe because it called for dill. I did use greek yogurt and strained it for just a few hours in cheesecloth. I don't really feel this was necessary as I collected very little liquid. I have to agree with cutting back on the lemon and salt. I cut back on the salt by half while making the sauce (as I don't like a lot of salt) but failed to read about cutting back on the lemon. You really need only half of what is called for. I also used only 1 tablespoon of olive oil. I used a regular cucumber, seeded and partially peeled before I grated it. The end result was great. It does however come out thick which is what I intended. For those of you who want a thinner sauce try using half regular yogurt with greek yogurt. To make this recipe I used 4 small (7 oz) containers of Fage 2% greek yogurt."
