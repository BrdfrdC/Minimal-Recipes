"reviewBody": "As promised, this was flavorful, and the green beans were nice and crunchy! As the recipe creator suggests, prepping in advance makes the execution fast and easy. This dish has a richly flavored sauce (just a bit sweet for us) that formed a nice glaze for the chicken and vegetables. If you elect to serve with rice, doubling the sauce would be a good idea."
