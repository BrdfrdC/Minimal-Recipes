"reviewBody": "All, if your mesa is not following the laws of physics remember it is a buoyancy test and simply means your aggregation mixture is not distributed sufficiently even and dense enough to float. What is happening is that there is more room than should be left in your mesa ball and it fills with water and sinks. Try adding additional butter/lard and sifting flour first it may help with sedimentation density."
