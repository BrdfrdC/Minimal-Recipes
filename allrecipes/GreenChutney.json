"reviewBody": "This recipe was really good. I had my doubts when I just tasted it on its own but it was really good as a dip for samosas. I had to use lime juice instead of lemon juice because I'm in a place where it's not possible to find lemon juice (or lemons!) but I imagine it would be even better prepared correctly, so I'm giving it 5 stars. Though, I did have to add about 1/4 - 1/3 cup water and that's not tecnhically a part of the recipe. Also, make sure you process the peanuts first and then add the other ingredients because if you put them in at the end they don't get processed properly and you end up with whole peanuts in your chutney."

The down side for me, which was no fault of the author was that in BUlgaria, we do not have fresh cliantro. However, I did find thai corriander paste which I substituted for the cliantro. It was still good with this substitute but I bet this recipe would have been really good if I could get real cliantro like I would get back in the states..."

"reviewBody": "I made as directed with a few minor changes: instead of the hot green chile I used 1/4 of a seeded finely diced jalapeño. (if I were having friends over who couldn't take much heat, I might reduce the jalapeño even further). The peanuts are probably not necessary...but I had some on hand so I tossed them in. And I used 2 cloves of garlic. Once everything was blended I noticed it didn't look \"right\"...looked more like a pesto than a sauce...so I added about 1/4 to 1/3 c of sour cream. It was AMAZING! We spread on those extra thin Indian cracker/bread things (Papadam??) along with the red and brown sauces the Indian restaurants serve as appetizers."

"reviewBody": "Green chutney is simply the best. I have my variations of this: only garlic or only ginger - not both. I prefer it without peanuts. I do add a little of unsweetened grated coconut to give this chutney some body from time to time. A few mint leaves also enhance the flavor. I also add 1/4 tsp of sugar. I love to smother my toast with this chutney and it gives me a welcome and spicy break from all the sweet breakfast dishes like pancakes, cereals, etc. You may want to avoid this if it has garlic though!! Great recipe! As for kids: only Indian and Mexican kids and kids from countries where the cuisine is normally fairly spicy will venture near this recipe!!"
