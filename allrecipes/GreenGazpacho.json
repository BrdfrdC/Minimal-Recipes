I use the juice of one lime then add the white balsamic to make a 1/4 cup combined. And instead of the jalapeño I do 1 TB of mild green salsa because I don’t like things too spicy. I also add about a cup of water otherwise mine ends up too thick. I’ve added a handful of spinach too, which gives it nice color but does not change the flavor. And it makes 4-5 servings for me."

Other reviewers suggestions I’m up to try are adding dill, substituting mango for melon, adding unflavored plant based yogurt for extra creaminess and/or calm the jalapeño and adding spinach for extra vitamins, since folks say it doesn’t effect the taste. Can be garnished with almost all of the ingredients or additions for some extra texture and to upgrade presentation."

It’s great if you like to play around and see how modifications alter taste without risking having to throw good food and money away. I like to omit the avocado even though I like them. Using half the jalapeño works well as the heat is an after taste that lingers too long. Maybe wasabi next time? Vadalia onions work better than white."

I must admit that it was up there but perhaps it was just the pepper I was using. (And I'm not shy about eating spicy food.)"
