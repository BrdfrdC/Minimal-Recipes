"reviewBody": "This is really good, and fairly simple to make. I used a good vegetable bullion, as the author recommended, and omitted the salt. Couldn't find the correct pasta, so used salad macaroni which worked fine. One note: 10 minutes at medium high heat was much too much for the onion and garlic (the mixture started to brown after 5 minutes at medium, at which point I proceeded with the rest of the recipe). Healthy and very tasty!"

"reviewBody": "This was a really nice change from the ordinary tomato based minestrone. I made as written except that I waited until the last five minutes to drop my zucchini in because I like it crisp. The next time I make this I will wait to put the peas and green beans in then too but that is just a personal preference. I find this works better for me when the leftovers are reheated as well. All the veggies hold their bright green color that way. This one is a keeper!"
