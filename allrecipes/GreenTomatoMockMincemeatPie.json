I make a massive batch with whatever green tomatoes are left in the garden - so its something like 3 pounds of tomatoes, 3 pounds of apples, as many raisins as you've got....then once it cools I package it in quart size freezer bags and freeze them indefinitely. They never freeze solid so whenever you want a pie, just pull out a bag and throw it in a crust."

Since we want our pies for the holidays, I plan to freeze the filling --assuming we don't eat it all right out of the pot! Delicious!"
