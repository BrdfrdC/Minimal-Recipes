I used about a 1 tsp. Duck sauce paired perfectly with it. Definitely try to use low sodium soy sauce if you can. I used regular soy sauce and there were a few bites I felt it was to much. Thanks for sharing the recipe"

Also, I didn’t put the remaining marinade to boil before I basted because I didn’t think it was necessary since there wasn’t any cornstarch in it. It still was yummy !

I'm assuming the honey was in the recipe to help brown the chicken, because I couldn't taste it.\nAlso, I had no fresh garlic or ginger on hand, so I used dried. Amazing! I'm sure it will taste even better with fresh ingredients.\nI used bone-in chicken thighs that I left marinating for two hours, so the grill/cook time had to be adjusted for that.\nThis was a delicious recipe that I will make again."

I followed recipe exactly except for using organic low sodium tamari instead of regular soy and powdered ginger in stead of fresh, and did not heat the marinade. I made marinade, put in ziploc bag with chicken and marinated in fridge a few hours. I made a second batch of marinade (half amount) to use when grilling (did not heat marinade before). I followed advice of another reviewer and pounded the chicken breasts flat. We used free range organic 2.5 pounds. It took 5 minutes or less per side to cook. Served over rice. WOW"

I didn't have enough sesame oil so added canola oil for the remainder of the oil called for. I didn't have ginger root so used 2 teaspoons of the ginger that comes in a tube (found in the fresh produce section). Will be making this again, that's for sure! Thanks for posting. Can bake at 400 for 40-45 min, covered. Next time I'll try uncovered as sauce was thin."

I also put the chicken in a bag and marinaded for only one hour because I was low on time. Being marinaded for only an hour, it was still so flavorful and juicy.

Removed the tenders from the breasts and pounded the breasts nice and even then butterflied them and marinated at room temp for approx 20 minutes. They only took about 4-5 minutes per side on the grill and turned out fantastic. Next time I make this I will double the marinade and thicken it to serve as a sauce. Definite keeper."

It was VERY flavorful, and with a relatively small ingredients list, it's an economical dinner as well for those working with a small grocery budget. I chose to cut three large chicken breasts in to smaller 1 1/2 inch strips in order to reduce the cooking time and get a more intense marinade soak that penetrateed the entire piece of chicken. I'll be making this dish again :)"

I doubled the sauce, I only had teriyaki sauce, and I added dried onion flakes. I used my George Forman grill, and just tossed the chicken in the left over sauce afterwards. My little kids and husband went back for seconds. My kids kept saying how good it was. With it I made Jasmine rice and turned it into a simple fried rice with onion sauteed in sesame oil and 2 scrambled eggs. I will definitely be making this again and again. Thank you."

I've replaced ginger root for powdered ginger at time when I did not have any ginger root and it still turned out very well. I've served this with rice, noodles and have even made salads with chicken and broccoli slaw. This recipe is quick and easy to make. I usually don't heat the marinade either."

It didn't seemed to have a great balance of flavor for us. There are so many really good Asian marinade recipes out there that I don't think I will be making this again."

Unfortunately, because of a severe storm, I was unable to grill them but they came out wonderfully in my cast iron skillet. Everyone enjoyed them."

"reviewBody": "Well I can't follow directions and skipped the microwave step and went straight to the marinade step, but this turned out fine. The soy was a bit strong and maybe teriaki sauce would be better next time even though I used a low sodium soy sauce. I used powdered ginger and only 1 tsp. It could have used more though as I really like ginger. I used a packaged asian salad mix and then sliced this grilled chicken and placed it on top and this was as fancy and plate pretty as something you would get when dining out. I'd like sesame seeds added next time too, and maybe even some chives or green onion."

"reviewBody": "This had a subtle, nicely balanced flavor, but only after I fiddled with the marinade a bit. First, I used about half the amount of soy sauce called for. I know how it can permeate delicately flavored chicken and it could potentially have made it too salty as well. Half the amount was the right amount. Second, the type of sesame oil was not specified, and it should be. Does the submitter intend the light, cold-pressed sesame oil used for salads and for frying? Or did she intend the boldly flavored *toasted\" sesame oil, used for flavor, usually not more than a dribble in ANY dish? I just used my own judgment, using the light sesame oil for the most part and just a little of the rich, brown, toasted sesame oil for its wonderful flavor. Ginger root is not something I use often so I rarely buy it (and I'm not terribly fond of it anyway). A light pinch of ground ginger sufficed. The honey was a nice addition, giving the chicken a beautiful glazed appearance once it came off the grill. The chicken was tender and moist, but I credit Hubs' expertise with grilling for that! Served with Classic Fried Rice and Easy Bok Choy, this was a delicious, darned near memorable meal, and beautiful in its presentation. (Note: I didn't see heating the marinade ingredients as necessary, so I didn't bother with that step. I just used the easier, more common method of just dumping everything into a Ziploc bag. I marinated the chicken as the submitter recommended, about 15 minutes)"

It was excellent--we will be using it again"

I used about 1 t. of ginger from a tube (found in the produce department) and I ended up putting in another squirt of honey because I thought the soy flavor was a bit overpowering. I didn’t bother heating the marinade, just whisked the ingredients together and poured most of it over the chicken. I reserved some for Hubs to baste on while grilling. I marinated this in the refrigerator for about 4 hours. The chicken came off the grill looking beautiful, with wonderful grill marks. The taste, however, was disappointing after all the rave reviews. This was ok, but I’m sorry to say we weren’t wowed by it at all."
