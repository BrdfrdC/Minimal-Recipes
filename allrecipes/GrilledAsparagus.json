I used the olive oil and seasoning from the recipe, but after reading reviews, added a dash of onion powder and extra roasted garlic powder. I left it to marinate for about 45 mins. We have a \"deluxe broiler rack\" for cooking burgers and fish over an open fire while camping, which I put the asparagus in. Hubbs said it was way easier and less time consuming than the bamboo skewers (which im sure work great). Love this, will make again!"

"reviewBody": "Took other reviewers advice and marinated asparagus in a zip loc with EVOO, balsamic vinegar, kosher salt and garlic powder for several hours. Roasted in 425 degree oven for about 15 minutes. Next time will try w/o vinegar and a little shorter time, maybe a bit less salt. Still delicious. Thanks for a great recipe from someone who hasn't cooked a lot of asparagus!"
