"reviewBody": "I have made these multiple times, in the oven and in an instant pot. I do add an additional tablespoon of onion powder along with the other spices listed in the recipe; When I use my Instant Pot (IP) —I add a 1/2 Cup of each apple cider vinegar and apple juice and push the “pressure cook button” on the IP set for 25 min. I also broil them for 3min. At the end and then you can put your favorite BBQ sauce on! You also only do step #1 in the directions and at this point if you want to make ahead throw them in the freezer and you can use either method (IP) or follow this recipe to step # 2 ( thaw ribs overnight in fridge) or directly put ribs in instant pot frozen!!! ( only 25 minutes) It Pessure cooks it so no worries!!! So, when I am crunched for time this is also a fast and super yummy alternative!!! I thought I would add a photo as I make double batches and freeze them for something quick to pull out when I am in a pinch for time! I buy my short ribs from a local butcher that is same price as the grocery store, but much better quality and cut."

"reviewBody": "Awesome! Made this for a last minute get together with my parents and everyone was amazed. I did a few things different but the cooking instructions were exactly as described. I did use my own marinade and let them marinade for 6 hours before cooking. Marinade made with two bottles of Guiness, paprika, tamerik, garlic, pepper, BBQ sauce and A1. Then cooked in BBQ with the ice cubes as instructed. Then at the end, hit it with some BBQ sauce and cooked for 5 minutes on flame. Amazing. I originally wanted to keep checking it to see if it's cooking but I put it on the BBQ in foil, off flame at 400 degrees and didn't touch it for 1 1/2 hours. It was perfect. I used a 4 burner BBQ and just ignited the left and right burners and put the aluminum foil wraps in the middle off flame. Then added the BBQ at the end blacking it for 5 mins. Da Bomb"

They were definitely moist and had a wonderful flavor.

Followed the rest of the recipe. I thought they'd be done quickly, being boneless, but they still needed over an hour on the grill. We skipped the BBQ sauce step, plenty of flavor. I thought they were a little gritty, but that's probably because I didn't let the rub sink in for the full time. Taste and texture were great! Oh, PS--skipped the salt....as in so many recipes, really no need for it."

Then I cooked them with olive oil on the George Foreman Grill. They cooked to perfection in about 15 minutes or so. I served them with our favorite BBQ sauce on the side but they were juicy, tender, &amp; delicious on their own."

"reviewBody": "Well I used the aluminum foil, but that is it!!! I used 2 slabs of baby back ribs and cut into 4 sections. I removed the membrane! Brushed with Baby Rays Barbecue Sauce and put each section into aluminum foil in the fridge over night! Next day I put the ribs in the oven for 2.5 hrs on 300 degrees on a cookie sheet! When done, I simply put them on the grill for 5 minutes to give that barbecued flavor! Simply fell off the bone! And absolutely no mess!! Soo good!!!"
