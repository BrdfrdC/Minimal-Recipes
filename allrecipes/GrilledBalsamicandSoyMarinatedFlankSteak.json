"reviewBody": "Great recipe. Very easy. Followed it exactly as it was written with the only change of white balsamic rather than dark. Cooked it on the rare side as that is how we like it. I found it not too salty at all with the soy. I also heated up the marinade and cooked it down a bit to add as a sauce for the finished meat. This was hit for both my husband and me."

Sealed it in a gallon sized freezer bag and let it marinate from a Friday afternoon until Sunday evening. I did grill it about 12 to 15 minutes per side because my steak was about 2lbs and I like it a little less pink than the current photo here. It turned out perfect! This is a keeper! Thanks!"

I didn't have a grill though, so I broiled it 2-3 inches from broiler for 10 minutes one side and about 5 the other and though it didn't have the char-grilled taste I would have loved, it was still amazing! I will definitely make this again."

"reviewBody": "Very good, but still doesn't reach the level of my mother-in-law's, which is the reason for the 4-star rating. I did, however, like the contrast of the balsamic; I think it really stood out in the dish, in a good way. This is easy to throw together and will probably make again. It's a healthier alternative to those flank marinades with brown sugar."

"reviewBody": "Absolutely outstanding! I had a 2 pound flank steak, so the cooking time was 3 minutes longer for it to come out medium rare. Other than that I used yellow mustard because that was all we had in the house. The flavor was terrific and the smell of the steak, while it was resting, just made my mouth water. Not only will we have this again, we'll try the marinate on some other things as well."

After serving it to guests with corn on the cob and grilled asparagus, everyone thought I was a genius! One friend whispered to me to send the recipe to his wife!! I followed recipe exactly-except for the onions (a guest doesn't like them) and the steak was soooo tender and delicious. Many thanks for posting this."

The intensity of the marinade flavor increases with the time marinated, yet even with an hour long soak, the meat turns out pleasantly flavored with a savory rosemary and garlic essence with a hint of basalmic."
