When we were kids and Granny babysat us for the day since our parents were working .. our favorite lunch she fixed for us, especially on Fridays, was cream of tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches. I used this very simple and perfect recipe and fixed it for myself today amidst the tears. Thank you for helping me to remember Granny. Peace and all good."

I then place the buttered buns on a plate and spread mayo and a slice of tomato. Then place the melted cheese bun atop each. Eat alone or with anything you like such as soup or chips. I like sweet pickles to the side."

"reviewBody": "I'm surprised more people don't toast both sides of the bread. My family generally makes grilled cheese sandwiches on a griddle, so you could theoretically make about four to eight at a time. We just put the butter straight on the griddle then put as many slices of bread on that can fit. As soon as the first slice is finished toasting, we butter and flip it to the other side, putting a slice of cheese on the toasted side and a slice of half toasted bread on top with the toasted side on the cheese. This ensures the cheese will melt, as it will be between two warm toasted sides. Once the bottom side of the sandwich finishes toasting butter and flip it to toast the top. Make sure to use plenty of butter throughout the process.\n\nNext time I'm going to steal someone's idea of putting some garlic/oregano/basil in the butter to see how that turns out. Yum!"

I think the results of this post just goes to show that the grilled cheese is one of the most versatile, delicious sandwiches on the planet. It’s not vegan, but it can be! And it is vegetarian, yet ardently desired by meat-eaters. It can be made countless ways, without deviating from its grilled cheeseness. There is no “best” way. In the case of a grilled cheese, it’s really “all good”! I’d say it leaves burgers in the dust!"

For someone just starting out in life, this recipe, and the reviews, are so needed and appreciated. May I add that I've found a pan on a stove works better for grilled cheese than an electric skillet or griddle. The heat is more even. Oh, and don't squish the sandwiches with your spatula. It ruins the fluffy texture of the bread, which is perfect against the golden buttery crispness of the grilled outer layer."

"reviewBody": "I decided to make this classic grilled cheese because I’ve been feeling nostalgic this week. My two twin boys Cody and Brody just went off to college and their favorite meal growing up was a simple no nonsense grilled cheese. It’s scary knowing they’re off forging their own path, but the memories kept in a grilled cheese are keeping me from bawling my eyes out knowing i’ll be waking up without my boys in the home. Even though it hurts, this is a pain that hopefully every parent can experience, to see their children grow and flourish. I even made one with mayonnaise instead of butter. That was Brody’s favorite, but YUCK! I’ll stick to this classic myself. Good work!"

I used pasta instead of bread because that's what I had on hand, and instead of the butter I used chicken broth because I'm trying to go low-fat. The cheese would have been great but I decide to 'upgrade' by using a mix of shredded chicken, celery, onions and carrots. \n\nTo be honest, this tasted more like chicken noodle soup than anything else. 5 stars."

American cheese slices melt the best, but try whatever you like. I used Colby jack this time. Medium heat cooks them too quickly-- medium low gives the cheese enough time to melt without burning the bread."
