The ingredients of this dish pair well along with banana peppers on the side. I would suggest adding a 1/2 lemon for acidity to even out the flavor. Over all..... Not bad:)"

And the sauce that gets reduced at the end is sooo salty, even with low sodium soy - -when you are boiling down the soy sauce, the salt stays As someone else pointed out, the braising and the grilling times are enough to cook the chicken. Time reduction on both might help."

Grilling gives a nice texture, but timings for each part of the recipe (simmer then grill) are almost enough in themselves to cook the chicken. And too much liquid for the quantity of chicken."

It might still be a little salty for some, but adding some water would probably cut some of that. The chicken comes out dynamite and it's much less salty that way.

I only had bone-in chicken, so I put five chicken thighs in the sauce (turning them in middle so they all should be submerged at some point) and cooked for 40 minutes. Then I transferred to a pan and broiled in the oven for five minutes. I boiled the sauce a little more to reduce and then spooned some over the chicken, as well as over the rice and broccoli I served as sides. The house smelled fabulous and the whole family loved this supper."

I omitted the bay leaves, used slightly more garlic and could only find bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (of which I removed the skin before using). The meat practically fell off the bone!"

Next time we will grill on medium and until they look crispy but not charred. Our fault not the recipe. Will make this one again. served with cilantro lime rice recipe (my cilantro had gone bad in fridge) so it was just lime rice but still good! Sauce reduced fine on high heat while grilling the meat but it didn't thicken up like gravy, not that I expected it to."

You can always add more saltiness but you can't get rid of it once its there. Try it with 1 cup rather than 1 1/2. I used rice vinegar and would recommend trimming the fat off the thighs before cooking. Fantastic recipe. I served it with \"roasted beets n sweets\" from this recipe and it paired beautifully."

We made the recipe exactly as stated except cut back on the soy sauce. We also used apple cider vinegar. Try this- while the chicken is on the grill, cut up some broccoli and toss it into the boiling sauce. Very delicious and will definitely make this again! Would be a crowd pleaser when company comes over."

Balsamic vinegar may have been over powering, but I'm not sure, it could have gone nicely with the flavors. I also used low sodium soy sauce. A little bit of the sauce goes a long way! Go easy on it or your rice and chicken will be over powered. I forgot to mention that to one diner, they used a lot of the sauce, and they said it was too salty."

I'm glad that the weather was nice as I needed to air out the house...the smell is great, but very intense with the vinegar and soy. I will do this one again."
