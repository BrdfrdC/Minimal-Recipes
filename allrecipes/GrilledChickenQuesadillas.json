I did a few changes though: I used the taco bell fajita seasoning instead of the adobo (dont even know what that is and didnt have time to look) and I only put cheese with the chicken (picky husband). I also used bonless skinless breasts. I cooked this in my humongous skillet on the stove. Worked great! (took a little practice to flip!) I scaled the recipe down to half and it still made a LOT for my husband and I. I have 2 days of leftovers for my lunch, fine with me! I served this with mexican rice and it was a great new dinner. Thanks!"

I like a lot of vegetables with my quesadillas so I made a kind of pico de gallo with green and red bell pepper and tomato added with the chiles and onion, seasoned with some salt. It adds a nice fresh and crispy taste. I also used my griddle to toast my tortillas instead of my grill. it has a much lighter toasting effect."
