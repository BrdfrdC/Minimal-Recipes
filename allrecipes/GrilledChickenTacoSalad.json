Hubs loved the seasoning on the chicken, but I felt after being grilled on a hot grill, the spices appeared to be burnt, however they didnâ€™t taste burnt. We both loved the bean/salsa combo. Since cilantro isnâ€™t a favorite of ours, I chose to use parsley instead, and only in the bean/salsa mixture, not in the salad. We skipped the corn tortilla but I did serve the salad with tortilla chips. We also opted to use some ranch salad dressing instead of the sour cream. This was a really good salad and I know weâ€™ll be making it again. Itâ€™s great for these hot, humid summer days!"

I did have one major chance with the recipe. My chicken was already cooked. I had roasted a whole bird and had a lot of meat leftover. I made up the marinade in the morning and smeared it all over the cooked (cold) chicken breast. At dinner time I threw it in a skillet to heat it and then proceeded with the recipe. It was fantastic. To my hubby's plate I added a little shredded cheese and fresh jalapeÃ±os. We love hearty dinner salads in the summer time, and MTCHYG, yours didn't disappoint. Thank you for sharing."

I rubbed the seasoning on quite heavy for lots of flavor and let them sit about 15 minutes. I just got a tortilla shell baker from Pampered Chef so I put my tortilla in that and made bowls to serve it in. Delicious! In addition to the avocado, sour cream and cilantro topping I added shredded Mexican blend cheese and diced tomatoes."
