Cooked at 250 for 45 min on our pellet grill, turned them over, turned temp up to 275 and cooked another 40 min basting with bbq in last 10 minutes. Will definitely make again!"

This overwhelmed the pork, and the marinade. Next time--and there will be a next time for this recipe, I'll content myself using only lump charcoal."

"reviewBody": "I had never made country style ribs, but my husband wanted some so I decided to try this recipe. He remembered his mother par boiling her ribs, so I made the marinade and added enough water to it to cover the meat in the pot. I boiled the ribs for an hour, and then he grilled them with extra barbecue sauce for just a few minutes. They were great. Extremely tender and wonderful flavor."

Since we aren't wine drinkers, I substituted grape juice for the wine &amp; they were amazing! I grilled the ribs on foil on the top rack of our gas grill for an hour on-medium low. They couldn't have been any better &amp; this will become one of our favs!"
