"reviewBody": "Wow-good!! And would work on any cut of beef - including the cheaper cuts! I had sirloin and had to halve the recipe since it was just the two of us. Started step 2 at noon (seasoning the steaks) and returned to the fridge until an hour before we were going to start the grill (to bring steaks to room temperature) - so, roughly 5 hour marinate time. Sauce; I also halved (2c vs 4) but left the two cheese amounts as written and did 1/8 tsp nutmeg, salt and pepper. Even halved, the sauce almost took an hour to cook down (I did use a smaller burner) and STILL have leftover sauce! I am debating whether to use over chicken or burgers. This truly was amazing and even my “likes only S&amp;P on his steaks” husband really, really enjoyed this! PS; also great with sautéd mushrooms. Thank you Shawn Alton!!"

"reviewBody": "I used this recipe for the cream sauce itself (my husband grills the steaks :) and it was delicious, but I used half of the cream, 5 oz. of the cheese, and the same amount of the rest of the ingredients as I wanted a thicker sauce. It was delicious and turned out exactly as I wanted. I thought the nutmeg was an unusual addition, but it gave it a really nice flavor. Even though I halved the amount of cream, I still had quite a bit left over, so I steamed some broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots and mixed it in with them, and that worked well too. The sauce is delicious and versatile, and I would definitely like to make it again."

"reviewBody": "Observations:\n\nDespite following the recipe exactly, sauce was consistency of milk when pouring over steaks. I didn't wash my pans after dinner--don't judge ;-)--and, next morning, the remaining sauce in the pot was thickened and what I would consider the correct consistency. So, IF I made this again, I'd allow time after cooking for it to sit and, hopefully thicken.\n\nSpeaking of there being remaining sauce--this recipe makes A LOT of sauce. I served a family of 5 and still had LOTS left over. I'd probably half it next time.\n\nI've seen other commenters mention it and so did my (adult) son: it's bland. I'd add some spices to increase flavor. Or, as my son suggested, try it again using bleu cheese instead of Gorgonzola."

"reviewBody": "Awesome!!! Made tonight, and the only thing I forgot was the green onion....didn't need it. Bacon I used was ready made kind and just crumbled ontop. The filets we made inside (storms) so we preheated the gas oven to 425 and baked 9 minutes each side, and they came out medium rare which is what we were aiming for, too rare and hubby gets grossed out. Sauce I made in a medium stainless steel sauce pan with a copper bottom and it only took 40-45 minutes to reduce once I got to the right temp. And as another reviewer noted this is a \"to taste\"sauce and you either add or reduce the cheeses and salt/pepper to your liking, but the nutmeg makes it so don't omit it, taste the sauce while adding the ingredients. Made with farro and asparagus, the sauce was great on the asparagus."

Both hub by and grandson said it tasted good but I was underwhelmed. Next time use nonfat half and half and thicken if necessary. Also I think I prefer the flavor of blue cheese instead of Gorgonzola to compliment the rich steaks. Maybe next time I'll just use crumbled blue cheese on the steaks or hamburger just before it comes off the grill. Less calories and a complimentary flavor with beef. Or combine blue cheese with Panko and put under the broiler for a minute or two."

I did add a pinch of cayenne but couldn't even taste it anyways. the only slight problem I had was that the sauce did not thicken even with the reduced amt of cream. Ended up adding probably a bit more than a T cornstarch. Perfect. Nice and thick, good flavour, especially with the bacon and green onions. for my steaks I wrapped them in bacon and broiled them after brushing with some olive oil, salt and pepper. To die for!"

"reviewBody": "I made this for Valentines day and it was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as far as ingredients but I did use less cream to make a smaller quantity of the sauce (there were only 2 of us). I just eyeballed the Gorgonzola &amp; Parmesan according to my taste and just added until i got the consistency I wanted (and it didn't take a full hour to get the cream to reduce/thicken nicely- I only used about 1.5 cups and we had plenty of sauce for 2 people to use generously). It's very flavorful &amp; rich- definitely my favorite cream sauce I've ever eaten on a steak! I wasn't sure about the nutmeg- I like it but my husband doesn't - however I went for it &amp; we didn't notice it in the finished product. However, the sauce was so good, I will make it exactly the same next time as I can only assume it's in there for a reason! I also seasoned the steaks according to this recipe and would follow this again- I did them stove top in my grilling pan. I paired this with roasted asparagus and the whole meal was a success. Great recipe for a special occasion at home- yet, it wasn't difficult, only took me about 40min start to finish so it was feasible for a working mom with a toddler to pull off with little hassle. *we don't care much for onions, so I garnished the top with the bacon crumbles &amp; a little fresh parsley which added color and also seemed to work nicely with the cream sauce. Can't wait to make this again!"

The only changes I made was to the sauce- I used half n half and reduced fat gorgonzola simply because that is what I had on hand. The sauce does take one hour - and needs 'hand holding' so plan to spend the time. And, don't forget the nutmeg- it's a must. This is a 5 star dish suitable for a special occasion."

The only people in the family who aren't demanding it every year are the people who generally do the cooking and were humbled by the deliciousness. Not difficult, and the leftovers made by far the best mac'n'cheese I've ever had. Unfortunately, regular steak and mac'n'cheese are ruined for me now."

As soon as I switched to a large pan it reduced by half quickly!\nMake sure you really like gorgonzola cheese before you make it. The sauce was very strong. I only used about 1/4 of the sauce on our fillets and it was plenty!"
