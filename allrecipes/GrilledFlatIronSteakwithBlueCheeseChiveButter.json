It's thin so it smokes very quickly, but the flavor the smoke adds was incredible. I highly recommend you try it if you have a smoker! I used plum wood simply because that was all I had on hand at the time."

"reviewBody": "The local grocery had \"flat iron steaks\" on sale. So... I had to try it. Based on quantity of reviews I opted for this recipe. Most of my family dislikes blue cheese, so I was lucky to find 'blue cheese butter' already mixed in the grocery gourmet section. I was happy to buy that for a few dollars vs. all the ingredients for higher cost. Guess what? NO topping necessary! The meat was tender and delicious marinated and grilled. This recipe (minus topping) will be a staple for us now. As for the blue cheese butter -- turns out it's pretty good on 'loaded' sandwiches. (you know, with tomato, lettuce, avocado, etc.)"

I cooked the meat for the time given, 5 minutes on each side, and it was more rare than medium rare. This actually worked out, because after I sliced it, I put the butter over the slices and put it into the oven for about 5 minutes until it was more medium rare. This melted the butter all over the meat!"

I sprinkled some blue cheese on the steak right after I pulled it off the grill. i don't know what it would have tasted like if i did use the butter, but I can tell you the steak we had was wonderful!"

"reviewBody": "Excellent flavor but I should have let my meat marinate longer. I used a chuck steak, that had some fat throughout, and marinated it for about 30-45 minutes. It was chewable but still kind of tough in my opinion. I didn't have any chives so I just mixed the blue cheese and butter together and sat it on top of the steaks after they are done. This was good but not great. Maybe I really did need the chives. I would make this again but will definitely use a different cut of steak and let it marinate longer."
