First time making them I followed the exact recipe (Which is delicious on its own) but I add onion powder to the recipe now. Also,I am a very avid hunter and when dove season roles around on Sept. 1st here in MO, you can bet your bottom dollar I put a single dove breast on top of the cheese filling before wrapping in bacon then they go straight on the grate if my Weber grill. Oh so so good :)"

"reviewBody": "I have been making this recipe for about a year. These are so good! I made a couple tiny changes. I removed stem and sliced in half longways. Let the bacon sit out for about 10 minutes so it softens up and can wrap easier. Toothpicks are not necessary at all. I bake in oven for 20-22 minutes at 375 degrees. Make sure you put them on a rack while baking, that way the bacon crisps up. I assemble a couple batches at a time and keep in frig and bake a few every day. Holds up well. Make sure you use gloves. I dip in Marie's ranch dressing. Definately a keeper. As a bonus, if you are Keto or low carb diet, these are a perfect snack!"

I did have to change the process since I have a standing pepper grill rack, but that didn't affect the flavor of recipe itself. I chopped the bacon and added it to the filling since I couldn't really wrap them. With just the slight adjustments noted, this will be a regular event in our backyard!"

I swapped Mozzarella cheese, used fresh grated Parmesan cheese, along with 1 tsp. garlic powder and cream cheese. I worked in plastic gloves for this recipe. For 7 of us, we ate them ALL! Would definitely make again. Bonus: one suggestion said to use the extra cream cheese filling on crackers; would definitely double the filling recipe and serve as a dip next time, too!"

The largest weighed in at 10.2oz, uncut and unseeded. These were definitely knife &amp; fork peppers; not \"poppers\". I just laid the bacon strip on top.\nMmmm; but they were good.\nThanks."

This was my test, so I just made half the recipe.\n\nI took the easy way out and microwaved the bacon, crumbled it and mixed it into the cheese mixture instead of wrapping the bacon around each jalapeno. I also just cut the jalapenos in half, cleaned out the seeds and stuffed them instead of doing the slivers. I then finely chopped about 1/2 a jalapeno and mixed that into the cheese mixture. I put on a sprayed grill pan on the grill for about 30 minutes. Very Yummy-- grilling the jalapeno seemed to kill some of the heat so they weren't too spicy--just right!"

Since I'd prefer to cook them in the foil, I'm adding cooked bacon bits to the top of each.\nThank you so much for a fantastic, fun recipe! My husband and family asks for them all the time.

Make sure you get all the seeds out but once you do, the poppers are just a tad bit spicy -- not really hot at all. The flavor is really excellent. We split the poppers in 2, filled them then wrapped 1 piece of bacon around each slice -- securing it on both ends with a toothpick. I only bought 9 poppers (18 halves) but ended up using all of this recipe. LOVE this and am so excited to share it with my friends. Perfect just as it is."

I cut the slices in half, which makes sense b/c a full slice would be too much. But it didn't cover the entire surface of the cheese area and sometimes the cheese dripped into the fire. I also didn't use toothpicks, which I will have to try next time. As my boyfriend was grilling them at our tailgating party, I was taking the bacon off of them since it was causing problems. He just fried the bacon next to the peppers and people grabbed a slice with a popper. I have some leftover cheese mixture which I'm going to use to make some more but put them in the oven. \n\nThe taste was fantastic and everyone still loved them, regardless of the mess!"

"reviewBody": "Fantastic. But having a 'tray' to grill the jalapeno peppers upright I just stuffed the whole pepper. Also rather than fussing with wrapping the pepper with bacon I added in real bacon bits I bought at the store. The combinations of cheese really hit the spot. And everyone that tried them liked that better than just cheddar that some recipes."

"reviewBody": "For years I've wanted to make jalapeño poppers and I finally did today. In another recipe someone suggested boiling the bacon to lose some if the grease but I realized that you shouldn't because it loses taste also. Just use turkey bacon. It doesn't leave them as greasy should you choose to make them in the oven. ~Thanks~"

I found them quite tasty and easy to do. I opted to split the jalapeno to get the seeds and membranes out and then reserved a few jalapenos to use to mix with the cream cheese mixture."
