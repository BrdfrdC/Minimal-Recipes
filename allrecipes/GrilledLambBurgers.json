I just made a few adjustments, including using fresh oregano (as another reviewer suggested) and I doubled the bread crumbs as the consistency of the burger mixture was too 'wet.' I served the burgers on buns with garlic mayonnaise, lettuce, and feta cheese. A delicious meal!"

"reviewBody": "This was a HUGE hit in our house. The preschoolers loved it (I may lessen the spices just a tad for them next time), and my husband has declared it to be a new \"staple\" in the house. We use toasted English muffins instead of hamburger rolls (something my mom used to do). I have made it with dried mint and fresh (the latter is preferred, but the former will do). This summer I'm likely to use all fresh herbs instead of any dried, but in the meantime, however we need to make it will make the whole family happy. Now if I can just remember to make the Tzatziki the day before..."

"reviewBody": "Excellent burgers, we loved them! I did make a change though by making and then topping the burgers with homemade greek tzatki. The slightly gamey taste of the lamb worked well with tzatki (made w/fat free greek yogurt)and allowed to skip a fattening condiment like mayo. We added a greek side salad and glasses of sangria for a great friday night meal. Would definetely make again."

I cooked in some ghee in cast iron pan, and everyone including the kids loved them. served them with sliced tomatoes and onions. Also fried some onions until soft and brown in the leftoever fat, and topped the lambergers. Will be making again with missing ingredients added!"
