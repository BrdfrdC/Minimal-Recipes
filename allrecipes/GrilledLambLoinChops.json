"reviewBody": "I made these lamb chops exactly as described.....and had no choice but to leave the rub on for only one hour....My only regret was not making more lamb chops than I did! We all wanted seconds. They were absolutely WONDERFUL and the fact that they were super fast was the biggest bonus for this working mom. No worries about marinating for many hours...quick on the grill. Perfection! (I used lamb loin chops and can't wait to make them again!). Sorry, no photo. They looked and smelled so good, they disappeared before I could even think about it! Thank you for this recipe!"
