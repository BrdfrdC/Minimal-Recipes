I have made several times - sometimes I pre-peel the shrimp, others I marinade with shell still on. I prefer the latter; I feel like the EZ Peel holds the flavor in more. But! For shellfish newbies; the idea of peeling the shrimp...not for everyone so I do it based on whether I’m serving me and my husband or have a pickier guests. (Also depends on kind of event). Either way; this is one of my go-to’s when grilling season starts and I have a hankering for shrimp! Thank you!"

We eat this shrimp like popcorn, in omelets, on PoBoys toasted and fully dressed, on noodles as scampi, snacks for midday etc. I generally do 3lb of large shrimp on this recipe for 2 people. I use ketchup instead of tomato paste and I double the amount of garlic. The spice is nice and my preference is Louisiana Hot Sauce. Sooo Good my mouth waters just thinking about those shrimp."

I also marinated some zucchini, onions, and cauliflower in it and that went on the grill as well. I made some chickpea pasta and mixed it with sauteed onions and peppers and the remaining marinade, and ended up throwing the grilled vegetables into the saute pan to marry it all together. Just wonderful! And hats off to the reviewer who had the idea to spoon out tablespoons of the tomato paste onto waxed paper and freeze. I only had a big can of paste, and I was glad to not have it go to waste. This was a wonderful recipe that we will be using often!"

I spend more time threading the shrimp onto kebabs then anything else.It really enhances the flavor of the shrimp without masking it."

"reviewBody": "I made this for a group event of about 40 people. Everyone raved about this recipe. At least 5 men specifically came up to me and said this is the best shrimp they have ever ate. \nI did make 15 pounds of shrimp so I made 7 times the amount. I marinated the shrimp for 2 hours and didn't add the lemon juice till 30 minutes before. But I agree with many here. The Lemon juice starts \"cooking\" the ends of the shrimp and created a gummy coating. Again everyone loved it though. I will only marinade it for 30-45 minutes next time and add the lemon about 5-10 minutes before grilling. We put the veggies on separate skewers from the shrimp which worked really well."

I didn't have much time to marinade the shrimp, probably gave it about 20 minutes, so I doubled the garlic, lemon, salt, pepper, and Cholula. This was SO FREAKING GOOD that I pulled out more shrimp and we're making more for later. I didn't have tomato paste, parsley, or oregano so we made this more of a lemon pepper shrimp. Thank you for sharing such a fantastic recipe!!"

We've never been shrimp eaters, but this recipe, along with being able to grill outside (it's HOT where we live in So Cal) are opening us to a whole new direction for our menus! I followed it exactly on a package of thawed, raw jumbo shrimp, marinating it for about 4 hours, flipping it (in the fridge) about 3 times. I halved the recipe and used one pound shrimp (won't anymore...LOL), skewered them up (one pound with 10 on each skewer gave us 4 or 5 skewers), and they grilled up in only a few minutes. Total keeper recipe, and one to repeat hummm...about 100xs a summer :). You can ALWAYS find ways to use already-grilled, leftover shrimp!!!"

And I don't bother to brush the shrimp with any reserved marinade. It cooks so quickly (usually 3 minutes per side) and the concentrated marinade, by using less oil in the marinade, gives it plenty of flavor. Many times I have marinated the shrimp only a few minutes and still get great results. One of my favorite recipes for entertaining."
