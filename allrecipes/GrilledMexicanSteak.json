I toasted those comino seeds ...and maybe shorted the culantro a bit ...but a bunch of culantro in Costa Rica is a whole lot of culantro. And the meat was a bit rare (although I exceeded the cook times) which I (a Gringo) loved ...and everybody else chowed down (though might prefer a bit more cooked. ) Served with salsa (called chimichuri in Costa Rica) and grilled onions and peppers. A big winner over all winner! A full 5 star !!!for a Mexican recipe!\n\nTHANKS FOR SHARING!"

I also used ground cumin (did it to taste) rather than deal with toasting the cumin seeds.\nI only marinated it for a couple of hours. After putting the meat on the grill, I poured the leftover marinade into a sauce pan and boiled it for about 5 minutes. Then I poured off almost all of the oil and used what was left as a sauce. DELICIOUS!!!!"

And we were both surprised that the meat wasn't more tender. It marinated for 48 hours and was cooked rare. We have other recipes that we enjoy much more. Won't be making this again."

It looked like Martian food when I went to grill it, but smelled terrific and even the non red meat eaters enjoyed. We used top sirloin grilling stake as I am not sure what skirt or flank is, must be localized word for the same thing. We did use pre-ground cumin to save time, the result was fantastic! thanks TA91!!"

"reviewBody": "First of all, the default quantity of ingredients this calls for is absurd. Three pounds of meat? Two bunches of cilantro? An entire jar of cumin seeds? The amount of food this made would feed every inmate in a Juarez prison. I ended up having to make a second trip to the grocers to buy more meat, once I had discovered the monstrous amount of marinade I had staring at me from my pan. Secondly, toasting the cumin seeds and pureeing the cilantro gave my house a bizarre odor, which I found off-putting. For the amount of work this took to prepare, I don't think it's deserving of all the fanfare. The meat ended up being edible, which is at least something. I say \"adios\" to this dish."

"reviewBody": "We loved it! I was a little worried that it would be too hot for my younger children with 5 jalepenos, but it was perfect. I made the marinade and marinated it for 3 days. I used the ground cumin also and I used petite sirloins. I grilled it a little longer on my indoor grill- close to 15 minutes on each side- and it was still pretty pink on the inside. I served it with Mexican Rice II. I uploaded a photo to share with everyone too. It was a great change from a traditional steak. Thanks for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "I did use 1/4 c of the preground cumin instead of the seed as suggested by TeaChef. I also substituted the fresh jalepenos for the jar jalepenos and used about 3/4 cup, because that is what I had on hand at the time. Beware the cilantro, 2 bunches is a little vague for me. Somehow I interpreted this as two whole bunches from the grocery store. However in my area we are blessed with some pretty large bunches. I used about a 1/4 of one of my bunches and it was very thick and very, very green. I was concerned that perhaps I had ruined the recipe, but after scraping off the marinade and grilling my family really loved it. My suggestion is to add the cilantro to the food processor slowly until you get the consistency you like. Good recipe though, easy and well worth the effort."

"reviewBody": "This was magnificent! Everyone raved. Only change I made was using 1/4 cup of pre-ground cumin since I didn't have any of the seed. The blender was already out, so used it instead of the food processer. I marinated the steak for 24hrs. Served it along with grilled peppers and onion, a salad of chunked cucumber, tomatoes and minced red onion and MORE cilantro tossed in PaulNewman's new Light Lime Viniagrette, and finally AllRecipe's \"Sweet Corn Cake\" recipe. Umm, ummmm good!"
