"reviewBody": "I live in the Boston area where we are lucky to have an international selection of top quality foods, Greek food being no exception so I know how excellent grilled octopus should taste like.\n\nThis is not it. I am a decent cook and based on all the reviews I followed each step carefully without improvising. The result was horrible - yes, it was cooked and fairly tender but the protein in the octopus was over cooked and had the texture of fake crab meat, a touch firmer.\n\nThe charred taste was dominant, there was no taste of octopus left. No taste, no texture not anything of octopus but a very bitter charred piece of random protein. Very sad for the time I spent on it. I managed to take a couple of bites but the rest went into compost. \n\nAnd although I had some orange after and cherries, I still have a strong bitter taste in my mouth. Very unfortunate."
