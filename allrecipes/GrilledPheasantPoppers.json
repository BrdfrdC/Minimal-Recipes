Cut the jalapeños in half, removed the seeds and white veins. Next I place a layer of cream cheese, then the breast and wrapped in bacon. Because of the larger size I used 2 skewers, 4 popper per the set of skewers. Sorry I didn’t take a picture but they were great! You could probably forgo the skewers all together and use toothpicks on each popper to hold the bacon in place."
