The contrast in textures and the sweet-salty combo of the prosciutto and peach is delicious! I crumbled goat cheese beneath each peach (because that's what I had on hand) and it was very tasty with the peaches. Everyone loved it. Can't wait to try with the burrata cheese. Thanks for another great recipe, Chef John!"

The creamy burrata cheese (my firstfirst time having burtata-yum!) worked well with the peaches too and the fresh basil was a much needed and perfect fresh compliment to the dish. I made this as a simple and delicious lunch."
