I grilled them until the shell turned red. Perfect built in thermometer. \n\nI also grilled a skewer of shrimp. Shells off 13 to 15 count. Just basted with butter. Grilled perfectly. I grilled until they appeared done. I did not time. Served with a salad of home grown lettuce a so called cleopatra dressing with pieces of fried bacon. \n\nWill definitely do this meal again."

I baste the lobster tails and grill, flesh down over the coal for 2-3 minutes. Then I flip them to the shell side off to the non-coal side for indirect heating. Baste them again and close the grill lid and allow to cook for another 5-6 minutes until the shells are red the the tail flesh is white and slightly firm. Remove from the grill and baste them one last time."

The base mix with my add on's made it BEYOND memorable. This is a great marinade for lobster, going to try this again using fish!! 15 min and basting on both sides and they came out PERFECT!!"

Brushed marinade on flesh and cooked flesh side down and then brushed on shell. Made sure to gently press flesh down for contact with griddle grill. Flipped to back of shell to gently cook lobster and then back again. Kept using some marinade to baste while cooking. Lobster easily came out of shell and didn't need butter. Used extra marinade to cook Tilapia filets as well! All were delicious!"

For my oven recipes the tail is split down the back (top). I ended up splitting from the top flipping it a couple of times. It need the full 12 minutes as the top inside wasn't fully cooked.at 9 min."

"reviewBody": "I mixed it just the like the recipe shows and we loved it! I agree with KARPOWELL that is doesn't need to cook for 12 minutes on the grill. Mine took about 10 minutes tops. But the marinade is so fast and easy to make and tastes great! Gives the lobster a nice little spice without over powering it. I will definitely use this recipe over and over again. I'm gonna try it on some shrimp for the grill next time. Thanks for sharing your recipe with us! :D"

"reviewBody": "Made the \"sauce\" almost exactly as written, but subbed a little butter in for part of the oil. This sauce is amazing, and is obviously what makes this recipe work. I used smaller (cheaper) tails, but made all the sauce. Used it to marinade the tails shortly before grilling and it was perfect to bring the meal together by dribbling some over the finished steak and asparagus. I cooked my tails just under 10 minutes and basted them very frequently...You cannot walk away from the grill while these are on. They turned out great! My daughter devoured her portion, and my wife said it was the best lobster she ever had (pretty good for $5 tails)."

However at a friend's BBQ last night, no one else knew how to grill lobster after they purchased it. I searched for a recipe and came across this one. I have never received so many great compliments about something. This recipe was perfect! I did not have any lemon or white pepper so I omitted those and added melted butter while the lobster was on the grill to keep them moist. I will definitely use this recipe from now on!"

So after going on a diet there were only certain foods I could have and I thought I'd give lobster a try, and this recipe was fantastic. I followed it to the \"t\" and the results were absolutely delicious. My kids even loved it and they won't eat any kind of seafood. Great recipe, thanks for the upload! Just a side note, I put a little honey on some before cooking once and it was great too. I just mixed about a tablespoon of honey with the olive oil and it turned out great too. We'll have it either way, this recipe is great without any modifications."
