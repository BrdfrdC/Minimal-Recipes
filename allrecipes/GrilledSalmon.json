Omitted the salt as the soy has plenty. I seldom marinade the full time, but do make slashes in the salmon so that it soaks into it better. I broil for about 10 minutes, serve with Israeli couscous and steamed vegetables."

Once the oven reached temp I placed the salmon skin size down on the pan. Placed it back in the oven and baked for 12 minutes. Salmon was flaky and the skin was crisp. Yummy marinade."

"reviewBody": "I had 1 small filet of salmon and wanted to bake it in the oven with my Brussels sprouts so went on the search for a simple recipe. Came across this and so glad I did. I divided the ingredients by 3, following everything except I didn‚Äôt have time to marinate the salmon. I saw the review about poaching, so I put the salmon in a piece of foil and drizzled half the marinade on top. Folded the top of foil, leaving some air space and baked at 400¬∞ for 15 minutes. Oh my! So good! Next time I will marinate the salmon a couple hours, as suggested, and grill it. But poaching will be my winter cooking method from now on."

Make sure to get skin-on fillet so that the salmon does not get dried out on the grill. I leave the salmon skin down for 7-8 minutes then flip for another 5-6 minutes. Watch the thinner part of the fillet so it does not over cook. Thank you for this easy, delicious recipe!"

Its amazing, its easy, its super fast. It tastes like salted fish candy. There is a good reason why this gets 5 of 5 stars. To make salmon any other way is just waste of good fish. Sometimes i throw mine on stovetop and sear it in pan with a very lil bit oil, just to make it a lil crunchy on outside."

It worked very well with the grill set to low. Thanks!"
