"reviewBody": "This chicken was great! We served it with rice and broccoli that I cooked in the reserved sauce (with some corn starch, like the notes said) and added a bunch of red pepper flakes and we loved it! Could just as easily be cooked on a skillet and add more sauce, which would be great over rice."
