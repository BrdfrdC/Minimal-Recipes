Take care not to overcook them, as once they soften too much, they will be hard to flip over and/or get off the grill. Easily customizable with different seasoning, but the simple salt, pepper and garlic is perfect."

"reviewBody": "I had a couple of on the vine tomatoes that I used for this. My result wasn’t all that great, but in fairness to the recipe, it could have been my tomatoes. It’s nearly impossible to get a decent tomato in Ohio this time of year. So, I’m giving this recipe the benefit of the doubt and giving it 5 stars. I’ll try it again when garden tomatoes are available to see if this recipe really is 5 stars."

"reviewBody": "I LOVE grilled tomatoes! I always throw them on the grill after the meat is almost done with the same temperature and method. I normally just do the olive oil and some kosher or regular salt. I will have to try adding some fresh garlic next time to see how that affects the taste. I am just a tad afraid of the fresh garlic burning. It really doesn't need it. Roma tomatoes tend to work the best, just cut in half. If you have never grilled a tomato you must try."

"reviewBody": "Simple and delicious! This is perfect for those warm summer months when tomatoes from the garden are so abundant. It's not only vibrant in color but also in taste. I combine my olive oil and minced garlic together and drizzle that over top while the tomatoes are grilling. After they come off I sprinkle with a little salt and pepper then top with fresh basil. Sometimes I add either fresh mozzarella for a \"grilled caprese\" or shredded Parmesan although they're great plain. No matter what you do these taste wonderful and can be a great appetizer or side dish. The leftovers (if there are any) are great on thick, crusty bread!"
