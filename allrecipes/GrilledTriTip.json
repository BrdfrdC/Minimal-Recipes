Then my favorite bbq sauce and mustard and use a brush to spread it even. Then cover it in plastic wrap overnight. Trick to cooking tender meat is getting the meat to room temp before putting it on heat. So leave the meat out for a couple hours before putting it on the grill. I’ve done this the same way forever and my dad before me. Best tri tip you’ll ever have."

It was still WAAAAY to salty!!!! It was my very first tri-tip, so I am pretty upset that this got such good reviews. Blown away, actually. I had to cut off all the edges and eat the middle. I like salt, and I like garlic, this just is not a normal amount of these products. I highly recommend staying away from this recipe. As far as cooking, I did a reverse sear which was pretty good. I set it on the indirect side until 123 degrees, then seared it. Did not sear it first, as instructed in this recipe. I have never seen that on any BBQ sites that I frequent. If I were to do it again, I would have seared at about 112, then let it rest for 15 minutes. Mine came out medium to med well. I wanted med rare to medium."

"reviewBody": "Four stars IF you cut down the salt (use garlic powder not garlic salt), and as another reviewer wrote searing does not seal in the juices, on top of that an internal temp of 145 will yield a medium well tri-tip, which in my opinion is overcooked and dry! Try cooking over medium heat instead and until an internal temperature of 125-130 degrees for a beautiful medium rare and don't forget to let the tri-tip rest for at least 15 minutes before carving on the bias, so the juices can redistribute back into the cell structure of the meat, otherwise you might as well go ahead and overcook it to start with because you'll just end up letting the juices run out of the meat onto your cutting board."

Also, as stated by another commentor, grill on HIGH HEAT 3 MINUTES each side for a total of 10-12 minutes each side (flip 3-4 times per side). Wait 20 mintues before cutting. You won't be disappointed. AWESOME, JUICY, TENDER, and FLAVORFUL!"

It's one of the few seasoned peppers that contains no salt, and lots of flavor. Just sprinkle it over the meat, both sides, along with granulated garlic--you don't need the quantities recipe calls for to get good flavor. You will be surprised how you won't miss the salt at all... As for the temp, I usually take my tri-tip off the grill when it reaches 120-125 degrees F. If you wait till 145, and also cover with foil, expect medium, not med rare.."

The MOST IMPORTANT step for delicious tender tri-tip is to cut it perpendicular to the grain of the meat, NOT with the grain. One reviewer mentioned her meat was tough, maybe it was cut with the grain?. Next time try cutting the tri-tip perpendicular to the grain, you'll be pleased with its tenderness. As others mentioned too much salt and no directions on cutting the meat. That's why I gave it 2 stars. If you follow these simple steps you will become a fan of grilled tri-tip"
