I used turkey breast I bought and sliced (since cooked panini style was not too dry) turned out great as recipe is written. Only problem I made it two days before the super bowl, would have been an excellent menu item for the party. Oh I did use spicy brown mustard it's a favorite I often sub with."

I made my own mustard with Dijon,light mayo,and chipotle sauce with smoked jalapenos. The sauce came out great with just the right amount of kick. Next,I used sliced American cheese,whole grain sandwich thins. The sandwiches came out great! I used an iron skillet with a heavy lid. The Butterball turkey roast I had made in the crockpot. I am sure with all the ingredients in this recipe,I would have given it 5 stars,with the exception of my homemade chipotle mustard! Thanks for posting this recipe!"

I did roast it in the oven rather than on the grill, and because the one I bought was \"Savory Herb\" I skipped the garlic and other seasonings. It was such a moist roast and cut beautifully. A really delicious dinner last night with fries on the side. We love Cubans and it was even better with this Butterball roast."

I used Torta rolls and the bread was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I will definitely be using this method again for other sandwiches."

"reviewBody": "I assumed the boneless turkey breast would be one piece, but mine was three pieces of meat, each a different size (which I didn't like) which meant each had to come off of the grill at different times. The first piece came off at 30 minutes, and the last at 40 minutes, each tested with a meat thermometer. We had half of the turkey for dinner the first evening, and I refrigerated the rest for the sandwiches which I cooked in my panini pan (not on the grill). That simple little seasoning of cumin, salt and pepper, combined with inserting slivers of garlic into the breast resulted in incredibly tasty meat and a fantastic Cuban sandwich. I made the honey mustard from a recipe on this site. This sandwich is not the healthiest and is something that I would consider a splurge nutritionally, but I would make it again (just not too often)."

This was a last minute lunch plan, so I did cheat a bit, lol...Instead of using a fresh turkey breast, I used Butterball sliced turkey from the deli, mixed the oil, garlic, cumin, salt and pepper together in a bowl and brushed the bread w/ it before proceeding w/ the recipe. This was fantastic, so I can only imagine making it w/ the roasted fresh turkey breast, which I plan to do next time. Great combo of flavors...This recipe is a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)"

"reviewBody": "This was AWESOME! I'd make the turkey breast in the crock pot a week prior for another recipe and chose to freeze some shredded leftovers just to make these sandwiches for #turkeytuesday. Using the precooked Butterball meat made these a snap to throw together for a weeknight. I used a smoked ham steak cut in pieces for the ham and chose to use yellow mustard per personal preference. This will be a repeater if we ever have leftover turkey at our house. THANKS, Butterball!"

I sliced it up while cold (which I think is easier), right before assembling the sandwiches. I made my own honey mustard sauce with equal parts dijon mustard to honey. I didn't have a heavy iron skillet or a brick to keep the sandwich pressed while on the grill, so I used my Pampered Chef rectangular baking stone, which worked perfectly! We will be making these again! Yum!"
