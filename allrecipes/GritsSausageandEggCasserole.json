"reviewBody": "This was SO good and SO easy and SO delicious! I used my rice maker and a box of cream of wheat in the place of grits...If you use the rice maker for the grits/cream of wheat, be sure to give it a stir once or twice as it starts cooking...I did not do that and I had a few lumps of cream of wheat that were not really a problem...just not what would have been easily attained perfection with a simple stir or two. Otherwise, I followed all the other ingredients precisely. I mixed it all up and left it in the mixing bowl in the fridge uncovered till morning. (other review said it was too wet so I figured a little overnight evaporation would help)...then thew it in a 9X13 and into the oven at 350 when I woke up - it took about an hour to bake, and I sprinkled the top highly with some shredded cheese toward the end...more for art than anything else. I found that it was just firm enough to serve brownie stile cut portions, but I would not call it firm - but at the same time...if it were slightly undercooked...or wetter I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much...it was perfection! (short of a couple of lumps as previously mentioned.) My family LOVED, and it made GREAT leftovers, cut servings held their shape nicely. I garnished with a rose-cut tomato, basil, sour cream, balsamic reduction, and chives...just for fun. - It was worthy! -its amazing how much food 3 eggs and 1 little pack of sausage links makes! -Use the rice maker and cream of wheat! - box directions for water/wheat for 1 cup of dry cream of wheat -SO SO SO SO SO easy and fast when you do the rice maker and mix it into a bowl for overnight in fridge before baking in the AM! -This would be perfect for pre-mixing and refrigerating and baking for a cabin retreat morning! Fresh fruit, buttered toast and Jelly on the side. -nice and soft for little mouths -fun and different!"

When grits were ready with added milk and egg I mixed everything in the same skillet. Covered with foil and baked 30 min (remember.... half recipe). Added sprinkle of extra cheese and finished in oven without foil covering. So yummy! Thanks for this recipe."

I was out of peppers, so I didn't add those, but I did add a chopped onion, which I cooked up with the sausage. I cooked the sausage in a 9-inch cast iron skillet, and then carefully added the cooked grits, cheese, and eggs to the pan and baked it in that instead of in a casserole dish, which saved a little on cleaning."

I thought I had cheddar cheese on hand but ended up having to use a mixture of various shredded cheeses. Next time I will try using just cheddar, but the mix of cheeses was fabulous also."

"reviewBody": "This is very good! I used quick grits because that is what I had on hand so it did not take the full 20 minutes for them to thicken. Next time I would reduce the fluid just a tiny bit (maybe 1/8 of a cup) as I think they would set better if using quick grits. This would also be fantastic with ham or bacon too or any combination of meats. In the future, I may add a tiny bit of cheese to the top the last few minutes of baking.\nI will definitely make this again. It was a huge hit with my family."

But the downside for me was the 1/2 cup of butter. I think the most needed would be 1-2 tbsp. When finished, the butter made the casserole runny and the taste way too rich. I'll try again, but next time with little or no added butter."
