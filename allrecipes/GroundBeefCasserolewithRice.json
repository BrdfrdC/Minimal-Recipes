You'll want to cover it good. Then I only heated it with cheese on top for 20 minutes as everything else was already hot, you are just melting the cheese!"

I took the suggestion to make it in a pan on top of the stove and it works perfectly and saved me from having to heat up the house by using the oven on this hot summer day. It is on my list for the future! Thank you!"

"reviewBody": "We eat vegan, so I substituted 1 lb of Beyond Beef and 1/2 lb Beyond Sausage. I used half a large onion (because a TBS is too little), added a jalapeno (because we like a little more spice), and threw in 1/2 cup of frozen peas. I only had one 14 oz can of diced tomatoes, so diced a fresh large tomato to compensate for the additional 14 oz. My wife and I both liked it. I was nervous about adding so much (vegan) Worcestershire sauce, but it made it much tastier. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. It is good comfort food and for a household of two will last for 2-3 more meals."

"reviewBody": "I hope this doesn't hurt the author's feelings, but this recipe reminds me of an OLD Hamburger Helper recipe that they made back in the 70's and early 80's. We loved that and this recipe is much improved upon that one! I made this on top of the stove in a stock pot. I added 2 teaspoons beef bouillon, and next time I will add a bit more. The recipe is really wonderful and my husband and adult son loved it! My son is very hard to please, and when he heard that this reminded me of an old H.H. box recipe, well, he was reluctant to even taste it. When he did - the look of happiness came over his face and he went back for seconds too! My husband asked for this recipe to be added to our dinner roster! Haha. Try this, and try it on top of the stove it is delicious!!"
