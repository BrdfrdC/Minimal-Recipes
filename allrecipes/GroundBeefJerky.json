"reviewBody": "Like others, I decreased salt by 1/2. I also added 1 tsp smoked paprika...which created a nice flavor as if I had smoked them, instead of baked. I don't own a jerky gun, so I double ground the meat and loaded it into a 1 gallon ziplock bag. I cut a corner and squeezed it out into round-ish sticks. Other than a bit of hand cramps, it worked well. I also used the \"dehydrate\" setting on my oven...which cooked at 135 degrees F while keeping the convection fans on. Worked out great....was ready in about 5 hours."

"reviewBody": "I made this using my oven and following the recipe exactly. For me there wasn't enough flavor so when I did the second round I made sure to add extra seasoning on top before cooking it. It's and ok recipe but I think I'll stick with liquid marinades because it seems to add a better flavor. The texture of ground beef is a little odd for me as well. I didn't use a gun I used a rolling pin making them into circles. Maybe I'd try a gun next time to see if that changes the texture but I'm thinking it won't."

I'm really surprised how good this is for using cheaper meat. I'm definitely saving this, and coming back to improve it to my taste over time. (Perhaps less garlic/onion, and a bit more spice.)\n\nThanks for posting it. :)"

I used my dehydrator and I let it dry a little longer than stated. I still got this weird droplets on the jerky but I think it is because of the ground meat. I will ABSOLUTELY use this recipe again."

"reviewBody": "I have really enjoyed this jerky and think it is perfect. My kids like it too. I took other's recommendations and only used 1 teaspoon of salt per pound and that has worked well. I have deviated just slightly. \n\nFirst I included in the 1 Tsp. salt some \"Curing Salt No. 1\" that I bought on the internet. It is intended to help the meat last longer and since I have been eating the jerky within a couple weeks I probably don't need it. However I do store it at room temp in my desk at work to snack on so I will continue adding it.\n\nSecond I have been smoke cooking the jerky in my smoker for four or five hours until it reaches the right dryness. Not hard and crunchy but having just a little moisture left. This is also probably not necessary as I have prepared ground jerky in the oven before using purchased mixes and they were good without the addition of smoke cooking.\n\nThird I am using ground venison.\n\nI recommend the addition of 1 pinch cayenne pepper per pound. I left it out on my first batch and my impression was that it needed more pepper. So I added the recommended 1 pinch and it was perfect. By the way I have a measuring spoon set that includes \"1 pinch\" and have used that.\n\nI tried rolling it out between two sheets of wax paper. It works fine but I have gone back to squeezing it out of a jerky gun. I have tried both flat strips and round. My kids like the round jerky the best and it seems to load up the tray better. I think they like round from eating purchased round jerky."

"reviewBody": "We tried this with ground venison. EXTREMELY salty! I think I'd use just half the amount of salt! The flavor was good though, other than the saltiness. And our meat dried much faster than the recipe states. It was only about an hour and a half until it was completely dry. Some parts even got a little crispy. I think I'd lower the oven temp and roll it thicker next time. Maybe add a little sugar too. I thought it needed a little sweetness."
