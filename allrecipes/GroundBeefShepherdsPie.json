"reviewBody": "As alot of reviews have mentioned, this is a great base recipe to start with. I went with a couple of ideas from other reviews; I too, added the garlic powder, onion powder, hot pepper flakes, salt &amp; black pepper (w/the basil), to the ground meat and onion mixture. Then the diced tomatoes and a can of (drained), mixed veggies instead of the green beans. I also added the can of cream of mushroom soup... However, I think I will leave the mushroom soup out of it next time as mine came out kind of like a thick stew. You can see it in my photo as the mashed potatoes started to sink, lol. The taste was definately still there though! We really liked it. I will add it to our recipe rotation."

From flavorless filling (which could be fixed if you find a spicing you love) to the bizarre potato topping, that would have totally failed if not for the cheddar cheese, this was not a dish anyone in my family cared for, with 2 people refusing to eat it. There are many recipes for this same thing... you may want to look elsewhere."

I was trying to make something quick since my husband had to go to a meeting so instead of making mashed potatoes from scratch I used a half a bag of frozen mashed potatoes. I also used half a bag of frozen mixed veggies thawed in the microwave instead of fresh green beans. I didn't realize I was out of onions so I used onion powder as a substitute. I also skipped adding the egg to the mashed potatoes but from what I read in the reviews I shouldn't have skipped that. (I will try that the next time I make it!) The last thing I changed was that after I cooked the dish for the 15 minutes I put it under the broiler for a few minutes to get the mashed potatoes a little bit browned. (I skipped the cheddar cheese on top.) My husband and I enjoyed this dish!"

My daughter had oral surgery n I needed to do/cook \"soft\" recipes. I remembered when she &amp; her sister were children, they loved SP. I was hoping that my grandchildren would, too. So, I hit the books looking for a similar recipe to the one, i cooked about 27 years ago. Ginger's came close &amp; was at hit. I added frozen corn &amp; used a tub of ready made Bob Evans mashed potatoes. I only heated it once &amp; spread it over the gr. Beef mixture. It browned well &amp; I added the cheddar cheese. Oh my, they loved it! Next time will try the complete recipe. Thank you, Ginger from my little family, the Yorks!!"

Also, I substituted the green beans with 1 can of drained corn. Great recipe- thanks for sharing it!"

It turned out to be a gooey, greasy mess. I don't think I should have left the lid on during the entire baking portion, I probably used ground beef with too much fat, and even though I made a ton of mashed potatoes to go on top they didn't create the correct ratio of beef to potato to veggie. Overall, it was a bland-tasting, yucky, gross-colored first effort. My husband was a great sport, saying that it \"wasn't too bad\". I'm giving this a 3 because it seems many of the recipes I use through this site are bland, but the bulk of the problem was my error in preparation."

"reviewBody": "Never had shepherd's pie before, but have been wanting to try for a long time. This was a great recipe. Even the kids loved it. As I had no canned or frozen veggies on hand, I used some diced yellow and green squash for the vegetables. I doubled the amount of potatoes as I figured two would not be enough. Glad I did! I blended the potatoes with the egg and water and added some pepper and folded the cheese into them as well. Also, after reading reviews, I added garlic salt and brown gravy (from a packet) to the meat mixture. It made it much more flavorful. The only thing I will change in the future would be to not add the egg, as it made the potatoes more fluffy, but turned the dish into mush. I didn't get the desired crust from them. Also, I had to cook for an additional ten minutes and it still did not brown. When I try again without the egg, maybe it will take less time to crust. Great recipe and very versatile!"

"reviewBody": "General format for the meal is patently plain and to a certain degree is attractive for a quick and uncomplicated meal. After regaling the family with recipe results, I have deduced that with simple additaments, the meal would be enhanced by slight modifications to the potatoes and the meat. The potatoes need more, perhaps butter to liven up the taste. Next, the meat was in need of more spicing which can be accomplished by adding a more powerful assortment of spices. I am certain that sautéing the brown onions with minced shallots, minced garlic, minced green onions, and very finely minced green jalapeno in olive oil, then combining with parsley, oregano, eggs and Italian bread crumbs, all added to the mixtures above before cooking would yield a tighter and more flavorful dish. I give this recipe a 5 star for the simplicity of cooking and the reality of being able to use spices which are usually on hand. Great meal!"
