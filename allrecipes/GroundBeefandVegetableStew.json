Added extra cup, so 5 cups. 1.5cups of tomato sauce, I used jar of tomato, basil, and garlic. And used frozen green beans and added corn. I also added steak seasoning to meat to frying it. \n\nFrugal way to feed a family with a pound of ground beef. Delish!"

"reviewBody": "Excuse my pic! I’d already eaten half of it when I took the pic lol. It’s absolutely delicious! I am a huge instant pot cooker so I cooked it that way. I browned the meat, onions and garlic together &amp; then drained. I tossed in the remaining ingredients in IP. I added a can of tomato paste bc I mistakenly opened that instead of the tomato sauce so I added both so it wouldn’t get wasted. I tossed in a can of rotel also bc it felt wrong making this without some type of tomato pieces. I added fresh carrots &amp; potatoes but frozen green beans and corn. Frozen veggies tend to work better for pressure cooking so they don’t get too mushy. The corn isn’t in the recipe but my kids LOVE it so I tossed in about a cup. I did a 7 minute cook and a 15 minute natural release. The veggies definitely weren’t mush but next time I’ll probably cook for 5 minutes instead so they will be a little firmer. I added the flour mixture after cooking it. I got lots of compliments from my picky eaters."
