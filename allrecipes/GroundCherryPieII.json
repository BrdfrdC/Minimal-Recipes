Will definitely make again if I get some more ground cherries. thank you for sharing this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "First time with Ground Cherries in my garden and this was a good start for finding a good recipe to work with, but I had problems with it. The sugar/sweetness wasn't a major concern, I'm sure the sugar levels for ground cherries vary like any other fruit, and you can use lemon juice and/or less sugar to adjust to your tastes, but 2 1/2 cups seems way to little fruit to fill a 9 inch pie. I ended up with a pie that looks half empty. Most 9inch pies use 4-6 cups of fruit."

I cut the sugar back, made a pie crust with a criss-cross top, and added some lemon juice to give it some extra tartness. Makes an excellent presentation. I think the original crumb topping would be fantastic as well."

It is delicious and I was eating a piece of it at work the other day and all the guys were like \"wow\" will you make me some of that? So I'm making two pies tonight. I've used this recipe multiple times so far. It turns out great every time but I do use less sugar."

There are only two difficulties: ground cherries are only available at our farmer's market occasionally, and it takes quite a lot of work to remove all those husks. But definitely worthwhile"
