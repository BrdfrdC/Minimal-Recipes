It needs more garlic in both the sauce and the cream cheese mixture, and more flavorful cheese (I'm thinking of adding Parmesan with the noodles and on top). The parsley adds good color, but no real flavor - I'm going to try using oregano next time. A good start!"

Since the first time I made this I have made a few tweaks that work for my family. I use two regular size jars of spaghetti sauce or one large size usually in a three cheese variety instead of the tomato sauce from the recipe. I also use 4 cups of dried egg noodles and the whole package of cream cheese 8oz. I then do 2 layers (think lasagna) noodles-meat sauce-mozzarella then repeat. I usually end up using more mozzarella than recipe calls for as well since I have 2 layers. I sometimes push frozen meatballs on top just til covered for added depth. Easy dinner whole family loves!! I also melt the cream cheese in microwave with milk just for ease and it works well. The garlic I cook in the meat mixture with the onion. Enjoy!!"

Someone mentioned the cheese might burn at 375. It almost did, but I just kept an eye on it and covered it with tin foil when it was dark enough. Next time I make this I am going to use double the noodles. I just felt it was heavy on meat and not enough noodles. So good, though!"

"reviewBody": "I made this with what I had on hand, and with some suggestions from reviews and it was really tasty comfort food. I used Tillamook cream cheese (aged cheddar which is very mild and flavorful), and a little dried garlic (1/2 tsp) in the cream sauce 'cause I ran out of time. I added about a tablespoon of worchestire sauce and 2 tsp of Better than Boullion veggie bouillion base (chicken would be fine too) to the turkey before adding the tomato sauce. And for the tomato sauce I added half a jar of marinara I needed to use up. It was really good! My kids are young and sometimes picky and they enjoyed it too. I'll be making it again. It seems a little complex, but if you cook a lot, it only takes about 20 minutes to come together and another 25 to bake (I did at 350 and it turned out great). I also buttered the pan for extra flavor."

Only have garlic powder so used that in milk/cream cheese mixture. I did add couple of finely diced celery to my meat, it added a nice little crunch.

"reviewBody": "Made this almost exactly as the recipe stated. Changed pasta from egg noodles to bow tie and put garlic in both the meat and the sauce (I never measure garlic because I used jarred pre-minced, but it was probably just a little over 2 TBSP or so). I also added some (Lawry’s) seasoning salt, a little sea salt, and black pepper to the meat. I was probably more liberal with the Italian seasoning than the recipe called for. In short though, it was delicious! This will be going on our rotation!"

It’s not only family-friendly and easy enough for a week night, but it would work for company too. Delighted to find another way to use ground turkey. There are ways to use this noodle bake as a base too and take off from here...next time I might try making it spicey, adding bacon, or using hamburger instead of turkey. Thanks for this one—it’s a new fav."

Also, I opted for the shredded Italian 5 cheese mix, as opposed to just mozzarella. The flavors were enhanced nicely when I added sea salt to the meat and cream mixtures. Great dish!"
