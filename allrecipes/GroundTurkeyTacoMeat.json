I have to say this is the worst tasting taco meat I have ever made. My gut said it was way too much salt and why so much Chili powder? Well I made it anyways to give it a shot. My husband who will eat anything said it was dreadful. With that said, I will go back to my recipe that does not have Chili Powder nor is it overly salty like this one. This recipe MASKS the meat."

I'm not saying this tasted bad, I'm just saying there should be a warning on this so people who don't want their mouth to hurt after they eat these can make adjustments."

The only thing i did different was mixed the brown sugar into all the dry ingredients then i added the vinegar after the meat, water and seasoning was already simmering. That was only because i didn't read correctly. It smelled and tasted just like the packages you buy out of the store. Will use this again!"

When I made it the first time I found it came out a bit dry; for a richer and moister dish, I added more water and at the end a generous amount of apple cider vinegar as well as a bit more brown sugar. I make this at least a couple of times a month. Everyone loves it and it’s easily my favorite easy dish to make."

Also, i add dried onions (sometimes we just dont have enough time), and towards the end i add fresh chopped parsley to the pan as its shimmering for a nice pop of color. BEST TACO RECIPE EVER"
