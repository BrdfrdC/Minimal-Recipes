"reviewBody": "Bernie (my partner) and I loved this dish. First of all, if I were using the amount of chicken the recipe calls for, I would make 1.5 or 2 times the sauce. I used chicken thighs and legs removing the skin and excess fat. I did reduce the vinegar to 1/2 cup but went by the recipe for the remaining ingredients. I found I had to increase the cooking time of the chicken by approximately 10 minutes. I reduced the sauce by more than the recipe recommended which gave it much more depth in flavour. When I added the coconut milk, I also added some sweet red, yellow and orange peppers that I had sautéed briefly. About 2 minutes before the sauce was done, I added a cup of frozen sweetlet peas for colour."

"reviewBody": "Delicious! Noting the many comments about this dish being oily, I used skinless chicken breasts which I cut into into pieces. I cooked for 30 minutes (others suggested longer cooking times for chicken legs, but that longer time would have dried out the breast meat). Some of the chicken broke down a bit into small \"shreds,\" which was actually nice in the sauce! Not having whole peppercorns on hand, I used slightly less than one teaspoon of ground black pepper. I increased the onion and garlic to my personal taste and used \"light\" coconut milk to reduce the fat content. Do not leave out the bay leaves -- while not overpowering, they definitely add to the flavor. This was delicious and it provided generous leftovers, as there were only two of us. We served over rice, but I imagine it would be nice over pasta, as well."

As others stated, it was very oily, and lacked depth of flavors. I added patis (fish sauce) and it helped a little, but the overall flavor of this dish was still disappointing."

I didn't add salt because it is already in the soy sauce. I also added a bit of cayenne and a pinch of corriander for some extra flavour. Yum Yum - if you make half of the recipe you will have some coconut milk left for coconut rice which pairs so well. Goes well with steamed asparagus on the side. mmmmm."
