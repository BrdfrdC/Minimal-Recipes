I added: 5-6 tbsp of flax meal to the flour and then mixed a large handful of raisins into the wet dough--the flax adds a raw nutty-ness that goes nicely with the stout while the raisins made the loaf slightly more moist and sweet. Keeper for sure. Yay for awesome Irish food"

I cut back the added vanilla to 1 teaspoon. I used a loaf pan and cooked it for 30 minutes at 375, then 40 minutes at 350. I let it cool in the oven for 30 minutes. The bread is dense but not dry. The exterior has a pleasing light crunch. There's just a faint taste of the bitter Guinness. A little honey butter on a warmed slice puts it over the top. It's gotta be healthy with all that whole wheat flour, oatmeal and yogurt, right? :)"

I also cut some time off the end because it was done and dark at the edges. Even so, it was still very moist. It tasted even better the second and third days. I'll definitely be making this again, and not just for St. Patrick's Day!"

I've made a double batch twice in 3 days time, once with normal sugar called for and once with 1/2 the sugar and both were equally great. Personally, I didn't notice a difference between the two. Both times they were done after only 10-15 minutes after turning down the oven temp. Simply amazing served warm with butter and honey. Everyone loved it!"

My husband loves to eat his plain and I zap mine in the microwave and use a little spray butter with a dusting of sugar. Quick bread heaven!"

I liked the dark texture. It went well with our corned beef dinner. The only difference I did, as others suggested, was to use 1/4 cup brown sugar. This yeilded a hint of sweetness, not overpowering the bread taste. Baked in an older USA made pyrex pie pan for the round effect. The odor while cooking filled the house, hard to wait for the meal and bread!\nThis is my new and only dark bear bread recipe. Thank you Dolly, my Irish ancestors would say 'Good on ya fer this one.\""

I baked it for 30 minutes at 425 and another 15 minutes at 400 and then removed it from the oven immediately. Any longer and I fear it would have burned or just dried out period. This baking time produced a sweet, tender and moist loaf. YUMMY! Thanks for sharing Dolly!"

The only thing that I did differently was take the bread out of the oven 15 minutes early...it was done. It is a heavy bread, but has a lighter texture than say brown bread. It turned out beautifully moist, not too sweet, with just a hint of the Guinness. It really was delish with butter and honey, but I think this would be equally good with a hot bowl of soup or stew. Thanks Dolly for introducing me to a fabulous new recipe using beer."

It's a bit too sweet to eat with a savory meal for me, but it's going to make a fantastic breakfast bread. I couldn't resist having a piece while it was piping hot and spread with a little fresh butter. YUM! I had just used the last of my buttermilk and subbed plain greek yogurt, and I used 2 Tbs butter and 2 Tbs grapeseed oil. I also had to use dark brown sugar. It didn't matter...it turned out great..crispy edges and a moist interior. I'll definitely make again, and I will probably try muffins next time. Thanks, Dolly!"

I used Irish steel cut oats and Smart Sense spread instead of butter. I cooked it at 425 F for 15 minutes, then 400 F for 15 minutes, then let it sit in the oven. Despite all these changes, it turned out very well. I think it would have been fine cooking as the recipe states, but I like how it came out--crispy on the outside and tender and chewy on the inside. The flavors were a unique treat for my tongue, and I found myself chewing slowly and really focusing on what I was tasting. I will definitely make this again! Very easy, tasty, and pretty!"

My worry pouring the batter was that it seemed too much (I used an 8\" round pan), so I poured it to nearly the top, and was able to make 4 mid sized muffins with the rest of the batter. The first round I baked for 25 mins, took out the muffins.. continued baking the round pan for only 20 mins, and left it in the oven for 20. That was plenty of time in the oven. I'll probably make this again, and try pouring all the batter in one 8\" round, seeing as how it didn't appear the batter spilled over while baking."
