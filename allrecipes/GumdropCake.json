"reviewBody": "I really liked the way the cake turned out. I used less sugar than the recipe called for (as usual for me - I used a little more than half of the amount called for) and with the extra gum drops I added it made for a nice sweetness level. I used a bundt pan (which is the same as a tube pan...). The cake was done in an hour and 20 minutes. At that I found it was a little overdone so I'll try checking it at the hour and fifteen minute mark next time. Very simple ingredients and easy to follow instructions. I will definitely be making this again but may try it with cherries next time."

"reviewBody": "After reading the reviews, I decided to change the recipe slightly. I used 3 1/2 cups of flour only reserving 1/4 cup for the gumdrops. I used gumdrops only and yes, I did add the black ones, my grandkids love them. I omitted the extracts and used 2 tsp. of pure, organic lemon juice instead and incorporated the grated lemon rind into the flour mix. I also used milk as was suggested by another reviewer and baked it for one hour only and it was done to perfection. The cake just came out of the oven and looks absolutely beautiful. My husband came home and said it looked like it came from a bakery! Lucille D"

"reviewBody": "I was a bit timid about trying this following its first review but I did and it is wonderful. I used milk instead of water (why use water in a cake??) and I substituted almond flavouring because I thought it would compliment the gumdrops...I WAS RIGHT. I took 20 minutes off the time to make it 1 hour and 10 minute rather than 1 1/2 hours...just right. Then I drizzled glaze over the top and it was a real winner."
