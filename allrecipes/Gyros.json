I cooked it for an hour, let it sit for an hour, then, drum tool please, sliced it and placed it in a cast iron skillet to give it a little bit of browning. OMG!! My boys loved it. Of course I made fries and tzatziki sauce."

I also needed it to cook faster (I overslept my nap!), so I cooked it in a 9 x 13 pan instead with a meat thermometer to tell me when it was ready. My whole family loved it! No leftovers! That’s extremely rare at my house!"

It's not the same stuff you'd get from a real Greek Restaurant, or a Gyro stand, so don't expect it to taste 100% authentic. I serve it with red onion, feta, tomato, cucumber and dill dressing on warm flat bread. I can almost smell the Mediterranean sea...mmmmmm"

This may not be as good as my favorite Greek restaurant's gyro, but it's as good (or better) than most gyros that you find at restaurants. I served with a tzatziki sauce from this site, as well. I was amazed at how easy this was to make. Definitely will be making again. Thanks ltsutton for sharing your recipe!"
