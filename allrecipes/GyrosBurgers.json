What they serve here is the frozen kind you can find in supermarkets, not the Kronos meat cut from that huge rotating spit that I am accustomed to in Chicago. The spices are perfect! Instead of a toasted piece of bread I used 5 finely crushed Saltine crackers. I will absolutely make this again."

Too much allspice IMO. didn't really remind me of gyro meat much at all. It is a decent start, but I think it will take a decent amount of tweaking to get the flavor profile right. It was just okay. With the fresh pitas I made (also from this site), chopped pickles and tomato, and tzaziki, it was decent. But I simply didn't have the same happy flavor explosion that I get with a gyro."

Next, I added bread crumbs and 1/4 cup feta cheese and added it to the mixture. In another bowl, I mixed the hamburger and lamb first and then combined it with the bread crumb/seasoning mixture. After the burgers were grilled, they were topped with a dollop of low-fat greek yogurt. followed by chopped grape tomatoes and a few slices of cucumber on top to give it more of a gyro feel. It was awesome!"

We didn't have bread on hand, so we used egg as a binder. Doubled the recipe so we would have leftovers. Used 5 mini loaf containers (alum foil) at 350 for 35 minutes. Next time, we'll try the mini loaves at 300 for 45 minutes. Had some green peas simmered in avocado oil, onion, and garlic on the side. I added a dollop of hummus on the side of the plate. (Didn't have taziki sauce available.) The meal went great with a dark read wine blend. Turned an ordinary Wednesday night into a celebration."

I know most sauces have cucumber and dill or mint in them.

I only used Lamb, added everything to the food processor, left out the bread crumbs and allspice but added about 2T Fenugreek and some Greek seasoning, molded them into strips and grilled them in a pan on the stove. They came out pretty good considering I just ate them with lettuce, sour cream and salt to save me a trip to the store. Hope this helps, I remember reading Fenugreek is a must."

I've also made it three ways, as burgers, as meatloaf (sliced), and \"taco style\". I think our favorite is taco style (stove top browned), because then we just spoon it into pitas. However, meatloaf style allows me to set my oven timer and walk away. \n\nWe serve it on pitas with a gyro sauce, tomatoes, and lettuce. Feta too if I remember it."

Bought some more expensive pitas (in the bakery section) along with a tzatziki sauce recipe on here called Molly's Mouthwatering Tzatziki Cucumber Sauce."

"reviewBody": "This recipe pleasantly surprised me; really simple to make and really flavorful. My one suggestion would be to actually blend the onion and garlic before adding it to the meat to make it smoother. I definitely made my burgers way too thick this time, so making sure they are thin is also a plus. I served this with homemade tzatziki sauce (made using the tzatziki sauce I recipe here), in a pita with lettuce and onions and it tasted 100% like a gyro, but way more filling. Super tasty. Next time, I'm looking forward to taking some reviewers advice and blending the meat, baking it like a meatloaf, and then slicing it thinly. My mouth's watering just thinking of it!"

I mixed the meat and everything else together until well blended and instead of cooking it the way the directions told you i took a reviewers advice and shaped the meat into a loaf and baked it in the oven for about an hour. I let it cool completely and sliced it thin and served it in a pita with tzatziki sauce, tomatoes and red onion. This was fantastic!! Will definately make this again."

This was so good, but I would add a bit more of all the spices to get the \"gyro\" flavor. Also, grilling can make it a bit dry, but not sure how to avoid that -- I loved it anyway. Added thinly sliced dill pickles, tomatoes and lettuce with homemade tzatziki sauce from this site."

They taste so much like Gyros that whatever craving you have for gryos will be totally satisfied. You can use all ground beef if you like instead of half lamb and half beef. They are juicy flavorful and the spices are spot on! I cannot say enough about these. They hit the spot. Yummy yummy."

These were really great. A friend suggested using turkey next time just to see if it livens up the same old turkey burger."

I used bread crumbs too and let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours when mixed together. Served on warmed, wheat pita with the greek sauce (however it's spelled), tomatoes, red onions, and iceberg lettuce. With greek green beans from this site- it made a nice meal."

This time I took a chance and tried to make these vegetarian, and had wonderful results. I changed the recipe to 7 servings, because I had two 14 ounce packages of Gimme Lean brand vegetarian \"ground beef\". I followed the recipe as written otherwise, but instead of grilling (it was raining), I added 1 Tablespoon of olive oil in a non-stick skillet and pan fryed these about 12 minutes, turning several times. These tasted just as good as using ground beef, although I will make these again with beef. I served these on warmed naan bread instead of pitas this time also. We do enjoy having this with the pitas too. Topped with romaine lettuce, tomato, red onion and Tzatziki sauce II from the site. We really love these, and make them often. Thank you for sharing this! :)"
