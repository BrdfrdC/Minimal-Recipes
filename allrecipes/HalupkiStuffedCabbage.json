Have made this a couple dozen times since discovering it and she absolutely loves it. Only do a couple minor modifications I've found enhance the recipe over time: I use fresh minced garlic rather than garlic powder, and I use 8oz of Campbells tomato soup (uncooked, out of the can) and 24oz tomato sauce. These both add a little more flavor and texture, and make a little extra sauce for the mashed potatoes that pair perfectly with this recipe."

A couple of very minor changes I make are to grate a half an onion right into the meat mixture. I also use fresh pressed garlic, cayenne pepper and some nutmeg which I mix into the beaten eggs before combining it all. Otherwise I make this exactly as written. My family also enjoyed them with mashed potatoes and we will again tonight!"

My husband ate 8 of them! \n\nI did make some adjustments to use ingredients I already had on hand and will probably do the same next time. I used white wine vinegar, 2lb. ground beef and 1lb. ground italian sausage, and I used brown sugar instead of white. I also added 2-15oz cans of diced tomatoes to the sauce and seasoned with salt and pepper after it was done cooking. One thing I would change next time is the cook time. I have a convection oven so I reduced the temperature to 325, but 2.5 hours was still a bit too long. Next time I’ll check them at 2 and 2.25 hours. Thanks for sharing your family recipe!"

It is authentic and perfect just the way it is. We serve them over mashed potatoes and they are the best. I have never tried to freeze them before cooking them and wonder if anyone has and if so, how long to bake them from frozen if you don't precooked them. Thank you for sharing this recipe. Even my grandmother approves and she always loved her mother's cabbage rolls the best. (My Nona didn't write down her recipes and until now no one could duplicate it. Not even my grandmother)"

Cooked the rice and placed in the fridge. I wasn't sure the prepped cabbage leaves would be easy to roll today, but they were! All I had to do today was make the filling, roll and make the sauce."

"reviewBody": "This turns out to be a rather large recipe, so I'd suggest either using some leaves from an additional cabbage or making sure to get a very large head. I used extra leaves since I happened to have 2 heads of cabbage. What I didn't have, was 1-1/2 lbs of ground pork; I only had about 1/2 lb, so I made up the difference with 1/2 lb beef and 1/2 lb. bacon (yes, BACON), which I cut into tiny pieces (uncooked) and added to the rest. The other alteration I made was to use tomato paste instead of tomato sauce because I wanted a richer sauce, but I diluted it with about 2-1/2 cups of cabbage water just to increase the volume. I ended up with about 20 wraps, and I baked them for 1-1/4 hours (the first 45 min. at 375F, then turned down to 350F for the last 30 min,). They turned out fabulous. The only thing my wife commented was that she wanted even more sauce to put on at a topping at the end. I think I must have eaten like 5 or 6 -- couldn't stop. Thanks for the recipe!"

I used half canned diced tomatoes as I did not have enough sauce - worked fine. I had left over meat, so put in a mini pan for meatloaf, poured some of the sauce over and cooked off with the rolls for less time. Use for sandwiches or whatever. Easy enough to make, not to much of a mess to clean up. Will make again and again!"

I also used dry minced onion instead of fresh diced. My meat mixture was 2lb of pork &amp; 1lb of ground turkey) and they turned out great. 100% will make again!"

I really enjoyed the taste and I would definitely make it again, with the exception of adding some additional sauce or other material to loosen up the filling just a little. It comes out very compact (good for stuffing) but really dry. I will give it another try, perhaps with a little extra tomato sauce mixed in, and hope it will show all it's promise!"

The things I did differently was, I did not use 12oz of cabbage water in the tomato soup, Yes I used tomato soup (2 large cans) however, I did use the water to thin the soup to my liking. The other thing I didn't do was, I didn't add sugar to the soup, but i did add a little vinegar. Great recipe!"

I also hesitated to add the cabbage water and should have listened to my instincts. The sauce was way too thin and was almost tasteless. I've since read other recipes that do not add water but also add a few tablespoons of the tomato sauce to the meat mixture which I think would help. keep the meat tender. I think the cooking time is too long - two hours would do it. My apologies to the author of this recipe but I would not make again."

Sorry, I just couldn’t see all tomato sauce, so I used 1 can each of diced tomatoes and tomato sauce. I used what was on hand which ended up being more pork than ground beef, but all tasted fine. Made these cabbage rolls in the morning, refrigerated, and then into the oven for dinner for an easy, but tasty entree. These were very, very good cabbage rolls, served with mashed potatoes and freshly-cooked apples. Definitely would make again."
