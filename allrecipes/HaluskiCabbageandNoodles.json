I changed it up the 2nd time. - replace “season with salt and pepper ” with “ season with a lot of Adobo” - half the recipe and it still makes a full 13x9 pan. - use 1/2 the butter it calls for (or half of 1/2 if you are making a half recipe. So a 1/2 stick of butter). - add stock for more moisture - The cabbage cooking time of 8-10 minutes is a total lie. More like 30 minutes."

"reviewBody": "I’ve made this recipe for years but do entirely on top of stove, no oven required. I make this often especially during lent when we do not eat meat on Fridays. I also admit I try making it healthier by sautéing a lot of sliced onion in EVOO, maybe 3-4 Tblsp, and then adding the sliced or diced cabbage, depending on type noodle I’m using. Once cabbage starts to wilt, I salt and pepper and continue sautéing until cabbage and onions are softened. I boil whole wheat wide egg noodles or else whole wheat linguini, undercooking by 2 minutes, saving 1-2 cups of the starchy pasta water. I add the 2 minute under cooked noodles of any type to the cabbage mixture and adding as needed some of the starchy water to finish cooking so flavors can meld and cook into noodles. I taste to see if needs anymore salt or pepper at this point before I serve. This was meant to be a peasant meal but no reason you can’t make it your own by adding bacon or kelbasi I’m sure it delicious added to this simple meal."

Of course, it is totally acceptable to add your bacon or kielbasa ... or perogies?!!! (Really?) But please don't call it Haluski. I'm Irish and it offends me! LOL! Seriously, though ... buttery egg noodles, cabbage and onions ... what more could you want? Ya' wanna switch it up? Brown that butter, it's awesome!"

Now if you brown your cabbage it will be delicious!! In my late 60’s and still love it as when I was a little girl!! Very delicious"

"reviewBody": "I made this one day to use up a head of cabbage and my father went nuts over it! I've made it several times now and I've made some changes. First - I tried making this with rotini pasta and bowties and they work well in place of egg noodles/dumplings. Second - BACON! I fry it up crisp and crumble it in just as I'm about to eat so the bacon stays crunchy. Third: BACON FAT! I fry the bacon first and then use the bacon fat plus butter added as needed to do the onions and cabbage. I'm telling you - the bacon and fat kicks it out of this world. Note - I only make it once a month, or even less, cause I'm not trying to die over here."

"reviewBody": "I have made Haluski for decades. In my version you let the onions and cabbage cook longer in the skillet, get soft and carmelize a bit (turn brown). It gives more sweetness to the cabbage and adds even more flavor to the dish. Just wait until the cabbage/onion mixture is cooked enough and then add the noodles. Stir together and add just a bit of the cooking water from the noodles. Boom, it's done. There is no need to bake it. I find that you need about a 2 to 1 ration of cabbage/onion mixture to the wide egg noodles. \nGreat served with almost any type of meat... Chicken breasts, pork chops, and of course, smoked sausage. A very nice change of pace from potatoes and rice."
