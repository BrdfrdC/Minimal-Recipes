Cutting by hand isn't the same. The only thing I've done different is I use two different kinds of mustard, yellow and a spicy one and maybe add a little more relish. It depends on the flavor of the ham. Like another reviewer said you can adjust all ingredients to your liking. \n\nGreat recipe...thank you for sharing."

We've tried a variety of other grocery store versions with no luck, amazing how many bad ones are out there. I saw this recipe and it looked just like one my mom used to make so I thought I'd try it. Definitely the best! The only thing I did a little different is I used diced/minced green onion vs. white or yellow etc. and I minced the celery as well - still crunchy but no huge chunks. I also chose Kraft Real mayo vs. any others. Bon appetit!"

I also chopped some bread and butter pickles and put them on my sandwich along with a little spread of mayo on the bread slices!"

My son thought the whole thing tasted like egg salad with ham, so I had an extra egg and threw it in for good measure. More protein. Haha. Our AC is down and it is too hot to cook, so we made a batch of homemade bread in the breadmaker to go with this and it made a great meal without heating up the house even more."

Come to find out the recipe is written with 4 tsp of relish and the video said 4 tablespoons of relish. Makes a big difference; I may not have needed to add extra of anything. I'l find out next time."

Used Dijon mustard instead of yellow to add a little more punch to the flavor. Next time I want to try it with dill relish as others have suggested. My guests I had for lunch remarked about how good it was! A recipe that rakes in the compliments is never a bad thing!!"

Don't you realize that as soon as you change the recipe, you're not reviewing the same thing? Sheesh people..."

It helped to create the perfect consistency. Please try this. You will not be disappointed!!!"

Mom used to make this with leftover Easter ham and ground the ham up with one of those hand-cranked meat grinders that clamped onto the edge of the kitchen table. I used this as a stuffing for appetizers. Stuffed it into English cucumber disks (about 1 inch thick, hollowed out a bit to make room for the ham salad), celery, and sugar snap peas. Took this to a party and they all disappeared."

I used more eggs because I had more ham than the recipe called for, I used my small food chopper to ground the ham to the consistency I wanted, but only the ham. I just used a fork to mash the egg whites, I took a page from a another reviewer and mixed the egg yolks in the mayo mixture. I used mayo that had olive oil and cracked black pepper, mustard, and a bit of cayenne pepper for a little kick. I used onion powder instead of onions, no celery because I didn't have any. This turned out wonderful! I didn't measure anything, just used what looked right, the salad is firm and not runny at all, and the it taste delicious, I have been eating it on toasted hoagie rolls."

I have to say, I was sceptical but with a massive amount of ham that needed to be used I went with it. this is really, really good. I did not measure anything but the ham (I ended up with 4 cups after processing) I used 4 eggs, 2 dill pickle spears and honey mustard because of course that's all I had. Next time, I will use more pickle, yum! and maybe add a little cream cheese because I love ham rolls and that is what this tastes like. I made this for sandwiches and it's delicious! \nnote- I did the whole salad in my processor, next time I will only process the ham because the texture is a little funny for me, but still, so delicious!"
