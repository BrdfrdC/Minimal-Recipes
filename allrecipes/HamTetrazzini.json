No mushroom soup and I’m allergic to dairy so I sautéed 1.5 c chopped Bella mushrooms with the onion. Added a package of Daiya Alfredo sauce, 1/2 c water and 1/4 c white wine. Used oil preserved dried tomato instead of pimento, and 1/4 broccoli heads chopped as I had no parsley. Topped with a little Parmesan. Other than the WW pasta actually pretty good"

Husband loves it and I thought it was pretty awesome too!\n\nNext time will try some capers and mushrooms."

Then drained the pasta, reserving some pasta water to use with the soup and cheese - thanks to America’s Test Kitchen for that tip. Cooked everything in the pasta pot and then reintroduced the pasta, tossing thoroughly to get every noodle coated in creamy cheesy goodness. Didn’t have pimentos so I omitted that step. For next time I’ll put them on the grocery list. And there WILL be a next time. Hubby and picky daughter both enjoyed it."

I used olive oil instead of butter and sautéed 3 chopped garlic cloves with the onion. Based on other reviews I used half low sodium chicken broth and wine for the liquid. Also added a pinch of black pepper and about 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper to the cheese mixture. I didn’t have spaghetti so I used whole wheat rotini for the pasta. Also added minced red pepper and about 1/2 cup frozen peas, mostly for color. Because I had time, I baked this at 350 for about 1/2 hour after topping with mozzarella and additional Parmesan cheese.. This was so yummy and the leftovers tasted even better!"

Added a little crunch to the top and made it more casserole-esque. But I think everyone would have liked it either way."

I used milk instead of water, added minced garlic, a whole onion and yellow chopped pepper. I also used more cheddar cheese and parmesan. Just eyeball it in the pot for thickness and add more milk if necessary. It was good!"

On the rare occasion we have leftover bacon I will dice that up and throw it in as well."

I noticed there wasn’t any seasoning so I added pepper in the sauce as well as salt and (since we have pasta) garlic salt. I also added shredded cheese once plated and my son LOVED IT!!"

"reviewBody": "This dish is perfect for what it is. Good, crowd-pleasing comfort food and most importantly quick and easy. I enjoy cooking healthy, exciting recipes with lots of prep work. There are also times when I'm feeling lazy, not in the mood to experiment and just want to make something easy that pretty much everyone will like. Everyone loved it and asked for me to make it again so that makes it five star for me. It is a little bland for most adult tastes imo but it makes a good base to customize to personal tastes. I personally would add a little more cheddar cheese and veggies (broccoli, cherry tomatoes, basil, whatever you have in your freezer) and some fresh parmesan cheese and pepper. This is going in my favorites, thanks!"

I substituted blue cheese for the cheddar, added some fresh garlic, a touch of ground cloves and cayenne pepper, and a pinch of korinje cinnamon. Added a half of a vidalia onion and a half of green bell pepper, minced. I omitted the pimento. Subbed milk for water and threw in a splash of German brandy. Used farfalle pasta instead of spaghetti for a different mouth feel. I love to play with basic recipes like this! Great way to use up the ham I had in the freezer."
