I may have added a bit too much water therefore, I’m letting it cut down further."

SImmered beans in low sodium chicken stock, a cup of brown sugar, and added 3 cups of the rendered liquid. I placed small chunks of the loin in the beans about halfway through the bean simmer and later sliced carrots. Adding the extra sugar made it appealing to those with a sweeter tooth."

I did reduce the brown sugar to 3 tbsp. I wanted my beans sweet because obviously this recipe is supposed to be on the sweet side. I feel like, while most people don't like to add sugar, with this the brown sugar emphasizes the ham flavor. Makes it reminiscent of a honeybaked ham taste. But if you don't add sugar, it becomes a more savory dish. I wanted to follow the recipe as it was intended to taste."

He loves it. Now, this recipe is crazy easy and he went nuts. Tasted better than he remembered. The only thing I changed is how I made it. I just wanted one large serving, so I used a can of cannelini beans, I had a ham steak in the freezer, so cubed that up I threw all the ingredients as written in the Instant Pot with a couple cups of water and pressure cooked for half hour. I was going to make cornbread, but he said he had to have a crusty bread, so he went to the store for a baguette. Seriously, that excited for ham and beans. He claimed it was the best most perfect ham and beans ever. His words. Then he complained about the lack of leftovers. Smh."

I did make some modifications, mainly cutting down on the brown sugar to about 1 tablespoon, added a little diced carrot, and substituted a 5 pepper combination from Sam's Club instead of cayenne. With those modifications, it was PERFECT!"

I am making this for dinner again tonight with some small variations - I used 2 cans of Great Northern Beans, I cut the amount of Cayenne Pepper in half (I did not the first time and it was just too much for our taste) and I just threw all the ingredients into the crock pot and will cook on high for approximately 4 hours until it smells like time to eat! I absolutely love this recipe and it literally takes less than 5 minutes to prepare and the crock pot does all the work. I am making pudding style corn bread (adding a can of cream of corn and a bit of brown sugar) to serve with it. Thank you so much for this recipe!!"

"reviewBody": "First off...I know this is listed under \"ham soup\", but this is not soup. It is Ham and Beans. This is a Southern thing for many. Serve it with cornbread and this is a classic Southern meal. I am originally from the North, but married a Southerner and have lived in the South for several years. I had to learn the \"basics\" of Southern cooking from his family and online. This is a basic comfort food. \nNow to the recipe, I read that some felt this was too sweet. The first time I made it I added just a shy short of 1/2 cup of Brown sugar. We had no leftovers. I made it again tonight with 1/3 cup of sugar to see if there was much difference. We didn't notice much difference in sweetness. The cayenne balances the sweetness. I added a little garlic to it as well. I made it both times in my electric pressure cooker. I'm still trying to perfect the right amount of water and timing for the recipe with the pressure cooker, but this recipe is a keeper for us. (I don't use the amount of water called for since cooking with the pressure cooker is different). The pressure cooker bypasses the need to soak the beans and makes this a fairly quick, easy, simple meal. And it's fairly cheap too. Thanks for the recipe."

I followed the basic how to but used chopped white onion, 3 cloves pressed garlic, 1 bay leaf, a 1/4 tsp white pepper, 1/2 tsp baking soda (a tip gleaned from the reviews - so thanks!) and generous tablespoon of dried parsley. This suited our tastes for savory rather than sweet."

Couple people said it was too hot, but I kept the cayenne pepper it called for cause I like a lil spice, and I was glad I did! I also took the advice to add 1/4 tsp of baking soda for creaminess. At the end I dissolved 2 tbsp of corn starch, using the juices from the soup, added it and let it simmer for about another 20 mins. I added 1 cup of milk at this time to add to the creaminess. I sauteed the onions like someone suggested. And instead of just dicing ham I used the whole ham hock and I added about 2 cups of diced chunks as well. The cook time said 2 hrs on the beans, I'm not sure if it's my altitude or what (9,000 ft), but it took about 3 hrs total to cook. Hope this helps. It sure is yummy!"

"reviewBody": "Yummy and a great way to use up leftover ham! I cut way back on the sugar, as recommended by most reviewers, adding 1.5 Tbs. I sauteed the onions and a sliced carrot in 1Tbs oil and butter, until the onions were soft, before adding the remaining ingredients. Used canned beans and added a cup of cubed butternut squash and 2 tablespoons red quinoa along with the ham and beans. Added a pinch of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp ground corriander, cooked 20 minutes, and during the last 2 minutes of cooking, added 1/4 tsp baking soda to reduce gassiness from the beans (per another reviewer's suggestion), 1Tbs cornstarch to thicken the remaining liquid, and about 4 oz bean sprouts, just to use those up. A lot of changes , I know, but, other than the reduced sugar, I dont think they were absolutely necessary to make this dish delicious. This recipe is very forgiving and allows one to swap out or add veges and grains that are on-hand, and spices to taste, which makes it a great recipe! And substituting canned beans drastically reduces the cooking time and you can have the meal on the table in under 30 minutes, start to finish!"
