"reviewBody": "I made this using Pillsbury Hot Roll mix instead of frozen bread dough. Super easy to make and took less than 5 minutes to prepare the dough. One change would be to not add tomato sauce to the stromboli, but serve it on the side to dip into when eating. When we order this out there is never sauce inside, and now I know why...it makes the dough on the bottom of the stromboli soggy. Next time I will leave it out. I made my own sauce using a can of tomato sauce, seasoned with oregano, basil, onion powder and garlic salt, a dash of salt &amp; ground pepper, delicious! Stuffed ours with green peppers, mushrooms, salami, ham, onions, black olives, pepperoni and asiago cheese. Be sure to fill the center of the dough all the way to the ends then fold over, otherwise you will end up with super doughy ends. I seasoned the top of the stromboli with a little oregano, basil and parmesan cheese and baked it 25 minutes in a 425 degree oven. Delicious!"

It would probably be better with better dough, and with some ham or another less greasy meat to balance out the grease. Great base recipe though."

I saw it on Man VS Food, it's one of his favorites and thought I should make it since no place sells it around here. I followed the recipe exactly and OMG it was good! Had a bunch of unexpected company and they hogged it down like it was the last thing on earth, got compliments from everyone! Was a major hit. Only thing I did differently was I made one huge loaf instead of dividing it up. Will make again, many, many times. Thank you so much! :)"

Next, I rolled the entire dough out and layered all meats and sauce. I rolled it up in one motion. I did not have to seperate into four layers, seems to make it more work than anything else. This recipe gave me ideas, but I ended up using my Mother's advice. Thanks anway."

I also used turkey pepperoni...Green peppers, onions, mushrooms, Parmesan, garlic, salt, pepper, basil, and italian seasoning...folded...brushed with garlic butter and baked at 425. Turned out GREAT! I see how the pepperoni and salami and sausage help it stay flat to be more of a sandwich. I'll make it more like the original recipe on the next run. Love it though!"

The crust was excellent! Much better than the frozen bread dough or rolls of refrigerated crust we used to use. I had leftover homemade marinara, and used both provolone and mozzarella and lots of veggies with turkey pepperoni. So good!! I'm going to stock up on those pizza dough balls so we can make these, calzones or pizza whenever we get a craving."

Instead of pizza sauce, I used garlic &amp; onion cream cheese (I heated it in the microwave for about 20 seconds to make it creamy enough to spread), and it was delicious. I also sauteed the onion &amp; mushrooms and let them cool for a few minutes before layering them in. I sprinkled the top of each stromboli with garlic salt and grated Parmesan before baking, which made it more like a flavored pizza crust. Awesome recipe, and very versatile; thanks!"
