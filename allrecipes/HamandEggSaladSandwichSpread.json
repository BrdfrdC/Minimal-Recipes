"reviewBody": "I wanted the ham salad mixture as a filling for a raw stuffed tomato salad rather than as a sandwich filling, so I cut back on the mayonnaise. I used some chunks of ham from the freezer which I first sliced, then chopped in the food processor. I also changed the mayo to regular rather than light. It proved to be a delightful salad and I'd definitely make it again."

"reviewBody": "No need to buy slices of ham. I had the Deli shave 1 lb. of ham. Then I chopped it up. Not a fan of djon so I used yellow mustard. Mixed all ingredients except mayo. Green onions were my choice using both white &amp; green, Then I added mayo slowly until I reached a nice mix to my liking.This goes really well on a good rye bread. I'm thinking of trying horseradish next time instead of mustard."

"reviewBody": "I did not have dill pickle relish but I did have garlic dills, I used four full garlic dill pickles in this recipe. I also added a couple good shakes of Frank's Hot Sauce. I made no other changes. For us, this was a little too mayonnaise-y though the combination of ingredients is fantastic. I will make this again but I will cut back the mayonnaise. I loved that this recipe called for light mayonnaise."
