,"description": "These are the easiest hamantashen I&#39;ve ever made! They are a bit sweet, roll out easily and are consumed quickly! My kids don&#39;t want to give them to their friends! Traditional fillings are prune and poppy seed. You can use any canned pie filling, whole fruit jelly, chocolate chips, or any type filling your family likes! Be creative with these- we put mini chocolate chips in the dough!"

I also enjoyed the texture - it is more of a doughy / cakey type of texture, which I like vs a shortbread type of dough, which I have made in the past. This is just my preference for a hamantashen. My only criticism is that I thought it could be a tad sweeter. Maybe if I had used a sweeter filling, it would have balanced out, but it just fell a little short for me. I would try adding a little bit more sugar the next time."

The dough is buttery and the orange juice is a perfect offset to any jam or filling you use (raspberry is my favorite and I've also done apricot). I find the baking time is more like 12-14 minutes if you freeze the cookies before putting them in the oven. You really have to watch for browning on the bottoms as the tops barely get any color by the time they are ready (too long in the oven and they get dry). Happy Purim!"

Also, make sure the edges are sealed tightly or the cookie will open up during baking. I tried poppyseed filling and apricot preserves. The apricot is my favorite, so far. When cool, I also like to dust them with icing sugar."

I really just didn't have the orange juice and wanted them to still be pareve. I took some to a meeting and people couldn't stop eating them! \n\nI chilled the dough and rolled it out on parchment paper to contain the mess. I did use a fair bit of flour under and on top of the dough to be able to remove the circles and move to the baking sheet (also lined with parchment). I followed the baking instructions to a t. I used canned pie filling (prune, apricot and raspberry). I also made some with chocolate chip cookie dough left over from another effort. All are great!"

I used real butter and just a touch more OJ. I put the dough in the fridge for about 8 hours. The dough was too hard to roll out, so I stuck it in the microwave for about 10 seconds, and it was very easy to work with. \nI didn't bother with freezing, just pinched really well and not a single one popped open. I cooked these a bit longer. Maybe about 11 minutes. They never got brown, but the consistency was just right. \nI'm bookmarking this recipe, and am so glad I no longer have to be disappointed by store bought or afraid to make my own!"

"reviewBody": "I liked the dough and appreciated all the good recommendations and comments that helped make this recipe work. It is a very easy recipe - make sure you use a real filling and not jam/jelly for a substitute. Jam will reduce and even run out the sides leaving thin lining of filling. The time in the freezer is a must, even with special attention to pinching the sides into a triangle. You may still have ones that open up in the oven so don't get lazy or be in too much of a hurry. I also recommend brushing them with a beaten egg and then lightly sprinkling them with some ground cinnamon."

Of course cooking times will vary, but 9min worked for me. Be careful because even overcooking for 1-2min will leave you with a dry, crunchier cookie rather than a doughy treat. I used cherry pie filling -- delicious! I recommend a gooey textured filling because I filled a few with chocolate chips and it seemed too dry."

I also threw a little honey in the wet ingredients and added the baking powder directly to my flour before I mixed. Because I used the shortening I found the dough easier to work with and while working with one batch I kept the extra dough in the fridge. Rolled between wax paper and baked on parchment. They came out light, delicious, perfect and were gobbled up quickly. Recipe is a keeper."

I used the poppy seed filling but I think the cookie part is a good base and you could use different kinds of fillings.

I bake numerous pareve desserts weekly, ranging from cakes to cookies to bars &amp; I always use Nucoa margarine in place of traditional dairy butter or margarine. There are other brands of pareve margarine out there; I have found the Nucoa brand to be the best for baking. Everyone that eats my baked pareve items cannot believe that there is no dairy in them. I suggest that anyone who wants to make this recipe non-dairy try the Nucoa brand margarine, you won't be disappointed. I did add some fruit fillings &amp; baked the Hamantashen in my convection oven at 350 degrees for 10 minutes (rotating the cookie sheets at 5 minutes) &amp; they turned out great!"

I used milk in place of orange juice and almond extract instead of vanilla extract. The dough held the shape of the cookie very well. Non of my cookies leaked out jam like other recipies I have tried. Everyone at work said they tasted like bakery cookies (not really like Hamantashen from NY bakeries). They would probably be better with the orange juice(I will make sure I have it next time). My filling was raspberry and apricot jams. My favorite is the raspberry, but that is personal taste. Would definately make these again. Thanks!"

However...I was expecting this to taste like the authentic hamantashen that I am used to, and was pretty dissappointed. I noticed where another person had suggesting using oil instead of butter and tried the recipe with that alteration, but the dough was still a bit too gooey and had trouble retaining the shape. After being baked, it seemed that the taste was softer or chewier than traditional hamantashen should be.. \nAgain, this is a tasty cookie, but not is you are wanting to make “real” hamanstahen :)"

"reviewBody": "This dough is very tasty, but its also gooey. I allowed the dough to chill in my fridge for about 4.5-5 hours, but it was still too gooey to roll out. I ended up making small balls and smashing them flat with my hands. My oven is strange and small so I had to make my Hamantashen in about 4 or 5 different bakings; this allowed me to experiment with baking temperatures, times, and sizes of the actual Hamantashen. I found that the dough expanded at an alarming rate and only when I made tiny (about half the size I would normally make) Hamentashen did they actually cook to become a normal size. Also, I increased the temperature from 190C to 200C and baked them for 16 mins. After they are baked they are still quite gooey, but the fridge hardens them without losing the chewiness/softness. Not bad :) That being said, you should know the dough is very sweet as well. I can eat a few at a time, but not too many because I start to feel sick from the sweetness. I guess thats good though cos they'll last longer! :)"

"reviewBody": "I made the dough in the afternoon and last night made the hamantashen with my 7 year old. We used a 3\" circumferance glass, lekvar and an apricot coconut filling. \n\nWe did not freeze before baking and were very happy with the results for 12 minutes of baking.\n\nThese were very delicious, more butter cookie than biscuit which is just the way I like it. Easy recipe to make, follow and worth the results. Thanks so much!"

"reviewBody": "While the cookie dough is indeed delicious, this is not like the bakery hamantashen here in the Northeast. It is basically a butter cookie with jam filling. I used only 3/4 cup sugar in the recipe and it was still too sweet. I also left out some of the butter and it was still too buttery!! I will alter this recipe or find another one to fit my tastes better. If you're used to a classic New York style hamantashen from a Jewish bakery, try a different recipe."

They looked beautiful and everyone commented on how delicious they were (we made them for an event at my daughter's school). I will definitely keep this recipe and have even promised to pass it on to a couple of other moms."

My 10 year old rolled out the dough, used a glass to cut circles, filled with filling and pinched into triangles.\n\nIt is important to put them in the freezer for at least 5 minutes before cooking them. The ones with cherry filling in my first batch came apart because I did not freeze them first.\n\nIt was easy to eat them all at once!"

"reviewBody": "GREAT RECIPE! More time was required for cooking (about 12 minutes total) as I took the prepared hamentashen out of the freezer only long enough for the oven to preheat. I would be interested to know how long the original submitter leaves them out of the freezer before cooking them. I also think I will cut them a bit bigger next time, just so I can fit more filling inside. I used cherry pie filling (our favorite) and they came out terrific. Highly recommended!"
