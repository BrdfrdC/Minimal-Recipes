After hamburger onions &amp; peppers are cooked I added two full cups of beef broth, one 14 oz can of petite tomatoes, one 8oz can tomato sauce, a can of drained corn along with the drained can of green beans. I precooked my potatoes &amp; macaroni so it could be added the last fifteen minutes. I was afraid the potatoes wouldn’t cook on simmer and I prefer to control the al dente of the pasta. The usual spices as recommended worked great. Served with cheddar cheese. It was delicious!! Thanks for all the other notes it helped me a great deal."

I used more tomato sauce than called for, but that may be because of potato size, etc., that I used. Also, it doesn't indicate in the recipe that you should cook the noodles al dente (firm) in boiling water before adding them to the goulash, but common sense would tell you that, I guess. A new cook may end up with some pretty crunchy noodles! This recipe is delicious! Oh! And next time, just because we love them, we'll be adding onions!"

"reviewBody": "Wonderful comfort food the whole family enjoys! I would have rated this 5, but the recipe needs some clarification. I drained the browned hamburger and added everything into the same pan to simmer. I diced the onion instead of slicing (to hide it from the kids) &amp; substituted 1 can of diced tomatos with the juice for one of the cans of tomato sauce. Everything except the green beans simmered together for 20 mins., enough for the potato to be tender, then added the noodles and green bean to cook til tender. Per others' reviews, I added 3/4 cup water with the noodles. Cooking time ended up to be less than 40 mins. Had I cooked it for the 1 hour recommended, everything would have been mushy. Served it with Parmesean cheese and everyone loved it!"

"reviewBody": "This was similar to something I used to make and decided to try it again. I made a few changes/additions and it came out great. I added carrots and celery, crushed tomatoes, beef bouillon, ground chipotle and a little smoked paprika (It seemed right at the time). I also substituted V8 juice for the tomato sauce. Totally skipped the worcestershire (didn't have any) and the potatoes (I just can't bring myself to have both potatoes and macaroni in the same dish). Added more water and put in pre-cooked large elbows towards the end. \n\nThe 2 year old finished hers and the 5 year old ate 3 bowls and said to make sure to put the leftovers away so she could have it for breakfast. It made a ton but there was only one large bowl left after 6 of us. Will make again and maybe next time try with potatoes."

I used peas instead of green beans, added a little more water, used 1 can of stewed tomatoes, 1 can tomato sauce (it was just what I had on hand), 1 chopped jalapeno pepper (to give it a little kick) and 1 TBSP of brown sugar. It was WONDERFUL! This is a keeper for us. Thanks!"

The only thing was that I needed to add quite a bit of water continuously to make sure it didn't burn as it was simmering (I think I added about four cups overall), and I added some more salt and pepper at the table. Easy to make, my family liked it, and there were lots of leftovers for lunch! I will definitely make this again."

It was good, but not one of my favorites... sorry ;( Changes: I did not add noodles, used 5 potatoes instead of 4; two cans of green beans (14.5 oz); one can of cream corn and one can of sweet yellow corn, and a small can of lima beans, more salt and pepper. This was a good recipe to serve the family, meaning kids, so they can get their nutrients, vegetables etc... but not anything enticing for company or guests.....I would cook this again, however, when running out of time and need a hot cooked meal, pronto!"

"reviewBody": "Excellent!! The whole family raved about this one with the changes recommended here in the reviews. I left out the potatoes because it seemed like a lot of unnecessary starch. I didn't have green beans so I substituted a can of diced tomatoes, but I'd like to try the green beans as I don't think that would be too bad. Either way, it's hard to imagine this dish without the diced tomatoes - they were perfect. I omitted the regular salt and added two tspns of garlic salt instead. I think I'll reduce the pepper to 1/2 tspn next time as it was a bit much for me. I also added a tspn of Italian herbs and I sauted the onions with the meat before adding everything else. And I cooked some spiral pasta seperately before adding to the pot. Yum!"

Used Italian style diced &amp; stewed (pureed) tomatos, lima beans, kidney beans. The great thing about Goulash is you can use whatever you want! Great starter recipe though!"
