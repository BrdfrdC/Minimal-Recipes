I used McIntosh apples which are naturally sweet so I skipped the sugar and opted only for the honey for sweetness. I added half a lemon worth of zest and juice to keep the apples from browning. Let's just say I've made it a second time since Passover. It makes a great addition to my morning oatmeal."

It gave the charoset nice color and keeps the nutrients from the peel. (Just be sure to use organic apples if you're keeping the peel!) I used 6 small organic gala apples and a cup of walnuts. It made enough for two medium bowlfuls. The rest of the ingredients I added by taste: cinnamon, honey, manishewitz. I omitted the sugar because the apples and honey are plenty sweet already. I also added about a tablespoon of lemon juice (for flavor and to prevent browning) and a prince of salt. Yum!"

I cut the recipe in half since we're not a big crowd this year and I'm sure I'll have plenty left over after our seder - except for the fact that my daughter eats it like it's a great snack. MAKE SURE TO MAKE IT AHEAD OF TIME AND SHAKE IT OCCASIONALLY TO MAKE SURE THE WINE IS ABSORBED BY ALL THE APPLES AND WALNUTS."

I use all honey, no sugar, although I'm sure date sugar would taste good. Manischevitz Concord is the only wine I think I've ever used. Since my son is allergic to nuts, I've had to omit the nuts for the past 13 years, but I still get raves every time."

I also made a batch experiment-style, as the combination of ingredients in haroset tends to irritate my mouth and tongue. Yippee - the end result doesn't create that same affect. I used pecans and almonds instead of walnuts, the full amount of apples, and did not peel them, but chopped them small but not fine in my food processor (did the nuts first, removed them and then did the apples). I used all honey, added about 3/4 cup drained crushed pineapple, blended all together, then added both a sweet red wine and a bit of pineapple juice, for moistening. Will definitely be using this recipe from now on! Thanks for sharing this, Jill."

The second time I made this was for a family Seder. I peeled the apples, but to save time I used a Cuisinart to chop both the apples (one at a time to avoid applesauce) and walnuts. My only regret was the appearance of the charoset. It would have looked much nicer if I had hand chopped the apples. Nevertheless, the hostess of this Seder asked me to bring this charoset next year because she wants to make it a tradition. I heard several people comment on the charoset and go back for seconds."

Instead of peeling and chopping I grated the unpeeled apples using my food processor, which saved immensely on the prep time, and I left the peels on, since that's where most of the apple's nutrients are (buy organic if you're going to leave the peels on, though). Also, I added a bit more honey (about 2 TBS total) to help bind everything together. To get three cups of grated apples I needed 5 smallish gala apples. I got several compliments on this, and two separate people told me it was the best haroset they'd ever had. Thanks for the great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Good recipe for haroset. Once you have the basic ingredients down you can play to your own tastes. I always like a few more nuts in mine. Also, note in the intro to this recipe that the amount of the finished product is 3 cups. 6 apples of the size I used was way to many for the 3-cup total -- even 4 apples were too many. I'd say 3-4 medium fuji or gala would work fine."
