"reviewBody": "I'm a huge chile relleno fan and made them at home for years but in my wiser years have steered away from them because of the frying not being the healthiest. I was excited to find this healthier (and easier) alternative but was dismayed by the first reviewer. So, I did what most adventurous cooks do and took this on as a project to improve. The modifications were all based on what I would agree is a very basic and flavorless egg batter and excessive cheese. The sauce was fantastic and I did allow it to reduce while the casserole was cooking down to a perfect consistency. With the below modification I would give it 5 stars but gave it a generous 4 because they get credit for getting me inspired. ;-) My changes: 1) I beat 2 of the egg yolks and folded them in to the whites (adds richness and flavor); 2) I used Mexican La Crema (available in your dairy cream section) as evaporated milk is too sweet for my taste; 3) I reduced the salt to 3/4 teaspoon; 4) I used 4 fresh-frozen hatch chile that I roasted in the oven instead of the canned; 5) I used 1/2 the amount of cheese and used a Mexican Cheese Mix as the other reviewer is right, the texture of the Oaxaca cheese is too tough when baked in a casserole. The result was excellent and the sauce made it sparkle!"

"reviewBody": "Without the sauce, the egg portion tasted of salt, but was otherwise tasteless. After cooking (30 minutes until a bit golden on top...) and letting cool for 10 minutes, then dug in to the casserole. Using the canned hatch chilies, it had an overall tart flavor. It also was too salty for my palate. The cheese is thick and chewy in texture, with not a lot of flavor except salt, like a mozzarella. (I would cut the salt in half.) The ranchero sauce was bold with spices, on the thin side, and again, a bit too salty for me, but tasted good on it's own. Too much sauce can overwhelm the casserole flavorwise, which may be the point. The overriding flavors were salt and tart and if using the sauce a bold flavored sauce that almost over-road the chile flavor. It baked up nicely."
