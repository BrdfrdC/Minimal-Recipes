We didn’t want too much pineapple or dressing so used a 14 ounce bag of slaw mix and we used pineapples in heavy syrup. (I appreciate the suggestions from other reviews!) She suggested using curry and cumin in place of the oregano and it worked well. Next time we will use oregano because I have to try this again!"

The dressing part easily covered the cabbage mixture despite using the 1 pound bag of chopped cabbage. Followed the rest of the recipe. I think the flavors would really pop if you used fresh cilantro instead of dried. But all in all, it is a good recipe that worked really well with baby back ribs and a Riesling."

I used a 16-oz bag of coleslaw mix because after it sits for a few hours it can get a little soupy when you only use 8-oz. I also omitted the onion (I don't like raw onion) and it still came out great. My favorite way to serve it is piled on top of a pulled pork taco. Delicious and easy! This is definitely a recipe I'll keep around."

I admittedly only used half the pineapple and thought that was an appropriate amount. My only issue was that I poured the liquid onto the slaw without realizing it was too much. So be careful to not use all the sauce unless you like it soupy."

"reviewBody": "This was a very simple and tasty slaw. The only changes I made: I used a 10oz package of coleslaw mix and parsley instead of cilantro (didn't have any and don't care for it). My can of crushed pineapple was 20oz so I did not use all of it, next time I definitely will. I may even switch to tidbits instead of crushed. The pineapple flavor was very subtle. But, very simple ingredients and a great side dish with our pulled pork and homemade mac and cheese ( used Chef John's recipe on this site). I disagree with other reviews that they did not think it was enough marinade/sauce. I thought it was plenty and may even do a touch less next time. I prefer more cabbage than sauce with my coleslaw."
