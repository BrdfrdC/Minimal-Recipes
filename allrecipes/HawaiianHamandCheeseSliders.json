I used sliced cheddar cheese on half and shredded pepper jack on the other half. I didn't have Dijon mustard, so I used Honey Mustard instead. These were great and with me doubling the recipe, I had leftovers to reheat afterwards. :)"

It's pretty amazing how when you use the honey mustard its hard to tell your eating turkey almost everyone thinks they are eating a ham and cheese slider.

If you separate your rolls rather than leaving them hooked together they turn out better - at least mine did! Don't skip the step of spreading some of the butter mixture on the rolls before piling on the ham and swiss! There is nothing healthy about these sandwiches so don't even go there. Just enjoy!"

"reviewBody": "We love these! Sometimes I’ll add a little brown sugar and fresh minced garlic to the butter mixture. We always make them with different meats and cheeses for variety. Turkey and Swiss, roast beef and cheddar or provolone, ham and American, etc. these are also so very good cold! Spousal unit likes taking them for lunch and the littles like them cold as well. Going on a road trip in a few weeks and I plan on making a big batch to take along for a 16 hour two day drive along with cold salads, chips, etc. the Hawaiian sweet rolls are a must! If not, a good potato dinner roll will work but the sweet rolls give it that extra pop. Also can be reheated in air fryer 350 for about 3-5 minutes. These are really good if you let them sit with the butter sauces in fridge for 1-24 hours before baking."

"reviewBody": "These sandwiches are simply awesome and so easy to put together! I live in Sweden, so I don't have access to \"slider\" buns, not to mention Hawaiian Sweet Bread. So the change I made was to make them on whole wheat rolls -- \"regular\" size. Which was also practical because I was serving them for dinner for our family of six. Other than the bread, I made two of them with smoked ham for my husband and I. Because our four teenage boys are refugees from Afghanistan and therefore Muslim, I used smoked deli turkey for their sandwiches. These were a definite hit with everyone, including requests that I make them again! I served them with a green salad and potato chips."

Perfect for a potluck and they were all gone! I always make some extra for us to have at home as they are good warmed up for lunch. The only thing I did differently was to follow someone else's suggestion of putting some of the sauce on the buns and some on top. Keeping this recipe and will definitely make this again!"

Sauté onions until soft...mixed sweet/spicy mustard, Worcester sauce and mayo...added to onions and stirred together for couple minutes. 3/4 of this was added to bottom buns, topped with meat, Swiss cheese (shredded), added top bun. Left a small portion of mustard mixture to add on top bun with sprinkle of more cheese. It was very very good."

"reviewBody": "Made these for my book club group last night and they were a real hit! I doubled the recipe and made 8 in an 8' x 8' pan with Turkey and Provolone Cheese and 16 in a 9' x 13' pan with Ham and Swiss Cheese. Think that I liked the ham better, but they were both wonderful! I put them together in the morning, covered with foil and put in the fridge for the day. The only ingredient that I changed was to use 1/4 cup dried onion flakes (for the doubled recipe) instead of minced fresh onions. They worked just fine and it was much quicker to put together. I probably also put less of the topping on the inside of the rolls than the recipe called for. Just brushed the butter sauce on each roll bottom till they looked well moistened. I just love how these get kind of crispy on the bottom, got ooey, gooey on the inside, and the topping was so pretty and tasted so good. Great company casual meal! Thanks, Susan. I am going to go out to the site and see what other yummy contributions you have made."
