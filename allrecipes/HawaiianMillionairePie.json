I also used a 10\" Graham cracker pie crust and switched out pecans for the walnuts. Be sure to strain your pineapples in a strainer for about 10 minutes and pat dry with paper towel. Complete hit. I will definitely be making this again!!"

It still hasn't completely set up yet and I did drain and squeeze out the juice. That's ok though I just had to invite my brother back over for dinner again tomorrow. Hopefully it will be ready then. The filling tastes very good, sweet but good :) **UPDATE ** I had extra filling leftover and since it wasn't setting I put a cup of it in the freezer. It made delicious ice cream!! I highly recommend saving some to freeze!"

"reviewBody": "this is an awesome and easy recipe that i have been using for a few years now and is always a special request at all the functions that i attend. One of the reviewers had mentioned it was very runny... i have had this problem to once before but figured out that the whip cream truly has to be completely thawed out. If it is frozen still at all, when you mix the ingredients, you will end up with what i fondly refer to as hawaiian soup! And no matter how long you keep it in the fridge at that point it will never firm up. so make sure that the whip cream is totally thawed out and you shouldn't have any problems!"

(knowledge from years making fruit salad) You want the fruit to be as dry as you can get it. If not it will break down your whipped cream sooooo fast and you end up with a runny mess. Overall good pie though :P"

"reviewBody": "Quite a recipe, indeed. I couldn't find any maraschino cherries, so I substituted canned \"real cherries\", and I think that it made the difference, honestly. The maraschino type would have made this pie extremely sweet - and it was already sweet enough without them. Some liked it, some did not - I enjoyed it immensely, as did my partner, so that's enough for me to give it a 5 star rating. One note: this pie was extremely messy, so if you're looking to give to company, I wouldn't recommend *this* particular one. However, no one will care once it's in their mouths =)"
