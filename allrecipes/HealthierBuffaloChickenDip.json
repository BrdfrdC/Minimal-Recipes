And everyone was asking who made it! Saving this to make again and again! \nSubstitutions: I replaced half the neufchatel with plain greek yogurt , added sauted onion (about a half of one onion) and minced garlic, and threw in one stalk of chopped celery."

"reviewBody": "This was very good. I used two boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 10oz each), diced and sauteed in a bit of olive oil, with garlic powder and onion powder liberally sprinkled on, and cut the hot sauce to 1/2 instead of 3/4 c. It still had a slight kick; for us, any more would have been too much. It was really good with celery. Also, it seemed so thick that I added about 1/c of water, a little at a time, till I got more of a dip consistency. \n\nFor four people the quantity was way too much, so I'd cut it in half if I made it again. One downside is that it needs to stay warm, and should be in a wider shallower container, a chafing dish or a wide crockpot. We didn't have those, so kept it on the stove, which meant it wasn't very convenient."

"reviewBody": "I made a few modifications to make it less fattening and reduce the dairy. I made my own chicken, used veggie shreds (cheddar cheese), Toffuti cream cheese (non dairy) and fat free Ranch and I added 1 Tbsp blue cheese. This reduced the calories by 70+ and reduced the fat by 11+ grams. Plus it was delicious. I think I could even cut the ranch to 1/2 cup due to sweetness or make my own Ranch with soy yogurt or Toffuti sour cream and seasonings. No one knew it was low fat and loved it."

"reviewBody": "I made half the recipe, but next time will do entire recipe. This dip is delicious, and was eaten within two days. I did slightly decrease the hot sauce for preference, and shredded one large pre-cooked chicken breast for a half recipe, didn't have canned. Heated in oven at 325, covered, for about 25 mins, until cheese was melted well. Served with celery sticks and everyone loved it. You could easily use low fat ranch too to decrease calories further and no one will know the difference. I think if I was leaving in a crockpot, I would add some milk to keep from drying out. Thanks for sharing!"

One change I have made for personal preference is instead of ranch dressing, I use 1 cp low fat greek yogurt, 1/2 cup skim milk and a packet of dry ranch mix. I also microwave or bake it, I've never done this in the slow cooker."

"reviewBody": "Could not tell ingredients were reduced fat/calories. I would not use the slow cooker again. Instead I would heat in the oven until cheese is melted on top. The slow cooker seemed to dry it out so it wasn't very creamy like a dip should be, (if it cools you can always heat again in the microwave.) I did leave it in the cooker for the duration of a football game, so that could be why it dried out. I also used frozen checken breast chunks instead of canned chicken. My kids loved it and I made it into a sandwich similar to a tuna melt the next day. It was wonderful!"
