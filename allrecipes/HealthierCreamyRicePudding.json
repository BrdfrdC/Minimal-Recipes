Rinse your rice well in a small strainer and then cook it in a lot of water (about 6 cups) and strain and rinse it again when done. Can use non-dairy milk (I like almond) to make it vegan. Also, needs warming spices (I use apple pie spice or just cinnamon). Thanks for a great recipe!"

To fix this, I added a few tablespoons of milk just on top, microwaved the individual puddings, and sprinkled cinnamon on top. I'll definitely make this pudding again, remembering to cook the rice 10-15 minutes longer."

"reviewBody": "Oops. I made a pot late Thursday night and I ate it all. Had to make another pot on Sunday morning! Even though it is a \"healthier\" version, you would NEVER know - it has all the taste and features you are looking for out of the regular version. Made with organic long grain brown rice, lactose-free milk and 1 tsp cinnamon thrown in, this recipe was everything I had hoped it would be and more. Super creamy. Sweet. Cinamonny. For the 1/3 cup sugar, I mixed half sugar and half Splenda and it was the perfect sweetness for me (I like it fairly sweet). In Canada, it's traditional to put maple syrup on top of rice pudding, so I added some no-sugar-added maple syrup and it even took this awesome rice pudding to the next level. Yum. Yum. Yum. I will keep this recipe and make it many times in the future. Because I need to try and maximize protein in my diet, I even added a scoop of vanilla brown rice protein (an extra 18g protein) to the just-cooked pudding - it didn't really alter the flavor at all, just the texture very slightly but I don't think it will even be noticeable after the pudding has had time to cool. Thanks so much for this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Ok, this is The creamiest rice dessert ever! It's Nothing like the old fashioned baked rice pudding, but it's really really yummy, Very creamy, and, easy to make!! I used leftover brown coconut rice that didn't really turn out the night before, didn't serve it (1 c brown rice, 1-13.5 can of coconut milk, 7 oz water, a little salt), so it kind of modified this recipe right off the bat (I realize I'm rating a recipe that I didn't follow to a T, a big pet peeve of mine. Sorry folks!) I was looking for a way to salvage it and found this recipe.\nSo I heated it back up on the stove, added a 1/2 c unsweetened cashew milk and half the sugar, a little salt, and a sprinkling of cinnamon. Once thoroughly heated through while constantly stirring, I added a 1/4 c more of the nut milk, a 1/4 c half &amp; half, and 1 more teaspoon of sugar. Once that was heated through again, I tempered a little of the hot rice mixture into the beaten egg, then added it into the entire mix. After a few minutes of again stirring constantly over the heat, I removed it from the heat and added the vanilla and butter. Served it with more cinnamon. Yumm-ee! So happy I made it :)"

The raisins give it the necessary sweetness.\n\n A tip. During the boiling of the brown rice I drained and replaced the water half way through. I felt that the water was to thick and discoloured, and that fresh water would aid the softening process, and also reduce the strong nutty flavour. Just remember to add extra time to allow for the water to reboil, or useboiling water as the replacement."

It was really tasty and you can barely tell it's brown rice...in fact I think it works better than white as it seems heartier. Next time I might cut the amount of sugar in half as it's pretty sweet but overall it's a great recipe :)"

"reviewBody": "Using up leftover cooked brown rice, so I had to remind myself how much cooked rice to substitute for uncooked. (Basically cooked is about 3x the volume of uncooked rice.) Had enough leftovers to nearly doubled this dish ( just over 4 cups of cooked brown rice), and doubled every other ingredient except sugar. I used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup granulated Splenda. It was sweet enough for my family's tastes. Also, I followed advice of other reviewers &amp; tempered the egg &amp; added 1 tsp of cinnamon (for my double batch). Very satisfied with the the end result!"

Doesn't harden properly in the fridge either.\nAnd i did this with low fat buttermilk? wow people actually eat this .\n\nSpare this recipe and either go with http://allrecipes.com/recipe/creamy-brown-rice-pudding/\nWhich uses evapourated milk to get it to a true pudding texture and uses nutty flavor rather than vanilla.\nOr just go to your local deli and buy eastern European hazelnut pudding and use low fat milk top it with some nutella and ground hazelnuts/almond meal.\nNot recommended and this is coming from someone who makes a new pudding each week."

For anyone who doesn't know how to temper an egg (like me when read recommendation) u just take last 1/2 cup of milk heat to a boil then slowly add to your egg that you have previously beaten. Once two are combined add to rice mix and bam the best rice pudding"

I almost didn't find it, though, because of the word \"healthy.\" I was looking for brown rice pudding, not necessarily healthy rice pudding! By the way, I recommend tempering the egg before adding it to the hot pudding- otherwise, you'll get scrambled egg bits in your pudding, of course."

It was very sweet too, but that wasn't the main issue I had with this. I really wanted to like this, as I love rice pudding and a healthier version would have been great. But I guess I'll stick with my usual recipe."

Also, I used soy milk and cooked brown rice. Per other comments, I cut back on the sugar too. I added 2 Truvia packets instead of sugar, and found the pudding plenty sweet. A dish a cinnamon, and all was fantastic!"

"reviewBody": "I give this about 3.5 stars. It was honestly, just way too sweet for my taste. After making this, I believe I had made the original recipe for this rice pudding and thought exactly the same. I only had 1/2 cup of raisins, so I used that much. I still thought there were too many raisins. I was surprised the recipe did not say to temper the eggs. I decided to follow the recipe as written, and learned I was right about that. I ended up with a few egg white bits in the pudding. I also thought the pudding was slightly too thin, but thickened after it cooled. I added some cinnamon in my serving bowl and it did cut through the sweetness a tad. I guess, I will keep looking for a good but slightly healthy recipe that has the right balance of creaminess to sweetness."

Although I think it would even be good on it's own without the fruit (if you happen to not have any and still want to make this). I also used slightly less sugar, only because I'm not big on sweet, and a dash of cinnamin and nutmeg on each serving. Delicious!"

"reviewBody": "I love this recipe! It's a healthier version of one of my favorite foods. I double the recipe and I do double the amount of vanilla and add 1/2 Tbsp of Cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of Nutmeg. I also cut down the amount of suger to 1/2 cup (1/4 cup if making the recipe as stated) and found that it was sweet enough without being 'sugary'. I have found that once it's refridgerated that it tends to thicken quite considerably so I need to add a few tablespoons of milk before I reheat. But it's so wonderful I don't care! Also, try adding the seeds from 1/2 a vanilla pod instead of the spices above. Yummy!"
