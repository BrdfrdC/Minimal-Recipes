Thsis is my first review as I normally dont do them!!I made it exactly as described minus the fresh parsley because I did not have it at home.\nYou can do SO MUCH with this recipe.....You could add any ingredient you want to change it up to your liking. Examples: Add celery, humus, olives, tomatoes, mushroom beans &amp; much more. You could eat it with salad, wraps, toast, sandwich, lettuce wraps or straight up as I did! You could add or delete ingredients as you like. Examples: add orange zest, grapefruit zest or leave it out. You could add honey, avocado, hot sauce, left over shredded chicken or any meats. You can add or delete anything you want to this recipe! Thank you to who ever posted it!"

I served it on romaine lettuce leaves and found it very refreshing and a nice change of pace. Thanks for the new recipe in my rotation!"

Serve in a scooped out fresh tomato in season or half an avocado for a lovely salad for lunch or dinner. I eat year round and always well received when served to guests. If you love tuna, this is worth a try! If not fond of tuna, sub in diced chicken or turkey."
