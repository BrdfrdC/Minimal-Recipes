I patted them dry thoroughly and put them in the freezer for 30 minutes rather than the fridge for and hour. Everything else was from the recipe. The wings came out decent, but definitely should've broiled for 10 minutes or baked longer as they weren't crispy enough. Also wish I omitted the butter as they're not very healthy!"

I also made Chef John's Buffalo Wing Sauce which probably takes away from the \"healthy\" just a bit because of the amount of butter but it has that authentic \"Buffalo\" flavor that we like. I stopped eating fried foods a couple of years ago and I try to bake them as much as possible, so this recipe will be my \"go to\" for \"oven fried\" anything for a long time to come. Goin to try it on my chicken fried steak as well. Thanks for an excellent recipe addition to my collection. Five stars and high fives"

I put parchment paper on the cookie sheets and let them sit for an hour or more in the fridge. The reason for only 4 stars is that I didn't use the sauce in the recipe, I just used Sweet Baby Ray's Buffalo Sauce, just to make it easier. I did find that I had to let them cook a little longer then written to get to the crispiness we like. But all in all, they were very good! And a lot less expensive than buying them out!"

Will make these again, but try them without the flour to see if they crisp up better. Also used less butter in the sauce, probably about 1 1/2 t. Good flavor, used Frank's original hot sauce. Almost forgot, I baked them on a rack sprayed with cooking spray so fat could drip away. Maybe they need to be in the fat to crisp up. So guess I really didn't follow the recipe!!! Sorry! Still a keeper!\nReviewed on 3/26/17, but my review says 1/1/2001 ?!?!?"

Prep: Husband had used up all the cayenne, so had to powderize some crushed red pepper. Reduced flour by half and there was still excess flour. Sauce: Cut butter in half, added pinch of dried ginger, 1/4 tsp of Aleppo pepper for more heat, and 1/2 tsp flour to thicken sauce. Texture was medium crispy. We like really crispy, but I didn't want to risk dry chicken."

I took the left over sauce &amp; jared it back into the Franks Original Hot Sauce bottle &amp; used it after for some breaded baked chicken breast delicious!

Next time I might cook them a little longer to get them a little crispier. The flavor was good, and I liked the spices in the flour dusting (I mixed them all together in a gallon-sized Ziploc bag and shook the chicken in the bag). The sauce was good but I will definitely decrease the butter next time; even this little amount left a sheen of oil on top of the sauce. A terrific alternative to ordering pizza and wings! Thanks!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe is wonderful - you can always add more or less spice depending on taste. Several of the people \"rating\" this recipe aren't rating it at all - they're creating their own version of a completely different recipe not using flour. It has nothing to do with how these wings are made and if they don't want to use flour that's fine, but don't rate a recipe you haven't made or tasted."

"reviewBody": "This came out very tasty. I added pre-chopped garlic and ginger at the seasoning stage and a bit of extra salt. I didn't get as far as making the butter sauce, because I fell asleep whilst they were in the oven and had to get dinner on the table quick!\n\nSo mine had a sort of crispy coating instead of a moist coating (we are from the UK, where this recipe is virtually unknown, so the kids didn't know any different). It was a real hit and I will do it again and minus the butter sauce it was superhealthy."

I sprayed the pan, put down the wings, and sprayed the wings before covering in saran wrap and putting in the freezer for 30 min (I didn't have an hour to refrigerate). As for the seasonings, I used Garlic salt instead of regular salt, some Tony Chachere's, and Mrs. Dash Original seasoning."

"reviewBody": "I'll rate this 4 stars. However, I don't understand the need to add butter. I season my wings and bake them for over an hour, draining off the fat before drizzling them with Frank's Hot Sauce and tossing in a bowl. Easy peasy, and a lot less greasy. The meat falls off the bone. But try baking them longer and using less butter and fat, there's already plenty of fat in the skin."

"reviewBody": "Hey kids\nThe secret is to dry off the wings as much as possible before tossing with flour.\nI stack mine with 3 layers of paper towel between each layer of wings after patting them dry, then I put them in refrigerator over night.\nI then pat them dry again Then I put 5-6 wings in bag with flour &amp; coat.\nAlso I cook mine @ 425 convection on parchment paper.\nA bit of effort is required but it is well worth it."

"reviewBody": "I agree, flour isn't necessary. A little oil and a dry rub of spices is much more healthy. I bake them on a wire rack so they are not sitting in a pool of grease. I like mine crispy so I skip the butter. If you want them hotter add some Tabasco to the oil."

"reviewBody": "Each time I make them I change up the spices in the flour mixture to give them different flavors and then combine with different dipping sauces. To cut on time, I freeze them for 30mins and the pop in the oven at 415-425 until done, flipping once. They come out crispy and yummy each time."
