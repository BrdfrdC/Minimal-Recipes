We’ve been in high spirits most of that time, but every now and again we’ll really feel their absence in the house. Their boisterous laughs, heavy panting after a jump on the trampoline, and love of blasting rock music all through the house would fill our lives with light in a way we didn’t realize until it was gone. They loved sloppy joes and this healthier recipe (we’ve got to watch our cholesterol) was perfect for remembering"

My favorite is G Hughes sugar free ketchup. Trust me on this it’s so good and I prefer it over regular ketchup now. \nAlmost 3/4 large red onion \nUsed about 3-4 tsp of McCormick sloppy joe seasoning mix but it would have tasted just as good without it I think. \nUsed sir Kensington honey mustard (10 cal for tsp) instead of regular mustard.\n\nAlso because I used so much veggie my recipe didn’t come out looking like a sloppy joe. It’s packing that dark meaty look but I let still tastes incredible"

His version came out just as good, though I had to add a bit of liquid to it as the veggie crumble is slightly different in texture etc. than ground beef - I added maybe a Tbsp or two of water and also the 2 Tbsp tomato paste I also added to our version. \n\nWe'll definitely make this regularly - easy, relatively healthy, fun!"
