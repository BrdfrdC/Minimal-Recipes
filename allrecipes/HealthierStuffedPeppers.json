There are hundreds of Stuff Peppers Recipies on the Allrecipes website; IMO, it is easier to find a recipe with ingredients and preparations you like, out of hundreds of recipes, without making 50 additional adjustments and changes to the selected recipes. It's like making a completely new recipe. The suggestions are already incorporated into other recipes. It is ok 2-3 small changes/suggestions."

I used 1 can of spaghetti sauce, saving some to put on the top with Italian seasoning sprinkled on. I also added cheese to the meat mixture. When cooking, I covered the tops with parchment paper and then tinfoil, baking for 30 minutes, then taking both off, adding more cheese on top and then baking for another 15 minutes. They were very good. The best I’ve ever made!"

I cooked the peppers in my 12” cast iron skillet which I am SO glad I did because the sauce was fabulous with the peppers especially with grated parmigiana on top. I used fresh peppers from our garden which were smaller than store bought but delicious. I topped the dish with fresh herbs! Fantastic meal served with a side salad."

I used Uncle Ben's 90 second microwave Jasmine rice and cooked it before adding to mix to make the recipe prep go quicker, I used garlic powder instead of fresh, and I steamed the peppers in the microwave, in a bowl with about 1 inch of water for about 4 minutes to soften a little bit, while cooking the beef mixture. I baked for about 45 minutes till temperature of meat reached 160! Served with one baked yeast roll. Perfection!!!!!"

"reviewBody": "Overall, good flavor and easy recipe, but some adjustments are needed. Brown Rice – I never have luck with brown rice on the stove (too mushy) and usually bake it (Alton Brown recipe). Thought more water should be added to pot, but wasn’t sure and followed recipe as written. Set the timer for 45 minutes and ended up burning the rice within 30-35 minutes. Cook time of 45-50 min. for brown rice is clearly too long. Should have paid attention, but I’m sick and didn’t—oops! I may be sick, but husband confirmed I had heat on medium-low. Hubs took over cooking and used 1 cup leftover white rice from last night. From looking at another similar recipe, I think 20 minutes to cook the brown rice would be sufficient and the rice would probably finish cooking in oven too. Used ground turkey in place of the beef. All other ingredients/measurements left the same. Didn’t have enough sauce left for basting…sauce seemed to dry up on peppers. Perhaps covering until last 15 minutes would have been better and forget the basting. Then you could add the parmesan in last 10-15 min. of baking (uncovered). Again, overall good flavors and ease in preparation! Unfortunately, rating 3 stars because of cook time on rice and lack of any sauce to baste with. However, will be making recipe again with adjustments…so, thanks for sharing the recipe!"

Practically anything I can find for desired flavor. Also, I always drain meat. Grease contributes to heartburn actually."

After sauteing the onions and garlic, I added the turkey, parmesan cheese, dried oregano, basil, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Once cooked, added 3/4 of organic low sodium jarred tomato sauce. I cut the peppers in half, added the rice/meat mixture to each and place in pyrex dish which was coated with the rest of the jarred sauce. I covered with foil and baked for 1 hr."

I used turkey in place of ground beef and quinoa instead of brown rice, because the texture is more moist and meat-like. Added some cumin and a little bit of taco seasoning and basted with a TINY drizzle of the sauce only 3 times during cooking so they wouldn't get soupy or soggy. I'll make them the exact same way next time with a little bit of cayenne or red pepper flakes"

Since that had so much flavor, I omitted the Italian seasoning. I also added Cheddar cheese to the beef mix and sprinkled it on top.\n\n45 minutes in our oven was enough--almost too much."

Good as posted. \n\nLike most, I tweaked tonight. First, used ground bison (Costco). Little different taste. Liberal use of garlic. Most importantly (as others) added Italian Seasoning (I use Gourmet Garden \"tube\" … love this stuff) directly to the onion / meat / rice mixture. Probably a little more liberal with Worcestershire sauce. Used only red, orange, and yellow peppers. Finally, as others suggested, needed more \"sauce\". Combined one can of tomato sauce (per recipe) and one can of tomato soup and couple of teaspoons of Italian Seasoning. Gave enough sauce to baste and made a little more moist. \n\nAwesome awesome. Total success but want to try the barley recommendation as well as poblano variation."
