Rather than double the chicken as others suggested to better equal the amount of sauce, I doubled the celery/apple / Craisins/ onion / walnuts and loved it. Sell your stock in Mircle Whip as this is my new salad dressing. Thanks Yoly."

I Love cranberries but I didn’t think they added that much taste but different texture. I added a few grapes on the side to see f it made a difference and it tasted fresher and lighter. Next time , I’d either add more apples or some grapes . Overall it tasted great was a nice change for a healthy summer chicken salad ."

"reviewBody": "I had a little of this and that leftover, and who can afford to throw leftovers out in our current economic climate. I found this recipe to be very forgiving. I had one grilled chicken breast leftover, enough for two generous servings, which I cut up. I didn't have any yogurt, so I used a cup of leftover cottage cheese, mixed with a tbsp of mayonnaise and a tbsp of sour cream. I added a tbsp of chopped red pepper, 2 tbsp chopped red onion, used walnuts instead of pecans, seasoned it with about 1/2 tsp of Greek seasoning and a bit of ground black pepper. I did have the rest of the recipe ingredients (apples, celery, craisins, Dijon mustard), and added those. Served it on top of thick slices of red native tomatoes, with a sliced cucumber salad and fresh watermelon. Came out pretty tasty, if I do say so myself."

I realize the nuts and Crasins are added for texture and flavor appeal . . . Just don’t over do it with these items from a caloric standpoint. And for those of you who thought it needed more flavor consider adding a small amount of lemon juice or apple cider vinegar to add some spark. And maybe a little garlic powder."

The dijon mustard gave it tang, the greek yogurt was creamy and the cottage cheese was a good addition. The crunch of the onion, celery, pecans and chew of the cran-raisins created a mouthful of texture and flavors to please. We ate it on toast but have plans to eat it on crackers or a bed of lettuce another day. We made half the recipe which was super easy to adjust too. This is a new \"go to\" recipe for us."
