Tonight's was spaghetti noodles with broccoli, carrots, tomatoes, black olives,and basil simmered in a sauce of butter, olive oil, chicken broth, onions, garlic and grated Parmesan. Seasoned with salt and lemon pepper. Spaghetti didn't hold the sauce well (penne is better), but it all tasted great!"

The recipe was easy to follow, prep was a cinch and a pasta primavera that didn't weigh me down with a cream sauce was exactly what I was looking for! The meal was delicious and filling, we will be making this often during the summer months!"

I don't like asparagus and passed on it. Since I didn't have carrots, I've used red peppers. It came out all right. I would make it again with the yellow squash, but I did have leftovers for another night."
