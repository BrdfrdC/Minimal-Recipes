When I made it the second time I followed the exact directions and it was disgusting, liquidy, and way too sweet and I have a big sweet tooth and even for me this was disgusting. I could taste the brown sugar in the mousse. It wasn't at all thick. It was grainy. I ended up throwing it out. I highly recommend not making this. It was the worst sweet thing I have ever had."

"reviewBody": "I don't like Greek yogurt much, but this was good. I'll definitely try it again sometime. I used natural peanut butter, and at 10 seconds in the microwave, it didn't seem liquid as indicated in the recipe, so I put in for another 10 seconds. That was a mistake, because the peanut butter started to cook--it got thick and grainy. I was still able to incorporate all of it into the yogurt, but it took quite a bit of stirring. Next time, I don't think I need to microwave at all. Also, I think I will try honey to sweeten instead."

"reviewBody": "1.11.17 First, I must say after looking at the nutritional breakdown, I’m not convinced how “healthy” this is, but I can say that it is delicious. Certainly is quick to prepare, and if piped into a dish or a small glass, actually has good presentation (nice enough for a company dessert). I just sprinkled on a few chocolate chips rather than mixing in, and the consistency is incredibly smooth and peanut-y. Next time, I'm going to add more vanilla Greek yogurt which I think will lighten the mousse texture even more. I can see mixing in some chopped banana or even some crisp pieces of bacon. Sarah, thanks for sharing your recipe. •••••UPDATE 12.25.17••••• FYI, I made this yesterday substituting Nutella for the peanut butter which was a nice variation on this simple dessert."
