The only deviations I made were 1) I probably doubled the garlic because we are huge garlic fans; and 2) I cooked the pasta noodles separately in heavily salted water and added it to the soup after one hour of simmering. The whole family adored the flavor and we are adding this to our usual “repertoire” of soups."

I also didn't do potatoes as I didn't want two starches in the soup. I also sautéed the garlic with the onions, celery, and carrots (versus adding it later). I also sautéed some pancetta (4 ounces) with all of the above ingredients. Yum Yum"

"reviewBody": "I made this mostly according to the directions, but added green beans I had on hand, and fresh thyme from our garden, and omitted the cabbage. I also used fresh tomatoes rather than the canned tomatoes, and home-made chicken bone broth. None of these changes change the recipe substantially though. \nThe one change that's important for me is boiling the pasta separately. I'm cooking for only two (my wife and me) and there are ALWAYS leftovers. If there is pasta in the leftover soup, over time it absorbs the liquid and becomes a squishy mess. So I cook the pasta separately, very al dente, and add a little to each bowl before serving.\nIn any case my two customers both loved it."

It came out very good after rectifying the salt and pepper. Will make it again!!!"

I even used some inferior bouillon, and it still turned out amazing. I plan on making it again soon."

"reviewBody": "Wow. This recipe I loosely followed to use up all my veggies in the fridge and some frozen (thawed). Then used leftover chicken that was grilled, a quart of canned tomatoes, leftover homemade spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato paste, but left the noodles out. May add some tomorrow to leftovers to make it stretch but I’m undecided. With how I made it it relied heavily on the veggies seasoning it. It was made into a clean eating very healthy meal. Even my diabetic boyfriend can eat what he wants with no worries (hence me not wanting to add noodles tonight). I will use this recipe over and over. Thank you so much. Full happy bellies all around."

"reviewBody": "When you want to clean out your fridge this is the soup to make, it’s hearty and tasty and makes a lot. I stuck to the instructions and added four carrots, four celery stalks, one large onion sautéed in olive oil. Made a hot spot and threw down the tomato paste to enhance the flavor and let it cook a minute before adding the rest of the veggies - in my fridge I had a piece of yellow squash, a quarter of a small cabbage and three small russet potatoes and a red bell pepper so they got cubed up and thrown in. I added a big can of plum tomatoes in purée (chopped up) and two boxes of chicken broth. For the beans I added a can of Goya Red Kidney beans in sauce which adds a lot of flavor base to the soup. Seasoning-wise I used fresh parsley, red pepper flakes, dried basil, oregano , a little garlic powder even tho I had already added minced garlic earlier, and two spoonfuls of beef bouillon in place of the salt. Cooked small soup shells separately since the last time I made this soup the shells really absorbed the broth and made it more stew like.\nMade Melissa d’Arabian’s foolproof popovers with some sweet butter to go with the soup. Perfect meal for a dreary day in the Northeast and it made the house smell wonderfully of comfort food. Tomorrow it will be even better."

I also added about a tblsp of brown sugar to cut the tomatoes' acidity, extra tomato paste and a little Italian seasoning. I cooked the macaroni (small shells) separately and will add to bowl of soup. I did let it simmer about 45 min because I didn't want too mushy. Topped bowl of soup with a drizzle of olive oil and romano cheese that I already had opened. Thanks for this delicious recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This is my go to minestrone soup. Tried others and this has been a real hit. If my wife likes something she raves to other coworkers and may even share. They also loved it and I printed out the recipe for them. So let’s recap a simple to follow ingredients, cost is minimal ( big on saving money) most people have these items as staples to there pantry. I added to my soup was a can of red kidney beans. Also added my own dried herbs. As for adding noodles ,I cooked them separate to allow people to add as much or as little to their bowl. Add to taste oregano a pinch to start. Dried basil ( red ) or (green) I grow both. There is a difference in taste use what you like. Dried thyme a pinch. As this soup cooks down flavor is intensified so add to your personal likes.

I followed the suggestion of another rater and added extra tomato paste to perk up the flavor. This is a keeper recipe - thank you! I make it for dinner on Sunday and pack the left overs for work week lunches. This freezes well to save for a quick meal later."
