We love things a bit spicy, so the second time I made it I used 1 lb. of Italian spicy hot sausage, a dash of cayenne, and I also used beef broth - we loved it and it is now our \"go to\" recipe for Minnestrone. Thank you!"

"reviewBody": "This was delicious! I was craving minestrone with beef and this met my (very pregnant) craving! I followed the directions, no substitutions, the only issue I ran into was that I have a 6qt instant pot and the set serving size (8) seems to be for a larger instant pot size. I had to follow the last step by boiling my noodles and the beans in a separate dish and adding them afterwards as with all of the ingredients prior to that point brought it to the max level of the IP. I will adjust accordingly next time."
