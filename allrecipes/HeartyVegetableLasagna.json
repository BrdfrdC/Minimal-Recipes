I added more chopped onions, a zucchini and a summer squash. ------------ I used more mushrooms and started cooking them first, then added the remaining ingredients to saute without adding oil because of the liquid that expelled from the mushrooms. I accidentally used more mozzarella than called for, but you can never go wrong with more mozzarella. Very easy and straightforward recipes."

"reviewBody": "This was quite good, and this recipe will become my base recipe. Guests complimented it. Of course, I did make some of my own changes :) The recipe doesn't indicate any use of salt. I knew I needed salt in the veggie sauce (I used ¼ tsp Kosher), and I also added a pinch of granulated salt to the ricotta/egg/cheese mixture. I usually lay out all the ingredients ahead of time, &amp; I think the recipe should indicate how much salt is needed at each step (or at least say \"salt to taste\" just to remind me). I also think the recipe needed more seasoning. I used 1 tsp of dried Herbes de Provence in the veggie sauce. I used fresh basil and fresh tarragon, which I added to the ricotta/egg/cheese mixture. I used 2 different tomato sauces for the veggie sauce mixture because that is what I had on hand. One of those tomato sauces had a bit of pepper heat to it. If that had not been the case, I would have added some sort of hot pepper seasoning. I added ½ a package of frozen spinach because I like spinach in lasagna. I did NOT need a whole package of lasagna noodles - probably only ½ the package. I tented aluminum foil over the dish in the oven for the 1st half of the cooking, and then turned broil on for the last 5 minutes or so. I tried the AllRecipes drop down to scale the recipe to fewer than 12 servings, but that messed up the mozzarella proportions, so I just made the 12 serving recipe. Guests had plenty, I had plenty over a few days, and there's one final piece in the freezer for later!"

I used portobellos, red peppers instead of green, a grated zucchini and grated carrot in the pan with the onions and garlic. Don't forget to add a good amount of Salt and Pepper--with all these veggies, it needs it. I also added frozen chopped spinach to the ricotta. I didn't use all the lasagna noodles (the pan was full to the top with 3 layers). This was moist and delicious."

We have vegetarians and carnivores, and everyone loved it. \n\nAs suggested by other reviewers, I added 1 16 oz bag of thawed and drained frozen spinach, and a hodge podge of other veggies (2 medium carrots chopped, broccoli tops chopped, \n1 red bell pepper chopped, 8 oz of mushrooms chopped, 2 zucchini chopped). \n\nI omitted the egg to the cheese mixture, and it was fine. I added 30 oz of pasta sauce, which seemed to be just right (not dry but not soupy at all). I was flummoxed as to why I have lots of cooked but unused lasagna noodles remaining unused, as I generously used noodles to fill a 9X13 pan. All in all, this was a home run and one that will be seen in the post season many times! Thank you for sharing your recipe, Sue!"
