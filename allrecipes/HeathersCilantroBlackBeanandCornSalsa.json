When I think of salsa I think of like a sauce and this was not saucy at all no juice and I also thought it was too much cilantro although I do love cilantro. So next time I think I will leave the sauce in the tomato and also add some store bought fresh salsa sauce. But otherwise very tasty."

Kitchen Tip: if you squeeze lemon juice or lime juice over the diced avocado (coating all sides) it slows the oxidation time incredibly so you can still enjoy adding this healthful and delicious fruit/veg without it going brown! Enjoy!"

But it turned out very well as a side dish for steak tortillas. I added some cumin, jalapano and chili peppers."

"reviewBody": "I substituted guacamole pico de gallo in place of avocado and used two cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of one. Based on personal preference I left out the pepper. Since the guacamole made it so creamy I didn't need the oil and it was really easy to scoop with a chip. This is one of those great recipes where it is good on its own, but allows you to tweak as you like. It makes a very large amount which makes it great for parties."

We mixed it all together and the avocado got pulverized, next time I may leave them on the side. This recipe goes PERFECT with burritos, definitely a favorite!"

"reviewBody": "So I took this recipe, as I do with all my recipes I find online, and changed it just slightly.\n\nSo I don't like using canned things so I used fresh corn (2 ears) and fresh beans (1.5 cups, dry). I also used fresh garlic (your recipe didn't specify) and fresh tomatoes (two Roma and a handful of cherry). I added other seasonings to taste ( garlic salt, paprika, chili powered, pinch of cumin, and Tony's creole seasoning). \n\nI kept everything else the same. Since I cooked dry beans the recipe time was much longer however if you have the beans pre cooked the time is about the same. (An additional 2-3 hours if dry beans are pre cooked)."

The only changes that I made were: I slightly heat the black beans and corn for a minute with the garlic. This gives it more texture when it comes to the blending process. I also used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, a small jalapeño pepper seeded for a little kick and a teaspoon of distilled vinegar. I omitted the avocado. I will definitely make it again! Great recipe! Thanks!!!"
