"reviewBody": "So I replaced the cream of soup with a roux (equal amounts of oil and flour stirred together over a medium heat until it turns to a caramel color then immediately but gradually adding in the broth) and I make my roux after frying the veggies and garlic, and WITH the veggies and garlic still in the pot. I also added diced celery to finish off the trinity (a Cajun culinary term for onions, bell peppers and celery). Fresh diced parsley and green onion tops are a GREAT addition; some during the cooking process and some for garnish. Also, adding in the precooked crawfish tails this early in the process and simmering SO LONG will create little balls of crawfish rubber. Once the gravy is completely done, THEN add in the crawfish and stirring the etouffee just until the crawfish are heated through. Thanks for reading this! üôÇ"

I did add in some Cajun seasoning and a little diced smoked sausage we had left over from a crawfish boil. That‚Äôs why I give this 5 stars. It would be perfect as is or you can easily modify it. I actually added a little too much water so I had to put a little flour in the thicken the sauce and it was still great."

"reviewBody": "I found this recipe after we had a lot of crawfish left over after a boil. Everyone loves it and we will make it again, for sure.... better than some etouffee I have had at restaurants. Modifications: used butter to saut√© the onion and pepper and much less than in the recipe. My son can spot a mushroom a mile away, so I used cream of celery soup. The crawfish from the boil were super spicy so I didn‚Äôt add any additional spice and there was still quite a kick. Instead of thinning with water I used a generous amount of half and half."

"reviewBody": "I grew up on Cajun food and am super picky when comes to anything Cajun related. My grandmother spoiled me. This recipe is the ‚Äúcheat‚Äù way I like to call it by using Cream of Mushroom. It sure does beat stirring a roux for hours! I added a spoon of Kary‚Äôs (the already made roux in a jar) to my Holy Trinity (the veggies) after saut√©ing them in butter for a while. I used 3 packs of crawfish therefore I used 3 cans of Cream of Mushroom Soup and filled each can up with water (i like getting all the soup off the can too) for my recipe. You always use the same amount of cans of soup that you would as packs crawfish. Instead of her seasonings I added Slap Ya Mama (because it‚Äôs less salty and better than Tony‚Äôs in my opinion and I grew up on Tony‚Äôs) andi added paprika for coloring! Add the crawfish in last so you don‚Äôt over cook. It was to die for!!!! Highly recommend this recipe! I am so thankful to have found it because it‚Äôs really close to my mom‚Äôs. I‚Äôm thinking it might be even better! 10 stars!"

It was a lot easier than other recipes I've tried, and with the addition of some hot sauce at the end, (for me, since I like it spicier than the rest of my family) it was perfect!"

"reviewBody": "I had an etouffee dish in Houston 10 years ago. I have always ordered etouffee when I could find it on the menu at home in Ohio, it was never the same. This was really close, so happy I tried this recipe. Did some tweaking, can't find real crawfish in Ohio so I substituted Langostinos. I don't have cajun seasoning so I used Old Bay sprinkled on plus a dash or two of cayenne and a little pepper. Tasted and thought I needed more pepper, accidentally opened the wrong side and dumped a good teaspoon of pepper into the dish, it was perfect! I like spicy but not super hot. I used the mushroom garlic soup and used the minced roasted garlic in a jar. This was fabulous! Thank you!"

We cooked our rice in a rice pot/cooker. This will def be added to our regular menu. Would be good with shrimp also! Thanks!!!!"

Mine came out too watery, so it didn't have as much flavor as it should. I think this did need some Cajun spice added to it. I sprinkled Zatarain's Cajun season blend on individual servings. Good basic recipe!"
