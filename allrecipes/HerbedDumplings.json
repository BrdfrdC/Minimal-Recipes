"reviewBody": "This is primarily to let you know that this recipe works with Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free 1:1 flour. The dumplings cook up soft and fluffy. They're not quite as good, there's no chewy outside, and they kind of collapse when you chew them, but they're close and totally worth making. On the topic of salt, IF you're using unsalted butter AND kosher salt, the full teaspoon is fine."

Very good savory dumplings. You can play w the liquid, use water, broth, milk, buttermilk. Theyâ€™re still delish!"

Only because i have tried them in the past and always failed, but tonight I added this recipe to my beef stew and i loved them. i made some changes as suggested by reviewers- cut down the salt by half, 1c buttermilk instead of the 3/4C of milk. They turned out so airy and light and not too salty but full of flavor. Going to be adding this to my soups and stews regularly now. They double in size when cooked so be aware not to crowd the pot TOO much. Thank you for the recipe!"

I followed the directions except I noticed pretty quickly I had only Oregano on hand in my understocked spice cabinet. (Again with the shame, lol.) I did have an Herbes de Provence Blend on hand and since it mostly had the same stuff, I subbed around 3 tbsps of it. I have never made dumplings before and wasn't aware of the \"no peeking rule\" but luckily my crockpot has a clear lid and I didn't peek enough to upset it too much. This is how we learn, haha! My results weren't pretty as a picture but the flavor was very good. I set the timer for 30 minutes and at that time, I took the lid off and stirred it gently to break them up a bit. Some of the dumplings denigrated completely but I like a thicker soup so it worked out. This is a very fluffy dumpling, as others have said, very bread or stuffing-like. I have never had a dumpling like these before, I am used to a more dense texture. Still, an easy recipe, flavorful results and a fun Sunday experiment. Thanks for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "Delicious! As per original poster I lowered salt to 1/4 tsp and that was fine. I probably put 3/4 tsp of each of the herbs (tailoring to a child a bit) and substituted basil for parsley (personal preference). They were so good. The Kid loved them, said they tasted like stuffing, a high compliment. \n\nI mixed it up as directed, made 12 balls and dropped into my simmering stew. I covered it with a lid and didn't peek for 15 minutes, although I had to turn the stew down because it was boiling over. After 15 minutes the dumplings looked sorta like brains and I was kind of worried but they tasted great, had great texture and were cooked in the middle. My husband kept saying, \"I can't believe you boiled bread and it cooked in the middle!\" \n\nSaving this recipe, the family wants these again. Thanks!"

Thanks!"

"reviewBody": "I tried this recipe for the first time today and was very pleased. Luckily, I had read some of the reviews and cut back on the salt, but I was a bit suspicious of the amount to begin with and very likely would have cut it back anyway. These dumplings were light and delicious, very enjoyable. I added two tablespoons of sour cream with the milk because we enjoy that taste. I have to say one thing though, I used a tablespoon and a half cookie scoop to drop the dough in and I still got 22 dumplings. I can't imagine how you could 'drop by rounded tablespoons' would only yield 6 dumplings. I almost doubled the recipe - thank goodness I didn't."
