"reviewBody": "I use this recipe as a base. I always add 1 medium onion, about a cup of frozen peas, usually 2 zucchini, and a can of water chestnuts. I start with cooking the onion for about 5 minutes on medium, then add the garlic(which I always double, we love garlic) and zucchini. After a couple minutes, I line the pan with all the veggies that I have cooked, making room in the center to cook the eggs. I add 1 T. of butter in the center for cooking the eggs. That little bit of butter adds another layer of flavor to the recipe. Once the eggs are done I add the rice, rest of the veggies, and soy sauce(4 to 6 Tablespoons). Before serving I also add salt and pepper to taste and about 1 teaspoon of sesame oil to it all and mix well. My son doesn't like the texture of sesame seeds. The sesame oil gives the taste of the seeds without the texture of them. Every time I make this everyone raves about how it's better than take out and just as good if not better than the hibachi restaurant. I hope this helps others. When it comes to cooking recipes, I love experimenting! BTW, I cooked the chicken separate. My son is autistic. I've learned to cook certain ways so he will eat everything. And chicken on the side and not mixed in is another thing that helps him. Enjoy!!"

I followed the recipe exactly but ended up adding a splash of water for additional moisture, a splash of sesame oil, and a splash of teriyaki sauce to balance out the sesame oil while cooking. Go VERY easy if you use sesame oil; it can overpower this particular dish very quickly. A teensy bit though added a wonderful depth of flavor. All in all, an excellent recipe."

Not to change the recipe but I added a tiny piece of butter, maybe 1 tablespoon, and some more oil and soy to compensate for the extra rice. My wife said it tasted exactly like the Hibachi rice from our honeymoon which she was obsessed with. I will add this to our top list of meals. Thanks!"

"reviewBody": "I did add lots of veggies (broccoli, matchstick carrots, green beans, a little celery and water chestnuts.) Cooked using sesame oil rather than olive oil, and added some sesame seeds as well. I had more than 2 cups of rice (probably 3) and used 1/2 the soy sauce, but 3 tablespoons of teriyaki in addition, but I think with the extra rice and the add ins, I should have still used 3 tablespoons of soy sauce because it wasn't salty enough to me, and I am the type to rub salt off of potato chips. I forgot the cilantro, but I believe that would be a good addition for next time as well."

For those of you who hate people that do this, I'm sorry. Feel this is a great base recipe and go from there. My cooking is never to the book! \n\nSeasoning I added: salt/pepper, ground ginger and garlic. Based on my mood this can change! Chicken bullion is a nice add as well. \n\nVeggies added: Bok Choy, water crests, shiitake mushrooms, mixed veggies (peas, corn, whatever needs to be used) \n\nFrying everything like this was quick, easy and a great way to use up leftovers !"

"reviewBody": "The only slight change I made to this recipe is that I used cubed seared chicken that I made in the skillet before I made the rest of the dish. Aside from that, my only advice is to cook the rice the day before and refrigerate it, like other reviewers have said. The dish was perfect for two people with just a little bit leftover, it would be a stretch to feed three people and it definitely needs a side dish to go along with it. I will be making this again because it tastes authentic and great!"
