"reviewBody": "My mom and I followed this recipe to the letter, with the exception of swapping out cake flour for the standard substitution (AP flour with corn starch). The cake came out ghostly white and raw on top, with none of the golden brown color or crackling on top that you expect. It also never rose above halfway up the pan, the same height as the batter that got spooned into the angel food pan. So. It went back in the oven for about 10-15 more minutes at 375 until it was light golden brown on top. The finished cake tasted meh/okay but the the texture was awful: dense and more like a bad biscuit. My husband joked that it would be great with sausage gravy."

I should have added more flour other than just 2T and definitely have increased the temp to 350° than 400° I’m guessing. It didn’t rise like it should or brown, it’s about half the height. Seems heavier than what I usually buy made at our local grocers. Disappointing but I will try again! I was making it for my son’s birthday party but will need to pick up one instead."

"reviewBody": "I live at just over 6000 feet. Despite ever website I could find insisting that you MUST use a tube pan, I wanted a layered cake, so I decided to try using regular pans. (I am a rebel like that!). I baked the recipe in three 6” heart-shaped, ungreased pans lined with parchment. I also put an ungreased large piping tip in the center of each pan (note — the filler tip works the best. I also used 1M tips). I filled each pan 3/4 full. I otherwise made the recipe EXACTLY as written, down to the number of minutes baked. It worked perfectly!!!! I inverted the pans onto a cooling rack straight out of the oven, like you would with any cake. I would absolutely make this again!"

"reviewBody": "I've never made an Angel Food Cake before, but had whites from 10 eggs left over after making a flan, so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm in Aurora CO and was pretty happy to find a recipe the I wouldn't have to do all the math myself to adjust for altitude. I made the cake exactly as instructed, except for the cake flour &amp; lemon extract... I didn't have either. For the four, I used 1 1/3 all purpose flour minus 2 tlbs and 2 tsp ( that's 1 tsp short of 3 tlbs), and replaced it with cornstarch. I then sifted the flour/cornstarch mix 4 times (one short of the instructions I found on JoytheBaker's blog). Instead of the Lemon Extract, I used almond. I baked it in a tube pan with no lining or grease. I ran a knife along all the edges before removing the cake. It came out beautiful and delicious. Thanks for the recipe."

We just moved to Colorado Springs from Nebraska and the cake did not turn out ha! I never thought about the altitude … SO! We are around 800 feet higher. What do you recommend me to do to alter the recipe?!\n\nThanks! Happy Baking!"

"reviewBody": "Absolutely delightful! This is my first stab at angel food cake baking. I researched and tried a recipe two nights ago from Allrecipes.com and it was a huge dud. Coarse texture, almost tough and not good taste. I then made this recipe the next night and oh the difference. I live in Thornton, Colorado, a north suburb of Denver, so the high altitude is always a challenge for cake baking. This recipe, however, has been adapted for our altitude and was amazing. Rose well, light texture, amazing taste. I took it for my friend's birthday cake and the 5 of ate and ate. I also used a recipe from Allrecipes for buttercream icing that was incredible. It is now our new favorite cake recipe, bumping dark chocolate cake out of first place!"

I finished the batter and stuck the cake in the oven and while cleaning up the dishes, I came across 1/2 cup of egg whites that I had accidently omitted from the recipe!! It still came out great. I'm sure with the appropriate amount of egg whites, the cake would have been even lighter and fluffier; but, like I said it was still great. I did use almond instead of lemon, but I'm sure either would've been wonderful."

"reviewBody": "I also live in a high altitude area, one hour north of Denver. Baking desserts is sometimes precarious. Thanks for this exceptional recipe for Angel Food Cake. The directions were easy to follow. I was surprised how quicky the batter came together. The only little change I made was using 1/2 teaspoon almond extract rather than the lemon. Lo and behold this cake was moist, flavorful, and much more substantial than boxed or store bought Angel Food. I cooked up a cup of frozen raspberries, 1/2 cup sugar, and a tablespoon of cornstarch making a sauce to pour over the cake. My family loved it. This should do well in lower altitudes if the egg whites are whipped longer, and 1/4 cup less flour is used. This was my first attempt at home made Angel Food, and it turned out great!"
