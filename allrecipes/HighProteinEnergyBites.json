"reviewBody": "I really enjoyed this but I can only take one at a time. Instead of chocolate protein powder, I used vanilla protein powder mixed with cacao powder and I think that it worked really well. I also didn't have any coconut extract so I used vanilla extract. When I rolled the balls out, I did not put any cocoa powder on the outside and instead of making 30 one inch balls, it made about 60. I also used sweetened coconut flakes because I ran out of unsweetened coconut flakes. Last, I used pumpkin seeds that I broke up with a mortar and pestle instead of flax seeds. Even with these adjustments I found that they still turned out really well and are very worth making."

"reviewBody": "Made exacly as the recipe shows. I will absolutely make these again - Made for Daughters Volleyball Tournament - they were a great for an energy pick up the girls needed when they had to play four matches in a row at the end of the day. Made a huge difference in the team's energy level - All the teenaged girls LOVED them. And the parents that tried them as well were amazed how good they tasted. Made with \"Vega One\" protein power -due to a lactose issue with a team mate. I have been requested by the team manager to bring to every tournament for the remainder of the season. I think that that speaks volume to how good these were - Thank you Bonnie for sharing this excellent Recipe!!!!"

I made it into a ball and refrigerated it for about 30 min before making individual balls. I like how the cocoa is incorporated. My teens will love these!"

I froze them in the freezer for about an hour and then they get nice and hard and don't stick together quite as much. I will keep making these for sure!"

Finally, we found that cocoa was too bitter, so we rolled them in protein powder. Yummy!"

I also messed up and added the cocoa right into the mixture, rather than saving it to roll the balls in . . . oops! I made these at my son's request, and he likes them. He took a baggie full of them to the gym with him tonight. Thanks for the recipe!"
