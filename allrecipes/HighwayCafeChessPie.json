I made 2 of this pie for the 1st time today -- one for my family to \"test\", the other to bring to tomorrow's Thanksgiving gathering. So far? RAVES! (For whatever reason, my pies don't look all that much like the pics. At the same time, with 6 RAVES already on the scoreboard, I'm not going to ask any questions, lol)."

I used only one cup of raisins and half cup of walnuts (all I had), and boiled water to just pour over the bowl of raisins, rather than actively boiling the raisins. Worked great. Served with vanilla sauce, but next time I might serve with vanilla ice cream or caramel sauce."

I was worried it might not taste that great but it was wonderful. Everyone loved it. My mom even asked how to make it. This is not as sweet as a chess pie and I like it that way. My mom and I cut the sugar when making one anyway."
