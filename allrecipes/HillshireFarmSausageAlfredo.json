I added the toasted vegetables right after I stirred in the parmesan. It added so much flavor and was just delicious."

I uploaded a pic of it, of course, not as pic perfect as the original post, but it's perfect for me.\n So, here are my changes: I added peas &amp; carrots to the dish. I believe some Reviews mentioned the peas but I had a bag of peas &amp; carrots. It gave it some color. The other change was: I didn't have Cajun Seasoning (I have tried locating it in the stores but I guess it's a popular seasoning around here) so, I looked up ingredients that go into making the seasoning, threw it in a ziploc bag &amp; mixed it all well. This dish came out TERRIFIC!! Hubby loves it &amp; he said it's a KEEPER!!"

I did have some trouble getting the sauce to thicken, but because I was using extra pasta a lot of it was soaked up. I would suggest using extra pasta or maybe cutting back on the heavy cream. This recipe is definitely going to become a regular!"

I also put this all to the side before I made the sauce in the pan. In addition to the cream I added half a cup of milk. It was a huge hit with the whole family. This will definitely be added to the request list!"

And then I mix it all up in a pot with the already cooked pasta and the already browned sausage. 6 out of 6 people in the family LOVE it. I also add shrimp to it if I have it."

And at the end when mixing the cheese I had a 2 teaspoons of crushed red pepper because I like a little more kick. Mixed in the ingredients, let it rest for 3-4 mins and put on the organic green onion and diced tomatoes to finish for color and flavor. Wife and I love it. We will probably do it again."

I added a small amount of oil (less than 1 Tbsp) to the skillet and put in a chopped pepper along with the sausage slices so those could cook together. After those were ready I turned the heat down and added broccoli, put on the lid and let it heat (I used frozen because I didn't have time to use the fresh I had on hand - either one would work.) Instead of just plain pasta, I used 1 1/2 containers of cheese tortellini that I cooked separately. After the broccoli was heated. I added the tortellini to the skillet. I made the sauce as stated and added that to the skillet with all the other ingredients and mixed it well. My family and I really enjoyed it."

Then made the sauce as directed and added the sausage and pasta. I don't buy special spices like Cajun spice, mainly due to the excessive salt in them. I used the Cajun spice mix recipe on this site and scaled it down to yield the 2 t. needed for this recipe. My husband and I love things hot and spicy so I added a bit more cayenne. I used bow tie pasta...cute and tasty!"
