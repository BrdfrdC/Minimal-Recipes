I took all of the other ingredients, mixed them together and cooked till it started to reduce just a bit And then spooned it over the salmon and then cooked an additional minute so that it would glaze the salmon"

The writer of the recipe must have had thick filets or likes salmon very well done. I checked mine at 20 minutes and it was already past what I prefer for salmon, and starting to get on the dry side. Next time I will check it at 15 min."

However, I made it with 460g / 16 ounces of salmon as opposed to 170g / 6 ounces. \n\nEven so, there was more than enough sauce to cover the salmon to feed 4 people.\n\nMy family all enjoyed it! I adjusted by replacing the chilli garlic sauce with a teaspoon of sriracha and added an extra clove of garlic to make up for the lack of garlic sauce.\n\nVery tasty, but I might decrease the light soy sauce from 1/3 cup to 1/4 cup as it was a touch salty for our family's tastes, and we definitely enjoy salty food!"

I have to say that I already really liked hoisin/soy dishes, but those little bursts from the ginger and garlic flecks really added to the OMG of this dish. I had a thinner tail that had more sauce and it overpowered the salmon a bit, but on the normal thickness pieces there was a perfect harmony of salmon-sweet-heat-savory that makes this a stand out salmon option. I hope I can break myself away from this to expand my salmon experiences, but I doubt it."

The salmon had almost a buttery quality to it and I dont know if thats from the marinade or a lot of fat in the fish. I didn’t have any chili garlic sauce so opted for a “spicy” pepper sauce I had on hand. Overall I was pretty happy with the recipe and will definitely make it again!"

I used candied ginger which sweetened the overall flavor. I also used \"basic\" Siracha rather than the garlic chili sauce the recipe called for. I also used pre-squeezed lemon juice rather than juice from fresh lemons. I will be making this again for sure!\n\nUpdate: I just realized I read the recipe wrong. Used Worcestershire sauce instead of Hoisin. I would highly recommend this change."

Plus, I seared the salmon first on top of the stove in a large hot cast iron frying pan. Then I put the pan and all in the oven for 30 minutes, basting the fish every 10 minutes, and using the oven broiler on low during the last 5 minutes to give the fish a burnt top. The salmon steaks turned out beautiful, flaky, and delicious! Not too salty and not too sweet, but just right."

I think the spice level also detracted from that lovely flavor a piece of really good (and expensive!) salmon has. I made it again with fresh ginger, fresh garlic, soy, hoisin, a pinch of red pepper flakes and less than half of the recommended spicy sauce. It worked for us, and it might be more appealing to other small children that way. My kids and I loved this recipe, so thank you for posting it."

After marinating the fish, I grill it on a cedar plank over charcoal with the lid down. Until browned, I like the edges kinda crispy... And it is AWESOME!! You've got to try it!!!"

I have used just a minced up jalapeno or small tabasco pepper instead of the chili sauce, and added a little extra hoisin to make up for the loss of sauce. Plus I've used ground ginger when I didn't have any fresh available, and each time it still tastes awesome. It's become my favourite salmon recipe."

I also followed the suggestion to pour off the excess marinade before baking. That turned out to be a great idea otherwise it would've been too saucy. I plan on making it again but this time with less sodium."

"reviewBody": "This is fantastic! As an Alaskan, I'm always looking for tasty new ways to prepare salmon and this recipe just made it's way to the top of my rotation. I made a couple of small changes, but mostly followed the recipe to a T. I accidentally left out the olive oil, but now that I've made it without the olive oil, I can't imagine that it would be any better with it and would probably opt not to use it the next time I make this. I also added a little extra fresh grated Ginger and Garlic and I topped the dish with fresh chopped Cilantro and thinly sliced Scallions after it came out of the oven. My Husband and I both thought it was fantastic and even my super-picky kids ate some! I highly recommend this recipe!"

I made the following minor substitutions: (1)sesame oil for olive oil; (2) lime juice for the lemon; (3) Sambal Oelek chili paste instead of chili garlic sauce and then added an extra clove of diced garlic. I broiled the salmon for about 8 1/2 minutes and it came out great. I will definitely be making this again. My husband thought it was a little strong on the hoisin so I may reduce that slightly next time, but otherwise it was near perfect!"
