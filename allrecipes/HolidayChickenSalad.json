I also halved the celery stalks before chopping them for a more subtle celery flavor. I've added a small garlic clove for more flavor, with excellent results. I've also substituted walnuts for the pecans, and it worked beautifully. I like that this salad uses cubed chicken instead of shredded chicken. My whole family loves this salad, and it's been requested repeatedly for family gatherings."

I took the advice of another reviewer to soak the dried cranberries in water prior to putting them in and it was really great advice. It prevented them from taking in too much of the moisture from mayo/dressing, causing the salad to become too dry. It tastes great just after making it but it is even better 24 hours later. Thanks for the recipe!"

Didn't have green onions, so I used sweet onions, and red peppers instead of green peppers, and had craisins on hand so I used those. It was wonderful. The texture combination of the craisins, celery, chicken and pecans made it very interesting to eat. The flavor was wonderful. I'm sure it would be just as good with the original ingredients, but I was able to use what I had on hand with no problem. Will definitely use this recipe again, as it is now my new favorite chicken salad."

"reviewBody": "Our family really enjoys this recipe. I have made it a few times. We usually put it on green leaf lettuce and eat it like a wrap. Today I was missing the bell pepper, green onion, and we were short on the cranberries. In place, I used extra celery, and used dried cherries to have enough of the dried fruit. I usually make it AS is, and this is a great recipe. The only I recommend is if you need it to be lower sodium, you could cut the seasoned salt in half and it would be yummy, yummy in your tummy! IF you find it bland: 1. you need to let it set so the flavors can meld, 2. check your spices, they may be expired or open too long (spices lose their intensity/flavor over time. Also, it does not state what kind of paprika to use, so I use a smoked paprika."

"reviewBody": "Excellent Chicken Salad and easy to adjust to your liking. Easy to make and a wonderful balance of flavors. Even my husband enjoyed it and I thought he would not care for the cranberries and pecans! The only changes I made were using Just Mayo (I cannot have eggs), didn't have green onions and added a little chopped fresh chives. I used half the amount of pecans called for in the recipe and toasted them, and it was perfect amount for the chicken salad. Also used a red bell pepper as we do not care too much for green bell pepper. Next time I will use a little less cranberries though as it seemed a little too sweet for us. Hubs had his on a croissant and I used a gluten free tortilla wrap. This will definitely be kept in the rotation when we have some chicken to use up or during the summer months! Thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Awesome Excellent Great! Perfect ratios! Texture and taste everyone loved even kids! Used Big Boy seasoning salt as it has touch of curry which is great w/ fruit- was out of some ingredients so made these substitutions : No green pepper 1/2 tsp onion powder ( scallions) slivered almonds (pecans) and a small apple ( cranberries). Great for lunch or dinner ! This would be wonderful at a shower or brunch too! Simple yet lots of flavors!! Also for new cooks your brand of mayo makes a big difference they are NOT all the same - my grandma swore by Hellman's and so do I!! I used leftover chicken breast I had baked in parchment paper with Old Bay seasoning, garlic salt, and butter -"

But I liked it better when I used more celery, Bells seasoning instead of seasoning salt, and skipped the bell pepper. And it was phenomenal when I used leftover chicken from this site (Grilled rosemary chicken breasts by Semigourmet). I still have a bunch of that chicken leftover and I'm going to chop and freeze it so I have on hand next time I want this chicken salad. This recipe is fantastic!"

I made it the day before so the flavors would blend and it did taste even better than the day I made it. I used scallions instead of onion and added halved red seedless grapes as well. I used slivered almonds instead of pecans because it is what I had. I know this recipe would be delicious as stated, but I do think the grapes added something extra special. Because I was adding them I did increase the dressing recipe by 1/4 more. I have tried 2 other chicken salad recipes that wasn't what I was looking for but this one is a top notch recipe."

When coated add the rest of the dry ingredients. The dry ingredients get dressed but lighter. Their true flavors stand out and their colors pop. Beautiful and delicious!"
