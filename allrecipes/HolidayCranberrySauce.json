Instead of putting spices in cheesecloth I just placed the spices in the 1-1/2 c. water WITHOUT the cranberries and let the spices steep in the warm water on low for 10-minutes. Then I took out the spices and added the cranberries making the recipe as instructed. I think it adds more spice to the dish."

I threw in a lemon zinger tea bag that I opened and put in 1 1/2 tsp of ground cloves and then tied it shut with string and added 3 cinnamon sticks. The result was a great spicy not too sweet taste. Do heat the water before putting in the berries for a more gelled result"

I couldn't find allspice berries so I used 1/4 tsp of ground allspice. I made \"Cranberry Sauce Extraordinaire\" as well to compare the two of them. This is a true sauce the other one is more of a salad. We prefer this one over the Extraordinaire recipe. My 5 yr old gobbled this up!"

I did take everyone else's advice and brought the sauce to a boil first (it only makes sense). I also followed another person's advice and added some orange zest, which REALLY set the taste of the top. I did only add a couple of pinches though, so it wouldn't overpower the sauce. I will definitely be making again and not just for the holidays."

"reviewBody": "I've made this recipe twice now, once a few years ago for Christmas and again this year for my family on Christmas as well. \n\nBefore I made this sauce, i never really liked cranberry sauce. To me it was the nasty artificial looking canned sauce you buy at the store even if no one likes it. My family did this every year I grew up for both of the \"Christian\" holidays, Thanksgiving and Christmas. I saw the recipe and it sounded great so I thought I'd give it a try. As many other reviewers already stated, the sauce is delicious. The spices infused with the bursting berries add a complex and very seasonally appropriate flavor to a traditionally boring recipe in serious need of an update."

"reviewBody": "For most of my life, I *HATED* cranberry sauce. My dad, however, loved it. One year I went looking for recipes and found this one. Very simple to make, and smells delightful.\n\nI wiped up a bit that had spilled down the side of the container, and tasted that. Surprisingly tasty, bright and fresh and not too sweet. (I cut the amount of sugar like some other reviews.) Then I licked the spoon I'd stirred it with. I realized I'd fallen in love when I sat down with the cooking pot and a spoon to get every last drop of tart deliciousness. This recipe made me a cranberry convert!\n\nI make this every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. If you're an experimental cook, don't be afraid to play with it. Put the zest of one orange in it. Since you bought an orange, throw the juice in too, and add water to make the called-for volume. You can double the called-for amounts of spices if your tastes buds need a wake-up call. You can even throw a shot of pomegranate liqueur into it after you turn the heat down, which is DELICIOUS btw. I change it a little every year, and every year my family, friends, and coworkers clamor for more."

"reviewBody": "My husband bought two bags of cranberries that made 1.75 times the recipe. I made the recipe almost exactly as written, including the full amount of sugar. The cranberry sauce came out great. In my opinion, it needs the sugar to contra the sourness of the cranberries. It would be helpful if the recipe mentioned the length of the cinnamon sticks to be used. The ones that I have are 4\" in length, and the cinnamon flavor stands out in the finished cranberry sauce. It is still excellent, but I may use less cinnamon in the future. I did use orange juice instead of water as suggested by other reviewers, and brought the berries to a boil on a high temperature before turning it down to medium. I cooked it the suggested 20 minutes, added the sugar, and then cooked it an additional 10 minutes on a medium heat. It looked watery when it was done, but jelled as it cooled. This cranberry sauce is definitely better than any you can buy in the store, and you know what's in it. I might also mention that it was very easy to make."

"reviewBody": "After reading other reviews, I made a couple of adjustments: I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, as I prefer it tart, substituted OJ for part of the water, and added grated orange rind. Did not have allspice and so just skipped it. I think I might have added a tad of nutmeg instead. It was still delicious and I've already been asked for the recipe! It's a very forgiving recipe, so you can play around with it however you'd like, and it's pretty foolproof. One note on timing: I used very fresh organic berries, and they burst almost instantly."

I used a coffee filter and string from a teabag to submerge the spices. I also reduced the amount of sugar to 1 and a half cups of sugar. I'm not sure if I didn't cook it long enough, but many of the berries were still whole, and it was kinda watery, so maybe cook it longer? It will be a tradition from now on. No more canned stuff for us. It was so easy. The expensive part was buying the cloves and allspice berries, but now I have enough to make it again and again, so it works out."

Definitely more like 20 min to get the majority of berries to pop. First time I made it (last week) I put the cloves, cinnamon sticks, and allspice berries in and fished them out at the end. This time I emptied a tea bag, filled with cloves and allspice, and stapled shut; cinnamon sticks went in separately. Hoping this works as I don't even know where to buy a spice bag! Over 5 days I ate ALL of this by myself. I should be ashamed, but it's soooo good! I had it with pork, all by itself and poured over vanilla ice cream. ;-)"
