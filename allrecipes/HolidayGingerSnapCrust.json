By the time I was letting the cheesecake sit in the oven for an hour after turning it off, I fell asleep! And unfortunately, the top cracked like crazy. Maybe because I didn't get it into the fridge soon enough. I did opt to make the crust out of gingersnaps and I think that really elevated the flavor of the whole cake. The final product was very flavorful and I would probably make it again, but would want to figure out how to avoid the cracking. Ultimately, I just covered the cracks with homemade whipped cream and a sprinkle of nutmeg. ;)"

"reviewBody": "For Thanksgiving this year, I made a Molasses-and-Spice Pumpkin Pie and I didn't want to make a plain ol' pie crust (I don't enjoy making pie crusts), so after exploring LOTS of recipes, I opted for this one. I pulsed a whole (5.25 oz) box of Anna's Ginger Thins in my food processor, cut the butter to 5 tablespoons, and pressed the mixture into four (big) ramekins (because I also made a pecan crust). Amidst the multi-tasking Thanksgiving prep, I forgot to pre-bake the crusts before filling the ramekins, so I just baked them at 350 (placed ramekins on a cookie sheet) until the filling was done. Next time I would pre-bake (to add crispiness), but everyone still enjoyed the unique twist on pumpkin pie. I didn't have any problems with excess grease, but it may be because I used Anna's instead of a heavier gingersnap. I would love to try this crust with a Banana Cream Pie!"
