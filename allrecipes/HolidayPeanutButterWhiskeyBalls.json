The fridge again after rolling. Only thing differently I did was drizzle white chocolate over the tops. That was the key. Wry tasty and cannot wait to make these again. Theyâ€™re strong and the recipe makes a lot. Great as a gift for the holidays. To me theyâ€™re also sweet so half of one for me goes a long way. Thank you for posting"

"reviewBody": "These are delicious! I used 1/2 vanilla wafers and 1/2 chocolate teddy grahams to make them chocolaty. To those who said they were crumbly, try adding a bit more peanut butter (I used 3 heaping spoonfuls) and blend everything right in your food processor. Blending the ingredients in the processor helps everything to stick together better. I also rolled these in small bite-sized balls and got about 40 from this recipe."

"reviewBody": "It is awesome. Tastes like Reese's Peanut Butter cups with a kick. I had to halve the peanuts because I did not want to risk my husband having any difficulty with the nuts. He has to be careful, so I ground them up really, really fine, and used half the amount. I doubled the peanut butter to compensate. I even had some really old whiskey around, and I used that in order to NOT have to go to the store for special peanut butter flavored whiskey. I figured with the extra peanut butter, I did not need it. But they turned out absolutely fabulous!!!! Truly, these are to die for."
