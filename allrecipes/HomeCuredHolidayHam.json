I then put it in my Big Green Egg with some cherry wood for smoke. Fantastic. I’ve cured several hams over the years, as I live in Italy and they just aren’t available as in the US. This will be my go to recipe from now on!! See Instagram @Thecookingcolonel."

I followed your recipe for the brine exactly, but I cooked it differently, using an Instant Pot instead of an oven, but glazing under the broiler, and making my pineapple glaze that I am used to. But I incorporated the mustard. I didn't think it would turn out as tasty as a holiday ham but I was wrong! It is better than store-bought without a doubt. My family is all going ballistic as I type this, and our 4.25lb. pork shoulder is going to be gone by tomorrow night for sure! 5 stars plus, and thank you for making our night!"

"reviewBody": "This is perfect. It is nearly the perfect amount of salt. After reading the reviews and doing my own calculations from the weight of most hams made, I came up with 2.5% salt content. This is equilibrium brining. Those that say is this was a ridiculous amount of salt have been doing dry brining. When wet brining, you add the weight of the pork and water and multiply it by the percentage of salt you want. I have seen anywhere from 2 to 7%. I think most that use Equilibrium brining shoot for 2%."

The butt is a much better cut of meat and makes a nice presentation.\nSecond I would leave the meat in the cure an extra day for a 8lb. ham longer for a larger one, so that the entire center is cured. I also soaked 1 day in water to reduce the saltiness."

"reviewBody": "First time to try to cure a ham...\nI used the rear leg HAM part ABOUT 8 LBS and followed he directions... I used 3 cups of pineapple juice as part of the brine.. fresh sea salt.. cane sugar and the spices mentioned. \nAfter cure, I did the clean water soak overnight 9-10 hours \nI also used the glaze recipe mentioned \nMy cook was on my Akorn Egg BBQ with 350F and 425F as in the recipe and using pecan chucks for smoke. 3-4 hours total time\nIt turned out great! I did have a very small uncured area in the center of my ham .. so I will increase the cure time next time by a day. Flavor and texture is wonderful.. saltiness is perfect for our tastes and the slight taste and sweetness of the pineapple juice is barely present but nice. The smokiness is in the outer layer and the fat maybe 1/2 in. I love pecan wood for smoking and use it in my bacon recipe also."

"reviewBody": "I made this with 2 pork loins, and have been making bacon and Canadian Bacon for some time. BUT the salt and cure levels are RIDICULOUSLY HIGH. Normal curing uses the EQ method. A seven pound piece of meat should use, in a brine ... just over 1/2 ounce of cure. The salt should be ... 5 ounces of salt. This is CRAZY high. Pink salt or curing salt is toxic to humans but is not present in finished, cured meats in a high enough dose to cause illness or death."

As he hinted at in the video, I cooked this on my gas grill with hickory wood chips to give a nice smokey flavor to the ham. Also, I didn't have any maple syrup for the glaze so I used honey instead. The only thing I would change next time would be to put it in a roasting bag for the brining process to help keep down the mess when I move the tub around in the fridge. I will be doing this one again in the future."

I was able to brine both butts in same large ss stock pot. I brined for 3 days then rinsed in fresh water for about 15 min. I tied the butts. I smoked the 9lb butt in my Masterbuilt electric smoker at 275F with Hickory chips until it reached 150F, about 2.5hrs. I baked the other 8lb butt in the oven as per recipe but without star anise, instead used ground cloves and cinnamon. The verdict: Both were super juicy, but everyone thought the smoked butt was FANTASTIC. The baked butt ended up tasting salty but still OK. Next time I will rinse in fresh water for longer. As for the sauce, I used Hazelnut syrup instead of Maple and it was also Fantastic. Thanks for the recipe."

"reviewBody": "I have enjoyed preparing Easter dinner for the past 16 years. I seek out a good ham, not smoked, as local as possible, with some pretty good results. This year I purchased 1/2 pig to support a friend's new farm endeavor, and therefore had a leg of pork. I did not want it smoked, so fresh ham it was. I followed this recipe, no changes, and it was the most delicious ham I have ever served up at our family Easter dinner. The flavor is complimentary to the meat, but not overpowering. I did pick up a meat injector for about $4, and injected the brine evenly through the leg of pork before brining. I would recommend doing this. After brining I did the coldwater soak for about 6 hours, and the salt level was just about perfect to my taste. I don't like overpowering salt flavor. I served the maple honey glaze on the side, it went well with everything, from the ham to the potatoes to shrimp! Try this recipe, homemade is amazing!"
