I added an extra tsp of Worcestershire, 2 tbsp Molasses, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder, and used dark soy sauce instead of the salt and cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. Then I brought everything to a simmer until it thickened. Next time I'll also use less water and only 1 cup of sugar."

AND IT WAS BLAND. It tasted like ketchup. So, I added 1 Tsp Chili Powder 1 Tsp Cumin 1 Tsp Hickory-Flavored Liquid Smoke Flavoring 1/2 TSP Garlic Powder 1/$ TSP Onion Powder It was not \"Great\" but without these changes it was not edible"

"reviewBody": "This is a delicious recipe. I followed it as written and doubled it as I used it to based 5 pounds of rib tips. I have a review for the oven bake rib tips from the same website with pictures. The only adjustment I made is that I added a tablespoon of blackstrap molasses as I love the taste of molasses. I reduced the brown sugar by 1/2 cup and used coconut sugar instead. I did not taste the difference. I also added an extra tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce because I like the flavor of it. I saw where one reviewer added a dash of liquid smoke which I will do the next time. This is a delicious rich and thick (from boiling for 5-7 minutes. The flavors are enhanced from the boiling. After it cools I put it in a cleaned empty 32 oz squeeze ketchup bottle. My sister uses it to squeeze on tater tots and says it’s the best. I will likely not buy bottled barbecue sauce again after I use up what I have on hand."

Brushed on olive oil then covered with Al foil. Bake at 250 deg F for 2-3 hrs. Remove ribs and pour off the fat and water. Cover with sauce then loosely cover with foil - about 1/2 hr at 250 the lower to 200. Ribs come out moist and delicious. I substituted apple cider vinegar and used sriracha sauce (3 tsp)."

So I made the following changes for an upgraded version: reduced brown sugar to 3/4 cup (dark brown) and reduce water from 1/2 cup to a few tablespoons. I also sauteed some diced yellow onion, garlic and serrano pepper in a pan and added it to the mixture. I then simmered everything together on low heat and used an immersion blender to get rid of the chunks."

I’m not sure why others said to cook it.. bbq sauce is supposed to be ooey and gooey besides it cooks when you put it on your meats so why would I add work to my dinner? Thank you so much for this recipe"

"reviewBody": "It’s a great base but is far too sweet for me. If you love really sweet sauces, you’ll love this sauce and probably not want to make changes - provided you also like vinegar. I’ll try again using less sugar and maybe even use tomato sauce in place of ketchup. The vinegar is on the upper end of the spectrum, though I like vinegar-based sauces, so it is fine for me in that sense.\n\nI took a risk of adding a teaspoon each of garlic and onion powder to dial up the flavor a bit. These turned out to be great additions. The sauce is probably fine without them, however.\n\nI use white pepper in place of black pepper in sauces because it keeps the sauce smooth and free of specks. The flavor profile is pretty close the same and probably impossible for most people to tell the difference. It just takes less white pepper because it is ground so fine.\n\nAs for cooking, simmering for a while is a must. I brought the sauce to just below a boil and backed off the heat and let it simmer gently for an hour. Be sure to whisk or stir constantly during the initial heating and periodically thereafter. This stuff will get gummy and burn if left alone on high heat."

When preparing my second batch I added 1 tbsp of soy sauce, 1tsp of powdered ginger and 1/2 tsp of cumin.\nOverall, this a great go to for me. I will no longer purchase bottled BBQ Sauces.\nThanks for a great recipe."

Everyone raved about the barbecue and I think the sauce is what made it. I followed the recipe but changed the paprika to smoked paprika. I added a small amount of liquid smoke. I read others reviews and I did not put it in the blender but boiled it for about a minute to let the flavors come together. The next day I let it get hot in the crock pot and then kept it on warm which also blended all the flavors. This will be my go to recipe for barbecue sauce."

"reviewBody": "This sace is great! I'm 13 and when my mom asked me to make bbq sauce for our ribs, I totally freaked. I thought, what'll be good that won't take FOREVER??? But then I found this recipe and was like woah. All I have to do is chuck it all in the blender? I even read it a few times to make sure I wasn't missing something. My family and I loved it and this is now our go-to recipe for bbq sauce. Perfect amount of sweetness and spice for me. Just a quick note, we didn't have any red wine vinegar, so I used equal parts apple cider vinegar and red wine. Macy, you might want to try this if you found that there was too much vinegar for you. I'm not a huge vinegar fan myself, and the way I did it wasn't very vinegary. Anyway, it was delicious. THANK YOU @JRNEUMILLER!!!!"

Since it's just for me I only used a splash of vinegar, and 1/4 of everything here in a pot on very low heat and added more to taste as needed. My Mom would say you can always add but not take away, so if you're unsure, reduce vinegar, worcesthire etc, and add more as needed. I also added a smigde of olive oil. Tastes better heated as others have said."

"reviewBody": "I started with this \"as is\" but found it is very sweet. Maybe it is a Canadian thing but I like my bbq sauce a little less sweet and a bit smokey similar to Bulls Eye Hickory. So after tasting this as per the recipe, I threw it in a pot and heated it, added some chili powder, more salt, more hot sauce (used Franks Red) and found the added saltiness and heat to balance out the sugar, then added probably a good teaspoon or more of liquid hickory smoke. It ended up way more to our personal tastes. I love this recipe as it is a great base to personalize from. Like other recommendations, if you don't like sweet sauces probably just reduce the amount of sugar or ketchup. If you make it as is and it isn't quite right, experiment with it. Thank you for posting it! It saved me another last minute trip to the grocery store."

For the BBQ sauce: I used a little less sugar and cayenne pepper instead of the paprika since I did not have the latter. I also omitted the hot sauce. I will never buy a BBQ Sauce thanks to this!"

Also the red wine vinegar can be overwhelming for some, I swapped out for apple cider vinegar for the second batch and it let the other flavours come through more, but it doesn't have the same sharpness to it. That tanginess can help balance the sweetness if you've low and slow bbq'd the ribs with a sugar-based rub."

I ended up by using 1\\2 cup of brown sugar and 8 teaspoons of Frank's original hot sauce. I also simmered it for 1 minute which thickened the sauce and enhanced the flavors. I have been trying to do d a recipe that mimics the wing sauce from my favorite wing estaurant. This recipe is the closest I have ever gotten. When my husband gets home I will ask him what he thinks and I may bump up the hot sauce a bit more. Really good. Better then any bottled sauce out there!"
