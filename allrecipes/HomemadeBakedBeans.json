I will never understand the purpose of \"draining and rinsing\" only to turn around and then add flavorless water, but I did add 1/2 cup of water as called for, but the beans came out very thin. I think next time I would not drain beans and cook uncovered to allow some thickening of liquid. It was otherwise very flavorful, and I am not a huge baked bean fan."

It's great as is, however, I like to double the beans and just use a combination of whatever beans I have on hand (usually pinto and black beans) and I add an extra 1/2 C of water. I also don't crisp the bacon, just cook it until it's lightly browned, since I don't like sharp bits in my beans."

I honestly could not have made it as good as i did if it wasnt for the comments about how the cup of water made it too soupy. That's the only thing i omitted and it came out great. I know i am going to be making this again in the future."

"reviewBody": "Very good recipe. I have so many canned white beans and not so many recipes for them. I did make a few small changes. I used raw honey (2 tbsp) in place of molasses (I didn't have it), omitted the bacon(low fat diet) and water, used 1/2 c. brown sugar instead of 3/4 c. I sauteed the onions with cooking spray in a 3 qt. pot and mixed in the rest of the ingredients. I decided to bring to a boil, then simmer on very low heat for 2 hours. The beans came out fantastic. Great flavor. Will definitely add to my go to sides."

This time I cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and the water to 1/4 cup. I also added a little extra ketchup and molasses. The recipe was great, I just like my beans a little less sweet. Both times the turned out great!"

I did alter the recipe a smidge though---I substituted onion powder for the fresh onions (since my husband can't handle the real thing), I only used 2 tablespoons of molasses since other reviews state it was a bit too sweet with 3, and I didn't put the bacon in it because I was all out. Even with these changes, this recipe was easy to make and very delicious!"

I also added an additional can of beans and cut the water down a little bit. It was still a little soupy after cooking longer than recommended. If you want it a bit drier, definitely plan on more time. Overall, pleased with the products and the bacon cooking is the most time consuming."

"reviewBody": "The ingredients in this recipe are exactly what we've used in my family for generations, so I thought I'd give using canned beans a try! (PS. My dog said he didn't give out the recipe! LOL) I used Goya Small White beans which eliminated the traditional process of soaking, boiling, etc. Also, because the canned beans are precooked, the actual bean pot to table time was considerably less. Great short cut! Glad I tried it! Thanks Mariap430!"

"reviewBody": "The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars, is because I needed to adjust the ketchup and molasses. Made as written, it was too bland for my taste. I'm not sure how much I adjusted; I just kept adding until it tasted correct. I too lessened the water and brown sugar to 1/2 cup each. I also sauteed the onion in some bacon fat for some added flavor. With my adjustments, we loved it."

"reviewBody": "I submitted this version and what I created originally does not show 1 cup water. Perhaps that was added by Allrecipes when it was published. That would definitely make it too soupy in my opinion. One tip is that I often use the pre-cooked bacon and it works just as well and saves a step."

"reviewBody": "Very good basic recipe, and I liked that it didn't call for a can of pork and beans/baked beans in the ingredients like so many others! I made this for the 4th of July when I realized at the last minute that I didn't have any canned beans to have with dinner. I used 2 cans pinto beans (because that's what I had on hand), substituted honey for the molasses (because we didn't have any), reduced the brown sugar to 1/2C. and omitted the bacon because I didn't want to wait for it to thaw. I didn't have time to bake them, so I cooked them on the stovetop for about 40 minutes while waiting for my husband to cook the hot dogs. Next time I will definitely do them in the crock pot or oven as the beans were a little too firm. But the flavor was PERFECT!"

BUT...too sweet for us, also a little watery - the latter is surprising as I baked it uncovered and for longer than called for. We will cut the brown sugar in half, will compensate by adding a little more molasses. Also will cut the water in half. I baked it longer than called for because we like a \"crust\"."
