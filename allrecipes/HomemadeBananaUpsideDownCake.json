"reviewBody": "I made the recipe as instructed. The only changes I made were to add a bit of fresh ground nutmeg (because I like it), and I could only fit 2 cut bananas for the topping. The cake was still hot after 30 minutes, but I inverted it anyway, and it came out fine. I did have to scrape some of the remaining topping from the pan, and spread it back over the cake, but otherwise all remained intact. I think this make a great cake even without the sugar/banana topping."
