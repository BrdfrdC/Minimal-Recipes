I change it up every time I make it now, usually leaving out potatoes, adding mushrooms, red wine, garlic, and egg noodles. It’s always a winner. Note: you can get the stew done in less time using an instant pot or other pressure cooker. Do the first step with a 15 minute pressure cook and 15 wait before releasing steam. I’ve done this with tougher cuts of meat and they’ve come out great."

"reviewBody": "I enjoyed this recipe I made a few minor adjustments I brown my meat in a skillet first until each side has a nice crust then I cook my celery in the same pan using the oils remaining from the meat until transparent. I don’t like crunchy celery in my food I added a can of diced tomatoes and juice Then I added my potatoes to the same skillet with the celery and a slice of butter to brown my potatoes a tad. It prevents them from turning into mush and adds great flavor. I use a tablespoon of the flour mixture I made to sear my meat, a tablespoon of the oil from my skillet 3 tablespoons of water mixed well and added it all to the pot and cooked on low for an additional 2 hours. I omitted corn starch Great hearty flavor Great thickness to gravy Very savory and meat extremely tender. Total cook time 3 hours"

If you're worried about your potatoes falling apart from over cooking, leave the skins on and just cube them."

It ended but being a soup, not stew. The required one hour was not enough time for the celery to cook, but the meat was super tender (because it had been boiled for two hours). The seasonings were basic, it made the house smell good but the flavor was lacking. This is a good starter stew recipe - but needs several adjustments."

I cannot edit my review so I am leaving a new one. \n\nAlthough I felt like I had to add a lot more cornstarch and leave it sit for a few hours to thicken up, I have to say, this has PHENOMENAL flavor so I feel I should give it another star. Not sure if the flavor is from leaving it sit and cook for a few hours or if it would have tasted the same if I didn't.\n\nJust know that as the recipe is written, it is a soup. It's liquid. After adding several more tsps of cornstarch, it thickened."

"reviewBody": "This stew is simmering on the stove right now, so I can’t fully rate it yet, but it smells really good! The reason I’m commenting is because I have noticed many people saying the stew wasn’t thick enough. I just noticed the recipes says to add the cornstarch/water mixture prior to the second hour of simmering. I think this may be part of the problem. You see, cornstarch is a great thickener, but if boiled/simmered too long, it can actually break down and lose its thickening ability. My suggestion is to wait until the last 10 minutes of cooking to add the cornstarch/water mixture. That will give the perfect amount of time to thicken the stew without the danger of it breaking down. This is what I plan to do when mine is almost done cooking. I will report back to comment on the final result!"

Standard stew meat from the store is a combo of who-knows-what cuts of extra meat the butcher ends up with; this is no way to select stew meat that will be certain to end up tender! Get a round roast and trim excessive fat, leaving a fair amount for flavor, and cut into desired size cubes.\nReally good recipe in original form. I have adjusted it over many trials to this:\nInstead of beef bullion, I use 4 tsp of Better than Bullion Beef Base and 1 tsp of Better than Bullion Roasted Garlic base. HUGE improvement for stews!\n\nI also add:\n1 tsp of smoked paprika\n1 Tbsp Worcetershire\n1 tsp dried thyme\n1 turnip, cubed to 1/2” +/-\n1 can sweet peas\n1 Tbsp ketchup (a squeeze from a tube of tomato paste is better if you have it)\n1 Tbsp of a good vinegary hot sauce such as Pickapeppa (I use a locally made sauce called Bustellos, but it’s no longer made and all but impossible to find any more-I have a case)\n1/2 cup good pinot noir\n\nI coat the meat in a mixture of flour and all the dry seasonings and brown in a cast iron skillet until a good crust appears on the surface. Deglaze the pan with the wine and some of the water to get all the tasty crunches in the pan!"

I add additional spices of garlic powder or minced garlic, onion powder, 3 dried bay leaves and Kitchen Bouquet. We like a lot of veggies so I add more than this recipe calls for. To thicken I use flour for a better texture, IMO. If I still want it thicker, I add potato flakes."

"reviewBody": "Loved this! Pretty much followed the #1 reviewer with flour, onion and garlic powders, and pepper on the beef before browning. I used Better Than Bouillon (roasted beef) in place of the cubes, and used one quarter of total liquid to be merlot wine and the rest water. Threw in a good pinch of herbes de Provence, along with extra rosemary. Simmered for about 1 1/2 hrs. Added a few red potatoes, carrots, and celery in about 1 inch pieces, along with about 1/2 onion chopped. Added a few shakes of Worcestershire, and a big dollop of concentrated tomato paste (from a tube). Wow, tasted the sauce before covering it and it was delicious! I don’t know if it was the Merlot, the Better than Bouillon or what, but it was sooo flavorful, unlike my usual slow cooker stews with canned broth. I won’t go back to those anymore!!! This is THE beef stew I want to make always. Maybe I’ll throw in pearl onions and mushrooms next time."

There's a carrot shortage where I am so we used frozen peas and carrots. I added beef flavored Better than Bouillon (2 heaping tablespoons' full), some Compton's Gravy Salt, gravy browning, worcestershire and a few teaspoons of tomato paste. For thicknesd, I left it in the Instant Pot on the slow cooker setting for seven hours but I think six would be ideal. I understand some people don't like recipe modifications but I do. So enjoy."

I did follow the suggestions below the recipe and I halved the recipe so I used a tablespoon of flour along with spices to coat 1 lb of stewing beef before it was browned. I browned the beef and added gravy cubes to the water along with 1/2 cup red wine to simmer for an hour. I used the vegetables in the recipe and added a cubed baby eggplant which I had in the fridge. One of the best stews I’ve had and will definitely be making this again."
