I cook them on the grill on some oiled foil but I'm sure they would be fine baked too."

I used 2 tsp of a standard chili sauce as that is what I had on hand and 2 eggs were needed. I followed the instructions to mix but once all ingredients together I once more put all in the food processor for a few seconds. As others did in the reviews I made my 4 patties on parchment paper and put in the freezer for 1/2 hour before grilling. They tasted great and presented well. Made twice and this last time had black beans in the refrigerator that I had cooked a previous day that I used. Using my cooked beans they were easier to patty but tasted the same as when I used the canned. Thanks for sharing this healthy burger recipe."

It definitely needs less food processor mixing and more bread crumbs or oatmeal or something to make it thicker."

Instead of breadcrumbs, I blended a cup of oats ....When the veggies cooled, I mixed them with the beans in a food processor. Then, with my clean hands, I mixed it all together with the oats, beaten egg, a bit of flax seed, a couple dashes of worcestershire sauce and a couple tablespoons of picante sauce.... a bit more kosher salt and pepper....covered and put in the fridge to fry later......it seems to stick together just fine and can't wait to try it !

I was hesitant to add to much bread crumbs so I wouldn‚Äôt make it so dry. It looked and tasted great but the texture threw us all off completely. I should have listened to the one review when they said let the beans dry and drain (strain) the wet ?ingredients. Not doing that added to much moisture. We will try it again but following these extra tips then I‚Äôll see if my family will not disown me."

Didn't squeeze out a ton of moisture from the pepper/onion mix and it still worked well. Added a couple shakes of Worcestershire sauce when I whisked the eggs. Eyeballed a combo of panko, bread crumbs and French fried onions until the whole mix became the texture I wanted. Divided the mixture in half added a handful of parmesan and made 4 patties and baked. Made the other 4 patties and pan fried with a little canola oil. Both versions turned out wonderfully! Made my burger with fresh spinach, tomato, raw onion, guacamole and chipotle mayo. Served with baked sweet potato rounds. Yum!"

I didn't use as much chili powder as indicated, added some salt and also added an extra egg. I put them in the freezer and then grilled them on tin foil. I would make them again."

"reviewBody": "Wonderful as is, but here are a few tips that worked for me (personal preferences): 1. Don't mash the beans. 2. Finely mince the vegetables, adding one medium carrot. 3. Saute the veggies and spices in 1 TB oil (this allows the spices to 'bloom' for a more intense flavor). 4. Use 2 eggs. 5. Use panko bread crumbs. 6. Freeze burgers between pieces of waxed paper. 7. Bake at 375 degrees for 10 minutes per side. 8. Serve with plain or spicy mayonnaise. Nutritious, economical, and appealing to vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!"

The trick was to chop up the veggies and then squeeze out all the excess water from the pepper and onion in a paper towel before putting it into the mixture. Instead of the smoky cumin and chili powder five, I used a little Italian vinaigrette with dried oregano, basil, and smoked paprika. It came out amazing, the entire family devoured it! I will definitely be remaking with canned kidney beans next week!"

I used rolled oats rather than breadcrumbs to make them gluten free and baked them a few minutes longer than recommended per side to crisp up their outer surface before flipping them over. I may try more beans or oats to make them less wet. I will make these again."

Pop those patties onto a baking sheet lined w. parchment paper and straight into the freezer. Cooked from frozen on the bbq and they're divine. Like, even if you're not vegetarian you'll love putting one of these on the bun WITH your burger. So flavourful."

We added corn (a little too much though - next time we will use less) and didn‚Äôt measure the bread crumbs. Just added a bit at a time until the consistency felt right. We also used not as much cumin and chili powder. Maybe a little more than 1/2 tbsp. The full amount just seemed too much. It was just right for us. But I think I will play around with the flavorings. Maybe do bbq sauce instead of sweet chili and play with the spices to see what creations we can make. Thanks for sharing. This was yummy!!!"

The other problem I experienced was that the outside cooked great, but the inside of the burger was still soft. I think the temperature should be dropped and they should cook a little longer. \nI modified this recipe. The original was not right for me. I doubled the bread crumbs and I also added some Oats to the mix. This allowed me to be able to stiffen them up to form them. I placed the on a lightly oiled pan, but the still stuck to the pan when turning over. \nOverall they were not bad. Another learning experience was that next time I will not go light on seasoning. I added extra spices than given because of my taste, and it was not enough. They were good, but needed more flavor. \nNext time I will also add a little cheese to the mix. This will help with binding the burgers and will add additional flavor."
