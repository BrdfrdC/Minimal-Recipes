"reviewBody": "This was very delicious, however, as other reviewers suggested, we omitted the sugar and spiced it up quite a bit with green tobasco. We also omitted the salt because we wanted to keep it low sodium, used low sodium tomato juice, and we blended about 1/4 C. real onion and one very large clove of garlic in place of the powders. It was fantastic but because of all the changes we made I gave it 4 stars. My favorite thing about the recipe is there was NO CELERY!! This is our new favorite recipe for this mix for sure."

I did reduce sugar based on another review since I'm not a fan of sweet either, but I may try it as is next time upon the request of others."

Everyone really liked it and I will definitely make it again instead of buying pre-made. I don't like my bloody Mary's very spicy so this was perfect. For my guests who wanted more spice, we just added it to their glass."

"reviewBody": "We like our bloody marts spiced up, so there was a lot of hot sauce added to the mix. I find that I'm liking things less and less sweet these days, and the one that I didn't care for in this mix was the sugar. I would reduce to a tsp or totally eliminate sugar in the future to suit our tastes. Definitely made a vibrant and refreshing drink, so thanks Nolimit for posting your recipe."
