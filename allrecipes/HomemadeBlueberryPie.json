"reviewBody": "Just made this for Christmas Eve, and it was a hit with everyone! I followed this recipe down to a tee, but one change that I made that I absolutely recommend is adding lemon juice. It does a phenomenal job of bringing out the flavor of the blueberries, and the pie has a nice tangy and tart taste as a result. I squeezed the juice of at least one lemon and strained the juice with a sieve. After the dry ingredients are mixed in with the blueberries, I poured in two tablespoons of the lemon juice into the mixture and folded it all in with a rubber spatula. Then I left it to set for at least an hour (the longer the better) before baking as directed to have the blueberries absorb all of the flavors. I hope this helps!"

I used just over 4 TB corn starch. I substitute sugar with erythritol, 1 to 1 , and it tastes very natural and not too sweet. It set beautifully and sliced well. Will definitely keep this recipe ."

Used 5 cups of fresh blueberries instead of 4 cups Used 6 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of only 3 tbsps Used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup. Was right mix of tart and sweetness (not too sweet) Cooked at 400 for 45 minutes. Edges did turn brown. Think next time, I'll try @ 375 degrees for 50 minutes I let it cool for several hours."

I’m new to fruit pies/thickeners and didn’t know this: I got frustrated with the initial “runny”ness of it. I then read other blueberry pie recipes and learned such. PATIENCE with letting it cool/congeal. And I would use less sugar. A personal preference."

I upped the sugar to 1 cuo, added a little more blueberries (fresh) since I was using a store-bought deep dish pie crust, 5 T cornstarch and 2 T bottled lemon juice, baked on a cookie sheet for 1 hour at 375° quick bake setting, turning the pie a few times for even browning. I would do everything exactly the same next time except I would not increase the amount of the blueberries since this one oozed blueberries all over the place and there were still tons inside. Be sure to use a cookie sheet! I also made blueberry frozen yogurt while I was at it and that also came out fantastic! Thank you! I will definitely be saving this recipe."

I heeded the advice of others to increase the cornstarch to 4 tbsp. I also added 1/4 tsp of coriander power in lieu of the cinnamon I then added 1/2 of a lemon and all of the zest. I think next time I’d macerate the fruit in the sugar for an hours and then add the rest. After dotting with butter, I baked at 425 for about 1 hour and then dropped the temp to 375 for 15 more minutes. Fruit had nicely set and wasn’t dry either."

I also buttered the pie tin to prevent the crust from sticking. I baked at 375 on the center rack for 50 minutes in my conventional oven, allowed it to cool and it set beautifully even at room temperature. If you have a convection oven (where the air/heat is circulating in the oven reduce the temperature to 350 and the cook time will change). Lastly, I egg washed the top crust to give it that nice shine. Happy baking."

I used pre-made pie crust bought from the store. \n\nI coated the blueberries in the sugar mixture by carefully folding them together to get a better coating and spread of sugar. After adding the blueberries to the crust, any remaining sugar mixture that didn’t stick I poured over top. \n\nCreated a lattice and had extra dough so I added the bow. \n\nMy husband and I both loved it."

In my past experience, I've always baked my fruit pies by starting out with a preheated oven at 425° for 15 minutes, then I turn the heat down to 375° or so for the remaining cooking time. Just my opinion but I have found that using this method has always resulted in a beautiful, brown, and flaky crust"

I'm staying in my guest house while the other house is built and I'm short on counter space. I bought Walmart's Great Value frozen blueberries, frozen deep-dish pie shell, and refrigerated ready to bake pie crust for the top. I let the crusts get to room temp. I used 5 cups of frozen blueberries (not thawed) and 5 TB cornstarch. I added an extra tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and 2 TBs of lemon juice. I baked it on a cookie sheet on the lower shelf for 15 minutes at 400 degrees and the lowered it to 375 for another 45 minutes. I let it set 2 1/2 hours and it was perfect. No runny mess! The crust was flaky and crisp on the bottom. It was delicious!! I will make this again for sure! Very easy!!!"

Finally, brushing the top crust with egg yolk and then sprinkling cinnamon sugar over it really gave the crust a delicious flavor and a nice gradient of texture."

I let it sit before cutting - at least 6 hours, and I refrigerated it for some of that time. I think that helped it hold together (as so many here complained that it was too runny). Family LOVED it. I do recommend putting a baking sheet under the pie; my crust didn't seem to be browning very fast so I removed the sheet - the juices promptly heated to bubbling and spilled all over my oven (my own fault, obviously - just a warning!)."

One thing I learned is that I should put the lattice strips closer together so I’ll have more crust on top and so it’ll keep most of the goodness inside. I put a little extra blueberries in mine and had a bit of a mess drip over into my oven. Next time I might not lattice the top to keep all the blueberries inside. It was still delicious!
