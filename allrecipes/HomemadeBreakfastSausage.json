I want to be able to taste the maple and garlic so I may delete the liquid smoke all together."

We combined the pork with ~25% mutton that we had in the freezer and it was honestly some of the best sausage I've ever had. We omitted the red pepper flakes from the main recipe, for the sake of the kids, but I add it back to my own portions before I cook it. This is our new go-to recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I think this is a very good starter recipe which can be easily adapted to your personal taste.\nAs with other reviews I believe there is too much salt in this recipe. For my own personal taste I would add more sage for a breakfast sausage. I used cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes. I cut the meat down to fit my meat grinder. I added more fat because my loin was very lean. Good sausage needs a certain amount of fat. I then added the spices and mixed well.bi have heard that the spices are more evenly distributed when added before grinding. I also added a half cup of water because the last time I made sausage it was tough. This sausage has a very good texture and flavor. There is just a hint of heat from the cayenne pepper. Which is fine for me. I like a taste of pepper but I don't wish to be burned. If you like spicy sausage you will need to increase both the black pepper (unless you are using fresh ground) and cayenne. I made a 5lb batch. I also added a small amount of blackened seasoning."

I added the meat, water and seasoning and let it cook down. Taste really good. Then used the left over liquid and added cabbage and red onion. So good. i guess this is an early St. Patrick's day brunch. Blessings..."

"reviewBody": "I've made this several times now and it's pretty good. There's a couple things though... First, to improve the flavor add 1 or 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar. It helps bring everything together. I also like to let everything cure in the fridge at least over night before cooking. But, the real issue is actually the type of pork you're using. Typically ground pork from the grocery store doesn't have enough fat in it for sausage. The stuff I get is, surprisingly, marked at 85/15 and my research shows an 80/20 mix is better for sausage. I may just break out the meat grinder and pick up a shoulder roast to see if I can get a better texture AND taste."

Since then I am happier with it by doubling the sage, leaving out the brown sugar, and added a tablespoon of canola oil to make it hold patty shape and cook more evenly. Good point to start to make your sausage at home and avoid the preservatives in grocery offerings."

"reviewBody": "Excellent recipe. Definitely taste like a fresher version of the store bought patties. I didn't expect it to be so good from a few ingredients, and I don't think it needs more ingredients. Additions such as fennel or other Italian herbs, IMO, would ruin this. Sometimes simple is all it takes, otherwise you'd be making Italian sausage (which some people are actually using this recipe as a base for)\n\nSome slight differences I made. I mixed 50/50 ground pork and ground turkey, which I don't think compromised the flavor at all. I questioned the use of red pepper flakes as that wouldn't disperse well in 2 pounds of meat, so I converted it to 1/8 tsp ground cayenne. I converted a \"pinch\" of ground cloves to 1/8 tsp because, seriously, a \"pinch\" is different to everyone. That's enough for them to serve their intended purpose as very subtle flavors.\n\nCould it be better? I think being more generous with the measurements (instead of being exact like I did) or slightly decreasing the amount of meat by 1/4 pound would boost the flavor more, but the recipe as it stands is fantastic."

I tried the wax paper trick that someone mentioned but it didn't work for me; everything stuck to the wax paper. Maybe I need to find better wax paper... There is no doubt that this recipe needs to include a \"rest period\", as all the flavors seem to show themselves after about 24 hours. \nI sooo live this recipe, especially since I live in Chile and breakfast sausage is 100% unheard of and unavailable. This is my second go and I will keep making it every time I run out."
