"reviewBody": "I have made this twice and I still think it needs some tweaking. The biggest change I made was swapping out the wheat bran for a cup of ground nuts (pecans, almonds, and sesame seeds). Neither Aldi nor Target had wheat bran and that is where I do my shopping so I looked online and the ground nuts seemed the best substitute. I did use cinnamon and nutmeg but maybe could use more (I may also use some more of something sweet next time too). The dates I substituted with raisins and the pecans with banana chips (I could use 50-100% more or each next time). Also, I left out the coconut. \n\nEven without the changes to suit my preferences, it is pretty good granola. My gripe is that there are no clumps. The second time I made it I added two egg whites to the liquid mixture. I poured the mix on two pans for baking and one I made the mistake of stirring and it is all loose now. The other I left alone and it is clumpy, which is what I want. I also had to bake it a little longer to really get it crunchy. \n\nNext time, a little more sweetener, egg whites, more spices, double the raisin and banana chips, no stirring and I will use parchment paper."

Only \"issue\" I have with this recipe is the serving size. I made the 12 serving size, and that should actually be more like 18 servings.....no one is going to eat a whole cup of granola at almost 600 calories!"

I let it cool in the baking pan, then added a cup of freeze-dried blueberries. We had this for breakfast and the kids and I absolutely loved it. I think next time, I might switch out the honey for maple syrup. I think that would be good, too. This was simple enough for me to make early in the morning while my kids were sleeping and have it ready to go as they were waking up."

"reviewBody": "This is a very easy and tasty homemade cereal to make. This is a great (and cheaper) alternative to today's commercial cereals that are processed and loaded with bad sugar. I have made this 5 times and all turned out great, using slightly different mixings dried fruits and nuts. You may also want to half the nutmeg so it’s not overpowering. To be totally organic (if that's a worry), then you may want to buy your own coconut and shred it (if used) and also buy a natural brown sugar (like muscavado). And if using some kind of blend of dried fruit, buy some that not artificially \"sweetened\". I estimated the cost to make this was $0.23 per serving (even using all natural ingredients as above). Furthermore, I estimated on a 2,500 calorie diet, if this was all you ate (not recommended), it would cost $1.84 per day to live off of (and buying a generic version of Oats)!"

I would recommend using at least 3 large jelly roll pans to spread the cereal out on. I put mine on 1, and it didn't evenly brown (the cereal along the edge browned faster than that in the middle). Also, I wish there was some way to make this \"clumpier.\" I like the crunchy clusters you get sometimes in cereal and granola-- this was all one consistency. Perhaps more honey next time? We really love this, though, and will make again. It lasts a very long time because it makes a big load of cereal."

I sometimes splurge on the vanilla too and add up to 2 tablespoons. As for the nuts I have found that I like chopped hazelnuts and almonds. I cook the nuts throughout the entire baking cycle to give them a nice toasted taste. Then I just add the dates for the last 15 minutes and skip the coconut. Super easy! Super good!"

"reviewBody": "This is a wonderful, nutritious and tasty cereal. For my youngest's food allergies, I substituted oat bran for wheat bran, ground up sunflower seeds for the wheat germ (an odd-sounding substitution, but it worked), and about 1/4 cup barley malt instead of brown sugar (I decreased the water a bit to make up for the liquid). This goes great with rice, oat or almond milk--and if you use just enough milk to cover the cereal and microwave it for about 60 seconds, it makes a wonderful hot cereal (really brings out the pecan flavor)."

I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it but the second time I used less oats but threw in a handful of wheat chex, bran flakes, corn flakes, dried sweetened cranberries, and combined sliced almonds with the pecans. thanks for a great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "It has a good flavor, but I was looking for something that could serve as a finger snack, and this won't. I substituted almonds and left out the coconut, just because i can't get almonds where i'm at and i don't like coconut. I have been eating it for breakfast, though, and I do like it."

"reviewBody": "Yummy, yummy cereal that stays crunchy in milk. I halved the recipe and did some substitutions due to lack of ingredients: I cut out the germ, dates, and coconut, and I added 1/2 cup of flour, 1/2 cup bran cereal (looks like twigs), and 1/2 cup of sliced almonds. This cereal is barely sweet, so I added some raisins to my bowl when I served it. I'll definitely be making this again!"

I don't care for coconut, so I left it out and the salt because I have to eat salt free. I also coated the almonds in a tablespoon of honey before adding. It is a great cereal."
