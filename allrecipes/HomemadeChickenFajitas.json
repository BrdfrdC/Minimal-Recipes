THAT says a LOT about this spice mix blend. Oh, I like mine in a homemade corn tortilla, so ..... does that make it more like a taco, than a fajita? MUY BUENO, Mijos &amp; Mijas!!"

"reviewBody": "The seasoning is exactly what I wanted. I made it a little differently. I had leftover roast chicken, so I used that. I cut the onions thinly and sautÃ©ed them in olive oil with strips of red bell pepper until the onions carmelized, then tossed in the seasoning and the chicken with a little more olive oil, sautÃ©ed, deglazed with a splash of chicken bone broth, and sautÃ©ed a little more until the chicken was warm. Crazy good!"

"reviewBody": "great! Make this a staple for rotation! I substituted cayenne pepper for ground red pepper. I used yellow bell peppers &amp; sweet onion only because that's all I had. Net time I would add red peppers. make plenty of the onion/bells for the recipe. Also, marinade 4-6 hours. Saute the chicken in a skillet. Grilled would be a good choice! Loved using LaTorilla Factory Handmade Style Tortillas (yellow corn &amp; wheat). Presented with a wired taco holder &amp; served with sour cream."

Although I did add more\n spice for our tasteâ€™s but great recipe, I could see making the spice mix the night before work then letting it marinate while Iâ€™m at work. I didnâ€™t let mine come to a full hour room temperature (I was in a hurry) but it was still good. Also Rebecca (if thatâ€™s your real name) this is NOT the forum for your ridiculous advertising, there are plenty of sleazy sites/boards to advertise your nonsense on - Allrecipes is NOT it."
