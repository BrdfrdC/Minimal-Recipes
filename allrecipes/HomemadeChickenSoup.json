"reviewBody": "This is essentially our family's generations-old chicken soup recipe, but a little bass-ackward. I pick as much meat off the carcass as I can before hand, then, using a large dutch oven with a strainer basket, I submerge the carcass in cold water, bring to a boil, then simmer until the whole thing falls apart. I lift the bones out using the strainer basket (placing on a platter to catch drips), cool and pick any remaining meat. While the meat/bones are cooling, I chop and add my onion, celery and carrots, parsley, herbs and spices, etc. and simmer until tender. Then add meat back in and taste for salt/pepper. Why you would throw the veggies in and cook them to mush while the bones are stewing, I have NO idea. Just making an unnecessary mess, imho. Also, don't add the meat back in until the end. Otherwise, you will cook the oils out of it and it will be dry and tough."

"reviewBody": "I agree with others that (1) it's basic and (2) the veggies will have no more flavor and be softer than desired. I prefer my veggies be very slightly softer than al dente. I actually prefer to make my stock and \"fast chill\" the stock so that the fat becomes hard and come right off with ease. Heat the broth using boullion cubes to taste. Cube the meat for a better presentation. Keep dark and light meat separate. Simmer the veggies about 10 minutes and add the DARK meat only. Adjust seasonings and simmer veggies until desired texture. Gently FOLD in white meat, turn off heat and serve."

"reviewBody": "It's a decent recipe but rather bland and not like your Mom's or Grandma's. If you use it you should add the bullion cubes or even start with a box of store bought chicken 'stock'. Better yet Try this approach: to start, split or quarter your chicken, season it, place it into your heated pot, skin side down, to brown the pieces and get some fond into the pot bottom. Then drop in your carrots and celery (in 1-2inch pieces) and give them a quick saute. Then add your water (or store stock not broth) your other seasonings and let come to a boil, scraping and disolving the fond as it heats. Then reduce immediately and simmer on low for 90 min or so. Skim off any scum that forms but don't take surface fat off."

"reviewBody": "As written I can only give this 2 stars. The broth started off decent but where are the herbs? Bay leaf? With that set aside, the veggies are complete mush and deprived of texture and need discarded and started all over for your soup. Chicken soup is an understatement. As written, that is all you have really. Chicken drowned in under-seasoned broth. This recipe is in dire need of tweaking. I made it work in the end but will not go into every single detail. What I will say is to discard the spent veggies (they were only there to flavor your broth) add fresh, add herbs, save half of your chicken for another use, and add some sort of noodles for depth so that you are getting more than just broth and chicken. Sorry but I won't make this one again."

I used a partly eaten rotisserie chicken so that I didn't have to worry about the meat being done. I also subbed chicken broth in for half of the water. Definitely needed the optional 1 teaspoon of chicken bouillon."

After straining the broth and returning it to heat, I added 2 chopped carrots, chopped kale and a teaspoon of herbs de provence. Boiled some noodles in a separate pot (just 1.5 cups cooked) and added to soup right before serving."

( Of course, I was using an un cooked bird, which takes a good 90 minutes) Added bay leaf, egg noodles and thyme, used a healthy amount of kosher salt and strained through a strainer with paper towels for a much cleaner broth. I think a green garnish like chives would add to the beauty of this soup. Enjoy"

"reviewBody": "I really wanted to love this recipe, based on the scores of reviews I read. I don't want to trash it because so many others enjoyed it, but I thought made as directed, this soup was like dish water. I did not use the veggies because after boiling for so long, they were very unappetizing, so I substituted fresh veggies. No lie, I added lots of other seasonings, including four boullion cubes and two packets of Goya poultry boullion. I kept adjusting after each addition until I got the taste I wanted. In addition, I added about 1/3 c. flour mixed with 3/4 cold water. (Shake well until completely blended, then add to soup to thicken - my mother always added a flour mixture to her chicken noodle soup.) After that, I reduced the soup for added flavor. Boiled egg noodles separately and added to the soup. When it was done, it was very good, but the finished version was a long ways from the original recipe. Good base, but I think this is just a starting point to anything remotely palatable."

Also a couple of crushed cloves of garlic is good. Also, you can make this basic recipe with any ethnic twist. Indian style, add a little curry powder. Italian, add basil oregano and sprinkle with grated parmesan. Mexican, add a container of salsa. Greek, add spinach and squeeze lemon. Have fun!"
