The main differences are that 1) I used dry pinto beans that I had soaked and cooked separately as noted in the Tips, and 2) instead of a slow cooker I slow simmered the mixture in a large pot for 4 hours, stirring occasionally. I also garnished with cilantro, diced onion, and grated cheese. It was a hit with my very discerning critic (wife)."

"reviewBody": "This is close to the way I use to make it. With small changes it is greatly improved. The difference is in the details: Addition of a small amount of sausage (1/3 of beef amt.) or brats. Remove the ground Brat ingredients from the casing and brown with the beef. Add the garlic &amp; onions until cooked. I can't tolerate chile pepper so I use Louisiana Hot Sauce, and Worcester sauce to enrich the beef flavor, salt to taste. Add the beans, diced canned tomatoes, beef consomm√© instead of water. 1 can each of the last three ingredients. My hubs likes a small amount of pasta in chili. I was told that it is an Indiana \"thing\"."

"reviewBody": "Well it was my first batch of chili, that I've made in a really long time. I did substitute a few items,I used turkey and hot Italian sausage and peppered thick sliced bacon. I like my chili hot so I added habanero peppers and serrano peppers and black beans with red peppers and onions. This was a great recipe and it was relatively easy and I'm not very good in the kitchen. And not to mention easy clean up to boot."

"reviewBody": "I was looking for a healthy chili and came across this one. I used extra lean beef, mixed beans instead of just kidney, I added an extra tbsp of chill powder and tsp of cayenne to spice it up a bit. It's a great slow cook meal that tastes better the longer it goes. Loved it the next day too! Thanks Healthy Girl, we'll make this one again."

"reviewBody": "Homemade Chili Haiku: \"Not sure it's 'homemade' when ingredients are canned. But dang, is it good!\" I halved the recipe for 2 adults and 2 kiddos, using a can of Rotel and one 15 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of the puree and made it in advance, letting it simmer in the dutch oven for an afternoon, tucking it into the fridge, then re-simmering next day b4 serving with cheese and Frito scoops. Nothing outstanding about this chili but maybe that's why we ate all of it up with no complaints. It's just a good, easy, basic chili. Can't wait for cooler Fall temperatures so we can have it again."
