It is a very sweet sauce and I used the leftover sauce for crockpot sloppy joes. They were fabulous! The second (and 3rd and 4th and 5th) I used chili powder instead of allspice, added granulated garlic and a bit more salt to cut some of the sweetness as I personally prefer savory over sweet; hubby loved it either way! Great recipe and is now a staple in my home!"

Mixed with mayonaise or miracle whip makes a great Thousand Island dressing. Also great in liew of the more spicy barbeque sauce on ribs. I also use it over an appetizer spread made of cream cheese and canned salmon. Ellenmel, I am so glad you submitted this as I no longer purchase prepared chili sauce because it contains high fructose corn syrup and I use it on many things."

"reviewBody": "This can be a good recipe with a LOT of additions. It was far too sweet even though I only added 1 tbs of brown sugar. I also ended up adding garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, red pepper flakes, salt, coarse black pepper, soy sauce and a dash of hot pepper sauce. NOW it tastes like what I think chili sauce should taste like. With these additions I will continue to make it."

I needed chili sauce in a recipe for maple meatballs and they turned out really well with this sauce in them. I'm looking forward to trying the rest of it in another recipe. Thank you!"

I would never hesitate to use this recipe in place of store bought bottled chili sauce, as it was pretty much identical! Thanks for sharing. :)"

Furthermore, I boiled it in a saucepan for a few minutes to meld the flavors together. I know it seems like I am rating an entirely different recipe, but this got me going in the right direction, and for that I tip my hat."

"reviewBody": "This was really good. I used it on the lentils (as recommended) when I made Glazed Corned Beef with Lentils from this site. I don't use onions or onion powder (because we have dogs, and they usually get some of what I cook, too) and I didn't add any garlic (because I had already added that to the water in which I cooked my lentils). I also substituted a bit of Cumin and a few shakes of Mrs. Dash's Southwest Chipotle blend for the allspice (I had it on hand, but ti rarely does anything for me), and it was great. I was skeptical (to say the least) about how all of the flavors that comprised this dinner would blend, but there wasn't a scrap left at the end of the meal. (I'm glad I threw in some potatoes with the lentils)."

After that went over like a led balloon, I added onion powder, garlic powder, salt, soy sauce, red pepper flakes, Asian mustard and hot sauce. I don't know what it turned into but it was much better than originally written. I was putting it over meatballs."

Also after tasting it, I thought it was missing something, and I read the ingredients off of the empty bottle of store bought chili sauce that I had. I then added 1/4tsp. of onion powder, 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp. of chili powder. It really improved it. (Besides, I don't know why you would name a recipe 'chili sauce' when there's no chili in it.)"
