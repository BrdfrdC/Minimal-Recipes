"reviewBody": "Whoa, these are dangerously good. My 7-year-old requested corn dogs for his birthday and I figured I'd try it even though I've never deep fried anything before. I thought a couple kids would eat them, but then all the adults ended up eating one and wishing there were more. The only change I made was to reduce the sugar. That makes them healthy corn dogs. As other reviewers suggested, I dried the hot dogs well before dipping in the batter. The batter layer does not need to go on thick.\n\nI had no idea how to actually fry anything, and the recipe doesn't cover that, so if you need tips: \n- I used a 1.5 qt bottle of canola oil in a cast iron dutch oven\n- I kept the oil at 350-375 degrees and made sure it was correct before each batch\n- The whole corn dog floated sideways in the oil, and I rotated it periodically. \n- I was able to put in 2-3 corn dogs at a time\n- They took 2-4 minutes each (I didn't actually time it), and it's easy to tell when you should take them out because they turn a beautiful golden brown color\n\nIt couldn't be easier, and it was a delicious treat!"

"reviewBody": "I used buttermilk instead of milk, had locally grown pink cornmeal (but it will turn golden so don‚Äôt worry about color), and omitted the pepper. \n\nI did find there is a way to twist and push in and pull back out, to cover the dog, and that it needs to be placed in boiling oil immediately...hold near bottom a few seconds before dropping in. (Yes I listened to the ex carnie and patted each dog dry before dipping.)\n\nI used real lard for cooking. Instead of full wieners I cut in half (natural Oscar Meyer beef) and placed on long metal BBQ skewers meant for shish-kabobs. Then I pushed the dog off the skewer with a table knife. I left until brown and then put onto plate with paper towel, but it might be even wiser to put onto a cookie rack to cool to eliminate dampness created. \n\nThe results were tasty (no you do not need to precook) and it reminded me of the mini corn dogs frozen in grocery stores. \n\nHowever, I did chill the batter and it became too thick, so I had to add more buttermilk and stir. The batter coated it, but it was a thin coating not thick. It tastes fine by me, but I give it 4 stars because it is not thick."

As it was, we used Kirkland Signature all-beef dogs and we had one naked dog at the end. It's possible the mix was too thick too, but I don't know how to tell since I've never done it before! LOL Next time I might try adding a touch more milk.\n\nI didn't see it mentioned, but the temperature should be between 350 and 375.\n\nI tried the flour trick on some of them just to see how it worked and dried dogs worked way better. And keeping the batter cold, as someone suggested, really helped it stick to the dogs too. \n\nThe cup method worked really well but after the first four dogs, there wasn't enough left in the cup to cover the dogs so I ended up spooning the batter over them.\n\nMy kids loved it and ate more than they usually would! Thanks!"

Also, I fried them without the sticks as I didn't have a ton of oil so they fried in a saucepan on their sides. They turned out perfect and I skewered them when they came out of the oil.

"reviewBody": "I made these just as written with the suggestions from the carney to dry the dogs and chill the cornbread batter and they came out perfect! I didn't have any issues with the batter falling off. I used fine ground corn meal (not course). I might reduce the amount of milk a little and add a bit of seasoning to the batter next time, but fantastic regardless! Thanks for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "I made these with the ingredients listed in the correct measurements, but did NOT use all beef hotdogs, and used two 8 packs of dogs cut in half-no sticks. I put the dough in the freezer while I cut my hotdogs (which went into the fridge as soon as they were cut), and made my chips-I am submitting a photo as well for you to see. I used a fondue fork to lift them out of the vegetable oil, and held them up and turned them a bit and lightly tapped the fork on the side of the bowl to coat them all over and remove excess--you do not need a lot of batter on there to make beautiful corn dogs! Even small bare patches were covered when removed from the oil because the breading expands enough to do that. I made little bread balls with the left over batter- me and my 4 yo granddaughter were the only one's who loved the dough alone. Will be making these again and am testing them for freezing and re-cooking so that I can have them when I am working in the summer. Will try to contact the OP if I am successful in freezing (or will leave a comment here to let users know how it works out.) Good recipe if you follow fundamental cooking rules and techniques. Thank you for sharing it here."

I dried the meat thoroughly first and the batter stuck fine. I didn‚Äôt put the smokies in right away so the batter started to puff up but, it didn‚Äôt matter. Even though there might have been a couple of small bare spots when I dropped them in the oil, the batter puffs up so beautifully that every piece was completely covered when they were done. The texture was light and soft on the inside with just the right amount of crunch on the outside. I‚Äôll definitely use this recipe again. Thanks!"

When I put my first corndog in I realized the oil was not hot enough so I just took it out and re-battered and it turned out great still. Oil temperature is everything for this recipe ! Also I did not use pepper as other reviews suggested.\nI used organic cornmeal and organic chicken hot dogs. I only had a package of 6 hotdogs but this recipe probably could have made double that because I had a lot of leftover batter."
