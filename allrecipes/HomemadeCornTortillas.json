We set most aside in order to make tortilla chips, but honestly, they are so delicious I think I'll serve them for soft tacos next time or enchiladas...which is saying a lot because I usually don't like corn tortillas at all...I find them kind of dry and crumbly, but when you make them fresh they are very pliable, warm and wow - an incredible comfort food!"

I tried covering the dough ball with plastic wrap, it sticks right to it and shreds apart when you try to remove it. I finally gave up and tried to drop the ball into the pan and make it into a circle with the spatula, nope, it sticks to the spatula and shreds apart.

"reviewBody": "So delicious. Make sure you use warm water; cold makes the dough crumbly it seems. As others have said, a freezer bag cut in half makes ideal sheets to press the tortillas between. I don't have a press, so I press them flat with a pan, and then roll them out a bit with a wine bottle (since I don't have a rolling pin). To ensure your tortillas puff, make sure there are no cracks in the dough balls before rolling them, that way there is a seal when the gas inside starts to expand. Right before I press each dough ball, I will put a few drops of water in my hand and smooth the ball to make sure it has no cracks. If it doesn't puff, don't worry - it'll still be tasty, the texture just won't be as great."

"reviewBody": "This is a standard traditional tortilla recipe. It is going to take some time for me to get them perfectly shaped and the hang of it so the edges don't tear when I peal them away from the plastic but they were far superior to any corn tortilla I have purchased at the store. Tips: Make them fresh.. the leftovers from yesterday tasted dry like the ones from the store and crumbled unlike the fresh ones. Also, I don't have a tortilla press so I placed the dough ball between two clear pastry mats, purchased as a two pack for $1, from our local dollar store. I then used a clear glass dish to flatten the dough ball and then used a rolling pin \"Palote\" I inherited from my great-grandma which can be made from the handle of a wooden broom. I peeled them back as carefully as I could and today's looked much better than yesterdays."

"reviewBody": "I had lost the original recipe that was on the bag of the masa I had bought, so was happy to discover this one, which had the perfect ratio of masa to water. After mixing up some cold water with the masa with a fork (I didn't see that it called for hot water until I read the directions and it was too late by that point) in the bowl until it made a crumbly mixture, I used two cookie scoops full of mixture to roll in a ball in my hand right away (again, didn't see the directions to let it rest - oops!) and it created the perfect small tortilla. They were hard at first, but softened up after sitting for a few minutes/steaming with the others in the stack, and were plenty pliable to bend without breaking - a big fear I had when it came to making corn tortillas instead of flour. This was the first time that I feel I have successfully made corn tortillas, and I couldn't believe how easy it was this time around, so thank you! I happily loaded them up with the \"Jayme's Coleslaw\" recipes from this site, and some root beer pulled pork leftovers from last night's sliders. Definitely transformed those leftovers with these tacos!!"

"reviewBody": "I added salt. The ratio of the flour and water didn't come out exactly as the recipe said. I had to add more water to achieve the right consistency of the dough. I don't own a press or griddle so I used ziplock bag and a round baking pan and my hands to press and shape the dough. To cook, I tried with iron skillet and non-stick pan. The first batch I made was with non-stick pan. After cooking 30 sec. or if not more on each side, most of them did not puff up and none of them turned brown. They were somewhat dry and tasted like undercooked. I adjusted the amount of the water to the dough and tried the second batch with iron skillet. I don't know if it's because of the electric stove, I had a problem controlling the cooking temperature. Dry, ungreased surface of the skillet didn't help either. So, back to non- stick pan and I tried the 3rd batch. On medium heat(electric stove 5). Making sure the pan is staying pretty hot, throw a tortilla in. And this time, I'm counting time: Cook for about 20 sec, flip, cook for another 20 sec, flip, cook for 10sec, flip, another 10 sec, flip. And it puffs up. Done. Some puffed up after a few flips and I don't know if it has anything to do with the thickness of the dough, but they all came out soft, moist and fully cooked. They just didn't get brown like the picture. Even though this recipe didn't work for me, I did get some really good helpful tips by reading everyone's review so I thank you all for that!"

"reviewBody": "This is the ol' standby recipe that has always worked for me. I do add some salt, not necessary but I like it. You can't depend on the exact amount of water from any tortilla recipe. Add enough water until the dough feels like play-dough, not dry enough to crack but not wet enough to be sticky. I use tools to help me: a KitchenAid stand mixer to knead the dough and a tortilla press to make lovely, thin rounds. And yes, I cook them on a cast-iron skillet. Fresh tortillas are so worth the work."

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe twice today! It was very easy &amp; relatively quick. I did add chicken bouillon to the water and 1 tsp of salt. I figured out the correct consistency of the dough is similar to that of play-doh. I found if the dough dried out I sprayed it with a little water from a spray bottle to rehydrate without making it sticky. I used a freezer Ziploc bag for my rolling sheets of choice (I tried parchment paper, but it pulls moisture from the dough). I don't have a tortilla press, so used my small cutting board for first press of the dough, then finished with my rolling pin, turning the tortilla after each roll which gave me an end result of a nice (fairly round) tortilla. I began the cooking process with a hot dry skillet, cooked 25 seconds, flipped &amp; cooked 25 seconds, flipped again, lightly pressing the tortilla just until it started to fill with air cooking 25 seconds (got that air pocket many say is important), then one more flip for 25 seconds more &amp; set on a plate covered by a bowl to keep the heat and moisture in (I also put a damp towel on the plate to wrap the tortillas in). The tortillas were soft and had a wonderful taste. I wrapped &amp; stored them in the fridge. I made a couple of empanadas (small fried meat pies) with the dough. One with some shredded left-over Asian pork &amp; one with some thick chili. My husband liked them so much, he asked if I would make some more for our dinner that night. I served them with a nice tossed salad. Great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Using the Maseca brand corn flour (not an easy find in France!) I followed the recipe as is except for the addition of a bit of salt. I don't have a tortilla press and found just using my hands and pressing the dough onto a piece of plastic wrap worked great. The plastic wrap was used so I could transfer them from the counter to the pan. If I found that the dough was breaking, I just sealed the cracks with some water on my fingers as I used my hand to press the dough balls into their final tortilla shape. I used my nonstick crepe pan, since I don't have a cast iron pan, to fry them. When done, I transferred them to a plate, covered that plate with another plate flipped upside down, and added a slightly damp paper towel to keep them pliable and warm. I have made them twice and both times they've come out great!"

"reviewBody": "I don't particularly enjoy making tortillas - in a home where we make nearly everything from scratch, it's just one more cooking chore in the bag. However, good luck finding non-gmo corn tortillas, so I had to go with homemade, otherwise I just wasn't going to use corn tortillas. This was a little bland, I would definitely try salt next time. Made homemade taquitos with them right off the griddle, and every last one cracked, even while they were warm and covered with a towel. My proportions and cook method could've been off, as I'm only used to making flour tortillas at this point. However, for my purposes, I think in the future I'll just use the raw dough, put in my fillings, and pan fry in a little coconut oil instead."

"reviewBody": "I've tweeked this recipe to finally make what I consider to be a perfect corn tortilla. First, I add 1 teaspoon of seasoning salt to the masa harina. Without it, they smell wonderful, but taste like a frisbee. I also add about one tablespoon of shortening (or bacon fat) to the hot water and let it melt before adding it to the masa harina. Then I divide the dough into about 12 balls - and use a tortilla press. This makes a perfect sized tortilla. I used to go crazy with the dough sticking - I tried plastic wrap, ziploc bags, parchment - they all stuck and I'd end up swearing way more than I usually do when cooking. What works is a tip I saw in the insert that came with my tortilla press - two circles cut out of plastic grocery bags (don't use the side with ink, or your tortilla will have writing on it). Press your tortillas between those, and they NEVER stick. Also, my corn tortillas NEVER used to puff (but I do like the brown spots that come from puffing). If you pull the dough balls apart and re-roll them right before pressing them, it seems to aerate the dough, and they'll puff and bubble nicely."

I definitely recommend using a tortilla press, although when you make them by hand it's a lot of fun (And good for kids, too!) and they have that 'homey' look to them. My mother in law taught me how to make tortillas that way, and using this basic recipe. Glad to see it on Allrecipes!"

"reviewBody": "I used this recipe last night and the tortillas were a hit. At first I tried kneading the masa like I knead bread dough, but it didn't work well; the masa crumbled apart and I had to keep gathering pieces and smashing them back in. I then switched to the clay kneading technique my potter mother-in-law taught me, rocking/pressing/twisting the dough, which worked perfectly to mix the masa. We don't have a tortilla press, so after putting the dough in the gallon zip lock bag I covered it with a heavy bamboo cutting board and my children &amp; I took turns sitting on it to press perfect tortillas! They loved this part! No need for a tortilla press! This recipe made about 10 tortillas for us but I'm not certain, because my husband liked to eat them hot off the comal with butter &amp; salt. Next time I'll double it so we'll have enough for man snacks, dinner, and breakfast chilaquiles. It's so nice to have fresh made tortillas that don't crack when I want to make taquitos or enchiladas!"

"reviewBody": "What I liked most about this recipe, were the top reviewers. I got a couple of great tips! I love homemade corn tortillas but hate standing over the stove doing one at a time. It takes all day! One of the reviewers mentioned using a pancake griddle and making about 6 at a time. LOVED that idea! Someone else mentioned using parchment paper squares and putting the dough balls between them with the tortilla press. It was the first time I had no sticking what so ever! Having a tortilla container is also neccessary, as if they appear tough at all they will soften up and become pliable when covered after removing from the griddle. However, one thing I noticed, is it was my first time completely using the press and the masa to water ratio differed from the bag. I am not sure why, but they tasted A LOT like the ones from the store just kind of warm. Maybe, it was how thin the press makes them? I am not sure, so next time I will just lightly press it. If that doesn't work, then I will go back to the ratios on the bag. They just seem softer."

I dont have a tortilla press, I just used a freezer bag and cut it to facilitate the pressing of the dough. I just used a small cast iron pan to press my dough. The trick for getting them off the plastic is the peel the plastic off the tortilla, not the other way around. \nThe tortilla takes awhile to \"puff\" up, you have to cook both sides, and then turn again, waiting patiently for the air to puff up the tortilla. It definately took longer than \"10 seconds\" for my tortillas to puff up. With these tips, this is a 5 star recipe, and Ill be making home made corn tortillas more often. Thanks!"

"reviewBody": "I've struggled &amp; struggled to make homemade corn tortillas, even after being taught &amp; watching my Honduran friend make them over and over and over again. This is the basic \"recipe\" that my friend used, but I found that other's suggestions made it PERFECT. I used chicken stock instead of water and a dash of salt and the flavor was fabulous. A freezer bag cut down the sides and a plate was perfect for flattening the tortillas, although my OCD made me smooth the edges out nice and pretty on each of them, but they've NEVER peeled off so easily before, I ALWAYS tore at least 1/2 my batch apart just trying to peel them off the plastic. One trick that my friend had that was perfect though, was to use a wet paper towel to press the tortillas as they're cooking &amp; use to grab the tortillas and flip without burning ur fingers. Pressing with the damp towel helps make the puffy parts of the tortilla that make the beautiful browned spots. With the adjustments, this is definitely a 5 star, but probably only about a 3 1/2 - 4 stars as it's written."

"reviewBody": "These turned out quite well. I added about 1/4 tsp salt to the dough, rolled out the tortillas between two pieces of plastic (freezer Ziplock cut open) using a rolling pin (they were not round tortillas), and cooked them on a hot cast iron pan. We ate them w/ a bit of cheese (grated and melted on top), salsa, and tomatillo sauce. Will definitely make them again!"

"reviewBody": "My kids love taco's and since I just started making fresh tortillas. They can't get enough. It took me some time to find a place that sells Masa Harina. But now that I have that looked after, we are eating fresh tortillas on a regular basis. They are so simple to make and taste soo good compared to those expensive tortillas you get at the store. I'm very happy I found this recipe. BTW I add some salt to the masa before I add the hot water."
