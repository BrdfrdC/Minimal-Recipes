One tip if you're like me and have trouble flipping it within a skillet like this: use an oven safe skillet (I use my cast iron) and then instead of flipping, cook the first side for like 4 minutes instead of five and then broil it in the oven for a couple for a couple minutes. As long as you keep an eye on it, it crisps up REAL nice and you don't have to risk breaking it up"

Great basic hash brown recipe. Thanks."

Two tablespoons of flour sprinkled over the partially thawed potatoes should be sufficient, salt and pepper, and one egg. If you are making German Latkes, add some grated nutmeg. Two tablespoons of vegetable oil should be plenty. Oil heated to medium high (not smoking) is a good temperature. Don't want it to flame up. An ice cream scoop of potato flattened in the hot oil makes a nice size and easy to flip over when browned. Call me a Philistine, but I am not grating my own potatoes."

If you're like me and need a bit more flavor than salt and pepper then this is what I did. My changes: I diced two small onions one red and one white, with chives, flavor peppers, grated two cloves of garlic and 1/2 inch piece of ginger. Fried them with 1 TSP of oil until the onions became translucent. 5 small potatoes and 1 large. Added dried stake seasoning, cayenne pepper. 2 flax egg because we don't eat meat (egg) 1/4 cup or less of oil for frying I followed the rest of the recipe. I covered my frying pan with a cover on medium to low heat so the potatoes can cook properly. I used a tablespoon of oil for every four hash brown. And man they are delicious at brunch 😋"

I did rinse the shredded potatoes three times in a salad spinner, spun them and wrung them dry in a towel. Next time, I’ll spread the mixture thinner to get less of a pancake texture. Also plan to try adding 1/2 c of shredded sharp cheddar just for variety."

"reviewBody": "Awesome! I followed the suggestion to shred the zucchini first, mix it with double the salt, and drain it while prepping everything else. I also minced the onion with some garlic in a mini food processor and browned it before adding it back to the mixing bowl and cleaning the pan. Once mixed, I pan fried in a VERY SMALL AMOUNT of peanut OIL as other reviewers suggested. The result was my first latke ever. It didn't really resemble hash browns at all but that was just fine with us! Oh yeah and I only used about 2.5 Tbs of flour.\n\nThank you for posting this recipe"

In fact the amount of oil suggested is worthy of 5 Michelin Stars, perhaps even the Nobel peace prize if such a thing is possible. The amount of oil suggested is so perfect, I feel the need to post it again for all the world to read, study, commit to memory and pass down to others for generations to come. \n\"1 cup oil for frying, or as needed\"\n\"....or as needed\"\n\"...OR AS NEEDED\""

I used 3 Tablespoons coconut oil and 2 Tbsp butter, and there was still a lot of oil left in the pan after cooking. So unless you prefer deep fried hashbrowns, I'd suggest decreasing the oil significantly."

"reviewBody": "Delicious! I made them as individual \"pancakes \" and everyone loved them. I added salt and pepper to the mixture before cooking. While I didn't use the amount of oil called for, you definitely need to ensure there's enough oil that when you turn them, the other side is in oil, not in a dry pan. The oil also needs to be very hot when you put them in - they need to sizzle! They're easily reheated on a medium heat in a frying pan coated in cooking spray. I used them as a side with pork chops and apples but am also adding these to my brunch offerings. Great with sour cream and/or apple sauce."
