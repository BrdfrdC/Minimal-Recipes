The only drawback would be is you need to be prepared to take a long time to cook these because you literally have to cook them like 1 at a time or they clump badly. 20 minutes we only had about 10 french fries which unfortunately our burgers were done so then we just gave up &amp; let them clump. We just served on 1 plate &amp; let everyone break up clumps. I did marinate my slices potatoes in worscterschire, Greek seasoning &amp; all season salt then removed the fries and put them in freezer bags to chill for a few hours before fry time. They were crispy h delicious!!"

"reviewBody": "Woohoooo!! I am the french fry hero of my family! This recipe solves the soggy homemade fry problem. My family said these were probably the best fries they have ever had. Fries stay crispy for a long time and also retain heat very well. Put them in an oven at low temp (~170 deg) and they are perfect for at least an hour. Seasoning is just right. You can play with the spices to get bolder flavors but the basic recipe is spot on. One tip: keep a small amount of the dry mix to add in near the end. The batter tends to get runny from the water on the fries and a little dry mix will thicken it some. It is a little more work than just homemade fries, but very much worth it."

Such a waste. I just left most my fries plain and fried them, then a little salt and pepper, those were wonderful. I would not waste your time. I am super bummed because allrecipes.com is my go to recipe site. They should remove this one."

The fries were very crisp and the flavor of the batter was great. No need to season afterward. I placed the fries on a cookie rack over a pan to catch dripping oil. Will need more than the 1/2 cup of water to get the batter to the right consistency. Like others have said, dry the potatoes well before you put them in the batter. Great recipe!"

I soaked the potatoes for aesthetic purposes and then poured the batter on the fries after draining the water. I let them sit in the batter and put a few fries in the oil at a time. They did stick together a bit but not too much. I broke them apart gently with a fork. My daughters ate all of them without ketchup, which they never do with fries. They always make fry sauce, but not with these! I was very pleasantly surprised and will definitely make these again!"

"reviewBody": "I liked the tip about making a thinner batter in a plastic container with a lid for shaking and using tongs, that was helpful. I altered the spices using A1 dry rub seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, ground dry mustard, salt and pepper. I recommend pulling out a handful or two of potatoes and letting the water drain off for a couple minutes before battering them, and put them in one at a time with the tongs. They didn't even need ketchup, they were so good. I had enough cut potatoes for a large mixing bowl, rinsed them several times before proceeding further and still had a little batter left over."

"reviewBody": "These were an UTTER DISASTER! First, WAY too much paprika. I just sprinkled it over the batter. I used granulated garlic powder and onion powder without the salt, then added kosher salt, cayenne, black pepper and parsley.\n\nI followed the video to the letter, but the fries stuck to the bottom of the fryer like glue. The end result was a hard, semi- gelatinous mess with under-cooked potatoes. I drained them, placed them on a sheet pan and baked them, then ate them as home fries. Next time, I will just cut fresh potatoes as shown, soak them in SALT water then just fry them, dry them, then immediately place in a paper sack with the seasoning I used mentioned above and shake. DONE. No mess."

"reviewBody": "Glad other people liked this recipe but my family did not like it. Potatoes were not meant to be breaded. The best way we've learned to make crispy fries is very simple. You par-cook the potatoes either in oil until they are about 3/4 done and remove them to drain the oil but are not browned. Alternatively, you can microwave the potato until it's about 3/4 cooked before cutting into fries. Then you put them into 350 degree oil until browned and crispy. Use seasoned salt or sea salt immediately after removing the fries from the oil before they drain the cooking oil completely. Works perfectly every time."

The only thing I recommend is to follow the recepie and put the potatos one by one. I tried (with my laziness) to put it all in the batter and the potatos started to release its water, so I had to add a little more flour and returned to the amazing batter from before! Thank you for introducing this greatness in my life haha \nGod bless"

These were fabulous! \n\nNot to take away anything from the recipe, I believe it is phenomenal just as is, but here in the South, we like our food heavily seasoned and every home has a can of Tony's Creole Seasoning at the table. So, based on personal preference only, I will probably add an additional tsp of Tony's and seasoned salt to the batter next time. I also used 1 cup of water in my batter and that worked out just right.\nThank you so much for sharing this recipe!"

Add your cut potatoes, seal it up, &amp; SHAKE for @1-2 minutes to coat all the fries. This will evenly coat all the fries w/batter &amp; save time in dipping them separately. When adding the fries to the hot oil... add them using tongs instead of your fingers... and in SMALL-MEDIUM batches. I took the tongs \"full bunches\" &amp; dropped them into the oil, let the batter set up ever so slightly, then separated them by shaking the bunches until they came apart @1 minute into frying. I'm also impatient &amp; while they didn't come out perfectly \"solo\" fries...the bunches were crisp.! *USED my deep fryer 375*F. for @ 9 minutes... a nice golden color. Also I ALWAYS use... onion powder &amp; garlic powder... NEVER onion or garlic salt.\n\nPrevious Next"

Stayed crispy even the next day :) Tip: Fry longer than you think to get the crispiness.

(Charleston is the #1 tourist destination in America and our wonderful food is one of the reasons.) \n\nThat said, the contributor of this recipe is definitely on the right track. As with any recipe, it needed tweaking according to our (or anyone's) personal tastes. We don't generally use recipes. I found this recipe when I was just looking to refresh my memory for some possible tips to make homemade fries better. (And to use the potatoes on-hand to keep from wasting them.) \n\nThe picture I attached was taken this morning--the day after making them and refrigerating the leftovers. They reheat very well for french fries in the oven or a toaster oven. I wouldn't recommend reheating in the microwave because they won't regain the crunchiness that way.\n\nI have a good bit of leftovers. Of course they won't be as crunchy, but they're so tasty that we'll probably chop them up a bit and cover with cheese, bacon, onion, butter, sour cream, gravy, or whatever else for a great version of a loaded baked potato with a twist! \n\nI didn't measure anything but here are a few of my \"tweaks\" that I either did or will do next time, having learned from this experience.
