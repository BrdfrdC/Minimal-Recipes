"reviewBody": "First, why would you use canned vegetables opposed to frozen? Frozen has all of the nutrients and none of the sodium and who knows what else. Used my culinary background to modify the method. Had a 1.8# freezer burned, skin on salmon fillet. Roasted it plain in oven. Used a bag of frozen peas and carrots, a pkg of frozen spinach and added two roasted sweet potatoes skin on. Much more nutrition as frozen veg is frozen immediately after harvest. Cooked the rice as I normally would. Bring to boil, lower temp just a bit, cook 30 minutes. Turn off heat and let sitar-30 minuted…never open lid. Blended eggs alone first, then added cooled roasted sweet potatoes. After that was combined I added all but rice. Took purée and mixed with rice. Dog loves it. Salmon adds the omega 3s that help with his arthritis."

"reviewBody": "My dog is extremely picky, has bad teeth so kibble is off the table, and doesn't like most canned dog foods either. Getting him to eat enough food has been a big cause of stress for me since we adopted him. Recently I learned that on top of this, his old \"favorite\" food is nutritionally incomplete, so I found this recipe. Before it would take hours of picking at his food to finish a meal, but with this recipe? He's OBSESSED, and so am I! He finishes eating in under a minute and his body language and mood seems revitalized, like his little body had been begging for nutrients and finally got what it needed. Honestly its a godsend, and I appreciate the peace of mind it gives me knowing he's getting good food I can trust and that he Loves it so much."

I used shredded fresh carrots I had, a couple of apples, a can of green beans that he loves and everything else according to the recipe. I gave him a taste when it was done and he gives it 4 paws!"
