This was my first time ever cooking treats at home. She drooled the entire time they were cooling. We don't feed treats often, so I threw most of them in a Ziploc and put them in the freezer. 10/10 will definitely be making these regularly!!"

(Not sure why recipe calls for greasing pan and then using parchment. I just use parchment and they come out fine.) I keep them in the freezer, and just pull out about 3 days worth at a time."

The main difference is that I score them before baking, then separate them and put into a dehydrator to remove all moisture. Perfect dog cookies!\nAdd-ins could include sesame seeds, finely grated apple or zucchini, etc."

So much healthier and cheaper than buying packaged \"Liver Bites.\" My photo shows the amount of bites the recipee makes for less than $5 of ingredients versus $16 for the pet shop version.\nI froze them in a ziplic baggie and take out a small amount as needed. Sometimes I even feed directly from the freezer.\nThe recipe doesn't say how long these last in the freezer or in the fridge. I keep mine in the fridge for a week."

My pup absolutely loves these treats."
