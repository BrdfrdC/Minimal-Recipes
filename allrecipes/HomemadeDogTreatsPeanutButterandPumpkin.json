Since they're human grade I was able to try them and I'm wondering if there's a way to make the pumpkin taste come through more? I added more peanut butter than the recipe called for so maybe that overwhelmed the pumpkin flavour."

Instead of canned pumpkin I used fresh which I cooked in a litte water with a beef cube added, then mashed. I also added about a teaspoon some liver treat \"powder\" (liver treats I blitz in a blender)."

"reviewBody": "If the FDA allows unhealthy ingredients in our food, I can only imagine what is allowed in pet food. Many labels will say, Made in the USA with imported ingredients. This is why I no longer feed my dog store bought dog treats or food. I have made many batches of these treats and she absolutely loves them. For me, I like to make them crunchy so they can help keep her teeth clean while she's gobbling down her treats. And, I never have to feel guilty for giving her highly processed snacks because these are super healthy. I highly recommend this recipe."

"reviewBody": "I used this recipe after having bought a certain brand of bones that had chickpea flour, pumpkin, peanut butter, etc. So I used chickpea flour instead of whole wheat. I also used 1 C pumpkin per other reviews. I added a full tsp of cinnamon. I didn't have to add the water, but I had to add more chickpea flour while rolling out the dough. During the process, the dough really smelled like chickpea flour to an overpowering extent, but after baking, the \"bones\" smelled amazing - like pumpkin muffins (almost). From the extra pumpkin, it was easier to cut the dough into strips instead of using a cookie cutter. My Chihuahua loves them! :) I gave four stars, because I really don't think whole wheat is any better for dogs than it is for people, and had to use twice the pumpkin as the recipe stated, but it's a good start."

"reviewBody": "I've made these about 5 times so far. I always add a little more pumpkin and peanut butter but otherwise follow the recipe. Then after kneading and rolling out the dough, I cut the dough into thin strips, place the strips on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper, and place them in the oven. Then after they're baked and cooled, I break or cut the strips into small pieces to use for dog treats or training treats and place them in the refrigerator (they can get moldy if kept out more than a few days). I see no need to bake them as dog bone shapes. My 55 lb. English Shepherd absolutely loves these small treats."

I added a third tbsp of peanut butter because I thought the dough was a little dry but ended up having to add more flour by the time I rolled out the dough. I suspect the dough would have been perfect if I hadn't altered the measurements. We still have a few milk bones in the box but Sarge won't eat them now that he has had these treats. Thanks again"

"reviewBody": "PRO TIP: The next time you buy store-bought treats, check for a little anti-moisture packet inside, save it, and pop it into whatever container you're storing these treats in. It will help increase the shelf life and keep moisture from molding any treats. Our dog absolutely LOVED these. I don't have a cute cookie cutter that fits for dog treats so i just used a cleaned out small glass jar (grey poupon anyone?) to cut out circles. Because of the shape, some of them kind of pop up and look like little flying saucers. The dog gets so excited eating these that she'll go in the backyard and roll for a bit after having one. That's the highest compliment she could have given me, as she only rolls when she's really happy. My fiance also says she tends to want to \"bite his hand off\" when he's giving her one of these treats. She just can't wait to get them in her mouf. They make the house smells surprisingly good when I'm baking them too. It's the cinnamon and peanut butter I think. Anyway, 5/5 stars. Love these, will continue to make them and keep refilling the doggie treat jar with these. They're fantastic."

I used the whole can of pumpkin and kept adding flour until it was the perfect consistency to roll the dough out. I baked them as recommended but after they cooled off I noticed they were still softish so I put them in the air fryer until they hardened up. Easy peasy."

Also replaced one egg with a flaxseed egg replacement (1 Tbsp flaxseed, 3 Tbsp water let sit until it becomes slimy). No fancy cutouts. Rolled out in a cookie sheet and cut up in squares with a pizza cutter. Doggies enjoyed!"
