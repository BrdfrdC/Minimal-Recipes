"reviewBody": "I chose this recipe because of the ingredients, but after I mixed them, I thought the dough was too wet and sticky. Sooooo this is what I did: I added whole wheat flour....probably 2 cups. This made it more what I was looking for. I then decided to roll it out between 2 sheets of parchment paper and use a small, round cookie cutter. I baked them at 350¬∞ for 40 minutes, flipping them for the last 15 minutes. They were definitely crunchy!! (I'm not sure why it's important to us to have them crunchy!! My dogs really don't care one bit!!) I actually ate one and It was good, but I think they need more flavor. I think, next time, I will add something. Maybe more peanut butter? A banana? Maybe some honey? If you make these this way please let us know if you add something and how it worked."

On the positive side.... My dogs loved them! Even the cat liked them! I kept them in the fridge and they were still good...and GONE... after a week! (I did give my dogs (2 large) more treats than usual because of the healthy ingredients!) I will definitely make them again and bake them a little longer. PS.. I feel so much better using these because of the healthy ingredients and the low cost!"

It would be nice to see in progress shots on this recipe and also to see how fine a grate is used. It's only enough to last me a few days for two dogs, so I don't make them as often as others."

"reviewBody": "My dog LOVES these. And they are so easy to make. ONE thing I'd like to point out; following the receipe, mine came out soft. Which is fine, but they went bad quickly, and don't travel well, say in a pocket for treats on a walk. The second time I baked them, I left them in the oven for 30 minutes and it still wasn't enough to get them crisp, like cookies. BUT, the third time, I then turned the oven off and left them in, now, PERFECTION. Everyone's oven is different so don't be shy about leaving them in as long as you need, to achieve the consistency you want. THEY ARE SO MUCH CHEAPER and HEALTHIER than storebought, these will be my \"go to\" dog treat forever!"
