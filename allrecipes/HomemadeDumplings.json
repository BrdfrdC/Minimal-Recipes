I cut up the butter and then mixed it by hand with the dry ingredients before adding the milk. I will definitely make them again!!"

"reviewBody": "recipe (mostly), added parsley flakes to dough mixture and turned out great. I rolled mine into about 1-2” balls and then pressed them down to about 1/4” thick before dropping into my chicken veg mixture. I used chicken broth instead of water and added some corn starch to thicken it up some. Note: need to cook dumplings until they sink into the soup/stew mixture to determine when they are done. We served over mashed potato’s. Delicious."

"reviewBody": "I've made this recipe twice now, the first time I used them in chicken soup, when I dropped them they almost immediately fell apart and ruined the soup. I was cautious to try this recipe again but I figured I must have messed something up so I watched the video and followed the recipe exactly. second time around with a new batch of soup, they held up better but I made sure not to make the same mistake as last time, I tried just one as a sample let it cook the full time I pulled it out to try it and it was so soft and mushy. Maybe that's how they're supposed to be and maybe people like soft slimy dumplings but I'm used to a firmer texture and a little bit of a bite. I'm still on the search for a good dumpling recipe."
