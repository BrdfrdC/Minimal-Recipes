"reviewBody": "This was a great recipe, since I've been wanting to try gnocchi for a while, and the last person in my house recently developed gluten intolerance. I scaled down the recipe a bit because I had less leftover baked potato than in the recipe but it turned out fine. Really good in alfredo and creamy sauces. After they rose to the surface while cooking, I seared them in an oiled pan. Amazing! Tip though, they do not freeze well."
