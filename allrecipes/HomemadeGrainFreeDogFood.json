My dog weighs 105 lbs so not sure how much he would need?? Thanks so much for taking the time to share this recipe!"

She has much more energy and it seems to be helping her fur hot spots she has developed in her older years. I put just shy of a tablespoon of olive oil and sunflower oil mixed in with each serving. This is what has shown signs of her fur improvement. I would have to say she is a fan of this meal. I am happy to see her happy üòä"

I wasn‚Äôt happy, either way it took Buster at least 2/3 weeks to stop with the diarrhea, but the throwing up stopped sooner! This is a great recipe for your dog, please allow your dog enough time to get all the bad out and let the food in! Can‚Äôt do anything to his system in just 4 days, it took I‚Äôm guessing years to get in his system! I hope this helps. I love my Buster üê©"
