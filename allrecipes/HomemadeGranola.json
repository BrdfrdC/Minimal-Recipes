Of course I tweaked the recipe a bit due to availability of ingredients, I added walnuts to the oats, omitted the nutmeg (didn't have any), used sweetened, shredded coconut, and olive oil for the oil. It turned out fabulous! Perfectly golden and sweet. I didn't think it was too sweet at all with one cup of brown sugar (I used dark), the flavors were perfect. Not to mention my whole house had the enticing smell of brown sugar and vanilla wafting throughout! A big plus! I stirred the oats every 15 minutes as instructed, but I only cooked them for around 50 minutes, I think the full hour would have been a bit too much. I added dried cranberries once cooled and it is perfection! Thank you so much Jaime for the amazing recipe! I definitely will be making this again and again!"

I tend to cut down on the oil and have added applesauce as a replacement with good results. I typically at least double the cinnamon and add pumpkin seeds and/or sunflower seeds, and I put the raisins in at the beginning because I prefer them dried out and chewy. Also add dried cranberries once it comes out of the oven (45 minutes does it rather than the hour recommended in the recipe)."

Mix it then pour it over flour dusted oats, dried cranberries &amp; raisins &amp; chopped almonds. Stir it while pouring the mixture. Then I use my hands and work the mixture into the oats then I add just a little brown sugar to taste. I bake mine with a very watchful eye at 400 degrees. I test it for crunchiness. I always make this recipe at the end of the month when I am out of box cereal and I want some cereal. I always have theses Items in my pantry so it is nice to have when your out of box cereal. I forgot to add some salt."

"reviewBody": "I changed it around a little, but loved the recipe!! I used 1/2 brown sugar-1/2 pure maple syrup (cooked covered in the microwave for 3 mins., prior to adding to the oat mixture). I added 1/2 teaspoon of maple flavoring to the 1/2 cup of water. I used whole pecans, hazelnuts, sliced almonds, and whole flaxseeds (just my preference). I too, thought a teaspoon of salt enhanced the flavor.\nTo cook it, I separated the mixture onto 2 cookie sheets, lined in foil and sprayed with cooking spray. I placed both pans into the preheated **375 degree** oven for 12 mins. stirring after 6 mins. I then lowered the heat to 300 degrees, stirred it once more, and returned it to a 300 degree oven for an additional 6 mins. I then turned the oven off completely, do not open the oven door to check or stir it again. The trick is to leave it in the oven until the oven with the granola inside, has cooled down completely.. This cuts the baking time to 18 mins., and makes it all very crunchy, but not overdone! When it comes out of the oven, completely cooled, I added white raisins, and craisins. So very yummy. \nOne last note...after removing the cooled granola from the oven (BEFORE adding the craisins/raisins) reserve 1-2 cups and add chocolate, or carob chips, to to the reserved granola, it's perfect on top ice cream or frozen yogurt!!!"

"reviewBody": "I didn't have flaked coconut, so didn't use it. Like others reviewers I changed it up a bit. I added about a tbsp and a half of honey, and used virgin coconut oil instead of regular oil. I added dried cranberries, yogurt covered raisins, chopped pecans, and chopped almonds. It was a nice granola, but have made better. Google \"Lazy granola\", in my opinion, that recipe tastes better!"

And I made some for gifts for teachers at my sons' preschool and was asked for the recipe, and now they make it all the time too."

"reviewBody": "The cup of water threw me for a loop because I've never seen a recipe that calls for that much--but it made it clump better which is exactly what I was hoping for. Great, sweet flavor. I added dried cranberries and chopped almonds at the end and omitted the nutmeg. This will now be my go to recipe. Thanks for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "Just made this recipe, actually made a variation. I only used 1 cup of oats,(I cut it down because I didn't want to waste the oats if I screwed it up!) I added steal cut oats, Chai seed and Hemp seed as well as the wheat germ. I didn't have coconut, but substituted the oil for coconut oil. I didn't use brown sugar, I used maybe a 1/3 cup (all that I had) of coconut sugar and about a 1/4 cup or so of organic maple syrup and some stevia. Also cut down the spices. I added dried cranberries, pumpkin seeds,and almonds. It came out great. I've never made granola before and used this as a guide. I'm surprised more people don't make their own, so easy and good. You can see I changed a lot from a very good recipe and worked with what I had."
