I added the thinly sliced apples (great!) and did not use the cheesecloth, instead just dropped everything in. Used ground allspice instead of berries. For Christmas I used glass coffee mugs and added spiced rum to the batch (two shots per person - strong but good!) and more maple syrup. Guests still rave about it. THANK YOU for this recipe."

Good for your Designated Drivers at holiday parties, too!\r\nHere are some tips:\r\nIf leaving it to sit, remove spices so it doesn't get too strong. I put allspice berries and cloves in a tea ball! Don't leave orange/lemon peels in too long or it will become bitter. Add a splash of lemon juice if no lemons available. Would be pretty served with orange &amp; lemon peels and cranberries floating in it.\r\n\r\nFor a very special treat, we use caramel syrup (like sundae topping) drizzled in a clear (\"fancy\") glass mug and topped with whipped cream. This will make the kids (and honestly, most adults too) go crazy. Better than a Caramel Apple Cider drink you'll pay $5 for at a coffee shop!"

Had to leave out the allspice and I used 1 tsp ground cinammon instead of a stick and 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of maple syrup. The ground cinammon clumps at first, but disolves as the cider gets hot. When I cut the peels,I made sure to use as little of the white part as possible to avoid bitterness. Some of the peels were almost translucent they were so thin. Mixed with red wine, this cider makes an excellent vin brulè as well. Enjoy!"

I followed the recipe exactly except that I could not find whole allspice and had to substitute ground. I think I ended up using 1/2 teaspoon. This smelled wonderful while it was cooking, but the end result was a little too tart for me. I would probably make this again but make an effort to add some more sweetness."

"reviewBody": "I love this apple cider recipe. I tried it at home first and really liked it. So then I placed it in my crockpot and took it to work and various potlucks. When using my crockpot, I increase the juice to 64 oz instead of 48 oz and double the cloves and allspice along. I place my crockpot on high for 30-40 minutes and then let it simmer until it smells delicious. Some events I take an extra bottle of apple cider and add after it is half gone then turn crockpot setting to high for 15-20 minutes and back to simmer. If I am going to a big potluck I will quadruple this recipe. Happy Cooking &amp; Baking!"

As a previous poster mentioned, the citrus tends to make the cider bitter after a while. It's important to add the spices that are mentioned. If you use ground spices as a substitute, it won't dissolve quite right and you'll have a layer of spices on the top."
