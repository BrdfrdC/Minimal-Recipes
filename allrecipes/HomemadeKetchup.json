Being very conservative on the ingredients (1/4 cup of sugar) while making 5x the amount."

It's got a more tomato and \"spice\" (not spicy) flavor than store brands, but honestly I feel like it tastes the way ketchup was supposed to taste...\n\nI used home grown tomatoes that I just weighed to equal what the recipe called for (I did double the recipe just fine). \n\nThings I changed (each of these things below I did twice as much of, but wanted to base it off the original recipe for you):\n\n1 Tbsp oyster sauce added \n1 cup honey (replaced the sugar with this)\nNo water added.\nApple Cider Vinegar (ACV) instead of white vinegar.\n1 Tsp of garlic instead of 1/2 tsp.\n\nI also did not cook this in the crock pot, but rather a stock pot. Took around 2-2.5 hours because I doubled the recipe for canning. I was disappointed to find that I only ended up getting 6.5 jelly jars of ketchup even with doubling this! That said... I'll just make more next time. I do not claim to be a canning expert, but went off the instructions in my canning book which had me can the jars in a water bath for 10 minutes. Turned out great!"

"reviewBody": "I've been making this for about 3 yrs now. Usually with my own tomato sauce I make from what I grow every season. I've have made it with store bought but like my own tomato product better. I went with original recipe (using sugar sub) but thought it was too 'blah' for me so....of course I changed more to my taste by adding bay leaf, more clove, fresh grated garlic, about 1 tsp of Jamaican jerk seasoning, fresh ground coriander, etc., etc. I too use a combo of diff vinegar's as well as smoked paprika and a 2 inch ribbon of anchovy paste (from the tube) for more layers of flavor. I cook on stove top as and it makes reducing quicker. If your end result is a bit too acidic - add 1/2 tsp of baking soda (it will foam up initially.) As for a thickening agent; I bloom 1/2 T of beef gelatin and it actually gives this more body. I have potassium sorbate pellets (preservative) which I add 1/2 tsp along with 1/2 tsp vitamin C crystals. I've not encountered any issue on the canning front by adding those 2 ingredients and I only put the HOT ketchup in a HOT sterile canning jar and it seals itself. I do store the few pint jars in the fridge and it gets used up in 6 months or so. Other than on burgers or fries, I use for CJ's unsloppy joes and my own recipe for a Catalina style dressing or any recipe with a ketchup base. Well...call me nuts but I dig making my own condiments. Thanks for a great starting point that you can translate into your own masterpiece. Yum!"

I think you could use your imagination and make the ketchup YOU love, with little effort. Do wait to taste for spice adjustments, as the recipe suggests. I tasted when finished and thought I would need to add salt and maybe some pepper, but after cooling overnight it was perfect!"

I almost missed the cayenne (I put 1/4 tsp) because it's not listed in the ingredients. Everything else I followed exactly. Anyway, the first day, I was tasting a bitterness from the apricots, but the next day it was PERFECT! Nice and thick too! I'll be making this regularly, because sugar or artificial sweetener is in all the store brands. This amount (about 3 cups) should last me a year, so I'm freezing it in portions."

There is no possible way, anyone would be able to tell, if I put this ketchup on your cheeseburger. The flavor is amazing! The richness and color....beautiful!

I used whole peeled tomatoes and put them in my food processor before putting them in a crockpot. I seldom use white vinegar as I personally believe it‚Äôs better for cleaning than cooking. I‚Äôll swap out the white vinegar for apple cider vinegar, and lessen the amount. Also, reduce the sugar. Remember, these can be adjusted to taste after it cooks for a while. Other measurements seemed to make a nice tasting ketchup."

I also use honey in place of the sugar.\nI made this at work yesterday and had to bake it in the oven instead of a slow cooker. It worked out great also. 6 hours @ 325 degrees checking on it every now and then.\nMy neice asks for this exclusively now. Lol. \nThanks again."

Then ran them through a blender. Then continued with the recipe.\n\nI used organic raw sugar instead of regular white sugar.\n\nI didn't use onions because my son doesn't like them. But next time I'll chop them finely in the food processor and saute them before adding to recipe while he is not looking!\n\nI didn't have whole cloves, so I used ground cloves instead.\n\nI didn't strain anything out because after blending and cooking down everything was very smooth."

I also have made tomato soup with this ketchup . Wonderful!"

I would recommend only using 1/3 Splenda instead of 2/3 white sugar...\nHonestly I would double this.... Other than the Spenda, I followed the recipe exactly. After 1 hour of simmer, I tasted great an my wife used half of it to make Sloppy Joes - they were assume; but don't ask, I don't know what recipe she used. Even though my old crockpot has a \"High\", \"Medium\" and \"Low\", it appears that all of those are \"Burn Everything this Person Puts in Me.\" So obviously, I did not watch this every minute and my first batched burned after 3 hours on low... So to make an even longer story short, I have a new crockpot, and my wife found a great price on fresh tomatoes, I spent my day canning tomatoes. So now I'm making this again with fresh tomatoes. And after 2 hours of simmering it is unbelievable. (So, to make a long story short, make it, double it...)"

It was alot of work to do the seeding and peeling, but well worth it for how wonderful the taste turned out. Added 3/4 cup of water (instead of the specified 1/2 c), used apple cider vinegar since I didn't have the distilled white vinegar, and added a little lemon juice. Used Xylitol in place of the sugar (adding maybe a couple of tbsp extra since the Xylitol is not quite as sweet as sugar). While cayenne was not listed as an ingredient, it was mentioned in the directions, so I added 1/4 tsp. Placed all in my new Instant Pot, on the slow cooker setting, but after 9 hrs it still hadn't thickened much, so put it in a pot on the stove on low, and cooked it for another 1-1 1/2 hrs til It was reduced and got very thick. Fantastic taste!"

I used Contadina style crushed tomatoes and followed the recipe, except, I didn't add any water, and I used 2 Tbsp more vinegar and 1/8 tsp ground cloves. I didn't have time for the crock pot version so I brought it to a slow bubble over low heat and shut it off to cool. It was really good. The consistency was a little runny, but I think it would be even better cooked long and slow in the crockpot. I am thinking of trying applesauce in place of the sugar. I can't wait to try using different spices and maybe even 1/2 wine, 1/2 vinegar too. The directions mention cayenne pepper, but the ingredients didn't list, so I added 1/4 tsp. I didn't even need to blend this. I might try making a hotter version to go on baked beans or burgers. It makes 2 quarts ."

I opted to just freeze mine since I was concerned that the lemon juice would change the taste. \n\nI used fresh Roma tomatoes. I blanched them, peeled them, removed some seeds and diced them.

To freeze my tomatoes for making sauces, I rinse the tomatoes, then cut them in chunks LEAMING the skins on and put the chunks in the blender. I pusle the blender till the tomatoes are all chopped up not quite pureed. I pour each batch of tomatoes into a large soup pan and cook till the tomatoes are done and have reduced a little. When cooled I put the tomatoes in 1 pint containers and put a lid on and write what is in the containers on the lids. Then I put the containers in the freezer in a single layer till they are frozen. When frozen I stack the containers . I think I will freeze my ketchup in 1/2 pint containers since we don't use a lot of ketchup. Thank you for the recipe."

I didn't heed the instructions to adjust flavorings when cooked and cold, so I was playing with more vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, a touch of sriracha, as it was simmering, doubting just how good this was going to turn out. At the end of the cooking time, all the flavors had blended beautifully! It does taste a bit like Heinz! I did not use my crock pot, since, if I was to stir it every hour or so, it was just as easy to simmer on the stove. I showed my husband the starting level of the sauce in relation to the handle rivets &amp; told him to watch out for when it had reduced by about half. We both gave it a little stir whenever we went through the kitchen. It also did not take 12 hours on the stove - only about 6 or 7. It even thickens up a bit more after it's been refrigerated. We like it!"

Rather than add sugar to cut the acidity I put a whole, huge, washed but not peeled carrot in (or a couple not so huge) and let it 'stew' with everything else. It massively reduces the acidity. I throw away the carrot before serving because the carrot has the acid in it if you will. This works with anything that has a tomato base and there's no added sugar. :o)"

Blend until smooth, and add to the rest of the crock pot. I've made catsup this way for years and we all love it.

I used only organic ingredients.\n\nI reduced the crushed tomato ketchup to about half the original volume, and then strained the ketchup as directed. After straining, I found the ketchup not quite as thick as I like, so I strained the ketchup again using cheese cloth to reduce the moisture content. \n\nThe ketchup was sent out as Christmas gifts together with Bread and Butter pickles (FoodWishes.Com recipe) and sweet pickle relish (The Big Easy Chef recipe).

No, I'm remaking it because it was too soupy and by that I mean it saturated the buns of both hamburger and hotdog. Not exactly conducive to making a good ketchup. I also wanted a recipe minus tomato paste. Came to the conclusion, you need to omit the 1/2 cup of water entirely! It makes it too runny, also change the distilled vinegar from 3/4 cup to 1/2 cup. This keeps the ketchup tasting like ketchup without being too bitter and also helps keep it from being runny. I used diced tomatoes and then finished pulverizing the tomatoes using my immersion blender, a bit messy, but worked in a pinch because my blender is in need of a gasket. I'll update it once this new batch is done."

"reviewBody": "This is very comparable to name brand ketchup, but of course it's better because it's from scratch. :) I've made this twice now, and it's WAY too sweet. Both times, I added more tomatoes because I was going to freeze it and wanted a large quantity; however, it's so sweet that I had to add a lot more tomatoes. If you're cooking this in the slow cooker, it also takes a lot longer to cook down this way.\n\nThe first time I made it, I got tired of waiting for it and put it on the stove in a soup pot instead. It ended up caramelizing the tomatoes, and it was delicious! I used it with a chicken finger recipe that called for spicy ketchup. Even my picky son loved it!"

"reviewBody": "Unbelievably good! I used about 4 pounds of garden fresh tomatoes, different varieties, blanched and peeled, instead of the canned stuff, and omitted the water. I got impatient with the slow cooker, so I finished it off on the stove. The taste develops best after it has been in the refrigerator for a couple of days. Nobody wants to eat the store-bought stuff anymore."
