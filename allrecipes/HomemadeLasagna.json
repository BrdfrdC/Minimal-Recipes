I also only added about a half a teaspoon of salt. I can my own Italian tomato mix and then to thicken the sauce up a little bit I used a can of tomato paste. We all like the noodles to be a little firmer, so I don‚Äôt pre-cook them."

"reviewBody": "Lasagna is a 2-day recipe for me: sauce is made on day 1, and recipe is finished, assembled, and baked the 2nd day. Sauce turned out very well, but I did adapt to our tastes a bit. Substituted a can of El Pato Hot Tomato Sauce (was a great addition and another layer of flavor), added a few fennel seeds, a glug of red wine, and bumped up the basil and oregano (all personal taste). I know, I know, I changed it, but lasagna is a lot of work, this was fairly expensive, and I didn‚Äôt want any flavor issues; I know our taste preferences. When boiling your noodles, count out 12, don‚Äôt add the 16-oz box because I did so, and ended up throwing away 7 noodles which weren‚Äôt needed. Could be the cottage cheese has a bit more moisture than ricotta, but I used it, and although it tasted really good, it took longer to bake than the timing in the recipe. I‚Äôm happy with the way this turned out, but I must say that I still prefer Italian sausage over ground pork."

The only tweaks I did were to NOT add the salt (the hubby and I use little or no salt and figured we'd get enough from the ingredients... and we did!), added a bit of pepper flakes and used oven ready lasagna noodles. We loved it and I even passed the recipe along to friends on FB. Bravo on a great recipe and thanks for sharing it!"

It adds a warmth to the sauce and everyone always seems to love it and they're always surprised when they find out what it is. \n\nThank you for this recipe! I will be making it again."

I wanted to make the old fashioned lasagna sauce again, so I gave this recipe a try. I was not disappointed! It tasted exactly as I remembered. I made this recipe exactly as written, I just added pepper to the sauce, and I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and only 1 egg instead of 2. I will be using this recipe! It's a winner, and it's not that much harder than using spaghetti sauce."

I loosely followed the recipe...3/4 lb 90% lean beef, 1 mild italian sausage, added onions and olive oil before cooking the meat, used ricotta rather than cottage cheese, added some fresh oregano and basil to the sauce, and replaced the sugar with a few grains of cardamom (like 10) which give a sweet taste without the sugar, and made fresh pasta instead of boxed. Using fresh pasta I researched whether to cook it or not before putting it in the oven and opted not to. I think that was a good choice, it kept the layers from being too runny and slippery when served. Everyone LOVED it."
