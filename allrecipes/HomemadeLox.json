This was created after much trial and error following what I found in other recipes. I want to say something like I stood on the shoulders of giants, but yes that goes a bit too far. I have to say thanks for the nice person, Alan, that posted and absolutely beautiful photo. Food is love. Feed love to those around you and you'll find it comes back to you. Life is too short, enjoy!"

"reviewBody": "Love Lox, Gravlax...even with Kosher salt this was a bit salty on it's own. Perhaps when eaten with something else to tame it, this would be more palatable. The recipe didn't say to remove the skin, so I left it on. Don't do that, remove the skin. It seemed the slices I tasted with the skins on were more salty than the ones I had removed the skins after the salt process. Will do again because it's just too cool to have this homemade! Thank you for sharing!"

Lox is never smoked and is strictly brined as the curing process; fantastic recipe for traditional lox that tastes just like the real deli product. Gravlax is very similar but would have juniper berries among other specific flavorings."

"reviewBody": "Good basic proportions for the lox of my east coast childhood, if you ignore the optional smoke flavor. Lox is not smoked, so that would make it unlike lox. Although Nova Scotia smoked salmon is sometimes called lox, to quote Epicurious, “Smoked salmon is cured or brined, then smoked. Lox is cured, but not smoked.”"

"reviewBody": "Your recipe is excellent. However, it’s Gravlax not Lox. ( Lox is either cold smoked or smoked not just smoke flavored). One point I would strongly suggest for any cured Salmon, DO NOT use farm raised only Wild Salmon should be cured for Gravlax. Try adding a liberal amount of fresh dill when curing."

An inexpensive alternative from store bought lox or smoked salmon, and made exactly the way you like it."
