I think 2 cups milk would have been sufficient and I'll try that the next time. I didn't read any reviews until after I made it and would agree that the Parmesan gave it a gritty texture but I like the flavor it gave the sauce. I did not use the crumb topping."

Then I use the powder from that box instead of any shredded cheeses. This recipe ends up WAY too salty after I add salt and pepper to taste, so I add a cup of white sugar to balance to flavor (I used brown sugar once and it was even better, but my recipe is white sugar). I wanted to give this recipe 10/10 stars, but I guess 5/5 will do, because they both add up to 1 when you do all the math."

"reviewBody": "I thought it came out very good for my first mac and cheese. I do not make these types of dishes for health reasons, but it was my son in laws birthday and one of his favorite foods. With that said, I thought it came out excellent and so did all who ate it. At first I felt the sauce needed more milk as the recipe suggested which I did after cooking on the stovetop, then when i poured it into the cassarole dish, I thought I made amistake because it looked too soupy. However, after cooking in the oven for about 30 minutes it certainly firmed up to a perfect consistency; not too dry, and not too wet. Personally, I would have liked to jazz this up a bit more in the flavor department. I thought the filling was very one dimensional meaning very cheesy but that's it. I think I would like to see some other elements added to it whether some type of pork flavoring, vegetable, or a bit of heat maybe with a touch of cayenne pepper. However, that is my preference. For a conventional Mac and Cheese, this recipe hit the mark. Just don't think about counting calories LOL."

"reviewBody": "My family of 3 enjoyed this recipe. I served it alongside grilled cheeseburgers and French fries for a quick &amp; easy weekend meal. I altered the order of the steps to reduce the amount of cookware to wash. First, I used Panko breadcrumbs that I browned with the butter in my LC braiser and set aside when browned. Then I made the roux and bechamel in the same braiser while the pasta was cooking in another pot. I added the al dente macaroni to the cheese sauce in the braiser, mixed well, topped with a little extra shredded cheese and the browned Panko breadcrumbs and finished in the oven. All together I used about 1 1/3 blocks of sharp cheddar and good 1/3 of the wedge of Parmigiano-Reggiano. A couple nights later to serve leftovers as meatless main course with a green salad, I made a cream sauce reduction ( #ChefJohn #FoodWishes) added a little extra cheddar and parm and a few good dashes of Sriracha sauce. Warmed low &amp; slow on stovetop until combined and hot. The Panko and cheese topping from the original cooking melted deliciously into the new sauce. Result was thick &amp; bubbly &amp; gooey &amp; cheesy. Thank you for a great recipe - so very versatile."

I decreased the milk( combo of 1/2 whipping cream and 1/2 evaporated milk) by about 2/3 cups. I added seasoning to the mixture as cheese melted. Mixture of 1/2 tsp each - garlic powder, onion powder, Old Bay. Dash of salt and about 1/4 tsp ground pepper. Added more seasoning to taste. We like Old Bay. Used Penne pasta instead of elbow. For the top— I increased the bread crumbs by 1/2 c , butter increased by 1 tsp. Baked about 30 min We all enjoyed it."

Grocery prices the way they are, I just lost $40 and still need to come up with another dish for my family!"

Also, there is way too much milk in this recipe. I doubled the recipe (and yes I doubled everything, no mistakes) and found that the macaroni was drowned in the sauce. A quick reference to several other Mac and cheese recipes showed that there's 1.5 times as much milk as there should be. So instead of eating this a soup, I had to discard a lot of the cheese sauce. Once I added salt on the plate, the Mac and cheese was fine but I'm just left wondering how much richer this would have tasted if so much cheese sauce wasn't wasted. Also, forgetting to include salt in the recipe is inexcusable."
