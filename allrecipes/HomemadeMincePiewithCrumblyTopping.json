"reviewBody": "We couldn't find a ready-made mince pie at any of the nearby grocery stores this year, so we decided to make one from scratch using this recipe. This turned out to be the best mince pie I've ever tasted! Even non-mince pie lovers said it was delicious. I made it with the following changes:\n\n*I substituted candied orange peel for the grapefruit peel. \n\n*Instead of half a ground graham cracker, I added a whole ground graham cracker to the filling, because my filling needed thickening. The result was perfect thickness once it had cooled. \n\n*I substituted currants for 1/2 cup of the raisins.\n\n*I used a graham cracker crust.\n\nThose were the only changes I made. I used red delicious apples and made the filling the day before. I kept the filling in the fridge, then the following day I put it in the pie shell and baked it. After baking, I just let the pie sit at room temp until serving the next day. It did fine at room temp. It sliced beautifully and held its shape. This pie was very easy to make, and it was absolutely delicious. We'll definitely never go back to the store bought or \"from a jar\" mince pies again."

"reviewBody": "My hubby asked for mince pie, wasn't familiar, tried this. This is apple/plumped raisin pie with a streusel topping. The raisins are sooo plump!! A bit of a rum raisin taste, without rum. Quite yummy! It was kind of a lot of work, mostly dicing. \n\nSubbed 1/2 lemon,1/2 orange dried jarred peel so I didn't waste a dollar on a grapefruit peel. I used 1/2 granny, 1/2 red and added 1/4 cup brown sugar. Skip the granny smith all together, too bitter for this....go red apple.\n\nSooo...good pie, 2-3 hours work, if this is the kind of pie you're craving:)"

"reviewBody": "Made it per recipe except I used dried cranberries for 1/3 of the raisins and added a T. of Grand Marnier for extra flavor. I used Splenda/brown blend for the streusel topping. Next time I'd use less sugar in the fruit, as it was a bit too sweet, and add some nuts. It's a lot of peeling and chopping, but really good pie."

I removed about a cup of liquid after cooking the apples but before adding the sugar. I also added 2 heaping soup spoons of rice flour. The pies were wonderful!"

I don't even like mince pie and I love this one. The only substitution I did was swapping nutmeg for the cloves, because I didn't have any on hand. It was delicious. It's a good thing I made two, because I'm taking the extra to Grandma's for Christmas."
