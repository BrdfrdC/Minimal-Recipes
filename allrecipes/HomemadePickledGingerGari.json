"reviewBody": "I peeled ginger with a serrated grapefruit spoon and then sliced it thin with a mandoline-- I think the key to getting thinner slices is to use very light pressure when using the mandoline-- the thickness varied greatly based on this. I boiled the rice wine vinegar and sugar, rinsed the salt from the ginger slices, and then added the sliced ginger to the pot of vinegar-- and let it all cool (as I was concerned about pouring boiling liquid into a glass jar). When still warm I transferred it all to a jar and let it sit out to cool completely before refrigerating. I've made this twice now- -- the recipe is spot on and it's great having pickled ginger on hand as I often forget to ask for more when I pick up sushi."

I had expected that it would be more wiggly so-to-speak, like the ginger that comes with sushi. Maybe I need to cook the ginger and then pickle it. I don‚Äôt know. For crunchy pickled ginger this is a fairly decent recipe."

"reviewBody": "This is a great base recipe that can be adjusted based on preference. We like our pickled ginger more on the sweet side so I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup and one scoop of Stevia extract. To get the desired pink color, I added one leaf of red cabbage in the vinegar when it was simmering. I tore it into pieces, cooked it down and sieved it out with a wire mesh strainer right before pouring into the ginger. When picking out the ginger at the store look for ones that have a pink blushing, they are easier to peel and slice, and are more tender once pickled."

"reviewBody": "The pink color has nothing to do with the quality of your rice vinegar. Only very young ginger will turn pink during the pickling process. The ginger root you buy at your supermarket is not young ginger. I doubt if any companies are using coloring to create the pink color, unless it is really cheap ginger. Any Japanese-made pickled gingr will be young ginger. If it really bugs you that it's not pink, try to find young ginger - you will probably have to go to an Asian market or a large public market in a major metropolitan area with a large Asian population. I like mine just fine white. This is a great recipe, just the way I make mine. You will love the taste, don't worry that it's not pink!"

"reviewBody": "It is nice to know how to make our own pickled ginger. I sliced the ginger thin when it was raw, then added it to the boiling vinegar mixture and simmered it for about 5 minutes. I then put it in to the jar, cooled it, and stored in the refridgerator. We used it the same day with our sushi...perfect!"
