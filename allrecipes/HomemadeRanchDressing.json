I also did not use the seasoned salt. \"I quite like this recipe with a few changes of my own and from those of other reviewers. First I decreased the sour cream to only 1/4 c. as I thought the sour cream flavor was a little overpowering. I added 1/2c. buttermilk to the mayo and used 1/8 tsp. seasoned salt in place of the regular salt, I also added 1/4 tsp. vinegar as had been suggested and upped the garlic powder to 1/2 tsp. With these changes I gave it 5 stars. Thanks for the recipe, it is wonderful!"

"reviewBody": "I hardly ever write reviews, but I read them obsessively. I also hate when people rate a recipe and include a multitude of changes made to the original recipe…. Having said that: I subbed Greek yogurt for the sour cream (simply because that’s what I had on hand) and cut the Mayo down to a little more than half a cup. I took over reviewers advice and made up the difference with half a cup of “faux” buttermilk (half cup milk and a tblsp of white vinegar). I tripled the parsley, garlic, and I onion powder because #spices and used fresh chives chopped very finely. Left out the dill this time as it didn’t fit the flavor profile I was using the ranch for (southwest egg rolls) \nSoooo good. Stupid good. Upsettingly good. Will for sure make again. And again. And again."

I did as others recommended and made up some “buttermilk” to thin it out. I then added a small sprinkle of all the seasonings and a sprinkle of garlic salt. If it weren’t for this base recipe, it would not have turned out, so it’s definitely At least a 4 star recipe!"

I do thin it out with a couple of tablespoons of water, and I add a tablespoon of vinegar to tang up the flavor.\n\nIn my opinion, the easiest way to make this is to put all of the ingredients into smoothie or protein drink shaker with the little metal mixer ball in in it. Screw on the lid, make sure the pouring spout cap is snapped on tightly, shake well and you've got this delicious ranch dressing!"

Loved the flavour but found it a bit runny. Third time, I made it “as is” (but with fresh herbs) and *added* buttermilk until it was a consistency I liked. Bingo. People actually groan with delight and disbelief when they eat it. But no matter how you make it, substitutions or not, the recipe is a keeper."

But since I have been discovering just how many things I can make at home (think dry onion soup, again from this site!) i thought I would try this. And score!! We do double the garlic (just because Im a garlic lover) and use 3/4 cups of mayo (we never seem to let it set long enough before dinner to let the flavors meld) but I'm sure it's awesome even as originally wrote!

If you want a dressing like consistency for salad greens, use less mayo (or skip it) and just use sour cream and buttermilk. My husband and I like to add some Tabasco sauce or some cayenne pepper to it occasionally to give it a it of bite, to change it up. Some days I'll add some fresh Lime juice and use an avocado in place of some of the mayo and the buttermilk to make Tex-Mex ranch."

I add lemon juice instead, which adds tang and brightens the dressing up. \n\nI use Just Mayo vegan mayo, which I think is way too vinegary, so, I tried different things, to try and counter act it. I tried adding a few tbs of apple juice , and it worked!\n\nOne might also use pickle juice, instead of apple juice, to counter act an overly vinegary taste, and use up pickle juice that most people just throw out, when the pickles are gone.\n\nI tried green olive brine, as a diluter &amp; salt additive, and it tones down the vinegar taste as well, adds depth of flavor, and uses up olive brine, that most people just throw away, when the olives are gone.\n\n So, there are many different ways one could tweak this recipe to their exact liking. \n\n I cook cubed potatoes for potato salad, in the diluted olive brine, and they come out tasty. \n\nI cook pasta for pasta salad in diluted pickle juice, and it adds more flavor. \n\n I just didn't like wasting a whole jar of pickle juice, and olive brine, so I tried to invent ways to use them up. \n\nOne can also use pickle juice as the liquid in meatloaf/veggie loaf. \n\nOne can make a savory bread, by using it in place of water, when making bread dough, add some herbs to"
