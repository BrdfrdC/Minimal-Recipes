"reviewBody": "This is my second time making this recipe, and I really do like it. The only real change that I make is to only use one cup of water. When making the sauce, I mix all the ingredients in a bowl first. After sauteing the onions and garlic for about three minutes in a medium high heat skillet, I add the ground beef and fry it off, and drain the fat. After adding the sauce it's only a matter waiting for the sauce to reduce. I cook mine in a cast iron skillet and don't have any brown bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. So no need for the extra cup of water that would only serve to dilute the sauce. Change the recipe to only one cup of water and I'll give it five duds stars."

I think not adding as much water and pre-sauteing the vegetables kept it from needing to simmer for 40 minutes. I also used no sugar ketchup. I split regular mustard and dijon. I love that I can make some childhood favorites and cut out the sugar! Thanks for this recipe! It is a keeper!"

I, too, used only one tbsp of brown sugar and it was still sweet so I don’t recommend the 2 tbsp. The cayenne pepper is a must! I used one tsp of it. Definitely is a keeper!"

"reviewBody": "The sauce was much too sweet for us. Easily fixed w vinegar &amp; hot sauce. The sauce was at the correct consistency before adding the water. I already omitted the cup of water w the veggies because it served no purpose. I wish I had not added the other cup of water to the sauce because it tasted like VERY watered down sauce. Luckily, I heated it up in a saucepan before adding to the cooked IMPOSSIBLE plant based ground \"meat\", to melt the sugar (which was not needed being so sweet), so I was able to fix it with double the sauce ingredients. Minus the water of course. Even then it was still watery but at least edible. Also, always cook your veggies until almost done to carmelize BEFORE the meat. Remove from pan, add meat, cook half way or so, then add veggies. Never add water to sauteed veggies, you'll just end up with soggy, no flavour veggies."

"reviewBody": "This was really tasty with just the right amount of sweet and savory flavors. I did throw in a jalapeño pepper since my green bell pepper was too small once I cut out the bruised parts. I had to adjust my seasoning and spices since I used 2 lbs of beef (they’re sold in 1 lb bricks and I didn’t want to put the half pound leftover back in the fridge). As other reviewers have noted, if it’s too soupy, that means it’s not done cooking. Don’t rely on the cook time since that will vary depending on a lot of factors. Don’t turn the heat off after 45 mins if you still see liquids. How lean your meat is also matters. I only had 85% lean ground beef so I had to skim off a lot of grease/fat in order for my Sloppy Joe to not be a soupy mess. My husband and I really enjoyed this on homemade hamburger buns (another Chef John recipe) and a slice of cheddar cheese. Will be making this again!"
