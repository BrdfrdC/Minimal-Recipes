} ,{
"@type": "HowToStep"
,"text": "Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly. Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty) and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down. You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt."
} ,{
"@type": "HowToStep"
,"text": "Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings."

"reviewBody": "A great recipe! Definitely cook this burger on the BBQ grill. I used a cast iron griddle press and a 15 inch Carbon Steel pan preseasoned. I used one rectangle piece of parchment paper to cover 2 burgers. Each burger was 2 ounces. A very quick way to make a burger. I sliced the tomatoes thin with a serrated knife and chopped up lettuce. I also added pickle and onion. I added all the veggies and condiments to the bottom bun. Thank you France C. for the excellent recipe!"
