The only change I made was omitting the green peppers since every one of my family members aren't fans of them including myself. However, I do think the sauce could've actually been even better had I not left them out but the sauce was still extremely delicious without them too! Next time I think I'll experiment a bit with ingredients based on others suggestions in the comments but I wanted to rate the recipe this time without a bunch of changes. I 100% agree with others when they say homemade spaghetti sauce is far superior to even the most expensive store bought sauces! This is a keeper."

Also use fresh basil! Also no need for tomato paste with my method the purée mixture acts as a thickener as well!"

I've been tweaking it to my taste along the way, and it's an easy recipe to tweak :) I've even made it without the bell peppers (because I didn't realize the one in my fridge had gone bad), and it was great! My dad and stepmom are older and like easy recipes to cook, and they are also in love with it! I always have some in the freezer ready to go for a quick dinner or pizza sauce. The one thing I might suggest is that it can be very thick, so if you want a little more sauciness, consider adding an extra small can of tomato sauce. I did that when I took some out of the freezer for use on pizza, and it worked out great!"

What I did differently was also used some hot Italian sausage, used San Marzano tomatoes, sauteed mushrooms separately and added them halfway through the simmer. I used Italian seasoning and added fresh basil before serving. I tasted it and thought it was slightly acidic, so added a little brown sugar. Years ago I made my sauce in a similar way!"

I put about an ounce of diced pecorino romano in after reading a recommendation to add parm; added during the adding of tomato sauces. I also had a weird mix of tomato cans at home. So I used 28 oz of tomato sauce, 16 oz of Rotel diced tomato and green chili, and 6 oz of tomato paste. The green chili added a subtle kick that really added more depth of flavor, as did the cheese. Will make again for sure!"

I did modify it a little by adding 2 stalks of celery, 3 teaspoons of brown sugar, a pinch of cayenne flakes, used italian spices and added extra salt and pepper. Definitely will make it again!"

"reviewBody": "I started out following the original recipe, but then used a red pepper instead, and Italian seasoning blend- about 2.5T. I added 2t brown sugar and parm rind plus some crushed red pepper while it simmered. I added over time probably about 3 cups pasta water while it simmered because I didn’t want it too thick- 1/2 c at a time. It came out excellent! I think next time, I’ll sauté up some pepperoni and cut them into bits to add on top at the end for texture and flavor (thanks to inspiration from Guy Fieri’s lasagna recipe). I agree this is a great base recipe you can adapt to your own liking. I’ll probably add a glug of Cabernet to sauce when simmering too next time."

Add beef broth to thin. Omit broth and add a small can of crushed tomatoes if desired. It's a taste-as-you-go recipe and that's how the Chicago Italian lady showed me how to make it forty years ago."

We put a lot of mushrooms and a little more than a pound of ground beef. We also had an Italian blend of seasonings and I only used 2 teaspoons. This replaced the oregano And the other herb the recipe listed. We had dried garlic which worked fine. We also threw in a over ripe tomato before it went bad. This recipe is hard to mess up. Will make again."
