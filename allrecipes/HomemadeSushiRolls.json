,"text": "Lay one sheet of nori on a sushi mat lined with plastic wrap; spread 1 cup of rice over nori with damp fingers, leaving a 1-inch border along one edge. Arrange desired fillings (see below) crosswise just off center of rice. Carefully lift filled edge of nori and roll over filling toward unfilled edge, tucking as you roll. Brush unfilled edge of nori with water; press to seal. Cut each roll into 8 pieces. Repeat with remaining nori, rice, and fillings. To make ahead, chill, covered, up to 4 hours."
