"reviewBody": "This was TOO salty and not enough spices to give it that classic sausage flavor. 1/2 teaspoon of salt per pound is PLENTY. There is another review in here that says ground sage is more potent than dried sage, instructing to use 1/4 the amount. Don't make this mistake when using ground sage or it will seriously lack flavor. Luckily I made a test patty to taste and was able to adjust Here's what I ended up doing. This is per 2 pounds of turkey, which is what the recipe calls for 2 teaspoon ground sage 1 teaspoon each: dried thyme, fennel seed, chili powder, red pepper flakes, paprika, salt, pepper 1/2 tsp each: onion powder, garlic powder I also placed this in the food processor with some ice to give it that fine texture you find in commercial sausage. Rolled into 1 oz breakfast links using plastic wrap and froze raw for later use."

I also substituted oregano for marjoram (out of marjoram) and upped the pepper flakes because I like a spicier sausage. The chicken substitution would not work with breast meat, I think, but thighs have enough fat content to add the right moisture and flavor."

A few said they were too salty and I know my bf isn't a fan of too much salt so I halved that. I placed the patties in the freezer and cooked some today. I was so shocked at how juicy they were and how much they tasted like a beef pattie!! I also loved that extra kick of spiciness from the pepper flakes. My bf thought there was too much black pepper so I'll probably half that next time (Just his preference. I thought they were great.). Can't wait to make a new batch!!"

Only change I made was because I didn't have dried sage and marjoram on hand...but I did have poultry seasoning. So, I omitted the sage and marjoram and added 2 teaspoons of poultry seasoning instead and it was perfect! (Top cooked patties with some pure maple syrup for an even more decadent turkey sausage! Yummy!!!) Thanks for a new favorite recipe (already made it 3 times this week for my big family)!"

I used 93% lean ground turkey and froze the patties raw. Patties were formed roughly palm size and fairly thin. They did shrink and puff up during cooking, but were perfect portion size. Yielded about 14-15 turkey sausage patties. Excellent and quick to make on our cabin trip for quick breakfasts. Definitely will be making again instead of purchasing store bought. Thank you for sharing the recipe!"

Hoping it'll taste even better after the seasoning has thoroughly been absorbed into the meat."

"reviewBody": "The sausage recipe I usually use is from a biscuit cook book and involves grinding your own pork and adding fat to it, although I usually use ground pork I get from the market. Even with the extra fat added, the ground pork I get is really lean, and the sausage tends to be dry. \n\nI had some leftover ground pork, (different store, more fatty), and was going to combine that with the ground turkey, but used all ground turkey instead when I tried this recipe. \n\nI have to watch my salt consumption and can't have black pepper, so I cut the salt in half, and used a lesser amount of white pepper. Instead of frying them, I baked them on a rack in the oven. It was a lot less messy. I have them individually bagged in the freezer, along with some frozen unbaked biscuits and they make a great breakfast together. Even leftover biscuits work well. I microwave the sausage for 30 seconds a side on High (700 watts) and it turns out perfectly. I really can't tell the difference between this and my pork sausage and it's not as dry and is a lot easier to make. I got 12 patties from 2 lbs. of ground turkey. This is now my go-to sausage recipe.\nThanks, cathy35"

I normally eat it with sourdough english muffin, fried egg and Kraft Deli cheese. Yum!"

I made this recipe as written for 12 servings with the exception of salt. I used 2 teaspoons as recommended by LilSnoo. I also agree with her about cooking 5 minutes each side is too long. I cooked them for a little over 4 minutes until they were done. I thought the patties were very tasty. The next time I make these I will cut the salt back a little more being I thought they were still a little too salty. Thank you for sharing this recipe."

I also just did a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes and at the very end added about 1 Tblsp of maple syrup. I just prefer sweeter sausage. I have found that if I use lean turkey, which I typically do, the dark and white meat mix works best for turkey sausage. It does come in lean also. For convenience sake I also made turkey crumbles and sautéed it in about a tsp of veg oil. It made about 7 servings, made as written here, at 100 calories each using 93% lean ground turkey. It worked well for breakfast burritos this morning."
