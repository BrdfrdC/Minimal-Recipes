"reviewBody": "I made this today for my husband for Valentine’s Day. It was my first time making it and it turned out great! It was true that it was in a rather soft form when I tried to roll it up at first. I tried lifting the plastic wrap up on both long sides to help shape it better before rolling it up and that helped. It set up well in the fridge and in less than an hour, I was able to finish making it. The cocoa powder gives it a velvety texture on the outside with the inside being rich and silky smooth, the way dark chocolate should be!"

"reviewBody": "Awesome. Thank you, Chef John, for the recipe and the helpful video. \r\n\r\nMade as written except I wrapped the chocolate in parchment paper. I left it in the fridge overnight and it was VERY easy to work with the next day.\r\n\r\nThe next time I made 4 batches with different flavors for gifts, but only had time to refrigerate them a few hours. The chocolate was too gooey to cut and had to be shaped. Very time consuming, and I lost a lot of precious chocolate due to the sticky mess, but the effort was still worth the delicious results.\r\n\r\nLove the recipe and will make them again - just a day ahead so they firm up. FAST, EASY, and DELICIOUS when done like the video."

"reviewBody": "The trick to making this work is before putting it on the plastic wrap, is letting it set up a bit in the fridge - maybe 5 or 6 minutes... I tried it twice EXACTLY like te recipe called for, and the chocolate was just too loose to roll. So, it dawned onme to try a few minutes in the fridge first, and voila!"

I had to pour each batch into a pan and leave in the refrigerator over night. I rolled them into truffles and even had to put the pan back into the refrigerator during the process as well as before coating with cocoa powder."
