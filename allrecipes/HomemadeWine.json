"reviewBody": "Simple, and effective. I would however note that using frozen concentrates over fresh fruit isn't ideal. For one thing you runnthe chance that a freezer burned concentrate will transfer that burnt flavor to your wine... similar to using the fruit more than once. It can taste very rotten. Secondly, concentrates notoriously use fillers...it's not all fruit or juice; which again will ultimately result in an inferior product. Nonetheless it will create passable wine if each step is properly observed. Finally, here's a hint to cut your wine making time in half: Use a kicker when starting your wine. I personally use A shot of bourbon/whiskey per 2 gallons. By adding 80 proof or better you greatly speed up the process where sugar/yeast catalyze and form sugar alcohol. I.E. a nice, normal wine cook will take about 5 to 7 days to really activate(when bubbles start appearing rapidly you know...) However, add a shot and in 12 hours it's carbonating like champagne. This means you can actually complete your fermentation in 3-4 days as opposed to a week or more. Add in clear time and if you can do without bottle aging it's ready in 2-3 weeks"

I’m going to be honest, it’s not nearly as complex as even homemade wines can be, but if you’re looking for a jug of something you can say you made, to pass around at a get together that’s going to have everyone feeling good and having fun–HERE YOU GO!"

I filtered this once and I still had some goop's in it but after the second filter I could not spot any goop's or flakes. Typically a wine is between 8%-15% and I managed to get this after the 2nd fermentation to about 22-25% very strong alcohol flavor but I love the bite so no problem with me."

"reviewBody": "Excellent recipe for starters! Here's a few tips:\n\n1: Poke holes in your balloon to allow carbon dioxide to escape. (If you plan on using this recipe a lot I'd suggest buying an airlock, they are about a dollar each.)\n\n2: Use a juice you like. If you don't like the taste of the juice, you won't like the wine it makes.\n\n3: If you have a gallon jug of the juice just pour some out and do all the adding sugar, mixing and fermentation in that jug. It comes to you sterile already.\n\n4: Whatever you are mixing, make sure you shake it well and get lots of air mixed with it. The yeast needs lot of air in the beginning to get their colony to grow. Later on you want to limit the air so you don't end up with vinegar.\n\n5: Have fun and share with friends. You'll look cool making your own booze."

"reviewBody": "This was a great trial and error experience that turned into some great memories with the husband and friends.\nIF YOU MAKE THIS\npoke a few holes as another commenter suggested. Make sure you strain the wine, because the sediment in it is gross and you dont want to drink that.\nThe balloon will collect gunk in it, and if it falls into the wine, it will sour it, but dont throw it out! Thats red or white wine vinegar and can be used for cooking! (Just doooont drink it haha!) \nI doubled the sugar in mine, but its all about preference. My husband pointed out that you could also improvise with another *ahem* latex item since they have about the same purpose for this recipe, just get the plain, no additives in the package kind lol. Also, they have fermentation locks on amazon for under 10 that can be used over and over as well. \nI used all types of juices for this recipe, and kept them in their original bottles, and 7/8 turned out fine, with some being better than others. The watermelon soured, so im not sure if it was from the gunk falling back in, or just the fact it was watermelon, but i wouldnt try that. I used a mango peach juice that turned into a FABULOUS mango peach hard cider within 4 weeks. The grape and white grape turned out great, and the strawberry was to die for. Keep it in the top of a closet or cabinet or somewhere you wont disturb it. Good luck and enjoy your wine! ??????"

I did rack the wine with 1 cup of water and 2 tablespoons of sugar for the final 2 weeks. Noticing activity again more than there was. Racking allows you to get some of the dead yeast out which can change the flavor of the wine."

"reviewBody": "A few things I did before making this wine. instead of using a balloon, I used a little fermenting venting mechanism that Ibpurchased off Amazon (shown in picture below). So instead of waiting for a balloon to deflate I just watched for when the bubbles stopp Ed rising from the bottom of the jug to know when the wine was finished. Also, when it was finished fermenting, I used a tube to siphon the liquid off so I wouldn’t get the sediment at the bottom of the jug into the finished wine product. I read that simply pouring the entire contents of the fermentation into a different jug causes the wine to be bitter. I used frozen grape juice. The finished product tastes like wine, only a bit harsher."

I also read need to let mixture cool to 90 degrees before adding yeast. I did put ballon on and waited like 2 mos . Balloon never went back down to original size but did decrease at least half to quarter inflated size. It was a little bitter but strong (alcohol content) as a mutha. Half gallon tore several college boys up. One note, I attributed the bitterness to to only using two cups of sugar. Go with this recipe or four cups"

Also, I do it the simple way, without any balloons or condoms, etc. I just put a paper towel over a gallon jug and then put the lid over that and twist it, leaving a bit of breathing room. Been doing it that way for awhile and haven't run into a vinegar problem :) Don't shake while fermenting, and always toss the bottom inch or so."

"reviewBody": "Loved it of course. Make sure everything is sterile and boiled out (glass jar preferably) makes for cleaner wine. In prison we used the juiced pulp of any fruit we were using and threw it in with the juice. Its what we called a kicker. At home throw a pound of raisins in the wine. It will actually speed up the sugar 'burning' process. We would make a finished and tasty batch with a kicker in 5-7 days. You'll know when the kicker is rocking when all the raisins rise to the top of the 'batch'. Or throw some applesauce in the batch and stir well. You'll see that rise and separate from the juice as it cooks. When the kicker drops to the bottom of the jar. The wine is done. Prison style. BANANAS ARE AWESOME AS A KICKER TOO!"

"reviewBody": "This was the first wine I ever tried to make, and have since started making proper wine. That said, this wasn't a bad first experiment. I used Welch's grape juice concentrate and the finished product was a lot like a jam sandwich. Over time, as the wine aged, it took on a bricky blush color and the grape flavor is more of a finisher after the strong alcohol bite. Apparently bread yeast tolerates high levels of alcohol.\n\nI use this for cooking, as I'm not fond of the flavor. It's nothing like the wine you buy in the store. However, if your goal is to simply make alcohol, then this will do the trick."

"reviewBody": "Okay, ah. Do some research people. The dead yeast at the bottom... yeah, that collects up no matter if you make one gallon, or a whole barrel of wine. You'll always have to worry about some of that. Now if you place a tap just above the bottom, then you could probably strain all the top stuff out. And then just dump the dead yeast. I just pour it into another container, until it appears like too much of that stuff might get into it, and then dump the little bit left on the bottom. It'll probably get a little better over time, to then place a normal lid on your container. I found sometimes, Apple ferments faster. And will actually get stronger over a shorter period of time. It is almost too sweet, but I like it.\nIt lists leaving it sit for 6 weeks, but it's not bad to drink it after only 4. You want to ferment it for 4 to 6 weeks, and then refrigerate it if you can.\n\nI found it to be an easy recipe, so have fun. A heads up though, it doesn't need to be kept too cool, or you'll stop the fermentation process."

I did not use a balloon, I used a proper air lock and plug that I got for $3.00. I live in a warm climate so it only took 10 days to ferment and stop bubbling through the air lock, I also got some Potassium Sorbate to prevent re-fermentation and added that before I bottled it. I put it in water bottles and from one gallon I got two 1 liter and three 1/2 liter bottles filed with another half of a 1/2 liter bottle left over. That is what I have sampled. It is still cloudy but tastes pretty good and it is very strong. I am going to let it stand for a few weeks and see if it clears up, if not I will add a clairifer in the next batch which I will be starting in the next few days."

(not knowing about the pin-hole trick for venting). based on the 4-6wk per gal. time table i allowed only 5 days of fermentation.very cloudy. strained the qt. off through coffee filter and began experimental drinking. first taste dry and bitter with very mild sweetness and a balloony aftertaste."

"reviewBody": "It might be \"drinkable\" after 6 weeks, but as an experienced mead maker, Newyear498is 100% right. you need to allow the fermentation byproducts to escape. I'm an environmental engineer and know a bit of chemistry. If you dont allow the CO2 to escape and filter out the yeast waste, it will take much longer for the brew to mellow to a palatable flavor. Don't confuse this with wine made with a vacuum sealed, temp controlled container. It is a bargain basement price recipe. keep that in mind with your comments. However, it will work quit well if you are patient.\n\n*BTW: Ive made mead using this exact method, and it took nearly 6 months, so... BE PATIENT!!!!!!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe is great if you're ok with Carlos Rossi grade wine.\r\n\r\nThe first question I had when I saw the recipe was, \"how sweet is it?\" Because I prefer dry over sweet, I cut the sugar down to less than 2 cups. MISTAKE. It tasted alcoholic (great) but unpalatable (not so great). After fermentation, I added sugar to taste, and it's fine now. \r\n\r\nMy process was such: Sanitize all equipment with hot water and dish soap, rinsing thoroughly. I used a ballon, active dry yeast, and welches grape concentrate. I let the yest sit in warm water to dissolve, and put the sugar in warm water to make a syrup. I mixed all ingredients togetherm sealed it with a balloon, gave it a few holes to let the gasses escape, and after 5 days, the balloon deflated. I filtered it with a funnel and coffee filters once and now I have a Carlos Rassi tasting sweet wine, which is chilling in my fridge. \r\n\r\nLike i said, this is ok if you like cheap, sweet wines that will get you drunk fast.\r\n\r\nI'll make more and experiment with white grape. I want something that will be less sweet but still palatable."

"reviewBody": "Helpful maybe?, I am not an expert and it has been some time since I did this:\nWash the balloon.\nWhen the balloon deflates the wine has stopped working and added time may screw the flavor and maybe turn to vinegar, earlier may taste yeasty. [actually the higher alcohol content kills the fungus making the alcohol, no longer giving off gas and the balloon goes down]\nMost rubber balloons have very small holes and will deflate over a short time, good ones may take a long time, so pricking small holes resolves this or your wine will sit too a long time with a big balloon and not working, but spoiling. You just need to know when it stops working, that is the purpose of the balloon idea. Timing is quite important, and sealing it in another clean bottle or refrigerating it after it is ready keeps it longer. If you do not clean and sterilize your jug you may get contaminates that may give it a bad flavor or affect the working process."

I used this formula to make four 1-gallon batches, two Welch white grapes and two Welch red grapes. Three came out perfect and one is a bit slow. I just bottled them today and they looked fantastic. They taste very good and strong too. I used RedStar montrachet yeast. I started a new 5-gallon batch with 10 cans of Welch red grape juice with RedStar champagne yeast this time. It's been a week now. Will see if it's going to taste stronger. The starting SG is a bit higher (1.126). \n\nThe one gallon batches I started out using the milk jug with air-locks though. I didn't use the balloons. After 4 weeks, I racked them into 1 gallon carboy. I used sparkaloid to clear the wines. They taste just as perfect without using the agent but I just want to make them clear to look nice in the bottles."

"reviewBody": "During the last year I have made this recipe over and over, using both 100% frozen or 100% bottled juices. I always have great strong wine in the end, and no two batches exactly the same. This wine is not for the weak or meek palate, it is strong! When aged much longer than the recipe states it can be used as a table wine. The pure grape tends to be the strongest and needs to age far longer than the others. I only use 3-1/2 cups sugar instead of 4 cups. In a saucepan I make a simple syrup by boiling approx. 2 cups water and 3-1/2 cups sugar until dissolved. This retards the growth of bacteria and makes the yeast work extremely well (fermentation). After the syrup is some what cooled pour it into the sterile glass jug using a sterile funnel. DO NOT ADD the yeast now, wait until the gallon and its contents are back to room temperature or the yeast itself will die and not ferment. The longer the wine sits/rests the better the taste. Forget about it!!! Salute!"

I am trying it for the first time after 6 weeks, and it is really very good. A little dry,barely sweet, and a beautiful color. Not quite as potent as the grape but I prefer that.

My grandfather has been making wine for many, many years and he has a pretty cool technique. he takes a plastic tube and pokes it in the lid of the milk jug and puts the other end in a glass of water. it keeps the air going out but not coming back in. The recipe itself is awsome. I made some and it turned out wonderful. My boyfriend says its a wine you can sip on all night and it creeps up on you. you dont notice it kickin your butt till its too late. The only thing that sucks about it is the after effect. My hangovers are always worse when i drink this wine."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is super. Follow the directions just like you see them here and you'll come out with a decent blush. It may not win any awards at a tasting party but it's better than a box wine. \n\nOne small suggestion. After five weeks the balloon may still be inflated, that's not a big problem. Do use a piece of tubing to siphon off the wine from the sediment in the bottom. Try not to disturb the sediment when you do that. I use two clean 2-liter pop bottles instead of a gallon jug. It's a way to reuse bottles we'd normally throw away. And the sediment packs itself down in the ridges in the bottom which makes siphoning a lot easier."

Common sense should tell you not to drink it without 'decanting' it from the original container. I can't imagine anyone would drink it with the 'sludge' it creates! This time, I'm going to try Mulberry."

"reviewBody": "A very good recipe for homemade wine. You might want to try \"Brewer's\" yeast instead of regular bread yeast though, it'll make it a bit dryer but it wont have that \"yeasty\" flavor. I have to agree with Newyear 498 about siphoning off of the sediment into a clean jug, and wine is one of those things that gets better with age! :)"

"reviewBody": "We always used a condom instead of latex balloons. Yes, I said CONDOMS! Latex balloons have a powder which can leak into the wine. \nSecondly, I also waited for the balloon to go up then come down at which time I knew it was ready. Please do not poke holes in the balloon, condom or whatever, as you want to keep everything as sterile as possible in order not to introduce unwanted bacteria or end up with vinegar as a result.\nFinally, I would suggest a trip to the winemaker or beer maker store for the right kind of yeast would also be in order. Otherwise Happy Wine Making-from a former home wine maker!"

"reviewBody": "The first time I made this the wait time was longer than stated, I actually removed the balloon while still inflated because it had been acuple of months and was still inflated. However, after that, the wine maturd in a couple of weeks and was excellant! And packed a pretty good punch. I don't care for wine that makes you pucker, and this was very sweet and easy to sip. It didn't last long, as company also thought it was excellant wine. My only regret is that I didn't make more the first time. I am now starting my next batch and am making two galons instead of one and am tryng some new flavors (my first one was of sourse concord grape, now I am trying strawberry and white grape/raspberry). I like the fact that you use prepared juices."

I placed the ingredients in wholesale bulk-sized pickle jars and covered them with 3 layers of saran wrap secured by a rubberband. I also used wine-grade yeast instead of all purpose yeast. Great Recipe for anyone. A+!!!"

"reviewBody": "I made this using white grape raspberry, white grape peach, and grape. The grape raspberry and grape peach are really good (and strong!) but the grape is by far the best. I used 6 cups of sugar and the result is a very sweet wine, which is what we like. I used yeast made especially for wine and I boiled my water and sugar to make sure all the sugar dissolved. After 5 weeks I poured through coffee filters and transferred wine to another container for a couple of weeks before bottling. This is the perfect wine to use to make Sangria."

In one gallon jug I added some juiced blackberries in another I just put grape juice and in another I did apple juice concentrate. The grapes are done and WOW are they strong my fiance and all of his friends love it and want me to make more. I was so happy that this turned out so well. I'm makeing more with different variations. Thanks!!!!!!!"
