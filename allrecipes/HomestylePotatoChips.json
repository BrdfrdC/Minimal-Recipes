One less thumb knuckle later... we have chips! :D Also, I just used an old pot (the one I use for chili) with a small bottle of virgin olive oil. Batches consisted of enough chips to cover 2 paper towels. 7 minutes per batch. Since this was a first time for me, I tested and noted times. Almost forgot - I had no way of measuring temperature either. Yes, I live in the past. I've just come to the future to post this review. Just let oil heat on med/high for about 5 min. Enjoy!"

I can't say whether this made any difference or not? I will say though that I usually rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat in ice cold water! I don't want any starch in that water. yes they need to be sliced very thin like on the thinnest setting on your mandolin!"

Vinegar flavor was subtle so I’m sure if I soaked them longer it would’ve been stronger. Seasoned some with salt and some with Cajun seasoning. Came out amazing and the kids loved them too. The whole family loved them actually! You really can’t go wrong with these, saves you a lot on chips."

I sliced them on my cheap mandolin on the thinnest setting, perfect by my standards for chips. I soaked them in a sugar/hottest tap water mix for a good 10 minutes, drained and rinsed. Then returned to a ice cold salt water bath for 30 minutes. Drain, rinse, and dry thoroughly. Fry as instructed, however, remove to a cooling rack so they don't sit in the oil dripping off. After all are done, fry once more for a minute or so for the super extra crispy."

This made wonderful chips which after pulling out of the oil and allowing the oil to drip off onto a paper towel I sprinkled salt and a cajun spice mix that I made on top. Wonderful home made chips, everyone enjoyed them. There was not one left."

I let them soak in warm salt water for 1 hour before rinsing them, and dried them out for half an hour. They turned out super crisp, and I made them real thin with my food processor which is a MAJOR plus. Overall, this is one of the best recipes for potato chips I have ever made, and my family sure seemed to enjoy them too!"

Mine were so crispy, I have never made homemade chips that crunchy before, Awesome! I saw some remarks about other peoples not being crispy enough, my suggestion would be take your time slicing the potatoes, don't rush it, slowly slice them as thin as possible, so thin you can almost see though it. This makes them perfectly crispy in the end. Enjoy! We did !"

For this one, I used a mandolin to slice 3 white potatoes as thin as possible (I can't slice anything paper thin with a knife without losing a finger). I then soaked the slices in cold water. Not sure if it would have been better soaking them in hot water so that is an experiment for another time."

"reviewBody": "Unfortunately the attachment on my food processor could not help with this so I had to cut very thin slices of poatoes. So, prep took a bit longer but not a problem. It only took about 5 minutes in the the deep fryer. After removing them from the fryer, drained, salted they were great fresh and warm. The consistency did not hold up when they cooled off. Maybe an error on my part. I would recommend this as a fast way to fry potatoes but not as chips. Thanks for sharing this recipe, it will make a great fast way to fry potatoes."

I have an inexpensive mandolin that is perfectly suited for thin slicing. Once this was done the rest is easy! My husband raved and said they were as good as Lays! I know he was being kind, but I will take that compliment any time. I finally got to try the last batch I made because I never brought them out to him!"

"reviewBody": "This was my first time trying homemade chips, as well as using my new fryer! I also used potatoes that had started to \"eye\", and I had them in water for only about 20 minutes before towel drying them and frying. I also did not soak them in salt water, just tap water. I don't have a special tool for slicing them, so I used a potato peeler to make the slices. For us, this was the perfect consistency and chip size. I fried each batch for six minutes, and it was perfectly golden/brown. I put them onto a plate with a towel, and then salted them immediately. My whole family devoured them! My six year old daughter said that they were the best chips she'd ever eaten. Really great!"

"reviewBody": "I just made these for the first time, and I kept it simple, but I wanted to pass on the technique that I used: I washed and removed eyes from 4 red potatoes, but did not peel them. Some of my taters were sprouting from their eyes already. I sliced them with my pampered chef mandoline slicer, so it only has the one thin slicing blade. I soaked the slices in cold water, changed the water several times, and the last soaking I added a hefty amount of salt. Rinsed them again, laid the slices on kitchen cloths/paper towels, and patted them dry.\nI heated my 10-inch cast iron frying pan, added about 1/2 cup canola oil, and brought it up to heat (level 8 out of 10 on a gas stove). I added potato slices so they could float freely side-by-side, not stacked on top of each other. I found that using 2 long-tined dinner forks were perfect for moving them, turning them, and removing them to a waiting paper-toweled cookie sheet, where I sprinkled them with salt. They were delicious! \nThe first bunch were probably undercooked, as I was afraid of burning them, but the later batches were crispy on the edges, barely soft in the middle, perfect! I will make these again! I wish I had some malt vinegar to sprinkle over them right now!"

Also, be sure to really dry your potatoes off before frying them...use a towel though, paper towel will stick to them (learned that the hard way). Delicious!"
