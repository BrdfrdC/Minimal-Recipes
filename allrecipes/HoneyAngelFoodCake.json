"reviewBody": "I'm always surprised when an old family recipe made many, many times doesn't turn out quite the way I'd expect. I followed this recipe to the letter, didn't get much of a rise, at 20 minutes the top and cake sides were overly browned, the bottom burned, and it stuck when I tried to get it out of the pan after sitting for 2 hours. Putting those things aside, it tasted good. It looked so pitiful that I sliced it, added a layer of SF lemon pudding, and topped with some sliced strawberries Putting those things aside, it tasted good. Just have to wonder if 425 is simply too high a temperature. I liked the taste of this well enough that I'm going to try it again at 375 and, hopefully, eliminate the issues that I had this time."
