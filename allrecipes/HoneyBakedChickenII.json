Instead of the full amounts of honey and mustard, I used lesser amounts of Trader Joe's \"Honey Pale Ale Mustard\" and Trader Joe's Raw Organic Honey. I DID cover the chicken for the first 30 mins., (as others had recommended); then uncovered and basted every 15 mins. for the remainder of time. Even tho' the inside temp. of the chicken was around 185ºF when done, the chicken was moist &amp; juicy (even the breast!) It was DELICIOUS, and the sauce was great over rice!"

Removed the foil after 30min and turned the thighs skin up, basting every 10min for 30 more minutes.\n\nRemoved the chicken to a dish and transferred the sauce to a saucepan, skimming the fat. Punched up the sauce with honey and mustard, thickened with cornstarch slurry, making a nice gravy. Served with whole roast garlic cloves on the side."

I mix it all together without any salt first, and then taste it. One of the Madras Curry powders I have needs no salt added, but I need to use 2 tsp. of the powder for flavor. I usually use skinless boneless cutlets, and cover it for 30 minutes, and uncover for 20. thicken up the sauce a bit and put it over rice. I usually serve it with a green vegetable."

Added extra teaspoon of curry powder, 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder. Cooked in Pyrex baking dish with a lid for 30 minutes, then removed lid and cooked an additional 30 minutes. I'd added about 1/8 cup of water to the spices so the chicken was covered and basting wasn't necessary. Chicken was delightful and tender. Definitely a repeat recipe."

I made the sauce with the only changes being decreased butter and adding a pinch of cayenne pepper. I used a 9x 13 pan lined with foil. The preheated oven was at 350. I covered the pan with foil and cooked 30 min. I increased the temp to 400, removed the foil and cooked another 30 min. basting twice.\nThe chicken skin caramelized and the sauce thickened.\nGreat recipe, good flavor and so easy."

If you baste it every 15 min per the instructions, there is no need to cover it with tin foil. My house also smells amazing now! I didn't get a chance to take a picture, we ate it all up---looked just like the main recipe though!"

"reviewBody": "Really easy to make and delicious. I did not use curry seasoning because I don't like the flavor. I used 1/4 cup of butter, 1/4 cup of honey, and 1/4 cup of Dijon mustard as other reviewers suggested. I also laid the chicken on top of sliced yellow onions. I basted the chicken every fifteen minutes. I started the chicken skin side down and covered. After the first fifteen minutes, I turned the chicken over and then basted every fifteen minutes. I also sliced a russet potato and laid the thick slices on the baking sheet. I continued basting the chicken and potatoes every fifteen minutes. The result is an absolutely delicious one-pan meal. Keep an eye on it towards the end of cooking time because the honey starts to carmelize and could burn. My chicken was a little over done and looked a little like barbecue but it was honesty yummy. I would serve this to company in a minute, especially because it's inexpressive and SO EASY to prépare. Yummy, yummy, yummy! Next time I'll make a bigger tray so that I have plenty of leftovers."

I used boneless chicken thighs and I cooked for an hour basting every 15 minutes. I sprinkled rosemary on top after 30 minutes. My kids loved it. I served it with white rice- sour cream and onion red potatoes in the steam bag and broccoli, everyone really loved it and we used the gravy on our rice. Thanks for the good meal to add to my rotation"

The skin was more dark, internal temperature was 205, but the meat was just wonderful, falling off the bone. The dark skin had a nutty cashew flavor, but was a little chewy. I did season with salt and pepper before the first basting. \nBottom line is this dish is wonderful!"

The bones and dark meat really enhances the flavor. I do like to make more of the sauce to dip the chicken in or have it on the rice. I will even save the sauce and use it on another meal. I've never been a huge curry fan but this recipe uses it so well that I'm so glad I tried it. Yummm yummm yummm... I don't change anything to it. It's amazing just how it is!! Give it a try!"

I used 4 thigh-leg quarters. Baked at 350F covered for 30 mins, turned the chicken and continued baking uncovered for another 30 mins. Turned again and then increased temp to 400F and baked for another 20 mins. There were a lot of oil so I separated the chicken from the sauce. Drained excess oil. Added some cornstarch (dissolved in water) and boiled til sauce thickened. Then poured sauce on top. Served with rice. Awesome! I will definitely make again."
