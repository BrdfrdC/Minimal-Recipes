Anytime you add a sweetener to a recipe you will need to cover the dish to avoid burning. I prepared a double recipe. Both were cooked in a glass Pyrex dish. The first one I did not cover until it had already browned. This one came out very dark. The second one I covered until the last 10 minutes of baking and it came out golden brown."

Not too crumbly, perfectly browned after 25 minutes at 375 degrees.\nI halved the sugar but next time will omit as I think the honey is enough sweetness.\nNo cream so I took the advice of another reviewer and substituted 3/4 cup skim and 1/4 cup melted butter.\nHad this cornbread with Black Bean and Salsa soup on this site."

Best corn bread I've tried. perfectly firm and just crumbly enough without it getting everywhere. It melts in your mouth and is great with honey butter or herb butter. I can't wait to make this again. So easy to prepare!"

Although they were moist, not enough flavor, so next time I‚Äôll add agave nectar and see. I also substituted the heavy cream because I didn‚Äôt have any, I used 3/4 c milk lactose and 1/4 c butter. Best recipe yet regardless of sweetness."

I had a little extra batter after 12 regular sized muffins. I decided to make a pancake with that. Me and my 2 kids gobbled that one pancake immediately. Will make pancakes next time using this recipe. The only changes I made are using 1/2 tsp salt and since I don't have cream, I substituted with equal amount evaporated milk."

Ended up making it more crumbly, however, it was somehow still most? Anywho, turned out pretty good. I also substituted the honey with homemade honey butter to make it a little buttery as well.
