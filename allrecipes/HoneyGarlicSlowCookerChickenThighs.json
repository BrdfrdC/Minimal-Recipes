The recipe says four thighs, but the accompanying video shows at least six in the pot (for the same amount of sauce.) Is it supposed to be 3-4 hours on low, or (as in the video) 3-4 hours on high if you're \"short on time\"? Or, since one reviewer said bone-IN thighs were ready after only four hours on low, is it neither? And while the photo looks delicious, I am really skeptical that you got a brown crust like that without giving the chicken a quick broil in the oven."

Saved the sauce and will use for chicken breasts. Can't wait."

I also adjusted the ingredients down to about one half of the quantity listed, and added liquid smoke to the mixture. Best chicken ever! Super simple and very moist! Can't wait to make it again!

"reviewBody": "My family and I literally inhaled this for dinner. Yummo! I flung in 12 thighs and doubled the sauce but definitely didn't need to. Though the extra sauce is always good to mop up with crusty buttered bread! I coated the thighs first with garlic and onion powder, S&amp;P, and paprika, then seared them before placing in slow cooker. I didn't read the reviews here until after I'd put it on, so I was stressing all afternoon about it being \"too salty\", *needlessly*. I didn't find it too salty at all (I was, however, heavy handed with the honey! ). I also added cornstarch to thicken. I'd definitely cook this again, so easy and tasty."

"reviewBody": "I am crazy about this chicken as are my daughter, SIL, and granddaughter (a picky 17 y.o.). But I also had a relative suggest that when I make it, that I use a bit less soy sauce and a bit more honey so I used 1/4 c. soy and a 1/2 c. honey which worked beautifully and gave distinctive notes of honey and soy at a balance that I thought was perfect. . .if you think about it--the soy basically provides the slightly salty note. would recommend the recipe as written or maybe change a bit the way I did. I know this is quirky but I always ALWAYS prepare and freeze chicken as soon as I process it from store. Earlier recipes that I tried after retiring the chicken tended to dry out a bit but now is less dry and more flavorful. Bon Appetit."

I placed the ribs on heavy duty foil, poured the sauce over the ribs, topped with more foil and crimped the foil tightly all around the ribs. Baked at 300 degrees for 3 hours. Turned the oven off and allowed the meat to rest for 30 minutes or so before serving. Some of the best ribs I've ever prepared. I will keep this sauce in the fridge for all types of meat - not just chicken."

Next time will add some fresh ginger and sesame seeds and a splash of Sesame seed oil during the last hour. Added corn starch at the end (to avoid the cornstarch just curdling up in the warm sauce, you put about 1 tablespoons of corn starch in approximately 1/2 cup of water and whisk well. Then adding a small amount at a time of the hot sauce to the cold mixture. When mixture is more warm than cold, you then add it into the sauce. You could increase the thickening effect even more by moving the sauce to a pan and bringing it to a boil.)"

As of late, I have been first putting a large chopped onion and 3-4 medium sliced carrots in the bottom of the slow cooker, then the chicken, (I tend to use 2-3 breasts cut in 5-6 pieces each). In this case, I double the sauce ingredients (for the ketchup, I put 1\\2 ketchup and 1/2 Heinz chili sauce for a little kick) and add some chili pepper flakes. The family always enjoys it! Today I took an extra step to first season my chicken pieces with salt and pepper and brown them in a frying pan with a Tbsp of olive oil. I'm looking forward to seeing how this turns out!"

I put the chicken in frozen on Low at about 11:15, and by 6 pm it was coming off the bones. After the chicken was done, I spooned most of the liquid into a small saucepan, added some cornstarch mixed with water, and heated and stoppered it until it was thickened, and we spooned that over the chicken and rice.

I mix up the sauce while this is going on, then put the thighs into the slow cooker (making sure sauce covers everything) at low for 4-6 hours OR into my casserole dish for 1 hour at 350.
