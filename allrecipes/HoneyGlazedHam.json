This year I made this ham twice...one with the brown sugar substitute and with the corn syrup... the corn syrup tasted better and more like the famous and EXPENSIVE honey glazed ham everyone buys. The brown sugar just added sweetness, but the corn syrup had more deep flavor and sweetness that melded all the flavors together. Will make this recipe with corn syrup from now on!! Thank you for the recipe!!"

I ended up taking it out of the bag and laying it in the pan (I used a disposable pan) along with the juice and used a spoon to pour the juice in the pan over the ham every 15min. I used cloves, but I may leave those out next time. Overall, delicious. Put half in the freezer and will be eating the other half for lunch a couple days. HAM SANDWICHES!!!"

I followed some of the other reviewers suggestion and change the sauce to 1/4 cup brown sugar, 2/3 cup butter, 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, and 1 cup of honey - this makes a lot of sauce. I had alot left for a 8 lb ham. My husband loved it. I will make this again."

"reviewBody": "Ham and glaze was amazing. I was a first time ham warmer, so I read almost 200 reviews from this glaze and studied all the pictures. We have a small crowd (only 6 ham eaters) and I had already picked up a 10lb spiral cut Smithfield ham. After looking at the pictures I decided not to score the top because of the loose pieces. Used a Hasty Bake grill (amazing) Got the grill to a steady 280 indirect heat, basted every thirty minutes. I kept the ham flat side down the whole time, this only took about 100 minutes which was way shorter than the planned time. I can’t think of a ham I’ve had that was better, but I’m not a pro ham taster either, I’ve probably only eaten 2 per year for the last 35 years and never warmed one up. Summary of the changes"

"reviewBody": "I had a 7.5 LBS Costco spiral sliced ham. Used the recipe basting ingredients except subbed brown sugar for the corn syrup as that is not an ingredient I buy or have on hand. I cut the glaze in half and it was plenty and added 1/8 t ground cloves to the glaze (I didn't stud the ham with whole cloves) although 1/4 t cloves might have been better. I put the ham in an oven bag w/ 1T flour, poured the slightly cooled glaze over the ham and placed the bag on a heavily foil lined 13X9 baking dish. I didn't cut holes in the oven bag. Cooked at 275 degrees for 12 mins per LBS. I turned the ham in the bag every so often, maybe every 20-30 mins. Came out great. I figured I could have removed the ham and juices from the bag at the end cooking time and broiled the ham for a few mins to crust up the outside, but I didn't on this go around."

"reviewBody": "It turned out very well! I just made a few time saving and yummy adjustments. Instead of adding cloves to the 6 lb ham, I added 1/4 tsp ground cloves to the honey mixture. I also substituted brown sugar for corn syrup. I sliced 2 lbs of carrots, drizzled them with some of the honey mixture, and placed them at the bottom of the pain with 1/4 c of water. I covered the ham and carrots loosely with foil, uncovering every 10-15 min to baste. During the last 5 min, I put the broiler on high and caramelized the top of the ham chunk. Even making only 1/3 of the honey mixture, generously basting, and adding it to carrots, I had a lot left over. The whole dish was outstanding! Mmm... with the sweet from the honey and the salt from the ham drippings, what wonderful carrots!"

I have been using 1/2 c of brown sugar instead of the corn syrup, and I add a few pineapples on top of the ham and add a little pineapple juice to the glaze. I use a shank portion ready to eat ham, and bake it like the recipe says. Recently, I tried the slow cooker method and used the spiral slice ham due to time restrictions. Personally, I like baking it better. The slow cooker method, I cooked on low for 6 hours, and it seemed a bit dry. Also, I like my glaze to be a bit sticky and I didn’t get that using the slow cooker. Wonderful recipe! I can’t make this ham without adding baby carrots to the bottom of the pan. They come out sooo good with this glaze!"

I only had a little over a cup of honey on hand and only light corn syrup so I had to improvise and used a mixture of corn syrup and molasses with the honey and butter. I had plenty of glaze for my big ham. I basted every 15-20 minutes and because my ham was double I doubled the time to get it to 140 degrees. It was delicious. Next time I will try to have the correct ingredients to do it as the recipe states, but even with a bit of improvising it turned out great. One person commented that it was the best ham they’d ever had. I will definately make it again!"

Once it came out of the oven, it was really good. Next time I'll splurge on a spiral sliced ham."

"reviewBody": "This was my first time ever making a ham, of any kind. I followed the other reviews as much as possible when I made this because i had no idea what I was doing. The whole messiness of this recipe made me lean more toward using a slow cooker. So thats how I did it. So, for all of you slow cooker folks, I hope this review will help you. Side Note: Ive never had a Honey Baked Ham in my life. So when everyone was comparing this ham to that one..well I can't say much, but I do know that this one was delicious!\n\nI tried to find a 5lb ham. That was impossible. The smallest I found was 8. something (we will just say 8). I had a choice between shank or butt. I chose butt because it was the smallest one I could find, but I hear a shank is better? But my butt was just fine. ha.\n\nMy tweaks included: 8lb ham instead of 5lb. 1/4t gound cloves (my boyfriend hates cloves and he couldn't even tell this was in there...and in all honesty neither did I. So don't run out and buy ground cloves if you don't have any on hand) 1/4cup BROWN SUGAR (instead of corn syrup), 1 Cup honey (I started out with 1/4c and there was definitely NOT enough glaze for my ham with that), and I would use the whole amount of butter it says, so 2/3C butter, I had to use less because that was all I had by the time I started this recipe and I wasn't about to leave the house in my Pjs.\n\nSo I kept that glaze warm (be careful because I left mine and came back to it almost bubbling over). I scored the ham (check out how to do"

Then my dad asked me to make ham for Easter. he bought it and got a mustard sauce packet to go with it and it was okay, and then the Thanksgiving before last I bought a fresh ham from the butcher and made this recipe and now I really enjoy this ham. \nI've made a few changes here and than. I use raw honey, which is expensive but for this recipe is great. I've used both brown sugar and mixed molasses with sugar both are good it just depends on what you have in your house."

Turns out fabulous every time! I always use light corn syrup as the dark tends to turn the ham brown while it is cooking. Ham can be left on the bone (if it will fit in the crockpot) or cut it off the bone before putting it in the crockpot. I've made it every year for Easter for the past 5 years and am now making it for Easter, Thanksgiving AND Christmas."
