I used the basic recipe but made my own additions/changes. I added about 3/4 c of ground flaxseed, used coconut oil in place of canola, added about 3 T. of maple syrup to oil/honey mix. I didn't have enough pecans so used what I had and added chopped walnuts to equal the 2 c nuts in recipe, as well as the rest of a bag of roasted/salted pumpkin seeds. Also added about 3/4 t. of salt to oil/honey/syrup mixture. I baked it a total of 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes. Perfect amount of time. Added dried chopped cherries to mix after taking out of oven. It's delicious!"

The only thing I do differently is melt coconut oil instead of the canola oil, and did 1/2 honey and 1/2 pure maple syrup instead of ALL honey (to save on my honey). I cook it longer cause we like it extra crunchy. I love that there's no sugar in this. Guilt-free eating! It's fabulous on yogurt!"

I used a big pan and a small pan and switched them after the second ten minute shift, then added ten more minutes. The big pan was on top first and I wouldn’t do it the other way around as the result was perfect."

The second time around, we added some cashews, a few tblsp. of dried grated coconut and about 1/4 cup of craisins to the mix, still making half the amount at a time since there are only 2 of us in the house regularly. This recipe can be varied quite a bit and we love this granola. Thank you!"

I've made a tropical version with dried mango &amp; candied ginger with macadamia nuts. Very yummy! I used coconut oil instead of canola and use a mix of sunflower seeds, millet &amp; pepitas instead of straight sunflower seeds. I also up the cinnamon &amp; vanilla and add a bit of salt to enhance the flavors. I add 1/3 cup dried milk at the end - I think that puts it over the top!"

The second time I made do with some things on hand (and it was vegan)....still turned out great. \nThe second time I used melted coconut oil instead of canola-that was great. I also used agave syrup instead of honey. I personally like it with honey better, but it was very good with agave as well. \nI'm making it again, today, back to the recipe's instructions!"

"reviewBody": "I don't often rate recipes, but this one is worthy. If you buy much granola you know it is much more expensive than the sum of its parts. This is not only outstanding, you can pick your nut addition, I don't always have the exact ones and also use walnuts. I also add a 1/4 cup of flax seed for a little health kick without changing the flavor. I have found that baking it works best for me if I stir it every 10 minutes the first couple of times and then drop back to 7 for the finish laps. I bake my until there is a noticeable color change, I.E. it starts to darken. This makes a granola that breaks up easily and stays that way in storage for me."

DH said that was the reason he liked it was because the oatmeal was crunchy sweet (instead of dry and gummy like store-bought). Thanks for sharing!"

I usually substitute walnuts for pecans. I also add 1/4 cup ground flaxseed for nutritional value. I bake for 20 minutes like the recipe suggests but I take it out and stir it every 7 minutes. It seems like 3 minutes wouldn't really make a difference but it does. This can get very brown (borderline burnt) very quickly so I think every 7 minutes is perfect. I bake it on wax paper for easy clean up and as its cooling I add some craisins. Perfect!"

But best of all... it's sooo easy to make, and so easy to mix-and-match. Just this morning, I put in raw pumpkin seeds, a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, and dried cranberries. Still with chopped pecans, too. ( You can never have too many nuts.) I've made it in many ways. Next... I want to try with coconut oil, instead of canola oil. Delicious!

I also hand chopped my almonds, and that was fine. I got 6 servings, approximately, with the half a recipe and missing sunflower seeds. I lined the baking sheet with parchment and had no problems with sticking or any issues. This granola is not overly sweet, sticky, or too crunchy like many I have tried. It was fine in milk, but it was excellent on some plain yogurt."
