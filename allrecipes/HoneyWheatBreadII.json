I changed amounts of honey to 1/2 cup, added an extra 1/2 tsp of salt. I also added a packet of maple oatmeal and another 1/2 cup of oatmeal. It's very moist and next time, I think I'll add a bit more honey since I like my bread on the sweet side."

The flavor was ok so we are using it to make toast! I decided to make another batch (with adjustments) and it was 100% better! I reduced the flour to a total of 5 cups (3 c wheat, 2 cups bread flour), replaced the oil with 5 tbs of melted butter, doubled the honey to 2/3 c, increased the water to 2 1/3 cups and reduced the Active Yeast to 2 tsp. \nI believe this is a near perfect loaf of bread! It's so soft and delicious. Now we will see how it freezes!"

But I was not quite satisfied with the taste so I thought I’d try a different but similar recipe. \nBeing a novice bread maker it did not occur to me to check the measurements on this recipe so I simple started throwing ingredients together. Which is when I realized something was terribly wrong. I checked the recipe and my measurements and all was spot on. But there is waaayyyy too much flour for this recipe. I do not know how people were able to add the full 5 cups of flour unless they didn’t and just went by feel instead. Which isn’t very good help for novices like myself. \nSo wish me luck that I can somehow make this dough into some reasonable bread."

"reviewBody": "Finally, a simple wheat recipe that doesn't require so many additional steps! I did want something a little healthier so per one of the reviews I did use 5 cups of whole wheat, plus a cup or 2 of all purpose just until it wasn't sticking to the sides of the bowl. And per alot of the reviews I did up the honey to 2/3 cup and also upped the salt to 1 1/2 tsp. It only took 30 min at 375 in my oven and it was definitely done. I do wish the directions explained to use UP to 5 cups of white flour - do not pour it in all at once, and then u won't need to add more water like one of the reviews said. Start with the 5 cups wheat and about 1 cup white, mix for 2 min, and then add about 1/2 cup of flour until dough is pulling away clean from sides of bowl (mixing for about 8-10 min total), and then whatever is needed to shape into dough ball. That being said, I was looking for a recipe that allowed me to use more wheat than white flour and this is def it! Thank you!"

"reviewBody": "I really got irritated when I bought a loaf of bread from the supermarket and it didn't mold after three weeks in my cupboard. So I decided to tackle my fear of baking bread and give this one a try. I read all the reviews and increased the honey to 1/2 cup, increased the salt to 1.5 tsp and substituted salted butter for the oil. I used white whole wheat flour (2 cups), unbleached bread flour (2 cups) and all-purpose flour (3 cups). I used my Kitchen Aid and was able to incorporate all the flour. I kneaded the dough only a little, and that was probably a mistake, and based on other reviews, I didn't bake it the full 30 minutes, which was also a mistake as one of my loaves was a bit doughy. The other loaf, after a little longer in the oven however, was perfect and delicious! This will become our new normal. Thanks for posting!"

I'm a newbie to kneading so I literally was kneading for 45 minutes with pauses to google \"how to tell when it's done kneading\" and \"how to knead dough\" since it was taking forever. ;) But somehow, this turned out really well. It tastes great, and my kids loved it - my 5 yr old just keeps asking for more bread. The cooking time was spot on and I pulled it out right between 25 and 30 minutes. I'm looking forward to trying one of the suggestions of putting a handful of oats in it some time. I'll be making this again."

"reviewBody": "First bread I've ever made. It turned out great. I used 4 cups of white flour instead of 5 , a little bit less than a half a cup of honey and little less than 2 teaspoons of salt and I used my Kitchenaid to do the rest. My dough was rising in the oven with open oven door at 175 F for about hour and a half and then I let it rise in the loaf pans in the oven for another 40 minutes. Baked at 375 for 25 min. I love the taste (does not taste like flour), consistency and pretty much everything about this bread. The cool thing about it is that I was able to use organic flour and make it as healthy as it gets for my family. I had almost half a loaf by my self, I had to try a sandwich with lunch meat and pb&amp;j, my dogs loved it with pb. Awesome recipe."

"reviewBody": "At one time I baked quite a bit of bread, but circumstances made it more trouble than it was worth for a few years. I recently rededicated myself to bread making and this is the first recipe I tried. My yeast was almost 5 years old, but I proofed it and it seemed workable. I made only a couple of small changes, using 3 cups of WW flour and about 4 cups of AP, and I used about one half cup of honey. I put it in a warm oven to rise and it took over two hours to double in bulk. Was it the old yeast or the extra WW flour, I don't know. The second rise was also slow, over an hour. I baked the loaves about 30 minutes and they turned out beautifully and oh, so tasty. BTW, my KA mixer handled the kneading with no problem, about 7 minutes on speed 2. For my first bread effort in years, I couldn't be happier. Next time, I will make some small changes to personalize the bread, but this is an excellent basic recipe."

I also used 1/2c of honey. After letting it rise the first time and splitting the dough, I noticed that it took way more time to rise than the first rise. I only gave it 3 stars because it took almost 4 hours to complete. I haven't tasted it yet, but this was my very first attempt at a yeast yielding bread. I have been making banana and banana nut bread which is quite easy."

I used the exact amount of flour it called for and thought it was not going to come out right as it was very difficult to knead and I read the comments of others, AFTER I had added all the flour, kneaded it and stuck it in the oven to proof. (my oven has a bread proof setting.) It took twice as much time to rise, both times. However, it was worth it, it is delicious. I will make this again."

Her recipe was complicated, but it included honey instead of sugar, and wheat, so I thought this recipe would be a good fit. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was OK. The bread is shaped like a rectangle (completely fat on top) and it was pretty dense. It tastes OK, but doesn't have much flavor. I realize that wheat take time to rise, or sometimes doesn't rise at all, and maybe that was part of my problem. Also, I live in a high altitude, so that may may a difference. Overall....it was just....OK."

I pretty much followed the recipe as written, with the exception of adding one packet of Maple and Brown Sugar Oatmeal, as one other review suggested. I used to buy rolls from a local bakery to use for sandwiches...not any more! To make sure my 1st loaves were done, I checked their internal temperature. When they reached 190 degrees I pulled them out of the oven. They were perfect. This is now my go-to recipe for daily bread and I can't wait to experiment with different flavors of oatmeal.

The loaves still came out very soft and tasty though. Next time I will add more water. The protein level in the flour is very high, which means it will absorb more liquid, so according to King Arthur flour, you should add two teaspoons extra liquid per cup of flour to the recipe you are using. So just a bit more water and a warmer place to rest and rise should do the trick!"

I use one packet of yeast and use a 1/2 cup of honey. The best part is that it calls for no eggs, milk or butter so it's truly economical for those looking for an affordable bread recipe. The bread comes out so soft and sweet. This is one of my favorite bread recipes on AR."

Dough doubled nicely, and I took the suggestion of the baker who used the microwave and a bowl of hot water as a proofing box of sorts. Baked for 30 minutes, and the result was a light, soft loaf with good crumb. I also doubled the honey, then added 3 TB of granulated sugar for good measure because I prefer a sweeter bread.

I also put honey down the center of the loaf directly before baking it. I ran it down with a knife to bake into the top of the bread, giving it a dimple down the middle. I think the bread came out nice, but it took forever to rise. I put the oven on to 170 and let it cool down for a few minutes,then put the bread in there for an hour with a damp cloth over it to rise. I had to do that both times and it never did rise as much as desired. I only gave it three stars mostly because even half the recipe took about 4-5 hours to get a loaf of bread, not the two stated. We ended up going to the store to buy bread for dinner and this finish when we were ready to go to bed. If you make the entire recipe, I'd double the honey."

Mine barely moved on the 2nd rise (yeast proofed fine) and I kept giving it time to rise until I finally did the \"imprint test\" and it said it was ready despite looking pretty much the same height as when it went in. I knew it wouldn't rise much cooking. It came out with a good consistency, but it was small of course, and pretty bland, though I followed the suggestions of increasing the honey. I don't know what I was expecting with taste, maybe I'm an artisan bread snob? I was trying to find a simple wheat bread for my kids to substitute for store-bought. I guess this would be it, but the issues with rising - I've never had a bread not rise so I'm a bit perplexed. I'll give it another try it again before writing it off."
