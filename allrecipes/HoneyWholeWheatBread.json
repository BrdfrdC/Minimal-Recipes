I then increased the honey to a 1/4 cup 1tsp yeast 2 cups whole wheat flour 1 cup white all purpose flour and one tsp salt subtitled butter for the oil. Used my stand mixer allowed to raise until just over the top of loaf pan and then pre heated my air fryer to 375 deg. Placed the loaf pan in the air fryer and cooked at 375 for 33 minutes used an instant read thermometer and checked for internal temperature of 200 deg. The bread came out perfectly great."

It completely touched the lid of the machine and deflated, ruining the look of the loaf. Tasted great but wow. This is way too much. I made a second batch on dough-only mode and then formed it into 8 sandwich size rolls. Let rise, covered for 30 minutes then bake for 15 minutes on 350. (the second batch had maple syrup rather than honey... not as good!) Next time I use the machine for this recipe, I'm going to adjust it down to 8 servings instead of 10. If that doesn't work, I'll just use the loaf pan and the oven like others have suggested. I rated it four stars because it really does taste great but it is just too much for the machine."

"reviewBody": "This has become my go-to recipe because it is repeatable and very good. The only modification I make is that after weighing the all-purpose white flour, I remove 4 teaspoons of it and replace with about 4 teaspoons of vital wheat gluten. I also weigh my flours (195g whole wheat, 188g of all purpose) instead of measuring by cups which can be inaccurate. I bake in conventional oven after processing the dough on the “Dough” cycle in a bread machine. If I am able to catch the dough and remove it from the machine right after the final “punch down” step (usually about 20 minutes or so before end of cycle) I pull it out and transfer to the baking pan (after shaping and lightly flouring) so that I don’t “waste” too much of its rising capacity by handling repeatedly."

So: I added 1/4 c raw honey, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 c margarine (I don't have access to butter). Oh, and in my warm and humid country, I only added 1 tsp active dry yeast on top of the 2c wheat flour, 1c bread flour and 1 tbsp of wheat gluten. The machine setting was wheat, and medium crust.\nSo, ok, I changed it a lot! But, seriously, this recipe was the basis so credit where credit is due, right?\nThe bread was DIVINE. Soft and fluffy, lots of wheat nuttiness, the crust was perfect (not too thick or tough).\nMy go-to recipe from now on!"

I've been searching and trying wheat bread recipes with mediocre results until I found this recipe. I normally make 2 loaves a week and as the recipe is I give it 5 stars. His preference is a little sweeter tasting so I did go on the advice of others on here and add 1/4 cup honey instead of 3 tbsp honey, added 1 tsp salt instead 1/3 tsp and added 2 cups wheat flour and 1 cup bread flour instead 1 1/2 cup wheat and 1 1/2 cup bread flour. He says it's perfect with the extra honey and loves it! Thanks for sharing it"

All wheat is too dry, but half white, half wheat is tender. I used to make home made bread all the time when kids were little. This compares to that consistency very well. Just husband and I now. One loaf lasting 3-5 days. Perfect!"

I adjusted the honey to 1/4 cup and added 2 Tbs. of Vital Wheat Gluten and used the White Bread cycle. Very tasty and good color. I also tried the recipe using with 2 cups of Whole Wheat and 1 cup of White Bread flour. Also very tasty however did not rise as well. In addition I have left the salt out of the recipe as I have to lower my sodium intake and it does not seem to affect the taste, I could not taste a difference"
