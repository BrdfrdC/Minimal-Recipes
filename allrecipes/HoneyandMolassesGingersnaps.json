Allrecipes cinnamon added a special spice to these as well. My daughter is the cookie maker in my house and we made these together. We also ate them together. The cookies didn't make it two days in our house -- they were so yummy! One of her favorite recipes."

"reviewBody": "Made the recipe as is. They were tasty; and of course I do appreciate the low calories per cookie. However, my cookies came out a bit burnt! I don't believe my oven runs particularly hot; I would recommend cooking them for a minute or two less than the recipe states. They are gingersnaps, so be aware they are quite hard cookies. If you like a soft, moist cookie this recipe is not for you. Not a huge fan of the cinnamon sugar coating, but that's purely opinion based. Overall a fairly good ginger cookie recipe."

"reviewBody": "I substituted a TB spoon of fresh finely grated ginger instead of the ginger powder. I added it to the sugar, butter, honey and molasses mixture and incorporated it well before added the dry portion. I also used granulated sugar and cinnamon instead of turbinado sugar. This is what what grandma used to roll them in... LOVE these cookies!!!"

"reviewBody": "This is a quick, easy alternative to my regular gingersnap recipe which calls for cloves and more molasses. I used a 1.5 inch scoop and it made 38 good sized cookies. I will have to try and double the recipe since my \"cookie monsters\" ate most of them as soon as they came out of the oven! I did not roll them in the sugar mixure."
