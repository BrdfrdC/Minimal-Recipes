Said it was better than the restaurant! I bought marinated, jarred artichoke hearts instead of canned. I think next time I will try using cream cheese in place of the heavy cream. I plan on making this for a Labor Day picnic in a few weeks! Thanks for sharing!!\nOh...and I like extra cheese! Can't possibly make this too cheesy!"

I also added a little shredded mozzarella on top of the dip before baking. For a large gathering, I'd recommend doubling the recipe. I made it the night before and baked it for about 45 min at 325 degrees for a double batch."

I just put everything in one small casserole dish (9x13 dish seems WAY too big) and stir everything after 10 minutes in the oven. Also, I just use slightly over 1/2 cup of parmesan instead of a mixture of parm and Romano, plus I usually increase the garlic drastically (and add garlic powder). I used to always make pita chips for this, but I've discovered I like it with tortilla chips right out of the bag even more!! Thanks so much for the recipe!"

Also, I did not bother with the food processor, just chopped up the artichokes and stirred everything together. Topped with chopped tomato after baking. It was easy and we will be making it often.

Next time I will add 8 oz. f cream cheese instead. I also added 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice and about a 1/2 teaspoon of salt too. I look forward to making this again!

I didn't have heavy cream so I substituted a mixture of regular milk and butter. Since the size was reduced to 8, I used 1/4 cup of milk and about 2 1/2tbsps. of cooled melted butter. Also, I didn't have grated Romano cheese. I substituted that with about 1 1/2 cups of shredded 'pizza' cheese which included shredded moz, provolone and romano! When mixing all the ingredients it appears thick but after cooking it loosens. Cook the stated time (20 to 25 mins.) then top with extra shredded pizza cheese and turn the broiler on high to brown. So so good."

I also baked it for a full 30 minutes and kept checking after 20 minutes for golden browning of the edges...it was DELICIOUS! I added a pinch of pepper and a pinch of salt but I think I will add a bit more salt to taste. I did not have minced garlic so I used one medium sized garlic clove and chopped it along with the artichoke and cheeses."

I approximately used 5 large hand fulls of fresh kale and boiled it for a few minutes; drained and pat dried it for 10 oz. I proceeded with the recipe with a few changes. I added one small can of whole chilies that I pulsed along with step #2. I used Greek plain yogurt instead of sour cream. As a topping I added sprinkles of paprika."

I added 4 oz cream cheese, more garlic, more parmesan cheese and a squeeze of lemon, baked it again for 15 minutes and it was much better. The cream cheese really added a lot both in taste and texture. My husband and son both loved it. Next time I think I will add another can of artichokes as there wasn't enough for my liking."

My family loves their spin dip so it's the first thing we order when dining out for our appetizer....well not anymore we will probably be making this weekly! It also makes a large enough amount for entertaining and goes great with the \"Perfect Pita Chips\" recipe on this site. I followed this recipe except for following suggestions to add just a little chicken broth to make it smooth and creamy which also helps it from getting thick when reheating. Hope you all enjoy this we sure did"

"reviewBody": "I have made this recipe numerous times! I have used it as a sauce on pizza instead of a red sauce, and as a spread on a sandwich for more pizzazzzz. It is very versatile. I do however, change a few things. Replace the frozen 10 oz spinach with roughly 14-16 oz fresh spinach and it seems to make a HUGE difference. I add 2 more teaspoons of minced garlic, and 1 cup more cup of Fresh Parmesean cheese. I have been known to make a batch and freeze it in small portions (pyrex is the best, you can take it from the freezer to the oven or microwave!). Great for last minute events, and wonderful for parties all through the year. I have not ever had a negative comment. I am so very thankful for this great recipe!"

Definitely prefer the hot version of spinach/artichoke dip to the cold one."
