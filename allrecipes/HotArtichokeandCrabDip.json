I’ve served it in a bread bowl too, which is delicious. Just be careful to cover the bread with foil so it doesn’t burn while you’re heating the dip. Enjoy!"

It is a very easy and versatile recipe, ready to be served with baguette slices, crackers, pita chips and mini bell pepper or celery. Hardly anyone changed the recipe so this is a keeper. Can be made ahead and popped in the oven as needed. Could see this as an opened faced sandwich topped with a little parmesan cheese, baked then under the broiler a minute or so. Add tomato basil soup and call it dinner. Thank you for a yummy offering!"

It actually tasted much better after reheating it several times. Ate it on crackers. delicious and would make it again."
