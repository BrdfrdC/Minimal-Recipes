I thought to myself, “what says hot wings other than chicken?” Then it came to me...this recipe has cream elements. I played around with it a little bit and removed the cream cheese, ranch dressing, and chicken and replaced it with Chrzan and pickled herring in sour cream, aka sledzie. This hits the spot on game day. We always have oplatek left over from Christmas, and these work amazingly well as a dipping implement. Na zdrowie!"

I also added a half stick of butter to the chicken after I cubes it. I took the cream cheese, hot sause and ranch and used my ninja to blend it and took out my ninja blade. I added the chicken to the ninja container with the mix in it and stuck in the fridge overnight. The morning of the party I used my crockpot on high for an hour and then added the shredded cheese. Once the cheese melted I lowered it to the low setting and once the party began I used the warm setting. I think next time I am going to use bleu cheese and also have celery to use to dip with!"

I also eliminated the shredded cheese and sprinkled it with Blue Cheese crumbles after it cooked instead. I also used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch. With these changes it tasted just like my favorite buffalo wings. I will be adding twice as much chicken next time and cube cutting it instead of shredding. Great recipe as is - try it - if you like buffalo wings you will love this recipe. Either blue cheese or ranch is good it just depends on what you like... Definitely try it on celery sticks!"

Cook the strips in the oven as directed then cut into bite~sized pieces. I typically layer the ingred. over the chicken starting w/ the wing sauce then the dressing mixed w/ softened cream cheese..I use blue cheese dressing instead of ranch, and this seems to be another favorite...this is such a hit with any group gathering,can't go wrong!!! Something else I've done w/ this...instead of using it as a dip, we had in stuffed in tortillas for dinner! Buffalo chick. burritos!! a great idea for leftover dip too...if you have any leftover!! :-)"

Then I mix the chicken and the bottle of Franks Hot Wing Sauce into a 9X13 pan and stick it in the oven to warm while I mix the rest. I then melt the cream cheese and ranch together on the stove top, low heat and spread it over the chicken, sprinkle the shredded cheddar and bake until bubbly and brown. I serve with tortilla chips."

"reviewBody": "Very tasty. Just like Buffalo Wings without the mess. I think 16 oz of cheese is a bit excessive. 8 oz was plenty for us, and I definitely didn't need to use the full 12 oz of hot sauce to give it a nice kick! I did about 7 oz of hot sauce and that made it a pretty spicy \"medium\" flavor. I also think that 1 pound of shredded chicken breast is too little. I used 1 1/2 pounds, but I think more like 3 pounds would make this dip PERFECT!"

"reviewBody": "Had something like this at a party but when I made it I skipped the cheddar and instead threw in some bleu and feta cheeses. This way it doesn't get as greasy and don't worry if you are not a bleu cheese fan- it will mellow as it heats. In addition, we kept adding more and more hot sauce. Could have been the brand I bought but for our taste it didn't seem \"buffalo\" enough."

The dip tasted OK, but it was WAY too soupy. My sister's recipe only called for 1 pkg. cream cheese and the dip was in layers, not all stirred together, I think I will follow hers next time."

I will warn you, if you are looking for something healthy, don't try this one...it is full of fat, but that is just fine for us to have on special occasions!"

"reviewBody": "I made this Dip for an appetizer on thanksgiving. It was delicious. I do have one tip though. If your going to make it the night before to save oven space don't put the cheese on yet. Make the main part of the dip, put it away and then add the cheese on top the day your going to serve it.(Microwave it if you can't use the oven.) I wasn't thinking and I cooked it all the night before. The cheese was VERY hard, but the dip underneath was good. I think it would have been the best dip ever if the cheese was melted right before. Oh and DON'T add the full amount of hot sauce. I used half of what the recipe called for and it was spicy enough."

The only change I have made is instead of 2 blocks of cream cheese, I use one block and 250ml of sour cream. I cut down the hot sauce depending on the crowd we are serving. Not everyone likes the heat like we do! Delicious!"

Add in about a cup of Franks Hot Sauce, then about a cup of Ranch dressing ( I do use the cheaper brand for this- doesn't seem to matter) 1/2 a package of finely shredded sharp cheddar and 1 package of cream cheese. Mix well and put in an 8x8 pan to bake for about 30 min at 350. Top with cheese and bake again until melted. Best with tortilla chips. Tastes GREAT!"
