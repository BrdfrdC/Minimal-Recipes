"reviewBody": "I was expecting a rich chocolate flavor throughout, and that’s not what I got… more like biscuits that someone rolled in hot chocolate powder to see how it turned out (thinking of “dough boys” when we went camping as kids), it the experiment wasn’t bad. Not like a well crafted recipe to be passed down and serving a bold chocolate flavor. It wasn’t bad, but won’t be making again."
