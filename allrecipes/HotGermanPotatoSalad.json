"reviewBody": "Flavorful - absolutely! Oktoberfest authentic - not that I have ever had at Oktoberfest and I have been there multiple times, once for 6 straight days. There are so very many different recipes for all foods and never more true than here or in Germany. As indicated, the recipe has good flavor, and I like it, but this would most likely be served in a restaurant the plays with flavors. Potato salad in Southern Germany (Bavaria especially) is almost always potatoes, finely chopped onions, white vinegar, vegetable oil, salt, pepper, with a bit of water at times (the water the potatoes were boiled in). Some restaurants serve it warm, but mostly it's at room temperature or slightly chilled. Virtually any mayo-free German Kartofelsalad is fine with me, but it is usually a very simple side dish as above. Bacon is often added in northern Germany and sometimes in Schwabia."

"reviewBody": "First let me say I'm 64 years old and I've always detested German potato salad. While my poor husband loves it, I've never made it. For a recent outdoor get together I decided to make this. Let me say everyone loved it, including myself. While I followed the ingredients to a T I did alter the amounts. I used about 3 pounds unpeeled (I'm lazy) red potatoes, about 3/4+ pounds thick cut bacon and 1.25 cups onion and doubled the sauce. While I doubled the sauce I did not double all the amounts. For double the sauce I used: 2 tsp of flour, 2 tsp of sugar, 2 tsp of salt (might go 2.5 or 3 next time), 1 tsp celery seed (might try 1.5 next time), 1/4 tsp pepper, 1.5 cups water and 2/3 chips white vinegar. When it was done I put it in an uncovered crockpot just to keep it warm. I was not impressed when it was first finished but after sitting for an hour or two in the crockpot it was delicious. So my take-a-way: This must sit for a period of time so that the flavors will meld. This was really good and quite the hit. I will make this many more times. Thank you for this recipe."

The \"extra\" flour made the salad a bit gluggy and slightly dissatisfying.\n\nAlso: I wish the person sharing this recipe would specify in the ingredients list the weight of the potatoes or at least the size of the \"9 potatoes.\" I am certain I'm not the only cook wondering just what size/type/amount of potatoes to use.\n\nAnd: I agree with earlier commenter who said a bit more vinegar would be better. I took her advice and added another two tablespoons (white wine vinegar) to my recipe.\n\nOther than the flour mishap and having to guess at true amount of potatoes-----this recipe is a keeper.\n\nOh-----and I used veggie bacon. Delicious."

"reviewBody": "I would suggest a slight variation to the Recipe. Use boiled red potatoes that are allowed to cool down after cooking and then skinned. Allow the bacon fat to cool down and then add a small portion for the dressing mixture of mayo, vinegar, sugar and small dab of sweet spicy German mustard. Do not heat this dressing. I would also recommend adding chopped boiled eggs, chopped pickles and chopped celery to the potato salad."

Even with the red potatoes, felt it lacked in the eye appeal so added scallions and parsley, too. Took it to a party last night, and there was zero left, so I am now making it again today! That's how good it is! Thanks for a great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This is very close to the German potato salad I used to make, then lost the recipe. The changes I made were to add about 1 tsp of ground mustard, and since I love the dressing so much, I double upon the ingredients and triple to quadruple the bacon (because the only thing better than bacon is more bacon). It freezes well, but the potatoes get a bit mushy when reheated, so the texture is almost like a very chunky mashed potato salad."

I spent far too much time during the party trying to coordinate this so it would still be hot. Ended up with good flavor, but kind of gluey (I used red potatoes). Won't likely make it again because we don't eat a lot of potato salad, but for another person, this might be great."

I ended up browning the flour mixture in the cooked onions, then added the vinegar and water to make a gravy. After draining the potatoes, let them sit over low heat for a bit to release the steam before adding the sauce. The potatoes will stay formed and not be as gummy."

This is a family secret from my German ancestors... do not drain the bacon fat,save it in the pan low heat and simmer, then add your spices and onions as well as your vinegar, simmer 3-5 minutes making sure not to burn, then pour over potatoes. This makes the dish much more flavorful and savory. Truly the ultimate comfort food."
