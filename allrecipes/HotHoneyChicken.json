I used Cholula hot sauce and this was very good; I cooked it until the chicken was a golden brown and it would have been amazing over rice; I'll make it that way next time. Still, it was a very tasty sweet hot flavor, so do yourself a favor and get some good, quality hot sauce when you make this."

I thought the black pepper was a little strong and would probably cut that in half next time. I did mine on the grill which needs to be on low so the sugar in the honey doesn't burn. Easy to do and tasty. I saved a little of the sauce out for a dipping sauce when the chicken was finished."

However I'd been sampling the sauce so much while cooking my taste buds burnt out by the time dinner came around. I simmered my leftover sauce and added some cumin, cilantro and a lot of onion and it made for a nice but very spicy sauce for my rice. My boyfriend loved the recipe as is, but next time I would try half as much hot sauce."

Honey overpowered the hot. There was a slight hot aftertaste, but that's about it for flavor. I may try this again by making a dipping sauce out of the honey and hot sauce, and maybe I'll feel differently. Thanks for sharing anyway!"

"reviewBody": "I think the reviewer from 9/26/2003 was right, the results of this recipe will vary a lot based on the style of sauce you use. We used Frank's Red Hot sauce, and followed the recipe exactly except we broiled boneless breasts instead of grilling whole pieces. I can't stand vinegary food, and with Frank's it wasn't too vinegary at all. Unfortunately, it also wasn't very spicy at all, it would be a good idea to marinate for a little while. This isn't our favorite recipe ever, but it's sure fast and easy, and can be part of a healthy quick dinner. It went really well with carrot and celery sticks and ranch dressing."
