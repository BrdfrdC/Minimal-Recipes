"reviewBody": "I've lived in Chicago for over 30 years, and have become hooked on hot giardiniera. This is hands down the best one ever. I have made it about a dozen times, and everyone I know loves when I have a new batch ready. I use peppers from my garden, so sometimes they are not too spicy, and sometimes they melt your face off. A tip I wanted to share if your peppers are too spicy: adding more carrots, cauliflower and some diced jicama helps absorb some of the spice plus adds a nice crunch. It's fun to pick the red jalapeños and Serranos to make a unique batch of red giardiniera. You can't go wrong with this recipe. This is amazing on scrambled eggs, baked potatoes and pretty much anything else."

I use a lot less oil -- maybe 2:1 vinegar to oil instead of 1:1 -- and I use half olive oil and half regular vegetable/canola oil. That way it doesn't solidify in the fridge.\n2. I make a mild version. Even though I like spicy foods, I rarely use the jalapeno (usually because I don't typically have it on hand). You can use whatever vegetables you want, I usually stick to cauliflower, carrots, celery, and red bell peppers. \n\nYUM!"

At first, I was afraid that the 1/2 cup of salt called for to soak veggies in was WAY too much? But after all was combined, and left to sit in the oil and vinegar, it turned out perfect. Just be sure to rinse veggies after they are done soaking really good."

"reviewBody": "This is a terrific recipe that closely mimics Vienna's Hot Giardiniera. I followed the recipe to the letter until tasting. At that point I added diced serrano peppers to achieve the heat level I was striving for. I have experienced a similar issue with recipes calling for jalapeno peppers prior to this recipe as there is a high degree of variance in heat level in Jalapenos. Serranos while not being overly hot are very consistent in the heat each pepper adds to the mix. Overall everyone loves the results of this recipe &amp; enjoys the salad mix in many different ways. Great Recipe."

"reviewBody": "Very tasty... very fresh.. \nThe mistake I made was emptying the entire 5.7oz bottle of olives with juice into the mixture. Should've drained the juice and maybe sliced the olives. \n\nThe olive juice is too present/up front in my mixture. Truthfully, I don't mind that.. but its a bit overpowering considering the amount of vinegar. I'm pretty certain the flavors would have been more balanced without the olive juice.\n\nI made this mixture specifically for homemade Italian beef sandwiches.. I was hoping to convert my wife and sons to the joy of the Italian Beef... I got one of three... kinda! LOL"

All my vegetables were roughly chopped- so this could be a finger food snack. I canned this in a hot water bath for 25 minutes for quarts leaving out the oil. I add oil to the mixture after I open up the canned quarts. This is hot but not TOO hot and the taste is awesome! I will definitely make this again next year when the garden is ready for harvest!"

She makes this delicious giardiniera to give as gifts. She also puts it on quesadillas. I make it for my family. We put it on rice, pasta, and pizza, and my husband mixes it in sour cream to tone down the heat and likes it as a side dish with sausage. I also use it as an Italian-style salsa with chips. Yum!"

"reviewBody": "I loved this recipe though I did make a few changes based on our taste preferences. First, since I had thought the store giardiniera was way too salty, I made sure I rinsed mine very well after I took it out of the fridge. Next, I did use Canola oil as others suggested since I knew I would be keeping it in the fridge and olive oil solidifies in the fridge. Finally, I only put in three jalepenos, but even that was too spicy for my husband so I may put in even fewer next time--or make us separate batches. \nI took some to share with my son and daughter-in-law and they too loved it. I will be making this again--soon."

For my personal preference, I wasn't crazy about the garlic. My husband loved it! Second batch, I left garlic out and added a bit more cauliflower and some hot banana peppers and used a blend of canola and olive oil. It's really hard to stay out of the jar. Thanks for a truly delicious recipe!"

I soaked veggies with 1/4 cup of salt for a day. Even after draining and rinsing veggies very well, there was still a very prevelent taste of salt. I then used about 4 ounces of the olives and about 3/4 cup of distilled vinegar and canola oil, along with the oregano, red pepper flakes, pepper. Overall it was very good. While I don't love salt, next time I will decrease salt and maybe mix in some black olives too."

I did change it a bit, I didn't have green peppers so only used orange bell peppers, I don't like green olives so I omited them but added mushrooms. I didn't have jalapeños but did have fresh red chili peppers (I didn't add seeds, concerned it would be too spicy). I like a bit more vinegar flavour so I added 1/4 cup less olive oil and added 1/4 cup more white vinegar. I also doubled the recipe, jarred and put them in hot water bath for 5 minutes so that it will keep. So, so yummy...Thank you for sharing"

"reviewBody": "My husband is a Chicago native and every time we go back to visit, we make a Bari's run to stock up on their medium and hot giardiniera. When I needed a milder version for a dinner party, I used this recipe -- and we like it even better. The big difference is that instead of running the jars through a canning process, I just stick them in the back of the fridge for up to six months. As long as the vegetables are submerged in the briny oil, they stay crunchy, bright and beautiful. For those of you who find the oil off-putting, consider this. As we use the \"fresh\" giardiniera, I pour that yummy oil into another container and repurpose it as a fabulous secret ingredient in pizza/foccacia dough and Italian soups. I also brush it on split rolls and toast them in the oven to elevate my Italian Beef sandwiches. (The modifications I apply to this recipe are omitting the saltwater soak, adding a 12 oz jar of sliced pepperoncini/banana peppers, and substituting canola oil for olive oil.)"
