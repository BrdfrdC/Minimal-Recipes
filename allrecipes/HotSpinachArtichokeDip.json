Added it to two cups of thawed spinach, added more grated cheese as well as roasted red peppers and 1/4 cup mexican blend cheese. Also topped with grated parmesan cheese. It turned out amazing. Roasted red peppers gave it a smokey flavor component and depth. The mexican blend didnt add much flavor so it can be subbed out for your favorite cheese."

Also, added 1 teaspoon of granulated garlic with parsley and used fresh spinach. We served this Everything crackers, sesame crackers, toasted garlic French bread, toasted and untoasted pita chips, and shredded wheat crackers. It was easy to warm up on day 2 with a moistened paper towel to cover and reheat in the microwave. I would make this again and again!"

I opted for miracle whip in olive oil than mayonnaise. Didnâ€™t have mayonnaise and never use it. The artichokes needed to be fully drained and chopped fine, the jar I had were in olive oil, vinegar and oregano. Got a bit tangier taste. But overall itâ€™s a hit to please any crowd.

I only gave it a 4 star bc I think the ratio of artichoke and spinach to the base of the dip is too much. I ended up doubling the cream cheese and sour cream and cheeses to accommodate the amount of vegetables. Nobody was mad that there was more dip but still. Another note, Iâ€™m not enjoying the basil in this dip. And I highly recommend a little cayenne pepper. Maybe 1/4 tsp."

I doubled the amount of parmesan, because I didn't have romano. I used a 10 oz. package of frozen spinach; thawed and squeezed dry. I added a 1/4 c of plain greek yogurt. I omitted the mozzarella, because I didn't bake it. Everything else in the recipe stayed the same. I let it sit in the refrigerator a few hours before serving. It's delicious with a fresh relish tray (carrots, celery, sweet peppers, etc.); also good on crackers and pita chips. The raw garlic and salty parmesan give it a punch of flavor."

After reading the reviews, I did substitute the sour cream for the mayo (I used an 8oz cup to ensure it wasn't dry) and I added extra artichokes only because I enjoy it that way. AWESOME recipe!!"

The only thing I did differently was to sautÃ© some fresh baby spinach vs frozen and added some paprika and onion powder. It only took about 10 minutes in our air fryer at 350. It came out nice and brown on the top."

I was looking for a spinach dip recipe that tasted like the ones you order in the restaurant. This recipe is great but after making it a couple of times I experimented just a little. I added a half envelope of Knorrs Leek Soup mix to this recipe and WOW, it tasted just like a spinach dip that was made in a restaurant. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This dish is quite honestly delicious! So simple yet so exquisite with flavors. We typically use ever recipe as a base and spice it up with our own twist but opted to keep it simple due to the reviews we read. They were right! The only thing we added was white pepper and I think that's all it needed. For those who haven't experimented with white pepper, it provides such a beautiful, light flavor while also adding the perfect amount of spice. Highly recommend. But anyways. If you're doubting this simple recipe's ability to wow you, don't! This is the first Greek dish we've tried and we will be adding this to our regular rotation. The zucchini and potato complement each other perfectly, what one lacks in texture the other provides. The onion and tomato are great supporters in flavor as well. Overall extremely impressed. Will make many times over and believe this would be a hit at any dinner gathering. Be prepared to use multiple baking dishes and have lot's of leftovers, this has a huge yield! That was great for us because we meal prep so I'll be able to enjoy this a few more times later this week!!"
