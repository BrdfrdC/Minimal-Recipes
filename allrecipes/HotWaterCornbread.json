That kind is uncommon in my part of Canada."

On its own with syrup or gravy is fine, but blended into a meal much better!"

My husband's family has been making this version for years. We only use stone ground mill cornmeal. This makes a huge difference. Easier to find in small towns in the south. We put whatever amount we're going to make in a large flatter type soup bowl. We measure salt by topping the top of the mound with salt(like a snow top mountain). We add enough water so it's between thick and thin. Cover bottom of frying pan with oil and drop by tablespoon. If you like your cornbread crunchier then make the batter a little thinner. My husband would neve want sugar in his fried cornbread. Whenever I make this no one has ever seen it but everyone loves it."

Just keep practicing u till you get it the way you want them."

Same recipe but drop into boiling pot of greens for a few minutes makes great corn bread dumplings! Mm mmm I can see my grand ma making these as I write. Also goes with pulled pork spit and made as sandwich."

My family loves this corn bread on the side with turnip greens, mustard greens and collard greens. It's even good with strawberry jam and preserves on top as a snack. I am an old Southern cook and this recipe is just like my grandma cooked. A+"

Reduced hot water by 2 tablespoons, thus adding 2 tablespoons of coconut milk, used corn oil instead of shortening, also slightly increased corn meal. I am happy!!!!!!!!!"

"reviewBody": "I didn't use cornbread mix. I used plain corn meal Cornbread mix has salt and flour in it. I also cut back on the water just a little and use milk. It helps it brown when not using sugar. I also add bacon grease to fry it in as it gives it the flavor I was used to growing up. My mother in law used to fry these in bacon grease only. She would butter them the minute they come out of the skillet and let the butter melt on the hot cornbread. Delicious."

We eat fried grits (what my mother called Fried Mush) with syrup so that would be about the same flavors. Very good. She put left over grits in a square tupperware container and refrigerated. When set she would slice them and fry in butter and drizzle syrup on them. Both being made from corn would have the same delicious flavors..will have to try sometime if we ever have any left over."

"reviewBody": "Very good cornbread. Easy to prepare and does not take long to cook.\n\nI used olive oil the first two times and vegetable oil the last time. Olive oil tasted better to me, but as a novice cook I found the oil had a more narrow cooking temperature range because it would spike in temp pretty quickly if not carefull. I stood over it and the first pop took it off the eye and turned the eye off and it got even hotter it seemed. Splattered everywhere.\n\nWith the vegetable oil I never had that even begin to get too hot. I think olive oil has a lower flashpoint and as a result a much norrower cooking range for the cornbread."

I increased it to 20 and i ended up with 16. It would not form \"little cakes\" so i just dropped it in the oil right off a spoon. I was also out of salt so i just used the sugar and i spread salted butter on the top, and they came out very good. Even my little sister who will eat almost nothing except pizza liked them! Oh and i used butter instead of shortening."
