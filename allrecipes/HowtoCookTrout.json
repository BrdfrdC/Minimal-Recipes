The balance of the butter and the fresh squeezed lemon juice and the freshly picked parsley was wonderful. Instead of salt and pepper we used a salt free lemon pepper. We used a 1.5 pound rainbow trout fillet, so it ended up taking about 10 minutes to cook. We will be making this again."

That's how you get the crunchy crust. Basic thing but I always rinsed the fish off and threw it in the pan. Just adding that little pat to dry the skin made all the difference."
