I used dried rosemary and thyme and added Northwoods seasoning from Penzey's into the butter with the rosemary and thyme. I cut up several stalks of celery, several carrots, 3 small onions, and a green apple to rest in the pan because those are all delicious when cooked in the juices along with the Turkey. I also used convection, so I followed the standard guideline of reducing temperature by 25 degrees to 300. My whole family declared it spectacular, including the 6 and 9 year olds."

And turned out to be one of the best turkeys I've ever made! Mine was a 21 pounder but I still think I could have used a little less of the seasoning amounts called for the 12 pounder here. Nevertheless, the drippings plus some low-sodium chicken broth made for an excellent gravy. I may even be a little more intentional about the carrots next year and pick them out for a very delicious and colorful side dish."

I followed this recipe to a tee, but added 2 quarters of fresh naval orange, 2 quarters of sweet yellow onion, Five fresh, uncut garlic cloves, and also added garlic, rosemary, thyme, and sage to the butter reduction. I also added some rubbed sage to the salt, pepper, and cayenne. I know I’m going on and on, but I also doubled the amount of fresh veggies for the bed in the pan, and added pats of butter just under the skin of the bird. I slowed the cook time by going with 300°. And let me tell you, it was the best turkey I ever made! Thank you for the basis of this recipe, and never be afraid to add to it a little!!"

No brining, smoking, deep frying to get a super moist, tasty bird—just use this recipe. The only thing I did do was to cook my 21lb bird an oven bag (due to a time crunch) for about 3 1/2 hours at 350. I had planned to remove it from the bag and cook it the last half hour uncovered (as oven bagged birds have not given me the golden brown color (see photo—taken just out of from the oven) I’m looking for), but when I opened the oven my bird was perfect! Thank you Chef John for this amazing recipe! Now I look forward to cooking my next turkey instead of dressing it:)"

I've also used jar spices for the Rosemary &amp; Sage when I forgot to buy fresh and could not face another trip to the store. It's an acceptable substitute and I don't kick myself for it. The turkey is always tender and NOT DRY (yay!) and falls off the bone. My hubby and 5 boys love it and more importantly I love it. HA! Thanks!"

I added the salt and peppers to the melted butter instead of sprinkling the seasonings over the buttered turkey, and it came out a beautiful, all over, roasted brown. I did not have sprigs of rosemary, so I used my dried rosemary and sage, lightly chopped, moistened, rubbed inside and place remaining inside the turkey. The gravy was very salty, so I plan to adjust the salt in the giblet broth instead of on the turkey. however, I did not stuff the turkey and that may change the saltiness. I plan to only bake a turkey this way in the future. It was that good!"

Although I swap out the onion for beets for my dogs health I always save my favourite parts of the turkey for myself. The spice mix and cooking time are always perfect and I've never once had any issues. My dog especially gives this recipe 10/10"

I seasoned my turkey to my liking and injected it with Mojo. Covered it with bacon weave and stuffed it with a whole apple garlic and half a sour orange. I cooked it at 325° for 3 &amp; half hours it was 15lb pounder at the 3 hour mark I checked for temp, breast was done but legs needed about 5 degrees. I covered the breast with aluminum foil. I did let the bird rest for a good hour before carving... I was amazed at house juice it was and completely cooked... I also tried not to open the oven door at all."

I cooked it for almost 3 hours and it came out perfect. I used a 12 lb turkey and it was moist. I set it to the temperature indicated.\n\nFor the person who says their turkey was not cooked after 3 hours, I would have to say it's the oven. All ovens are different but most should cook a 12lb turkey after 2 1/2 hours.\n\nI also used the popout timer. I place one on the thickest part of the thigh and another at the thickest part of the breast. The thigh timer popped first and then 20 minutes later the breast timer popped. I left it in the oven, turned off for an additional 10 minutes and the turkey was to perfection. My guests could not stop complementing how moist and delicious the turkey was. I am happy with this recipe and will continue to use it. Also this is the second time in my life I made a turkey. The first time was 22 years ago, followed a Betty Crocker recipe and this time I used this recipe. Both times it came out super delicious!"

However, I've never been able to cook one where the Turkey looked evenly golden brown and so pretty. This recipe is so easy to follow and I was happy with my results. \n\nI didn't have fresh sage or rosemary. My go-to store was out. So I mixed 2 teaspoons of ground sage and crushed rosemary into the butter when I melted it. I used the same spices to coat two chopped up celery stalks in a bowl and then stuffed the raw Turkey with the coated celery. That way my Turkey was able to still get a good, aromatic flavor from inside the cavity as it cooked. This recipe is a keeper! Thank you Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "Delicious, but too salty for our taste (and we enjoy salt).\nThe cayenne pepper was a nice change. If you taste the dry spice mix it will be spicy, but once cooked on the turkey - it was very nice and not at all too spicy.\nI used a 16.5 pound turkey and followed the recipe exactly (exception: recipe calls for 12 pound turkey and I only had fine Sea Salt). \nI think had I used this on a 12 pound turkey, I'd be rating it lower than four stars because it would have been SO salty.\nThe next time I make this I will reduce the salt to 1 Tablespoon or perhaps slightly rounded Tablespoon. ( I used Bob's Red Mill Sea Salt. I have used Kosher salt before and although the Kosher was a tad larger grain - I believe it would still have been too salty). \nNext time I make this I will reduce the salt (to amount mentioned above) but, I will keep everything else as the recipe lists. Also, this recipe would be delicious with a roast chicken in place of turkey."

For an 11 lbs unstuffed turkey, it took 4 hours, and it was still iffy by the bone. \nI will start my next one at 400 F, breast down for 1 hour. Then flip it breast side up, reduce temp to 325 F for 2 more hours. \nThis is my tried and true method, and the meat literally falls off the bone. \nLooking forward to combining these recipes. Yum!"

The potatoes actually cooked with the juices from the turkey. The salt, blk pepper &amp; cayenne mixture plus the sage and rosemary really added great flavor to the turkey. In the final half 45 minutes I basted the turkey with the juices causing the skin to have a beautiful crunch. Great and easy recipe."

After the brine sat for 12 hrs I discarded the liquid &amp; let the turkey 'dry out' over night in the fridge... this helps it brown better. It was picture perfect!
