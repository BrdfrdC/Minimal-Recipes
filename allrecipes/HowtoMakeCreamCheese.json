It worked but it had the sourness of Labneh.\n\nIt tastes good and fresh but it's not really cream cheese like other reviewers pointed out."

It was actually just one of the ways she got rid of extra yogurt as we made our own weekly She would give me a small óleo plastic of it but it was mixed with a variety of herbs (like mint, tarragon and basil) and dried flower petals (rose was especially good) We also made our own cracker bread and I recommend one With poppyseeds and or sesame is especially good with this!"

Tie tightly, and don't be afraid to give the dripping\nbundle an extra squeeze when you walk by the fridge. I serve\nmine drizzled with just softened minced garlic in hot butter, &amp;\nsprinkle with oregano and crushed black pepper"
