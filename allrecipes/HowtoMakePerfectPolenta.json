And then that's when the Polenta (in \"mush\" form) lightbulb went off in my head. Enter AllRecipes.com and Chef John. Now I've been making Polenta for YEARS, but (silly, stupid me I guess)I had NEVER served it as an accompaniment to any kind of Seafood. I included all (except for the Parmegianno-Romano) of the recommended ingredients, but 'eye-balled\" the amounts according to what I know to be my own and my family's preferences. Instead of the Parmegianno-Romano, I used a hefty amount of Kraft's shredded \"Italian Cheese Blend\" (we like things \"gooey\", but we like things that are \"budget-friendly\" even more). I served it UNDER (rather than as a \"side to\") this site's \"My Special Shrimp Scampi Florentine\". We are 4; I adjusted for 6 (for both recipes). Not even any of the Spinach was left once Dinner was done. This is an \"even better than GREAT\" Polenta recipe. I can't wait to make it again (and again and again and ...) to serve (rather than, for instance, pasta or rice) UNDER so many of my \"standards\"."

"reviewBody": "The Ingredients were very misleading for me. The first time I made it, it said polenta instead of cornmeal, so I made polenta with another recipe and then used that. I had no idea that the polenta ingredient was actually cornmeal so I added part of the already made polenta to the saucepan and started whisking. It wasn't until a few minutes later that I realized it meant cornmeal, not an already made polenta dish. it was too late for it and our main course was partially ruined. The remaining polenta was really good though, so I'm giving it a 4/5, although I would have given it a 3.5/5 if I could have. I think the creator of the recipe should change the ingredients to say cornmeal, not polenta."

When I serve it with broccoli florets on top, I also add 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese, 1/4 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese and a teaspoon each of onion and garlic powder to give it a little more flavor as a compliment to the broccoli."

Perfectly creamy texture and I didn’t feel too bad since I only added 2 tbs of butter to the whole thing. Highly recommended recipe!!"

But this polenta just brought my childhood back to me and I wanted meat with gravy to top this off. I settled for a chickpea ragout, but the polenta was the star of this dish."

Used regular grind cornmeal I had on hand (not a box or mix like Jiffy) and had to add a bit more broth (bone broth made from Thanksgiving turkey). The finer grind cooked up quicker and required more whisking and stirring. I halved the recipe (only 2 people), and served it with fried sausage and peppers. And we licked the platter clean! Next time I will make full amount. Thank you chef John"
