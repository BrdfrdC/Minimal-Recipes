"reviewBody": "I love this kind of salsa and it’s the only kind I’ve ever made. We change up the peppers we use sometimes. Ancho or poblano are good. Our garden was planted to be a salsa/guacamole/margarita garden. What really bumped it up was using a traditional molcajete to mash the garlic, onion and cilantro in lime juice. Our latest fun twist is Datil peppers only found in Saint Augustine, FL. Wonderful flavor with a slow heat that scares you the first time cuz you don’t know where it stopping. It’s not that bad though. I’d say it’s less heat than a jalapeño. An easy cheat to preserve it a little longer- a squirt of catsup-the no sugar kind."

I feel thankful that they took time out of their busy lives to share it with us. It’s a good recipe. If it helps you to see what your missing to make the dish complete or so your able to make your own come out better. Most are making a dish for the first time so try to be appreciative to the recipient of the recipe. Give the recipe a rating. If you feel a comment is necessary try to be nice &amp; helpful....not rude, big headed or a know it all. If your incapable......move on. It’s rude to start off telling them they have left out several ingredients or as most put, the “key” ingredient. Obviously it is to their satisfaction, and others likings or they would not have posted it. Each to their own I say and of course most of all........BRAVO!!!! Im a wife of 17yrs &amp; mother of 2 healthy eating boys. I’m told by so many that I’m an amazing cook but I’ve never been brave enough to post one of my recipes, out of fear of being ridiculed so I’m happy to have another’s to try. I feel lucky enough to have access to all the wonderful technology this day in time to find recipes and help with my own recipes but I will never act as if I know what another’s recipe needs to be perfect.

"reviewBody": "Like most reviewers lime and minced garlic are a must have. I've made pico a dozen different ways and enjoy it with a couple tabs of sugar to sweeten it and reduce the acidity a bit. Other options include red wine vinegar or some old world jalepano infused vinegar. Have fun with pico! Fresh Roma's, best to de- seed (pam says always take the snot out!!!) of your maters, any onion, cilantro and a good pepper are the bedrock of a good dip or seafood, chicken,pork garnish. Gotta love Mexican food."

"reviewBody": "I make Pico all the time and this recipe is definitely off. It's a good starting point but the amount of tomato to onion is really wrong - I use 3 or 4 tomatoes to 1 onion. I add a lot more cilantro because we really like it and 2 sprigs is almost none - why bother? Fresh garlic is a must - just put it through a garlic press and it adds so much more flavor. With herbs and spices, fresh is always better. Last of all, lime juice is required. I'd use at least 1 whole lemon, juiced - about 2 T. or even 3. Sorry but if I have to correct the recipe it's never a 5 star. I rate the recipe as stated, not as I make it."

I had used 3 small/medium red vine tomatoes, 1 whole jalapeno, 1 whole yellow onion, like 3 times the cilantro, a couple shakes of salt and pepper and little less garlic powder, one green onion and about 1 lime juice. I really used this as a guide line more than anything. But for first timers this recipe is fine. Just dont put too much salt it will draw the water out of the tomatoes and make the pico de gallo watery."

"reviewBody": "Excellent base recipe!! I made it for a friend and we both thought it was better than the fresh at the farm market in her neighborhood. My five-star rating is based upon the recipe itself; however, I did make some very basic alterations. I used roma tomatoes and used three for the one tomato as listed in the recipe. I did not use green onion as I missed that in the list so I didn't have any, but I doubled the recipe (using six roma tomatoes) and used one full, medium-sized onion. I chopped the tomatoes, onion and pepper very fine. I also substituted one large clove of garlic (minced very fine) for the garlic powder. I don't feel as though my alterations were much of a departure from the original recipe, and it was delicious! Exactly what I was looking for! When I served it, I squeezed a half a lime over the bowl and stirred it together. YUM!!! Oh, I did use A LOT more cilantro - love cilantro!"
