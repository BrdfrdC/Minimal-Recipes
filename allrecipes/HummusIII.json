"reviewBody": "This tastes so good. I lived in the Holy Land for two years and I had hummus several times a week, every week. This recipe is as good as any hummus I've had anywhere. I cooked 1 lb of dried chickpeas the day before, after soaking them the night before that. (Any kind of cooked dry beans are always better the day after you cook them.) I used 2 cups of the cooked chickpeas and thinned them with some of the delicious broth. I added ¼ tsp of ground red pepper and a few shakes of black pepper. The chickpeas I cooked already had a lot of garlic and lemon, so I didn't add any additional garlic and I used about half the lemon juice called for in this recipe. I used ⅓ cup of tahini, and salted to taste. Great recipe. Now I'm off to make some Arabic salad and baba ghanoush to go with the hummus."

It's good with the reconstituted too but the fresh will about knock your socks off it's so good! This recipe is quick &amp; easy &amp; simply put, the best."

This has a deeper flavor than the store bought as well, and you can make it creamier by adding in more tahini and blending longer. I would suggest keeping some of the chickpea juice to use as needed to suit your liking as far as thickness of the hummus goes."

It wasn’t quite as soaked as I needed so I made it 48 hours later. It absorbed water to make 4 cups, so double the recipe. If using canned it might whip up faster. \n\nI bet if you had really expensive great olive oil it would be fragrant! I had cheap olive oil, which made an average hummus, nothing different than store-bought except I saved money and there are no chemical preserves in it. Just salt. That makes it 5 stars. \n\nI used a Nutrabullet to make this. \n\nI bet this will be good on gyros, but it’s good like this on pita and salsa. Enjoy!"

Better yet, buy dry chick peas, cook them the day before and let them cool over night. Save the water to add to the hummus if it is too dry. Good additions are black olives or roasted sweet pepper."

I like to spice it up with extra garlic (double or triple the recommendation). Tahineh can be tricky and can go rancid if not properly stored and used. Some people also forget to mix it VERY well before using. If you have thick paste at the bottom keep stirring. I also fold in the tahineh at the end and give it as few spins in the food processor as possible. I heard it can cause mixture to \"glutenize\" if blended too long."

"reviewBody": "I followed other reviewers and added only 1 TBLS of toasted sesame seed oil as I didn’t have any tahini, I thought it worked well. I didn’t have any Meyer lemon so I added regular fresh lemon and thought the final result was a bit too lemony. Next time I’ll reduce the lemon juice to one cup. Also, I added 3 TBLS of extra virgin olive oil to help thin it out and while I thought that was the perfect amount my Greek husband thought I could add more. Overall, good solid recipe to start with!"

I thinned it with half lemon juice and half water. We'll see how it mellows in a few hours! I may start making this one a lot! Loved the comment about freezing it in a cupcake pan, and the one about adding roasted red pepper. I forsee taste tests!"

Puree the whole lot in food processor, place in food storage container and store in the fridge overnight to let everything blend together. Serve as usual. Hope you enjoy."

"reviewBody": "OK, kids. Tahini is just ground sesame seeds. You can make it in a coffee grinder or mortar &amp; pestle. This is a good recipe because it lists all the essential ingredients for hummus, not necessarily because its ratios are perfect for everyone. My absolute favorite kind of hummus is one I invented and therefore can’t be found in stores: sweet &amp; spicy chili basil! Add a couple tablespoons of garlic chili sauce (Asian market) and a handful or 2 of basil leaves (Thai is better but Italian works in a pinch, but they MUST be fresh). Since there’s garlic in the chili sauce, I don’t add raw garlic to this kind of hummus. Instead, I use either roasted fresh garlic or a tablespoon of Better than Bullion Roasted Garlic Base. And I like half lemon half lime juice and a few drops of lemon extract, but that’s personal preference. Also, if your lemons aren’t ripe... don’t blame the recipe."

"reviewBody": "A couple issues for me: I made this first with canned beans and today with dry beans that I de-skinned; the latter is by far a better, smoother texture with a fresher taste, so if you have time, try it if you eat a lot of hummus. The recipe seemed a bit bland as written the first time I followed it, so the second time, I added 1 T EVOO and 1 T smoked paprika while blending, then topped with pine nuts and another sprinkle of the paprika. The additions livened the flavor, so that's preference."

Rinse and drain the beans. \n\nPay attention to the ingredients list. I almost put in 2 CANS of beans. It calls for 2 cups. Measure them, one can equaled 1 1/2 cups, but another brand had a lot less beans in the can.\n \nPut all the ingredients except the beans in first, blend them, then add the warm beans after you have rinsed off the baking soda water and drained them."
