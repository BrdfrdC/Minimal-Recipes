"reviewBody": "The only reason I made this recipe was because I was looking for an easy appetizer that didn't contain cheese. Truth be told, neither my husband nor I like Bruschetta very much. But WOW! This was fantastic!! I think part of the reason it was so good is because the bread is sliced on the thick side and isn't toasted until it's as hard as a rock. The tomato topping was very easy to make and can be prepared in advance. I served it to company and got many compliments. This will be one of my mainstays in the future!"

The tomatoes tasted very fresh giving the bruschetta a nice tomato taste. I did feel the bruschetta was lacking something and could benefit from drizzling a balsamic glaze over top or parmigiana cheese. Great recipe to have for surprise guest or a quick appetizer."

The tomatoes were firm, ripe, and tasted great. Adding garlic and fresh basil made the dish exceptional. When I make it again I will refrigerate the tomatoes first. I love the contrast of hot bread and cold bruschetta."

"reviewBody": "12.3.16 Honestly, I had my doubts about using canned tomatoes for bruschetta, but I was pleasantly surprised because these were good! The fresh basil and healthy dose of garlic really ramp up the flavor. This bruschetta was much better made with the canned tomatoes rather than the fresh (but mostly tasteless) tomatoes you buy this time of year. Simply tastes like good, old classic bruschetta."
