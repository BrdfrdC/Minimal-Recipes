Next time I'll add a little bit of flour to stiffen up the dough, make it easier to mold into balls, and hopefully make them more uniform in shape. I'll make this again."

Also, they were really bland so we will add sugar to the batter next time if we make them again. Adding butter and sugar on top really helped and made them savory and sweet. Good luck making these! They turned out pretty good with a few adjustments. (we left out the celery)"
