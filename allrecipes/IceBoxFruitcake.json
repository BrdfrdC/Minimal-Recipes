She also used graham crackers candied fruit in the little clear plastic cartons with the green cherries and pinapple in it and added a little cinnamon and allspice because you could taste it. She would line loaf pans with wax paper and not use a bundt pan. It wasn't Christmas without one. I think this is a southern dish too... my inlaws and outlaws from up north never have seen or heard of it.\nWhen she died... her brother inlaw was upset because she didn't give out the recipe to any of us. I think that's why he cried the most.\nI will have to make one for uncle Buddy."

I just finished a double-batch today, and have placed in in the \"ice box\" using the wax paper and graham cracker boxes. I'll bring it out on Christmas Day! On a side note, I didn't use the whole box of crackers for the recipe, but a bit more than 2/3 of it. I'm thinking this will add a bit more moistness. This second batch I also added a dash of cherry juice from the jar! My Dad said it was just like Mama's - a definite compliment!"

"reviewBody": "I really want to like this recipe as-is for all the great ingredients &amp; unique preparation (relative to my usual Christmas cookie baking), but it fell flat for me &amp; my family at Christmas. Waiting all that time for the cake to \"age\" and unwrapping all the layers of foil &amp; saran wrap was anticlimatic to see that beige blob in the dish. Family members had to be cajoled to give it try and the reviews were mixed from a \"mmm - better than I thought it would be\" to \"blah.\" Being a sweet-tooth, I thought the cake tasted pretty good, and would describe the taste &amp; texture as glorified cookie dough. If I were to use this recipe again, I would take it one more step by cutting the cake into bite-sized pieces and dipping them into chocolate in order to hide the beige coloring. I probably wouldn't keep the word \"fruitcake\" in the recipe title either... when I said the name of this recipe people wrinkled their noses before the first layer of foil was pulled."

One, we use a LOT of nuts (pecans are our preference) and not much fruit. We use the candied fruit. Also, we use graham crackers, but I may try the sugar free vanilla wafers. We have also used Marshmallow cream instead of sweetened condensed milk. Both work equally well. We always make them the week after Thanksgiving and keep in the fridge until Christmas time. It seems to be better when it has time for the flavors to mix. We usually wrap one large cake for Christmas and then the rest we wrap in individual rolls.about the size of a pound of sausage. This keeps a long time in the fridge. We always make at least double this recipe. This is the only fruitcake I will eat and I have converted many people that \"hated\" fruitcake to asking for this every year!"

I placed the cherries on top for decoration. Now to wait a whole week. If the cake taste like the dough, it will be great. Can't wait!!"

The only difference (other than omitting the raisins) was that she rolled it into a log in foil and sliced it into small circles. Thanks so much for the memories."

Her version of this cake converted many die-hard fruitcake haters. She accidentally bought the spiced gum drops one year and that was a little weird tasting. HaHa!"
