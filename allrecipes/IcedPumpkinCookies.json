I made mixed cookie platters for about 20 families and I received a couple compliments on this particular cookie but no one guessed they were pumpkin. Everyone thought they were a gingerbread cake cookie. The cookie doesn't taste great without icing. The icing doesn't taste great on it's own. Together they worked well. This is a decent cookie but nothing amazing. If I were to take one kind of cookie to a party, this isn't going to be it. However, they are a really nice addition to a holiday cookie platter. Next time, I'm going to try making the icing with Nestle pumpkin spice morsels."

If I don't have all of the spices, I'll sub for 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I also add a dash of cinnamon to the icing. Highly recommend this recipe!"

The pumpkin cookies were always my husband’s favorite so I’ve been looking for a substitute. I was worried because the dough was super sticky so just let it drop off the spoon, all ugly. But they smooth out, for the most part in the oven. The glaze was easy to whip up and the finished product was excellent."

"reviewBody": "I made these last night when friends came over, they were a hit. Followed the recipe exactly for the cookies but had some cream cheese frosting on hand, in the pantry, so I melted some and drizzled that on top instead. We're in the mountains of Colorado and I baked them in my Ninja air fryer, that also bakes, for about 17-18 minutes (don't know if that makes a difference, but just putting that out there). They came out light and fluffy, they reminded us of cake, gonna have to try them with raisins or nuts next time . My friends and I enjoyed them even without the frosting, so good! Thanks for the recipe!!??"

When on the cookie sheet I pressed a few more broken nut pieces onto the top.\nFor the icing I made it with maple syrup and vanilla and drizzled it, then dusted them with cinnamon.\nThey are beautiful, and everyone requests them at gatherings."

For some of the batter I added white chocolate chips which gave additional sweetness and texture. Delicious with or without. \nAs for the glaze, WOW! The flavor as well as the fact it hardens just enough to not be messy on our fingers was perfection. Thank you for sharing. (I'm getting ready to make another batch right now)"
