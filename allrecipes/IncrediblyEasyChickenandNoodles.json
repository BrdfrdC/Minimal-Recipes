I also added 1/4 tsp each of crushed peppercorn and black pepper. So far I’ve used 48 oz of chicken broth and looks like I’ll need more. Probably should have only used 1 bag of frozen noodles. 😂. I cheated with the chicken also and used the Tyson frozen precooked cubed chicken. I’m thinking about letting it cook for about 15 minutes and then dumping it into my crock pot to finish up slowly. I tasted the broth. The flavor and texture is awesome. I used about 64 oz of chicken broth, next time 1 bag of noodles!"

"reviewBody": "I’ve made this for 20 years and it’s a lovely and fun family base to play with. (Picky eaters? I sneak in cream of mushroom soup as I purée the mushroom bits to nothingness. They never see the can labels You can play with consistency with lessening amount of broth (and always go low sodium condensed soups or they can taste too strong). Sometimes I add cheese to it so while not make and cheese has a yummy dimension you want seconds with good wide egg or shell pasta to hold nestle that chicken and wide egg noodle or shell pasta or spirals in. You need hearty noodles. A couple dashes of Worschershire to the soup mix also gives it a nice zing when not using. Soup mix as is great comfort food. Sometimes I pour it in casserole, too it with cheddar, buttered bread crumbs and bake til top is bubbly and browned. So versatile"

Let that come to a boil. Then I added wide egg noodles instead of the frozen, reduced the heat and let them soften and soak up the broth. While that was working I browned the chicken breasts in olive oil, seasoning them with a little salt, pepper and garlic powder. Once the noodles had soaked up most of the broth I added the creamed soups. And finally added the browned chicken breasts cut up bite sized. Stirred it all up and let it simmer for another 10 minutes."

I used 1 small can of creme of chicken soup, 2 cans of chicken broth, one round can of chicken breast and only half the amount noodles but not frozen. I warmed some peas in the microwave and mixed them in. It still makes quite a bit but it keeps well in the fridge."

"reviewBody": "Great base for old school, southern style comfort food. I did realize I only had low sodium soups and broth so I substituted garlic salt for garlic powder and added celery salt, per another reviewer's suggestion. I also boiled, then shredded the chicken, threw in minced onions, finely chopped baby spinach, defrosted frozen peas and corn, and about 10 sliced white mushrooms. At the last minute, and at the suggestion of another review, I added about 2 TB of butter a few minutes before serving, which made a huge difference in richness for the little that was incorporated into the gravy. I served it with Grands southern-style biscuits. My husband said it tasted like pot pie and I thought it was similar to my Granny's chicken and dumplings. So awesome! Next time I will add fresh carrots for nutrients, color, and a little extra sweetness."

"reviewBody": "The key to mouthwatering chicken and noodles is to cook chicken thighs overnight in a crock pot to extract the best flavors from the fat and bones into the broth. I make homemade egg noodles with mine. Takes a little longer but this dish is a favorite everytime I serve it. This is comfort food at it's finest. Not meant to be bold flavored. It makes my mouth happy."

I also used fresh onions and garlic. You can literally use any veggie left in your fridge. Tweak as needed and add the salt last. I served it with a salad and multigrain bread. If you want a thinner sauce or more of it at the end add in more ckn broth, sour cream or even milk."

"reviewBody": "I made it with 2 cans of cream of chicken instead of 1 chicken and 1 mushroom (just not a mushroom fan) and doubled the spices. It may have been because of the soup change, but when I tasted it halfway through it reaaaally needed more seasoning. But with those simple changes it was perfect for us! Bonus points for how well it heats up; my husband never does leftovers, but with these he actually ate leftovers TWICE. Really simple but really delicious."

"reviewBody": "My family requests this dish regularly and there’s always enough to freeze a few servings for later. It is delicious as is, but here are the changes I’ve made to suit us: I use homemade chicken bone broth for increased nutrition and because it’s so inexpensive and simple to make and freeze. I substitute 3 regular size cans of cream of chicken soup for the large one and I buy the frozen noodles that are already cooked to make this easy recipe come together even faster. I add 2 bags of frozen peas &amp; carrots for added color and nutrition as well, steamed in the microwave. Today I tried making in the crockpot and it turned out beautifully. I actually put the chicken and broth in frozen on high. When the meat was 165 degrees (a couple hours) I shredded it and whisked in the cream soups and seasonings, and let it heat up for another hour or so. Then added the veggies &amp; frozen noodles. Another hour and it was done and ready to eat. Next time I’m going to try adding a few Tbsp of butter just because it sounds good. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!"

LOL I cooked regular egg noodles on the side for 7 minutes then added noodles to stock. Let it boil back up for 5 minutes. Mine was thick but not too thick and not too soupy.
