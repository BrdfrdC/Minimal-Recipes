The only adjustments I made were to heat the tawa on medium high, as medium wasn't hot enough on my stove, and I found it still took around 40 seconds per side to get the charred blisters shown in the illustration. To keep them soft, I piled them on top of each other and placed a clean dish towel over the lot. Yum!"

"reviewBody": "I typically use a different chapati recipe but now this one is my favorite. The chapatis were soft and flexible and delicious. I used the ingredients in the amounts listed and then found I needed to continue to add extra flour to get to where the dough was not very sticky (just a little sticky). Before rolling I dusted the counter and both sides of the dough balls generously with flour. I rolled them out as thin as I could get them. I cooked them on a flat cast iron pan that I had oiled with canola oil, and had to apply more oil before each chapati. It will smoke the entire time; just keep your oven fan on. Sometimes less than 30 sec is needed, so watch your chapati especially on side 2."

Two pinches salt and a few drops of neutral oil such as vegetable oil is correct. Just enough to lubricate the hands. Hot water isn’t necessary. Best to use atta flour which is widely available not our whole wheat which is totally different. Bad recipe."

"reviewBody": "With very little practice, these turn out perfectly! I cook them on a cast iron skillet on a gas flame, and they're awesome. I found that it's easy to use too much oil in the pan, though, so when it says \"grease lightly\", it means VERY lightly, otherwise they come out too oily. But these are so quick and easy... I don't usually keep bread in the house because I don't eat it quickly enough of it before it goes bad, so this is the best way to have bread on hand when you need it. If you have 10-15 minutes to spare while dinner is cooking, you can have fresh chapati. Thanks for the great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Great base recipe. For softer chapati, I used hot almond milk instead of water (though any dairy or nut milk would work, too) and added a scant teaspoon of honey. Used equal amounts of olive and coconut oil for the fat. Time constraints dictate whether or not I let the dough rest overnight in the fridge before bringing it to room temp and rolling it out thinly between two sheets cut from the emptied bags of commercial breakfast cereal. Then I accordion-fold (pleat) the dough, coil it into a tight circle and roll it out again thinly before cooking it on a lightly oiled medium-hot heavy skillet. (This puts layers in the dough and helps it puff when cooking.) Covering the skillet while cooking keeps the steam in and helps them puff and cook more evenly. Once done I stack them on top of one another under a paper towel and a dome lid I have to keep the steam in while they cool. When kept in a plastic bag in the fridge for a few days (if they last that long), they're easy to re-heat on a warm skillet or the low setting of a microwave. There's no limit to seasoning additions for customizing the taste outcome, too."

"reviewBody": "A basic chapati -that I've used many times - works best with a type of flour called \"Atta\" which is a hard durum wheat flour available in international markets. Consider letting more than a few minutes - like an hour or more , I prefer to cover with plastic wrap and rest several hours in the fridge if not overnight then bring to room temp before forming and rolling - this allows for the glutens to develope you'll find the dough less sticky and more elastic. Cooking - I prefer to use a cast iron fryingpan or griddle because it retains a more even cooking temperature especially when using an electric stove. What makes a a chapati light and fluffy is the steam that is generated inside the chapati when cooking. after the bottom is lightly brown flip to brown the other side - you will note bubbles starting to form in the cooking chapati - on way to get these bubbles to form and expand between the outside layers is - after the bread is turned - press down on the browned topside with a dampened kitchen towel - you can even feel the bread rise up under the towel continue this all over until the bread is finally done will feel - I prefer to lightly brush one side with melted butter, stack and keep wrapped in a towel until the batch is done."

I live in an apartment with no oven, so I am always trying to find breads and baking that I can do in a fry pan. I am amazingly inventive! I wanted a no-yeast flatbread that I could cook without an oven, wasn't sweet and would do for sandwiches and everything else. I found this Indian Chapati Bread and followed the recipe exactly but made a 1/2 recipe. I also let it rest for 30 min. as suggested by others, I was able to roll them very thin but they puffed up nicely, and were delicious. Thanks so much for the recipe."

You can usually find this flour in the international section at the supermarket. Make sure you knead really well till the dough is soft. Also to make it more authentic, after making the chapati I lightly sprayed them with canola oil (you can use melted butter or ghee) and rubbed them together."

Also, traditional recipe can be done with only 1 type of flour, preferably wheat. \r\nThe only issue I had with this recipe is that I needed more water than called for as all of flour wouldn't soak up with listed amount. \r\nThen I refrigerated the dough for a 1.5 days. The end results were good though. They were buttered after they were cooked for more flavor."

I think I'm gonna add sugar to the dough, then powder sugar and cinnamon the finished bread next time for a dessert! Try this recipe!(It may not seem so, but it was very good with soup! Try it! ) Thanks for posting!"

"reviewBody": "I lived in Kenya for awhile and Chapati's were a main staple. I thought this recipe was great and very authentic with a few changes: -I just used all white flour because I didn't have wheat flour - I didn't let mine stand for very long - just let it relax for a few minutes while I stirred my curry, but definitely not 30 minutes like some reviews recommend - The big difference was rolling it out - traditional chapatis are chewy and oily. So divide your dough, and then each smaller ball of dough you want to roll out into a long tube. I put olive oil on my hands while rolling it into the tube to coat it on all sides. Then you coil that tube into a circle and roll that out with your rolling pin. You will have a very pliable dough when you're done and they will be softer and more chewy when cooked. And the hot pan is very important! It should be hotter than you think - my kitchen is usually a little smoky when I'm done cooking these. Good luck!"

I find that whilst the chapati needs to be slightly thicker, this same recipe is good for tortilla type wraps too which you can roll paper thin for the better wrap. This is my favourite version of bread as it is very cheap, quick and easy to make, from cupboard to plate in around 10 minutes. For a taste change, try adding a flavoured olive oil such as garlic or basil."
