Also I used only 2 tablespoons of regular curry powder and 1/2 tablespoons of hot curry powder and so I omitted the cayenne. I was afraid the spices would be too much. You can always add if needed but didn’t need more. Also I added the whole can of coconut milk. You can remove the chicken and continue to simmer the sauce to make it thicker which I liked. Maybe other recipes are better but I’ll come back to this one. Btw, I could taste the lemon and I didn’t think it was too much. Again you could use less at first and taste your sauce."

"reviewBody": "The flavor was great, but this recipe needs some modification. For starters, if you add the spices to a dry pan as written, they'll burn and you'll get a smokey mess. Instead, add them with the yogurt and coconut milk. Also, there is too much liquid released from the chicken. I simmered for an extra 15 minutes, but it was still way too liquidy- and this was before the lemon juice was added. I had to make a cornstarch slurry to thicken it up. The flavor was great though- serve over rice."

I used a lime instead of a lemon (because limes are usually bitter, I thought it would be a great substitute for this dish, and it didn’t disappoint)! I didn’t have tomato paste so I used pizza sauce instead (I know, I know, it sounds weird but it’s a REALLY great red sauce with a lot of flavor). I didn’t have coconut milk (surprisingly, I always keep it on hand), so I substituted it for cream cheese and milk (made it really creamy and I was SOOO impressed). I used a little more sugar than the recipe called for, used white and brown sugar. If you’re are a curry lover…you HAVE to try this!! 😁❤️‍🔥"

Personally, i would suggest doubling or even tripling the recipe, as i had doubled the recipe so i would have leftovers the next day, but it had already all been eaten. This was super easy to make, and had just the right amount of spice where my mouth didn't feel like it was on fire, but i still got the taste of the spices and it didn't feel bland. I got a lot of mixed signals about the taste and authenticity but this curry proved to be delicious. ♥︎"

To allow them to cook a little more and not be so grainy (raw) feeling on the palate, I added a half cup of water before the coconut milk/yogurt, covered, and allowed everything to meld together. I also simmered mine altogether for another 25-30 min (for a total cook time of 1hr20min). It turned out sooo good!!"

So I didn't add the lemon. Also left out the cayenne because I'm not a fan of very spicy food. It had enough of a kick from the curry. I also let it stew for quite a while, so the meat was very tender. I'll probably try it again with chapatis because I think they would taste great together."

"reviewBody": "I followed what \"The Gangrel\" wrote and used whole spices at the start - cinnamon stick, bay leaves, and cloves; I fried them in a bit of oil, but I don't often cook with whole spices so wasn't sure whether to take them out or leave them in.. I took them out and then added the garlic, ginger, and onion into the oil that has been infused with the whole spices. Then I added my ground spices as per the recipe. I then pushed all of that aside and added the chicken in the same pan to brown. I actually added about 1/2 cup of canned chopped tomatoes and much less coconut milk than suggested. Very tasty!"

After reading several reviews and seeing what I had on-hand for ingredients I made several adjustments... and the recipe gets credit for being so easy to change to your personal taste. Left out the cayenne pepper (spicy enough for us without it); also left out the lemon and tomato paste and used a full can of coconut milk in place of the plain yogurt because I didn't have any. Toasted the seasonings in a dry pan first before adding the onion and garlic. Added sliced carrots and peas. Let it simmer for 45+ minutes while I made naan bread (recipe also from this site) and rice."

My only changes were based on several reviews: I toasted the spices before adding the oil, onion, &amp; garlic (I did not use whole spices, just ground as in recipe) &amp; added diced boiled potatoes &amp; frozen peas. I used boneless chicken thighs because that's what I had and they worked great. Next time, I'll double the amount of meat. I ended up with lots of sauce, which I froze for future veggie meal.

"reviewBody": "Found this recipe after my wife dared me to use some random ingredients in our pantry to cook with (coconut cream, crushed tomatoes). Turned out great. I used the amount of curry called for and thought it was enough for me (and I'm not a stranger to Indian food). I did add a heaping teaspoon of garam masala and about 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger (didn't have fresh) and omitted the cinnamon since that's in the garam masala already. I also followed the common recommendation to toast the dry ingredients before adding the onion and chicken (I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, salt, and some garam masala). I substituted the coconut milk for coconut cream and used the whole can. I also substituted crushed tomatoes (maybe 1/4 cup worth?) for the tomato paste and then cooked everything down for about 30 min. I omitted the lemon juice and yogurt (felt like the thicker coconut accomplished the same task). I would definitely make this again as described."

I followed the recipe outline.... but I followed one of the comments here for the actions, and THIS WAS THE BEST CURRY I HAVE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE OF PUTTING IN MY MOUTH! I used all the spices from the actual recipe. I cooked all the spices in the oil first really hot. I used 2 (fresh) bay leaves from my garden. In my own preference I used more grated ginger, browned the onions a little more, used sheep yogurt, a whole lemon, added cumin and a little bit of turmeric, added some water after everything to make it less thick. I used cayanne and added a little bit of red pepper flakes and it was just on the cusp of too Spicey for me. It was perfect. I was pleasantly sweating. It was even better the next day at breakfast when I fried a couple of eggs and kale and poured the left over curry on top of it. SO MUCH YUMMMM. DEFINITELY MAKING AGAIN next time with some cloves and maybe some nutmeg and cardamom."

I found this recipe and it sounded similar to the ingredients she used. I followed the recipe but also used a reviewer's comments and increased the curry to 8 tablespoons and used Indian red chili powder (found it on Amazon). It is a very hot dish, but it tasted EXACTLY like hers! I am so thankful that I found this!"

"reviewBody": "Very good recipe. Easy to make and the family loves it. I use chicken thighs and add more curry powder. One trick I do is I make it the night before and refrigerate it so it all mells together. Most of the time not all of it makes it to the next night. I then reheat it and serve with jasmine rice. Regarding heat, more cayenne is good, but my wife doesn’t like as much heat as my sons and so we add hot sauce like a good scorpion sauce or habanero. I’ve turned other people onto this recipe specifically in my cooking club and all have thoroughly enjoyed it. I think next time I make it, tonight, I’ll try frying the spices like the one reviewer said."
