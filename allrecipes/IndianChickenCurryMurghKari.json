I also use about half the cayenne pepper called for because I cook for little ones. Tonight I didn't have tumeric and subbed that with smoked paprika and it still came out super delicious!!"

"reviewBody": "Definitely don't use a half cup of oil. Had a rough start because I used a quarter cup of olive oil on high heat and it was... not fun. The oil was smoking because it was olive oil of course, and it was splattering everywhere... I stopped everything, removed the chicken, dumped the oil, and replaced it with canola oil. Canola oil has a higher smoke point, so this was fine. The chicken refused to brown until I removed almost all but a tablespoon. I felt a little foolish, it's obvious that the video shows them using a tablespoon of oil even while clearly stating a half cup. Shame on staff for changing the recipe for the video but keeping the same written directions. -1 star. The other issue was that my sauce broke for some reason. I've got little grains of yogurt floating around in the sauce and it looks awful. I only added a quarter cup of water instead of a half cup after the yogurt and the tomatoes, so maybe that was the problem? I think next time I might pre-mix the yogurt and the water and add it right at the end. I also added two fresh serrano peppers instead of using cayenne and it's got a nice medium heat."

Pineapple chunks and/or potato is another option for this. ;-)"

One thing I would suggest when making is to get some of the sauce into a bowl and add the yoghurt in first so it doesn't split. \n\nMy other suggestion would be to make double the amount, this would go great day 2 or 3 when the flavours have had some time to mature. Will cook again."

We will most certainly make this again but next time will use less oil for browning. There was a lot left after browning the chicken but we went ahead and left it in there with the onion. This was incredibly flavorful and we are planning to eat it for breakfast. Can't wait. HIGHLY recommend this."
