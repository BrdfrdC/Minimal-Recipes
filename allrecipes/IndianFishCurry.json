I used cod because it was on sale and looked good and canned petite diced tomatoes. I made the sauce the night before, which made it pretty quick and easy to get the dish in the oven when I got home from work. My fish took a little longer to cook, probably because the fillets were pretty thick. I took it out when the fish got to 130 degrees, and it was perfectly done. I can't wait to make this again!"

If I use canned tomato’s and frozen fish fillets, I usually have the ingredients on hand. I’ve used all kinds of fish (including salmon) and all worked great."

"reviewBody": "Wow! Possibly the best recipe on Allrecipes. Amazing - I use all of these ingredients all the time, but never tasted anything like this out of my kitchen. Wonderful flavor. I used olive oil because I don't like canola oil and 1 t cayenne, and one large filet of wild salmon, skin on bottom. Marinated in the baking dish I used and did not discard the marinate, just dumped the curry sauce on top of the fish before baking. Dressed it with thin slices of mango around the edges. What a delight."

I was a little concerned that the garlic might be overpowering, and a little surprised to be adding sugar, but the flavors all blended perfectly. Very flavorful. This recipe will definitely be added to our rotation of fish dishes, thanks!!"

I use only 3/4 tsp cayenne (personal preference) increase tomato to 1 cup and add 1/2 can coconut milk for creaminess and just because the sauce is so delicious we like to have extra to spoon over rice. We use about 6 Basa fillets - super tender! Another great thing about this dish (compared to many fish dishes) - it keeps in the oven covered at 200 degrees without drying as we discovered one night when dinner was ready but family was an hour late getting home. This is a restaurant-quality recipe, great with naan and a simple crunchy salad with an oil &amp; vinegar dressing. Thanks for the recipe :)"

"reviewBody": "This dish was terrific! So tasty! We're big curry fans and this was was very authentic. I made it for 2 people and made it a low fat dish by omitting all oil. I used a 1 lb swordfish steak cut into 1 inch chunks. To marinate, I placed the chunks in a small baking dish and covered with 5 forkfuls of minced garlic from a jar and about 5 Tblsp of Dijon mustard. For the curry I used minced ginger from a jar for convenience. 1 tsp of cayenne was plenty spicy for us. In my opinion I could have left the cashew halves out and not known the difference. I cooked the sauce without oil, it wasn't necessary, and used Splenda instead of sugar. Two diced Roma tomatoes worked for me, and I put the sauce right on top of the marinade before baking. I left off the cilantro garnish because I don't care for it. Served it with steamed cauliflower and a sliced banana, and for anyone on Weight Watchers the entire dinner came out to 7 SmartPoints per serving. Husband liked this a lot and so did I; I will definitely make this again!"

And that's after I cut it down to 1/2 t! But the recipe was delicious, especially with some greek yogurt on the side, and we really liked the overall flavor it imparted to the fish. I served with brown basmati and a curry-slathered roasted cauliflower, which was a really nice combo."

I used 1 tsp cayenne and found that it was plenty spicy. I used cod as that was what I had. My cod was previously frozen and was water logged when I thawed it. I blotted it really well with paper towels so that it would not cook up watery. The fish texture was good after cooking. I didn't love the texture of the sauce or the visual appearance of it. Next time I will skip the food processor and finely dice everything.. I will also decrease the amount of salt. With a bit of tweaking, this will be great for our personal preferences. Thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Ugh, mine didn't come out well at all.:P The sweetness of the sugar was overpowering (and I used RAW cane sugar, which isn't as sweet as refined white sugar!), so I would suggest cutting the sugar that the recipes calls for way down. In all fairness, I did replace the dry ingredients with my go-to curry masala, but that should not have affected how sweet this curry was! I did use frozen fish (as the option was noted in this recipe), but it turned out chewy and tough, not like the tender flakes of fresh cod at all. In terms of taste, I would have rated this recipe one star, but given that I didn't follow this recipe completely (I used my own curry masala instead), I compensated with the extra star."

I adjusted the recipe for 3 servings and followed the recipe that way. I followed all directions as stated except I had no fresh tomatoes. For that, I used 1.5 TBS of tomato sauce. I also used about a half palm size of unsalted cashew pieces since I didn't have any whole cashews. ETA: when we go to the Indian restaurants, we usually ask for a level 4/mild. I made this curry using only 1/4 tsp and it was a good amount. He said he'd rate it level 1 spiciness from an Indian restaurant.\n\nI used 3 wild caught flounder filets for this dish. In the future, I will definitely make more of the sauce! It's extremely flavorful. I found myself constantly tasting it."
