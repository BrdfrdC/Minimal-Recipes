Before serving I did add a small can for sliced carrots which I had drain; you know, got to get those veggies in. I was expecting the rice to have a more bold flavor. I will make it again but I think I will up all the spices by 1/8 teaspoon to start."

Mixed that in 2 cups water and made it in my Instant Pot using the Rice setting. It was delicious, everyone loved it and I will make it again, and again. Even hubby came back for seconds, and he doesn't like \"spicy\" stuff. Nice flavor!"

I sautéed the onion in the pressure cooker insert with olive oil, and once translucent added the spices to bloom. I used a few whole cloves instead of ground. Added the 1 cup of rice and sautéed to coat with oil and lightly toast. Added 1.5 cups chicken broth and a pinch of salt. Cooked on Rice setting (low pressure about 12 minutes), and let it natural release for 10 minutes. Released remaining pressure and added 1/2 cup peas. Then fluffed. Full of flavor and the rice was nicely separated."

I will be adding this dish to our family favorites rotation. I didn't have any curry powder so I made my own. It was easy and tasty. I also cooked the onions in the broth with the spices and then added the rice."

So next time will do one of the following tweaks 1. add the onion and spices to the broth so this way they will blend better with the liquid or 2. as the broth is coming to a boil in a small fry pan sauté the onion and spices in a little oil and butter. Once the broth is at the boil add along with the rice. Will be making again."

"reviewBody": "Flavor is delicious, but I did substitute bouillion/water and added salt to the water to be boiled. I paired with Easy Indian Butter Chicken here and rated that recipe too. This recipe made sticky rice, not finely separated Indian rice we're used to in restaurants. Next time I will toast rice in some butter or oil and boil bouillion salt water separately to add to it and see if that solves the sticky rice outcome.\n\nServing size was right on. My four kids under 10 asked for leftovers in their lunches so I had to forgo my own leftover hopes. Next time I will double the rice."
