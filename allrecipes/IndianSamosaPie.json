Couldn't find whole wheat pastry flour so used 1/4 cup of all purpose whole wheat flour and another 1/4 cup of all purpose white flour. Didn't bother to peel the potatoes.\n\nNext time I think I'll add some mashed chickpeas to up the protein."

It was really just okay and sadly had to throw out leftovers as no one would eat it. Crust wasn't enough to make two crusts as the recipe indicated (would have been REALLY thin pastry) so I doubled it."

I mash them leaving enough larger chunks for taste and texture. I reduce the broth amount to keep the mixture from being too wet. I also substitute Garam Masala for the ground cumin. Tasty fresh or from frozen."

I think the filling needs to be chunkier, and fresh ginger is a must rather than ground. Next time we'll double the spices. Overall, tho, it was good---just needs a few little changes. Thanks!"
