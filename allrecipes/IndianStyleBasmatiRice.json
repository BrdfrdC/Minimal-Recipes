I substituted powederd cinnamon as I was out of sticks (1 tsp) and, if anything, I would increase a bit more spices next time (I am not. aspicy person: I am European and we are notorious for blend flavor profiles...). I was surprise about people commenting on too much cumin: is suspect they mistook seed for powder."

"reviewBody": "This authentic Indian style rice is spot on. All the way from the fragrance to the flavor, your taste buds will jump! This is my go to recipe for Indian style rice. Tastes EXACTLY like you'd get at an Indian restaurant. As far as changes, I left out the onion as I believe onion has no place in rice, however I do use thinly sliced onion in my Tikka Masala sauce and thinly sliced red onion in my Byrani. If you leave out the onion, make sure you saute the pods, cloves, cinnamon stick and cumin seeds for a few minutes in the hot oil to open up those flavors and fragrance. Also, don't forget to rinse and soak the rice, it's extremely important. Equally as important as using Basmatti rice. One other change I made is that I used 1 less clove. Not a huge fan of clove unless the flavor is buried amongst other flavors! Enjoy!!"

Allowing the spices to bloom in the saute really releases their flavor. Crushing the green cardamom pods a bit before cooking lets this fabulous flavor be more predominant. I really like the tip to continue to steam the rice for 10 minutes with the lid still on. We love this rice!"

"reviewBody": "I've cooked this probably 10-15 times since finding this recipe. So far, it's my go-to Indian rice recipe. I screwed up rice for a long time before I finally found this recipe.\n\n I add a couple cloves of minced garlic with the cumin seed, the flavor is not remarkably different, but great either way. I use way more oil than is called for. I don't measure it, I pour a couple tablespoons before adding spices, then a little more with the onions if they don't seem to be wet and slippery looking. I probably use closer to 4 Tablespoons total (I am NOT a low-fat chef) I cook everything in a big stainless pot with a super-thick (like 1\") base. The oil keeps anything from sticking to the pot, and keeps the grains separate when done. When toasting the rice before adding the water, I cook and stir until I can hear that the water clinging to the rice has basically cooked off.\n\nAs soon as it reaches a boil, I set the timer for 15 min, turn the heat as far down as it goes, and cover. When the timer goes off, I immediately invert into a big mixing bowl and fluff then let stand. I found that letting it stand in the pot just overcooks the bottom, probably because of my heavy base.\n\nFried in a wok the following day, this rice is even better which is saying a lot. Spectacular. Never found anyone that didn't love it. I am not ethnically Indian however.\n\nI did this with jasmine rice and the flavor is good, but it's super sticky. Basmati is far better."

The recipe also is a good base for southwestern-style cilantro lime rice. Simply omit all the spices, add some finely minced garlic to the onions and keep the status quo from there. When the rice is done, add 1/3-1/2 bunch chopped cilantro and the juice of 1 1/2 limes. Delicious."

But, I think it tastes even better the next day! \nI did add some veggies at the last few minutes: defrosted baby peas and white and gold corn, and bits of broccoli, and cooked some minced fresh carrots in with the rice. Served it with spicy, sauteed shrimp. Yum! Complete meal!"

First, I used Basmati Rice, instead of brown, and used 1/8 teaspoon of regular cumin, rather than the seeds. I also added a bay leaf in with the spices and used 2 cinnamon sticks instead of one. Lastly, after toasting the rice, I poured it into a rice cooker with about 3/4 a cup of water. Cooked for about 16 minutes, fluffed, and let it set for 5 more minutes. Without a doubt, this is best rice I've ever made!"

I used maybe less than a 1/4 t ground spices instead of the whole seeds of cardamom and clove. I don't know what soaking the rice did except definitely made it un-toastable. It instantly sticks to the pan. Very nice way to make rice extra special to serve with lentil soup or something else."

I have made basmati based from the recipe found on the side of the rice package with less than stellar results. This recipe resulted in a side very similar to the rice at the restaurants. I did take the advise of several reviewers and cut down on the cumin to 1/2 teaspoon. I cut the onions razor thin and fried in ghee instead of oil (maybe too powerful of a butter flavor). Next time I will try veg oil to see the difference. Definitely a recipe that is going in my book. Thanks!"

I did make some tweaks to it to get it \"just right\": 1/4 tsp cumin instead of 1 tbsp; more cardamom pods (5) and whole cloves (4); 3 tbsp oil instead of 2; added 1/4 tsp saffron in 2 tbsp hot water -- saffron made a huge difference. Also cooked for 14 mins instead of 15 and let it sit covered for 10 mins after. All that said, this recipe gave me the baseline for an incredible plate of rice! Next time I might add more onion, because the golden onions were fantastic and I would like more of them in this dish. I plan to use this recipe often in the future."

My rice cooker is a 3 cup cooker and I know that 1.5 cups of pre-soaked rice needs enough water to cover the rice by about a 1/4 inch. Came out a little too cinnamon for my taste. Maybe a half stick next time, otherwise very good. Surprisingly better the next day when the spices settled and weren't so sparky."

After I drained the rice I sautÃ©ed it along with the spices until lightly toasted and mixed with spices. I added a tsp saffron and then turned pressure cooker on for 3 minutes. After that I let the steam naturally release for 10 minutes before opening the vent. Fluffed with a fork and served. Perfectly cooked and delicious!"
