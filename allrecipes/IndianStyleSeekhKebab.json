I saw the reviews about the mix being wet so I pulsed the onion in the food processor and then squeezed out the water by placing it in a kitchen towel and twisting. Then I put all the spice ingredients back into the processor with the onion. I subbed sriracha for the green chili paste. I turned the spice mix into a bowel and hand mixed the lamb. I was told I should have doubled the recipe. These were FANTASTIC!"

I chop all ingredients in food processor and mix with spices in a bowl. If I am out of fresh cilantro, I double the amount of ground coriander. I find baking the skewers on a broiling pan at 425F works very well, turning after 20 min and cooking for an additional 5-10. You don't want to overcook or they get really dry."

I made 1.5 x the recipe and added 1 lb of lean ground beef as others had mentioned. I also added enough dry bread crumbs to keep it together. I used a mixture of fresh tabasco and jalapeño peppers because I couldn't find green chili paste at the store. We broiled these because of the rain but plan to grill the next time . These made about 30 skewers and had I known what a hit they would have been I would have tripled it. I can't say enough how good these are. Thanks for sharing the recipe"

"reviewBody": "This \"Indian Style Sheekh Kababs\" recipe is FANTASTIC! It tastes very authentic and it is so easy to make. My husband is Iranian, and Iranians usually grate the onions by hand for their kababs (rather than chop them finely). I'm too lazy for that, and usually just puree them in the food processor (S Blade, NOT the grater disc). For this particular Indian-Style recipe, I suggest doing all of the following in the food processor: (a) \"mincing\" the ginger; (b) \"grating\" the onion (JUST BARELY PUREED and added on top of the ginger); (c) mixing the spices with puree mixture so that they will be evenly distributed in the meat mixture; and (d) adding the cilanto and mint to the onion puree and \"pulsing\" a couple times to \"chop them finely\". (You will want to work quickly and wash your food processor right away so the spices don't stain it.) Also, in the wintertime, we often just make meat patties using a restaurant-style burger press, and bake them in the oven with a broiler treatment the last few minutes. Although it is not as good as on the BBQ, it is still pretty darn good. This is one of our favorite recipes! Thanks Yakuta!"

At middle eastern markets (if you have one near you) one can buy metal skewers that are flat and a scant half inch wide. Forming the ground meat around these is much easier and relatively failsafe. A second method is to use 2 skewers (well soaked bamboo or wood). While the meat will easily rotate on a single skewer, it usually will not using 2 skewers. I have not made this recipe but gave it 5 stars based on ingredients. I am sure it would be very good, but I have a recipe that I have used for years that is a little different."

Didn't need to mess with the food processor, just ran the onion through the coarse side of the box grater. Everything else tasted the edge of my chef's knife! ;) I served this with frozen nann (cheated, sorry.. ) and the AWESOME cucumber raita by BeneloventEmpress elsewhere here. Had to roll me to bed... ;)"

Then just a few months ago I decided to make it again, and follow the recipe once more. This time they were excellent!! The difference? The first time I used lamb from the supermarket, the second time I had the butcher make it from lamb shoulder. I always get the lamb from the butcher now, it's so moist and flavorful that way. I have tinkered with the spices, etc but really its good as written. I don't leave out the cilantro even though I don't like it, because it adds to the overall flavour. You can't really taste the mint even if you use fresh. Fanstastic recipe! Use good quality meat!"

I ended up having to use freshly diced green chilis, as I could find no paste. Everything else was the same. I had no trouble at all with these sticking or falling apart. I think you need to have your grill very hot, and let it sear and get brown on one side before moving it. My lamb wasn't lean, and it was a little greasy for me - but that is entirely my own fault. Use lean lamb, it will be better! Thanks. - Served with tzatiki sauce and naan bread."

They are a little time consuming to make and its very difficult trying to form around the skewers. I tried everything including making sausages and then putting the skewers through later, no matter what it was still quite difficult. I guess worth the hassle, as they were gorgeous. Cooked on an electric griddle, as didn't want to use the grill this time of year!!!"

This recipe was very easy, fantastically flavorful, and fun to eat. LOVED IT!"

I had my company say it was better than the food they'd had in authentic curry houses. Top notch."

I usually do have to add bread crumbs to the mixture to help it stay together. I have made this both with and without skewers. Without skewers, I just shape them into smaller kebabs. I usually broil these for about 5 minutes, then turn them and broil for about another 5 minutes but they do have to be watched quite closely as they cook very quickly. Thanks, Yakuta for this great recipe!"

Also, when I make kebabs (Indian or Greek) I often use half ground lamb, half ground beef - the flavor is really excellent, and the meat stays a little more moist than if using just lamb. I serve these on warm split naan breads or paratha with a drizzle of cucumber raita. With a leafy salad, some onion chutney, and a couple of pappadums, this makes an awesome meal. 8/9/07 Made these again for lunch today. Absolutely outstanding. I'd forgotten how much I love them!

Used about a cup of breadcrumbs, which did not help either. Beef kebabs turned out well, but still required about 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs for it to hold together. I noticed someone using flour to hold together falafels, may use that next time. Will make again but cut down the amount of mint and increase coriander."
