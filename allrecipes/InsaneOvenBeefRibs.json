I didn't have curry or soy sauce but I'm not a curry lover at all. They came out so delicious! I love the flavor! I found them a little tiny bit too oily, will use less when I make them again, soon!

I read all the reviews and so made the following changes: red vinegar wine instead of red wine, cut the oil in half, and used a teaspoon of red pepper flakes instead of curry powder. Don't despair that the sauce is thin at first, it will thicken up during cooking and you just need to mix it well when you pour in the remainder of the sauce at the halfway mark. My husband and I really enjoyed it and will certainly cook it again soon. :)"

Made a couple of revisions to the recipe:\n\n- Used Coppola Merlot\n- 1/2 cup of brown sugar\n- 1 tsp of curry powder (preference)\n- Given I had to cook multiple things in the oven, lower and slower at 380 degrees (about an hour 10 min)\n\nJust phenomenal! This will certainly be one of my go-to recipes!"

Once the sauce was combined I plopped in a frozen Tri-Tip roast, baked in a cast iron Dutch oven at 425Â° for 30 minutes, then reduced heat to 250Â° for around 6 hours. The sauce was plentiful and the flavor? Iâ€™m making it for my Motherâ€™s Day dinner. Itâ€™s just that good. Oh my! Served over rice with a green salad alongside. Thank you for a great and easy recipe!! I might have to get some ribs.... ;)"

I added salt and pepper to it and drenched them about every 5 minutes in the oven (at 400 degrees instead of 425) to get a good glaze. The beef however was not very tender after being boiled, and I may marinade or slow cook next time to try and get it more tender. All around good recipe however."

I did cut back on the amount of olive oil I used and added heaping tablespoons of flour to make sure the sauce thickened after reading prior reviews. I probably doubled the amount of garlic and also added onion powder. I served it with sticky white rice and stir fried some broccoli with garlic, olive oil, sesame oil and a tiny bit of soy sauce.

"reviewBody": "The ingredients and proportions in this recipe are spot on, and would have been worth five stars had the recipe not called for cooking the short ribs at 425 for half an hour (ribs came out dry and overcooked the first time around). The second time around, I heated the oven to 250 degrees, placed the ribs in a roasting pan with a cover, and cooked them low and slow for about five hours. The meat slid right off the bone and was tender enough to cut with a fork. Absolutely delicious.\n\nEdit 10/9/2016: Forgot to stress this enough in my original review; never boil ribs! The best flavors from the meat will end up dissolved in the water and going down the sink."

I substituted a small amount of paprika, chili powder, and a generous pinch of cayenne for the curry, then I marinated the ribs in the sauce for 30 minutes. I baked them at 350 for an hour and a half, completely covers in sauce. My husband and 2 year old daughter were VERY impressed, this has become a new favorite in thr house, and the sauce is thick enough to enjoy over rice!"

"reviewBody": "This was fanTAStic. I did the long ribs. They were perfect! I used cumin instead of curry, though. And I used Worchestershire instead of soy sauce. Oh yeah, and I added onion powder. I used all ingredients (minus the ribs) as a \"sauce\" to marinate the ribs overnight (reserving half of it to use while cooking) then covered tightly with foil. I slow cooked them at 250 degrees for several hours while we were out at a family function. (we were gone from 3pm to 6:30pm) They absolutely FELL off the bone and were sooooo tender! I had researched other recipes but this turned out to be the BEST launching pad recipe. This is going to be added to the hand-me-down family recipe box for all time. I might try to add cayenne pepper next time though. That might just put this \"insane\" recipe right over the top and commit us all to the asylum! Everyone at the table kept saying between bites, \"mmm-this is really, really good.\" Honestly, there wasn't any intelligent conversation at the dinner table tonight; only exclamations of delight. And once dinner was over, immediate texting to friends about the great meal. My stay-at-home-mom, kitchen-cooking-ego is fit to burst!"

Using a dutch oven, I made a few minor changes; I rubbed the garlic and curry powder into the raw meat instead of mixing it into the sauce and braised the ribs for about 2 minutes in a mix of olive oil and butter (about 1tbsp each). I then added the sauce and moved the concoction to the oven. Hubby loved it."
