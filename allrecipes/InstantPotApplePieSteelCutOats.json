I absolutely love this dish and I used all the measurements and ingredients that was listed and I now have breakfast for myself for the next 3-4 days. Thank you."

I also had not tried Steel Cut Oats so I had to get use to the different consistency from regular oatmeal. My apple pieces seemed to disappear so next time I will just use my apple cutter but up it to 2 apples."

I manually released the pressure and I did not have the burned or stuck to the bottom of the pan and mentioned by Erin. I only added the maple syrup to the recipe. It came out well and I will make it this way again."

"reviewBody": "I really like steel cut oats and thought this was the perfect consistency. I wish I had cut my apples in a bit bigger chunks; I diced them rather small. My problem with this recipe was the amount of salt called for. I should have known better, but I was still tired this morning, and I put in the full 1/2 tsp salt. It was too salty for me. I added a couple tablespoons of brown sugar, which helped. I wouldn't add more than an 1/8 tsp of salt in the future. I added some half and half on top, which is a nice touch, and they were okay."

"reviewBody": "5.25.18 Although we love oatmeal, honestly, we’re not huge steel cut oats fans, but I keep trying to acquire a taste for them. Consistency was pretty thick, so I did add some vanilla almond milk and some maple syrup, and I must say I liked it MUCH better after the addition of those two ingredients. We’re not big into sweetness these days, but I think this needed some sweetness, and the maple syrup took care of that. I like the combo of ingredients in this recipe, they partnered well, just didn’t care for the texture of the oats. I plan to try this again with regular oatmeal, and if it turns out more to our satisfaction, I’ll do an update for any other folks who also may not be steel cut oats fans. It certainly is super simple to make, and that I love. I’m the first reviewer, and I don’t want to discourage anybody from trying this. My comments are based on our personal taste preferences. Pamela Wurtz, thanks for sharing your recipe."
