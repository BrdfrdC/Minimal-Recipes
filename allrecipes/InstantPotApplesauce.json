"reviewBody": "1.7.19 I haven’t bought applesauce in a jar for many, many years. We simply prefer homemade, which I usually make in the microwave, but this method is just as easy. The star in this applesauce and the single thing that makes it distinctive and delicious is the star anise. It doesn’t overpower, but it is the first flavor that you taste, and it does make you wonder “…what is that?” I love finding new recipes that I can make in the Instant Pot®, and this will be my go-to recipe in the future. I used MacIntosh apples, and cut back a little on the brown sugar (personal taste preference). Thanks for sharing your recipe, we really enjoyed it."
