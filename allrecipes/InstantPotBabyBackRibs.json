For learners use 1 tsp Koshersalt, you can always add to your serving! Served with red mashed potatoes with the skin, and steamed carrots! My husband enjoyed his meal.

Used water, broth doesnâ€™t seem to add anything to the flavor. They would not stand up in a teepee, no worries. Used my own spice, â€˜Slap ya Mamaâ€™. Didnâ€™t broil or place in the oven. And applied BBQ sauce after they were cooked. My dog and I ate them all. I just cook to eat, not for anyone else but my dog and me. It works"

And not putting 2 tablespoons of anything powder!!!!! . However you author didnâ€™t mention to put ribs on rack so they donâ€™t get wet from liquid ingredients. I could be wrong but as a seasoned home chef the only thing Iâ€™ll would use 2 tablespoons of salt if I was boiling 2 gals of water for potatoes and pasta am sure thereâ€™s more the point is a great rack of rib!!!!"

"reviewBody": "These were fabulous as to the cooking method and you could definitely taste the smoky flavoring of the rub. Very tender. I modified the rub substantially so that it would not be so spicy - and it still had a surprising amount of kick - but even more surprisingly, my 5 and 2 year old both ate all of their ribs. It even had a kick for me! Next time, I'd probably modify it a bit more to tone down the spice, but that's just due to personal preference. Also, you don't need to bake the ribs after taking them from the InstantPot. Just put them under the broiler for 10-15 minutes (turn once) to caramelize the sauce. This will be my go-to way of making ribs when I have an Instant Pot on hand. Modification (from what I recall): 1 TBSP salt; 1 teaspoon chili powder; 1/2 tsp cayenne; 1/2 teaspoon pepper"

The first time I went to make these, I didn't have all the ingredients for the rub, so I used McCormick Grill Mates Smokehouse Maple. It made the recipe even easier, so I've stuck with it. I top it with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. They truly are fall-off-the-bone delicious!"

I have done exactly as the recipe says, I have used water instead of the beef broth because I didnâ€™t have it and I have used beer instead of broth. I didnâ€™t see much difference so now I just use water. I highly recommend this recipe. I buy the mega-pack of ribs at Costco and cook them in one day, slide out the bones, cut them in sections and package them in airtight zipper lock bags then freeze. The easiest dinner youâ€™ll have. Just take them out of the freezer and put them in the fridge and in the evening I put them on my gas grill or you can put them in the oven."

I brush Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce on the backside bake 7 mins and then the front and bake another 7 mins. This BBQ sauce goes well with the rub recipe. You get the sweet and then the little bit of heat from the cayenne .Nice sweet and gooey!"

"reviewBody": "I use my own recipe for the rub but otherwise follow the directions in the recipe pretty closely. The ribs really did come out well. I think the temperature given in the recipe is wrong. For ribs to fall off the bone they need to be closer to 180 degrees. Thatâ€™s about what mine were after 15 to 20 minutes in the oven. Also next time I may add some liquid smoke to the beef broth. I miss the smoky flavor I get when I do the ribs on my cold smoker."

What was left over on New Years Day were eaten the next day and they said they were even better the 2nd day than the 1st day. This is definitely a recipe I will be making a lot. Quick, easy and very tasty. Quality BBQ restaurant taste and a lot cheaper. I rubbed olive oil on the ribs, mixed all of the spices together and rubbed the spices on both sides of the ribs before cooking."

Yes, even the salt. Perfect. I could pull the meat off of the bones, the taste was not too strong in any direction, and even the 4 year old approved. In the way that 4 year olds approve, that they eat 3 bites and say they are good and smile at the taste but then spend the rest of the meal eating the baked beans. ?? But *I* really liked it and am adding to my 'very little drama involved' recipe list. \n\nI paired with roasted broccoli (since the oven was already at 425 anyway) and baked beans."

Only used 3/4 cup water was still plenty of liquid. Put the ribs under the broiler for 2 minutes after baking so they had more substance &amp; texture like you get when you order out. Used store bought barby sauce from store to baste them prior to the baking part. Imagine you could put on the grill for a bit also."

My husband usually puts these in a smoker or on the grill in foil. It takes forever. He's sad now because I'll never let him bbq ribs again after this fantastic recipe.\nUpdate: I made these a second time because my son showed up to visit on a night that I didn't plan to make dinner. I had ribs in the freezer so I seasoned them in the frozen state, popped them into the instant pot and added 20 minutes to the cooking time. They came out just as fabulous as the first time from the fresh state."
