I have to cool it down and scrape the bottom and re-cook it. No website advice helps and I'm sure not going to throw it out! Those times it can taste a little bit burnt but I don't mind, it is still better than $3/can Bush's. Over rice or on toast it is delicious!"

So I cut the cooking time with the sauce down to 20 minutes and did auto release of pressure. (my beans must have been fresh because older beans take longer to took). This recipe is amazing! It reminds me of the beans my French Canadian mother made. Thank you so much."

I did double the sauce ingredients as suggested by some and was glad I did. I think it would be too dry if not doubled. The batch I made for the picnic all went and when I got home, I whipped up an batch and froze some of it. This is my new go to recipe for beans, without a doubt. These were a hit with everyone and I've given the recipe out to several people already. Thanks!"
