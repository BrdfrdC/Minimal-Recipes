Instead of creating the meat mixture myself, I purchased a \"meatloaf\" mixture at our supermarket that contained the beef, veal, &amp; pork. I also have a crockpot express instead of an instant pot, but the directions were spot on and it turned out great! The only change I may make is using less sauce...perhaps 1 can that is 28 oz and one of the smaller 15 oz cans instead of 2 (28 oz) cans. This dish will be one I add to my regular rotation."

"reviewBody": "A good and quick process to soften the cabbage!\n\nAt 9 minutes, the other layers of my cabbage were overcooked. However, the innermost ones were slightly undercooked. When I do this in the future, I'll unwrap all layers and use more of the inner ones.\n\nThe recipe is titled \"basic\". If you want some suggestions, here are a couple:\n 1. For the sauce and meat combo, my grandma would throw in a handful of shredded carrots and raisins.\n 2. And, my personal preference is a slightly more robust sauce. So, I substituted one can of sauce for a small can of paste, crushed tomatoes, and whole tomatoes.\n\nOverall, great, simple process for Cabbage Rolls. Thank you!"

Unfortunately if you follow the instructions exactly on this recipe in my instant pot it burned as soon as it hit pressure it never even got to cook for the 22 minutes. I had to quickly release the pressure scoop everything out into a saucepan and then similar along the stove to be able to eat anything we lossed all of the spaghetti sauce because it was burned on the bottom and left a burned taste. This recipe to me epic fail."

I did use 1 pound each of ground beef and veal. and made the sauce a little larger by adding a can of diced tomatoes. I would not recommend putting the cabbage in the cooker to soften the cabbage, it didn't work out for me. I had to run to the store and buy another head.. well to be honest my wife did, but it was great and reminded me of my moms!!"

I fried 1/2 lb. hamburger, 1/2 lb. mild pork sausage (didn't have veal), and rinsed well to drain fat, then chopped fine with food processor. I subbed brown rice for white rice, but since it takes twice as long to cook normally, I simmered it for 20 minutes, and it came out done nicely in the Instant Pot. I also used dried onions, and a bit more pepper, and it was wonderful. Chopped and added remaining cabbage on top, per previous reviewer."
