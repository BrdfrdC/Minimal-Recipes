"reviewBody": "This is a great soup. My son is feeling under the weather and chicken noodle soup is always his request when unwell. I had to make a few substitutions. I used fresh chicken breasts, and I didn't have wide noodles on hands so subbed linguine broke into 1-inch pieces. I also left out the bouillon and basically halved the recipe. I think it was plenty flavorful for us. If I would have had it, I would have used all the broth instead of part water. My picky son was happy!"

(The cubes I use cal for 1 cube per 2 cups water, so I put in one extra) \n\nI used chicken thighs. \n\nI did a quick release instead of natural. \n\nEverything else was the same and it was perfect! So flavorful and perfect for fall/ winter."

I would probably change it up next time and use more broth instead of the cubes but overall this was a good recipe and one I would make again. Also, I would recommend using the quick release over natural so that the veggies do not get overcooked."
