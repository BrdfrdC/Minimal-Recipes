I used about half as many mushrooms as that recipe called for. Over a cup. After I sautéed the chicken, I cooked the mushrooms and added the onions and then garlic. I followed this recipe from there. I cheated a ½ cup of the 4½ cups of broth and used water. I rarely finish a whole carton of broth before it goes bad. I will definitely make this again and try other risotto recipes too."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was great as far as texture- the risotto was perfect, creamy and rich with the cheese added. It cooked perfectly at the times listed. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars was the amount of time it took to prep and the lack of flavor! There needs to be a definite increase in the spices and I used a double strength chicken broth. I'm not sure what would have happened had I used regular, but it wouldn't have helped. So, if you are great with spicing things up to your taste, this would be great. If you are more of a beginning cook, this might be a little too much of a challenge without additional spices broken down in the recipe."

It tasted really good with the chicken thighs.\n I would not hesitate to make this again. It was creamy and the chicken was melt in your mouth."
