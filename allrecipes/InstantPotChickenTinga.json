"reviewBody": "Because I had only had a half can left of chipotle peppers in adobe sauce from a previous recipe - i only had 3 vs 6. I think I could have handled all 6 ðŸ˜‰ Heat but not overwhelming (but the steam smell from the adobe was intense in my kitchen!). Also chopped tomatoes from my garden vs canned. Nice smoky, overall good flavor! Had lots of leftovers!! Next night, I made the slaw from this same submitter (Air Fryer Crispy Fish Tacos with Slaw - slaw only) and turned into a spin of chicken tacos. Really liked and we would do this again! This recipe could have fed a crowd! Picture submitted includes leftovers (taco version) with the slaw. Thanks Nicole!!"

I also added some El Pato sauce at the end to help thicken the sauce that was created. It was so good both traditionally over tostadas and then again as burritos! Will m make again."

"reviewBody": "Perfect recipe for tinga and just like one I've made in the past, but shortened cooking time by using the Instant Pot! Easy to make and very delicious! We thought it was a little spicy, but didn't feel the heat level was overpowering. It's a nice slow hit of heat with each bite. The only change I made to the recipe was that I blended a can of no salt added diced tomatoes with the chipotle peppers because I was out of crushed tomatoes. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written. While the chicken was cooking in the Instant Pot, I made our sides of Mexican rice, black beans, and corn. Will definitely make this recipe again in the Instant Pot! Thanks for the recipe Soup Loving Nicole!"
