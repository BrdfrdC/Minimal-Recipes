At that step, I put the shredded chicken into the pot with the liquid and seasonings and set it to high pressure for 3 minutes to get it boiling. Then followed the rest of the directions. I did add a little more chicken stock after it was cooked as it seemed too thick. But my family LOVED it!! Will definitely be making this again."

I tweak it for our family by omitting the chicken breasts (it was too much meat for us &amp; the thighs taste better), increasing the dumpling recipe by 50%, and I sometimes sub corn for the green beans. Itâ€™s amazing!"

I thought the sauce should be thicker so I doubled the flour and butter and next time I will triple the flour. But the best thing I did was follow another suggestion and that is to pressure the dumplings for 10 minutes on low. It worked so well. Otherwise I had to pour out the stew into another pan and cook the dumplings on top of the stew on the stove. I'm not going there again."

Fresh marjoram and thyme versus dried, only needed two medium chicken breasts (plenty of meat), and half &amp; half (with 2 tsp of dried buttermilk mix) substituted for the buttermilk for the dumplings.\nAs others mentioned, set the Instant Pot to saute for the dumplings, but set to low as it will start burning the bottom. 12 minutes lid on and another 5 off.\nWill do this recipe again."

The last instruction to put your cooker on 'slow cook' will not work to cook the dumplings, the heat is way too low. Instead, leave your cooker on saute and just let the dumplings cook in the boiling/simmering liquid for about 15 mins."

A brilliant idea to use bone-in for the dark and white meat. It gives the soup a flavor profile that you just wonâ€™t attain with boneless poultry. I didnâ€™t make any major modifications, only small preference changes. Like I added garlic and instead of using butter for the flour paste, I just skimmed the chicken fat from the broth after it was done cooking."

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe exactly as called for, and there's just something about these ingredients that tastes better than the run of the mill chicken soup or pot pie filling. The only thing I would change is to make more dumplings! Not sure how I'd cook the extra but I'd figure out a way. I live by myself and this fed me for a week. Delicious! Thank you for sharing this! r-"

"reviewBody": "This was really good! Family loved it and said it is a definite keeper. Some changes I made: used boneless chicken breast, cut up into cubes. Therefore, did not cook, remove, shred. I just skipped that step and continued with recipe from there. Also, I did not add the extra vegetables. We prefer only the onions, celery and carrots, which I increased a little. Other than that, I followed the recipe and there were zero leftovers."

"reviewBody": "This recipe showed up on my feed and of course I had to make it. My husband and I adjusted a few of the ingredients. We use the instant pot all the time and Iâ€™m always impressed by how easy and tasteful things are in it. We didnâ€™t have buttermilk so I used regular milk. Substituted edemame for the green beans and peas, used a can of cream of chicken soup and a cup less chicken broth. Love it, weâ€™ll make this again."

My daughter thought they were very soft potatoes. They did have a very good flavor though! I will make it again, but might experiment with different dumpling recipes."

"reviewBody": "the soup came out amazing. the issue I have is the fact that there are ingredients in the recipe that aren't on the list and there is no measurement for it such as buttermilk and parsley. there were 4 items not listed in the ingredients. I had to guess on the buttermilk and I made my own since I wasn't aware I needed any. i used about 1/4 cup of milk with a small splash of vinegar to sour the milk."

"reviewBody": "I made this again for dinner last nightâ€”perfect comfort food for wintry weather. The vegetables don't need to be finely diced; I just do a rough chop, since the pressure cooker ensures they'll be tender. I also added chunks of potatoes because I had a couple to use up. The flour-butter paste at the end is to thicken the broth and to add richness. Oh, and if you don't have buttermilk, regular milk is fine for the dumplings. I made this last batch using my stovetop pressure cooker, which is big enough for a 1.5x amount of dumplings. For the bigger batch, I just added more flour and buttermilk but kept the salt, baking powder, and butter amounts the same."
