"reviewBody": "The roux was a disaster- the instapot is too big and this is such a small amount, it burned to the bottom almost instantly. There was no way to stir it in to anything for more than about 30 seconds. When I added the vegetables it turned in to a big clumpy mess and I gave up and combined everything. The end result was way too much liquid, similar to soup. 3 stars because the flavor was still decent, but make the roux separately in a smaller pan."

It's spicy for sure but nothing some sour cream can't help if you can't handle it- otherwise I'd say avoid using too much cayenne pepper; maybe half a teaspoon?"

"reviewBody": "This was spicy and delicious! I used leftover chicken from another meal. I didn't have andouille, so I used smoked turkey sausage. My husband loved it and we liked it even better the next day after the flavors had a chance to meld. My only minor disappointment was that it was much thinner than gumbo usually is. Next time I would either make a larger roux or use less chicken broth. This recipe is definitely a keeper!"

Cooking time could be a little longer in my opinion, some of the celery was not cooked as thoroughly as I expected, but I might have cut mine a little bigger than the author of the recipe. The recipe is great as is. I added some shrimp at the very end because I love shrimp in gumbo."
