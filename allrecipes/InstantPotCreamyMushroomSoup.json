Some salt is necessary for a great broth. I added some salt to the soup once it was finished cooking. Much better. I didn't have any thyme so I used fresh home grown rosemary. I didn't have sherry so I used my homemade Cabernet sauvignon. I also added a good pinch of ground coriander to the soup. So good!"

Play around with any of these suggestions: Maybe 1/2 beef, 1/2 chicken broth; a tiny pinch or two of nutmeg in anything with cream; and a wonderful garnish is toasted slivered or sliced almonds. For fewer calories, fat free condensed milk, though it won't quite have the same mouth feel as heavy cream! Have fun!"

"reviewBody": "Loved this recipe. I agree with others who commented that it needed just a bit more depth and rich flavor so here’s what I added. Eliminated the sherry and replaced with 1/2-1 teaspoon of good quality balsamic vinegar (be very careful as you can over do it, taste test it as you go). Also added to taste liquid aminos, a full bunch of thyme tied into a bouquet garnis, and two full cups of heavy cream. I puréed the soup in a BlendTec blender then poured back into my Instant Pot to thicken slightly, although it didn’t really need it. I served with crusty toasted buttered San Francisco sourdough slices from Arizmendi Bakery in the famous Mission District. Thank you for this recipe it’s so good I would serve this for a very high end dinner or a casual meal at home. It’s 5 star restaurant quality."

"reviewBody": "3.30.19 Shopped at Aldi today, and they had white mushrooms on sale for $.99/8-oz pkg, so three packages went into my cart for a Friday night soup and sandwich evening. Followed the directions to the letter, and then made a few adjustments (personal preference here). I wanted a thicker, creamier consistency, so I did add additional flour (Wondra®) mixed with more sherry (love sherry in mushroom soup). Next time, I’ll use baby bella/cremini mushrooms for a bit bolder flavor, but this was not the least bit shabby made with less expensive white mushrooms. Smooth, creamy, with a delicate flavor, and the thyme was the perfect herb for this soup. So very, very easy. This soup is good enough to serve to guests. I’m always on the lookout for Instant Pot® recipes, and this is a good one…SAVED!!"
