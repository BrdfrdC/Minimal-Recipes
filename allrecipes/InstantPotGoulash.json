Starting with this recipe I would eliminate the tomato sauce and just use a 28oz can of crushed or whole tomatoes and keep everything else as is. I ended up adding more ground meat and pasta to balance it out. I do like American style goulash even though I grew up in a Czech house where it was made in its true form."

I also added Umami to enhance the flavors. I did not drain the meat etc because I wanted the flavors and it was NOT greasy. I used a glass liquid measure cup to measure Broad Egg Noodles and threw in a 3rd cup...I LOVE egg noodles! Brother taster and I HAD to go back for seconds is was so creamy and delicious I even dreamed about it!!!"

Wife likes her pasta soft, so we added more cook time (about 5 min) on the back end to be sure they were done. This was a mistake. The pasta was really mushy and there was no liquid. It still had good flavor and if we make again, will not skimp on liquid or adjust cook time."

"reviewBody": "I made this tonight for dinner, and my family loved it. I did make some changes, but some were for ingredients I didn't have. Instead of the pint of fresh mushrooms, I used 2 cans of sliced mushrooms. Instead of the 2 1/2 cups of water, I used 1 1/2 cups of beef broth since other reviews suggested the 2 1/2 cups of water in the recipe was too much. I had only 2 8 ounce cans of tomato sauce on hand, so I reconstituted 2 small cans of tomato paste with 1 can of water. I also used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce as other reviewer did since the soy sauce would add too much salt. I did all of the cutting and chopping ahead of time and had everything ready to go into the pot as needed. By doing this, preparing this meal was incredibly fast. The results were very good and the consistency of the goulash was perfect. For 3 of us, this recipe made enough for tonight's meal and one meal to freeze for later. I will definitely be making this again."

When finished, it still had more liquid than I wanted, so put it on \"low saute\" for ten minutes. The end result was the consistency I wanted. Next time, I will use only 1.5 cups of water."

I would recommend adding only 1.5-2 cups of water instead of 2.5, adding corn, and using 3-3.5 cups of noodles (shell noodles in particular)."
