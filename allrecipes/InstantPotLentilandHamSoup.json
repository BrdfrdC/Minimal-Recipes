I ended up bringing it back up to pressure for a few more minutes to soften the lentils a little more, but other than that it was a perfect meal. I served it with brown rice and leftover cornbread. I cooked it in my IP Mini, and it filled it to the max line (however, it may explain the need for a little longer cook time.)."

"reviewBody": "I love this recipe so much. The first time I made it exactly as written, and it was good. The second and third time I made a few changes, and it was even better. I omitted the water - it didn't need it. I increased all the seasonings a bit. I put in extra carrots simply because I like them. The best part is that you can work with what meat you have, whether it be ham, ham hocks, some type of sausage, or my personal favorite, smoked turkey thighs! You can use the chicken broth specified in the recipe, but homemade bone broth is great too, or beef broth if you have it. This is a lovely recipe that is easy enough for a child to put together. It is absolutely delicious on a cold night, with leftovers for lunch the next day."

Think a Campbell chunky soup. Itâ€™s fantastic the way it is but next time Iâ€™ll try adding cubed potatoes and red kidney beans to give it more density."

I browned the sausage with olive oil, then added the onions, carrots and celery and sautÃ© until most of the liquid evaporated, then on with the rest of the recipe as written.\n\nMan oâ€™ man, one of the best lentil soups I have ever made! Itâ€™s a definite keeper and it will be the only one I will make from now on."

After tasting it, I decided to add a half of lemon. Not just the juice but the actual lemon. That boosted the flavors. But it was a 5 before that as well. We will make it again :)"

The lentils and veggies did get a little over done and mushy in my opinion so next time I will either reduce the cook time or else just do a quick release instead of the natural release. I'm still giving this 5 stars. This is a great recipe!"
