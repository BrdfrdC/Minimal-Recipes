My only change was that I used Knorr chicken bouillon with tomato to make the broth instead of regular chicken broth and tomato sauce. Perfect! Next time I’ll add veggies like corn, black beans and sautéed peppers for additional flavor and color. Also, I didn’t sauté the rice…just added the broth and then the rice. If you’re salt sensitive, just reduce salt to 1/2 teaspoon."

"reviewBody": "I was going to try this recipe but seeing many having issues with the burn notification. I think the problem is not the scraping the bottom of the pot but rather that the recipe calls for the rice to be cooked on high pressure. Rice in a Instant Pot should be low pressure and natural release and a 1:1 ration of rice and liquid as I see others having wet, sticky rice. I think I will try this recipe but change the liquid and cook time based off Instant Pot manual recommendations or use the rice button. I will also add some other seasoning I normally use in my regular version of Mexican rice. Adobo, Sazon, Chicken bullion and a green pepper."

"reviewBody": "I found that the liquid ratio is off at least for my first run at 8 servings. Typically, I use 1.75:1 ratio for this recipe made on the stovetop. This is closer to 2:1 with the stock and tomato sauce. If you like a dryer/fluffier rice consider cutting back stock a bit. Also, in my opinion cumin would not go into traditional red rice so I omitted it. Next time I would add 1tsp of paprika and a bit more salt."

It was so easy to make and I only made a few minor adjustments like adding Sofrito (my spanish friends swear by it lol) and having to blend canned diced tomatoes into a tomato sauce. But it came out so perfect my picky eater 5 yo even requested that I make it everyday Thanks for this simple and delicious recipe!!"

When the rice and onions were golden, I added a half cup of drained canned pinto beans (all I had on hand, will use black next time) before adding the rest of the mixed ingredients. When I took the lid off I added a half cup of frozen corn with the chopped jalapeno in it from Presidents Choice. Stirred it up and put the lid back on and by the time I had my salsa and sour cream out, it was ready. Served with beef fajitas. Family approved and went back for seconds. Will definitely make this again. Thank you!"

For anyone who wants to use brown rice, the only change is to increase the pressure cook time to 28 minutes. I recommend letting the pot cool a couple of minutes after sauteing the onions and garlic to avoid the dreaded burn warning."

The base recipe was decent, but it was too wet and didn't have as much flavor as I hoped. \nMy grandmother is from mexico and used to make rice all the time. I took the base recipe and tweaked it a bit. \nI slightly browned the rice on the saute setting before adding the broth/sauce. I used bullion instead of chicken broth and reduced the amount of water by 1/2 cup. I added a tablespoon of onion powder and followed the rest of the recipe! Came out great!"

I think maybe the other commentators are correct and it has to do with the saute. Will definitely let it cool off before beginning the rice portion next time and report back. l Followed the recipe and only changes I made was to double it, sub EVOO, and add 1/2 tsp chili powder.

The rice was tender and the veggies were soft. Everything blended very well. No overpowering taste of anything. I should have added more spice along with the enchilada sauce to get a kick, overall a good recipe. Makes 4 small servings, great as a side dish."

The only change I made was adding cumin/salt to rice and stirring after adding stock, and I needed this to be vegan so I used veggie stock instead of chicken . I added the tomato sauce but didn't stir it in until after cooking was complete. Was a little concerned that I had put too much liquid because as a rule, with pressure cooking rice, you do a 1:1 ratio of rice to liquid. Was somewhat wet when I opened the lid but I stirred and after standing for a few mins it was fine. Good recipe, thanks for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "This is the best Mexican rice recipe I've tried so far...outstanding! I should note, however, that I didn't have the chicken stock on hand. Instead, I replaced the 1 1/2 Cups of chicken broth with 2 Teaspoons of \"Better Than Bouillon\" dissolved into 1 1/2 Cups warm water. Also added 1 whole diced Serrano pepper. This is my go to Mexican rice recipe from here on out. The ingredient proportions and cook time were spot on, and I did NOT experience any burn issues whatsoever. To clarify one thing, I waited exactly 5 minutes AFTER engaging the pressure release mechanism before opening the lid...flawless rice. Seriously. Release the pressure immediately after the 7 minute cook time, and then wait the 5 minutes."

I made modifications to suit my family’s tastes and traditions. I did follow the suggestion of other reviewers and did NOT stir in the tomato sauce prior to cooking. It did just fine on top and when the cooking was over it stirred in beautifully like it had always been a part of the dish. There were many raves about the rice at dinner. We all marveled at the ingenuity of this and it will become a staple in my house for cooking rice going forward."

The only thing i changed was to cut the salt in half, subbed chicken broth, subbed olive oil, and I plopped the sauce in without stirring like others suggested. \n\nAfter the seven mins, i did a quick release and set my timer for 5 mins. Opened up and fluffed with a fork.\n\none tip: Immediately out of the pot, it was very soggy. I set out on the counter and allowed some of the wetness to soak in and it was much better after a 20 minute rest."

"reviewBody": "I think the instructions are unclear. Mine also came out with the burn message. I was able to salvage it and put it on the stove. I mixed in the tomato sauce when I was making it. According to an IP troubleshooting blog I read, and another reviewer noted not to mix the sauce, don't mix the sauce because the liquid at the bottom needs to be thin. What that means is that after you have mixed everything, pour the tomato sauce on top and don't mix it in, just let it float there, so the liquid on the bottom stays thin. Next, I am unclear whether I cook on high pressure or low pressure? I don't know. I think the flavors are great, but the instructions are unclear for those of us who are not used to using an IP. Mine is the newer model."

The \"Burn\" warning seems to be prevalent to the newer models and there are several possible causes. 1. The pot is too hot from sauteing, should this happen in the future simply turn off the unit and wait a few minutes 2. The gasket in improperly inserted 3. There are bits stuck to the bottom of the pot 3. The pressure relief valve is stuck and releasing steam....I am sorry that this recipe didn't work for you, best of luck with future recipes:)\nI am responding to a question about the pressure on this recipe, there is an error in the instructions that I didn't catch...it should be high pressure, not low.

I also rinsed the long grain rice for a bit to remove some of the starch. I only cooked this for 6 minutes, due to scaling the recipe down, I figured that it would need slightly less time to cook. It turned out great, and went well with our leftovers that we brought home from the Mexican restaurant over the weekend. Will make again. Thanks Bren!"

"reviewBody": "I’ve made this recipe at least 10-15 times since May with success! Truly delicious go to for us. My husband even says it is one of the best Mex. Rice I’ve ever made and I agree…full of more flavor than I expected using the Instant Pot (IP)! I’ve subbed taco seasoning when out of cumin and have made this exactly as written too. Here are some tips for some who might be new to the IP as I was. #1 Rinse your rice. #2 Do not stir in the tomato sauce—recipe doesn’t say to do so, but you might be tempted out of habit. When I stirred, IP did not come to pressure and some rice was uncooked. I fired up pot for 3 additional minutes, but ended up with a very thin burned layer of rice on bottom of pot. No big deal, just remove the pot and cover it with foil. Cooked rice will lift off fine and some like the crisp part anyway. Barely any rice wasted from my own newbie error. You’ll just have to soak the pot a little to wash out what’s left…easy peasy. #3 Do not try to do natural release because you’re busy with other dishes. Texture change noted…still good though. #4 Chunky/Thick salsas do not seem to work as a sub. #5 If rice done and you think too much moisture, just leave it on keep warm and excess moisture will be absorbed by rice or evaporate lending to perfect fluffy and delicious Mexican Rice. End of story, make exactly as recipe instructs and you won’t be disappointed! Yum! Thanks again, Bren—I’ve been converted to making your rice in the IP! :)"
