The only changes I made, were adding a stalk of chopped celery with the veggies and a little extra ground up canned tomato. Otherwise, I followed the directions and it came out great. \n\nFor those having trouble understanding the directions, after you have sauteed, cancel and put the lid on. Then press your \"Pressure cook\" button and set it for 4-5 min. It will take about 10 min. to pressurize and it will then begin cooking and counting down. I hope that helps!"

Was I suppose to set it for pressure cooking? Or leave it on saute? Dont assume everyone just knows what you are talking about!!! will never make again!"

I also used a ~15oz can of tomato sauce which I think is much better than the smaller one. I only had rotini noodles at home and they worked fine at 2 cups."
