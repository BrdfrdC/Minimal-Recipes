My mom grew up on her Grandpa's pinto bean farm in New Mexico in the '30s and '40s and she knew how to make pinto beans. This tastes much like hers. Sometimes she'd use a ham hock, sometimes salt pork, sometimes bacon. I like the bacon flavor myself, but the hock or salt pork will make the beans a bit creamier. That bean said, this is a favorite and a go-too for me now."

"reviewBody": "This turned out really great! I had to change things up a little bit due to items on hand. I ended up using 6tsp of the Knorr Tomato chicken broth, 6 cups water due to no tomato paste plus no chicken broth or bouillon. Because of that, I only used 3/4 tsp of kosher salt. Also, since I had no canned chilis (or fresh), I used a tbsp of the freeze dried jalapenos. Instead of the fresh onion, I used about 1 1/2 tbsp of dried minced onion... OOH! I added a dash of cayenne, dash of tabasco, and a squeeze of lime. (GAH, so sorry!! lots of modifications because I REALLY had a taste for Pinto Beans!!) I had no bacon :( \nI followed the instructions for 45 minutes cook time and natural release. After tasting, I ended up putting about a tsp of Agave Sweetner in the pot and stirring. I had to much acid and needed to tone it down. Then it was Perfect"

I had no green chili peppers but I had red, dried ones that I had grown this past summer and dropped two into the mix. I started by dicing the bacon and the onions and then sauteing them together which worked well. When done the dish is kind of like a bean soup but my Lord is it good!!! I will definitely cook it again!"
