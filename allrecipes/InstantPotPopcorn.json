Everything seemed fine, but today I get no light on the display. Probably burnt the fuse. Pot was full of soup ingredients -- well, there is still the crock pot in the cupboard as back up."

"reviewBody": "I did like this popcorn, even though I forgot to add my popcorn salt to the oil this time which was my error, not the recipe. Much better than microwave popcorn! I do not own a glass lid for my Instant Pot. I made do with a glass lid from other cookware. My IP is the simple version 6 quart. I started a timer on my stove when the first 2 kernels popped. Listened to the popping to almost stop which was less than 3 minutes. Turned off the IP ,removed the lid, dumped the popcorn into a large bowl. Almost No unpopped kernels, even though my popcorn was a bit old. I will make this again! Thanks!"

"reviewBody": "Hey, this really worked! I used grapeseed oil and added salt to the oil. I didn't let it go for the full five minutes because I was worried about burning. I waited until there were about three seconds between each pop; there was still 1 minute, 45 seconds on the timer. I turned off the heat and left the lid on for the rest of the time. Great! Oh, and I don't have a glass lid either but it was fine."
