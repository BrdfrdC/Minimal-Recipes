Ironically, it was not chuck roast, it was some kind of beef roast that said “best if slow cooked.” But I used it in this recipe and it is so tender and juicy! I only used 2 cups of beef broth, as others recommended, and it was plenty! I cooked the roast on high for 40 minutes, did a quick steam release, then added a mesh basket with the red potatoes and carrots. Put it back on for 20 more minutes, and voila! Best meal I’ve made all year!"

I also made sure to take the meat out of the pot after browning all the sides, add the broth and scrape up all the bits while still on saute, so as to avoid the dreaded burn notice. I had baby carrots so I had to add them in the last 10 minutes, and that was perfect. Thanks for a great recipe!"

Next time i will cut slots in the roast and pack seasoning inside, but for leftover stuff I had to cook with it came out pretty good."

I came fairly close with this one, but I added some Brazilian seasonings (Sabor do Nordeste), more Worcestershire than called for, half a packet of dry onion soup mix, some mushrooms, and a stalk of celery. I also diced some onion into the sauteing oil, just for the heck of it. \nI was a little worried when I opened it up and saw all the liquid in there. I was afraid that it would be as dry as my crockpot roasts. However, I fished it all out, set the pot to saute again, boiled up the liquid and whisked in some flour to make gravy. Best pot roast I have ever made."

"reviewBody": "I made this with a 5 pound eye of round roast cut in half, no other changes. It had great flavor, but could have been a bit more tender. Could be it was too large of roast. I'd use this recipe again and perhaps go with 85 minutes vs 80."

"reviewBody": "This is my third attempt to do a pot roast in the instant pot, and my last. The pressure cooker isn’t the best place for something that needs to be slow cooked. ... Following the advice of some of the reviewers, I doubled up on all the spices, used fresh rosemary and fresh garlic, I reduced the amount of liquid and included red wine.… Even with reducing the liquid, there was still too much liquid left at the end. Which I had to sauté for an extra 40 min to reduce. \n\nI used 3 1/2 pound roast, cooked it on high pressure for 70 min, but the inside was still tough. I peeled off some of the meat that came off easy and then put the rest back in for another 30 minutes, it still wasn’t tender enough after that, so again had to cut parts of it and put it back in for longer, while sautéing the sauce to reduce it. \n\nI included the onions, and added extra, but I did not put it in with carrots and potatoes as I’ve made that mistake in the past… They don’t turn out well in the pressure cooker for that long. \n\nThe flavour was delicious, but the texture, tenderness and richness of the beef wasn’t there. There is no substitution to slow cooking, which is what is needed. And at the end, after all the corrections, it ended up taking just as much time."

"reviewBody": "I did not use the garlic powder but minced 2 cloves of garlic instead and did not use the paprika. I used russet potatoes but would use the red potatoes next time as they are more creamy. I also added fresh green beans and it was excellent.\nWill definitely make this again . It is a great recipe in the instant pot for a motorhome dinner."

"reviewBody": "I was surprised at how good this turned out. I made only a few adjustments. I used Italian seasoning, onion powder and fresh minced garlic (sauteed with the fresh onion). I also added 2 tbsp. of tomato paste. One other thing that I had seen in another recipe was to wrap the potatoes and the carrots in their own foil packets placed on top of the roast. This did keep the vegetables from getting too mushy. Anyway, this recipe will be a keeper."

"reviewBody": "I'm really surprised this got so many good reviews! I looked at the recipe and just didn't see where there would be much taste to the beef. I was right. I had added an envelope of Lipton Onion Soup mix and I doubled the amount of seasonings and the beef was *still* kind of bland.\n\nAlso, the carrots and potatoes were WAY too soft and the onions just disintegrated. \n\nI would suggest cooking the beef under pressure with one onion, for about 90% of the amount of time, releasing the pressure and then adding in the potatoes, carrots, and another sliced onion for the remaining time. That way the vegetables aren't mush. I think two envelopes of the onion soup mix would lend this dish more flavor."
