Today I cooked them for 50 minutes right to start, let them natural release which took about 20-25 and they were perfect!"

"reviewBody": "Loved using the Instant Pot to make this recipe! So simple for your basic refried beans and the directions were spot on. I just mashed the beans instead of using the immersion blender because we do like some texture. I felt as written it could use more salt or seasoning. I ended up adding a little Rotel and continued to mash. It did seem like there was too much liquid, but let it sit as Soup Loving Nicole indicated in her review and the beans were perfect. Thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "1.12.19 I started off adding 1/2 cup of the bean liquid, and adding more until I reached the consistency that we like. We like our refried beans a little chunky, so I didn’t blend them until totally smooth. The only change I made was substituting one teaspoon of the salt with a teaspoon of Goya® Adobo Seasoning (one of my favorites for Latin recipes) which really elevated the flavor. Also, we’re pepper fans, so I did give these beans a pretty healthy grind of fresh peppercorns. They turned out delicious, and this was so very easy! I love finding recipes for my Instant Pot® that are outstanding, and these beans are in that category!"

I panicked at first when I added a cup of the cooking liquid because they were quite runny. Give them 5 minutes and they will set up to the perfect texture. I do feel they could use more seasoning other than just salt but I am still giving this 5 stars. The method is spot on! Thanks for sharing!"
