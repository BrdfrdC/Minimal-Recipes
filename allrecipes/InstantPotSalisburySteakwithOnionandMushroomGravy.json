My instincts told me to drain the fat - but I followed the recipe. However, beyond the fat, the flavor of the whole dish was off, the gravy was too salty, the meat was too bland. Lastly, the meat patties were very difficult to flip inside the Instant Pot, causing them to fall apart before I even started. I learned that just because you CAN cook something in an Instant Pot doesn't mean you should!"

"reviewBody": "I would definitely fry the patties in a pan rather than in the instant pot....I sauted the first 3 patties in the instant pot and they really stuck to the pot and one fell apart. The next 3 I browned in a pan and that worked much better. You can still add all the drippings to the instant pot when you saute the onions and mushrooms so the flavor remains. Also, I manually released the steam after 15 minutes of natural release since I was pressed for time - it worked great. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly with the following minor exceptions: 3 cloves of garlic (I always up the garlic), used a pound of turkey instead of the 1/2 lb of pork, and no salt beef bouillon instead of the beef broth (it didn't detract from the flavor and I figured if anyone needed a bit more salt they could add it at the table (no one did!). Served it with mashed potatoes and asparagus - everyone enjoyed it. (The recipe made 6 patties with the 2 lbs of gound meat.)"

Prepping the patties takes half an hour. Add another 1.5 hours if you decide to refrigerate them. The sautee steps take another half hour. The full time to pressure cook is 45 minutes, then you have to finish the gravy. I like the recipe but will look for a different was to make it next time."

Caramelized the onions (I didn't use mushrooms) before adding ALL the gravy ingredients and then let simmer for a bit to meld the flavors. Then I cooked on high pressure 15 minutes, natural release 15 minutes. Removed patties to a plate and used sauté function to thicken sauce with cornstarch ( I used more than called for for a thicker gravy), then returned patties to simmer just before serving. This is everything a great Salisbury steak should be; tender, tasty patties and a delicious gravy! Thank you!"

Gravy is a little thin when done but just add a little more cornstarch and water as suggested. Next time, I will make extra patties and freeze them so I will have them prepared. That will cut done on the prep time. This recipe is a keeper and will be used often in my home. My husband LOVED it!!!!!!"

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe using ground venison rather than ground beef (we have a freezer full!), and the sauce does an amazing job of hiding any gamey taste, if you're sensitive to that. Be careful when you're adding cornstarch at the end -- the sauce thickened so much that I had to add broth to thin it back out. Maybe bring it down to 1 T. rather than 2 T. of cornstarch. Other than that, it was so tasty. The whole family enjoyed it!"

"reviewBody": "Made it as directed except for a few cooking step changes. 1. I didn't leave the meat out for 30 minutes, that's just asking for bacteria to grow on it. I also letft the natural release for my InstantPot for 15 minutes, after that the pressure is pretty much low enough and you're just letting it stew in the sauce, which is fine if that's what you want, but it isn't necessary. I was afraid it was going to have a strong tomato taste but it came out fine. My only complaint is the meat patties were falling apart and we had to scoop them out, might add some more egg next time. All-in-all, we liked this recipe and will make it again. For those complaining about doing it in an IP or that it took too long. I only dirtied one pot to make the whole recipe, and if you cut the release time you won't be waiting around. This recipe was simple to make and worth the effort IMHO."

"reviewBody": "Perfect example of why electric pressure cookers are sometimes no faster than a regular pot. This recipe calls for 15 minutes preheat, 15 minutes to cook and 10-40 minutes [?] to cool down. I browned the patties in a frying pan and had then finished in a stove-top pressure cooker in barely 20 minutes. They tasted alright; nothing special."

"reviewBody": "This was excellent! The only changes I made were due to dietary restrictions (omitted egg, used Ian's panko bread crumbs for Gluten Free, Dairy Free, and Egg free, and subbed the red wine for marsala wine as that's what I had on hand). The patties held together perfectly and the flavor of the sauce with the mushrooms and onions was so spot on perfect for Salisbury Steak! Even my mushroom hater just pushed aside the mushrooms and said this dish was super good...not once, but twice! Served with mashed sweet potatoes and to my surprise the sauce goes well...complimented and cut the sweetness of the potatoes nicely imo. My husband had some corn too. Perfect all around meal! Thanks for another great recipe, Bren!"

I wanted to make a little bit more so I used 1 pd of ground pork instead of 1/2, used two eggs (because they were a little on the small size) and 1/2 cup bread crumbs. It made six larger patties. The sauce I did one and one half times the recipe just so that we would have left overs. Everyone that ate this meal said it was awesome and to def keep to make again!"

We made everything almost exactly the same except the parsley in the patties. I guess I ran out of it and realized last minute but either way they were still very flavorful. We doubled the batch and have frozen the other half for another busy weeknight. Thanks"

"reviewBody": "I followed this almost to the letter. What I didn’t do was use any onion. I have an onion hater in the house that wouldn’t have eater dinner had I added the onion. I did, however, add onion powder in its place. Folks, it needs the real onions! If you have a hater then shred them, grind them, make onion water, do something, but add real onion. The flavor just wasn’t where it needed to be without. For the pork, I had a pork tenderloin I needed to use so I ground that up. I left this in the pot for the full natural release, which took nearly 40 minutes. Next time I would probably release after 10-15 minutes since it was a little on the dry side, which the gravy helped with."

"reviewBody": "8.23.18 I followed this recipe to the letter and wouldn’t change a thing, it turned out awesome. I sliced the onions and mushrooms and mixed up the meat patties (including the pork) in the morning, put them in the fridge, and then this was just a breeze to make later for dinner in the Instant Pot®. The gravy is absolutely delicious, and that little bit of red wine adds incredible richness and depth of flavor. Do use a good-quality beef broth/stock (the only one that I buy is Kitchen Basics® for beef, chicken, and vegetable), and it’s what has been used in every cooking class that I’ve ever taken (well, I haven’t taken that many, but they’ve always used Kitchen Basics). Not sure what happened to my onions, as they seem to be barely visible, but their flavor contributes greatly to that crazy-good gravy. Some might say “…hey, this is just salisbury steak,” but this turned out exceptionally well, that’s why I’m raving about it. This one’s going into my Favorites, definitely a “make-again” recipe."
