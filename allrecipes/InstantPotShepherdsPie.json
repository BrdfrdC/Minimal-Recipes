I was careful to scrape the bottom well before cooking too, but it burned nonetheless. I removed ingredients, washed pot, aded ingredients back in, added a lot more water, and it BURNED a second time."

I did not drain the meat after sauteing, so not sure if that's the problem or not. If that doesn't work, then drain the meat mixture before adding the mashed potatoes. Oh, I also used cream cheese instead of half and half."

And I always at least double the amount of garlic needed because I love garlic. To the potatos I added Queso and Sharp Cheddar, Paprika (gonna try smoked paprika next time), bacon, and omited the cream.\n\nYes,it was very liquidy...but that liquid was DELICIOUS. Next time I will drain that liquid and save as a base for another recipe. Maybe add it to a pot roast or soup for an extra bang?\n\nI also added Slap Ya Mama and a tad bit of hot sauce on my plate of it, holy smokes...yes!"

I did add back approx. 1/2 cup of the liquid to keep it moist but not soupy. Otherwise definitely a keeper and I'll make this again. Thanks"

My potatoes were also on the small side, so the mashed potatoes didn't cover the whole dish, but that is what I had on hand. I topped it off with slices of Clearfield American cheese. I would try it again."

I could care less if it is called cottage pie or shepard’s Pie and could’ve gone the rest of my life without knowing the difference. If that makes me an “idiot” then so be it! Ha ?? All my life I have eaten Shepard’s Pie with different types of veggies and seasonings and even some without veggies all together and I am pretty sure it was always prepared with BEEF!
