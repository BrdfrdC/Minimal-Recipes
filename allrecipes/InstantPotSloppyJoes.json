I did use the advice of others and cut the vinegar in half. I have no idea what \"strained\" crushed tomatoes are so I poured in a whole can. And I did add a good squirt (about 3 Tbs.) of Baby Ray's Honey Barbecue. I made some fresh coleslaw to accompany the meal. Very good."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was VERY good and easy! The only thing I did change was the seasoning a little because it started to taste a little too much like a chili sandwich. I cut back a little on the Chili and also added about a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. It definitely gave it the Sloppy Joe kick it was missing. Also can be made with ground turkey and is delicious and quite a bit healthier!"

I made extra to refrigerate so the kids could warm some up later for a quick lunch during the week while I’m at work. They’ve already gone back for seconds! The only change I made was to reduce the apple cider vinegar by about half because I didn’t want it to be overpowering for them. It still has the tartness, but without being overwhelming for young, picky eaters. Thanks for sharing!"

But it was super easy to prepare and even with a little tweaking didn't take nearly as much time as others!!! My fiance and I didn't eat all of it as I doubled the recipe BUT it gave me a nice base to actually make a nice chilli the next day so I can say it's super versatile and if you tweak it I think it's actually a decent recipe!!"
