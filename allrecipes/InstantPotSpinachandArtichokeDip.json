"reviewBody": "5 Stars because I think the recipe itself is great, classic and simple. However I did have issues with my Instant Pot and I'd really love feedback from anyone who was successful. I'm new to IP so I'm completely accepting that it's user error at this point. I combined all ingredients, stirred a bit and then set to cook on high pressure as instructed. As soon as the IP reached pressure and began the cooking countdown I got the food burn error. I added additional chicken broth, stirred again and reset. Over and over this happened. I ended up heating the dip in the oven and it tasted great but wondering why I didn't see mention of this and if anyone may have a suggestion for next time? \n\nThank you!"

I'd probably do a little less grated parmesan next time and slightly more fresh garlic. I'll definitely make it again for gamedays or at the firehouse."
