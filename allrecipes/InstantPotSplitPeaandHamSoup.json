"reviewBody": "This is one of the best Split Pea Soup recipes I’ve ever tried. It’s simple but uses potatoes which I’ve never used before but I’ve been told they also do in Germany. I received many compliments asking for the recipe so I know it was a definite hit. \nWhen I made it in the pot I left it about 4 hours. I think this made all the difference in breaking down the carbohydrates more fully so they did not causing bloating and gassiness. \nThanks for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "This is a very good basic recipe. Seasonings are excellent, too. I did a second version, adding a pinch of thyme, too. The bay leaf is the flavor key, but don't forget to remove them after cooking. Excellent for college students, too. Holds up well, when freezing, but you will have to add water when using the microwave to reheat, as the so thickens over time."
