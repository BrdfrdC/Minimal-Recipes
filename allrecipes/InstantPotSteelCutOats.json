I like that it is super easy to prepare and possibly slightly faster to make in the Instant Pot. I add cinnamon, butter and 1 or 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. For a creamier result, I use milk instead of water."

"reviewBody": "For me, this is the perfect method for IP steel-cut oats. This is so much easier than stove top, I now make them much more often than I used to. The liquid to oats ratio is the right consistency for me. And the time of 3 minutes is perfect. Other recipes call for 5 min or even up to 15 min! The oats start sticking to the pot after 5 minutes. They might seem a bit watery at first, but they thicken quickly. And you can put your add-ins right in the pot if you'd like. If your IP isn't done releasing pressure after 10 minutes, you can go ahead and release it."

I used 1 cup almond milk and 2 cups water (as the submitter suggested in the cook's notes). I also added chopped apples and cinnamon to top the oatmeal."
