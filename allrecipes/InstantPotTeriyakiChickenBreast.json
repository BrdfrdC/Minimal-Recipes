"reviewBody": "1.19.21 I didn’t have mirin, so I substituted dry sherry in the sauce which worked well. Love that this goes directly from the freezer into the pot, and in a very short amount of time, you have a tasty main course. Great weeknight meal! I wanted a thicker sauce, so I did a cornstarch slurry on low saute on the Instant Pot® for a couple minutes, then put the chicken back in to infuse the teriyaki flavor for a few minutes. Thanks for sharing your recipe, I’d make this again."
