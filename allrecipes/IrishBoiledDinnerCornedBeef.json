I added its spices, a bay leaf, and a tablespoon of beef better than bullion. When I took it off heat I stirred in a handful of minced curly parsley. Made it look beautiful! Served with soda bread and our family mild horseradish sauce. Everyone loved it, even a kindergartener."

Also, at the last step I had to turn the temp from low simmer to medium to get the potatoes and carrots to cook through, otherwise they were still raw after 40 minutes at a simmer for that last step. Cabbage cooked perfectly this way."

I do not like the seasoning packet that comes with the corn beef but agree that some spices are needed. I added 5-6 cloves of garlic and 2 stalks of celery, along with salt and pepper. I read the comments about how the cooking time was too long so after cooking for 4 hours, I removed the meat, covered with tin foil and set aside. I then added the vegetables and boiled for the 30 minutes specified. The meat came out perfectly cooked and melted in our mouths. I like my veggies a little firmer so next time I will only boil for 20 minutes. I like to eat corn beef with mustard, hubby likes horseradish. Hubby also adds butter to the cabbage and potatoes. It was delicious!"

Who has a pot big enough to fit all of this?!"

"reviewBody": "I have been cooking my corned beef this way for 52 yrs. now and it has never failed me. I do add the seasoning packet with the brisket from the start. The only thing I add different from this recipe is I add one tsp. of minced garlic from a jar. If you strain your spices out of the juice in your stew pot after you take all your veggies and meat out the juice makes a wonderfully flavored dip as well as good spooned onto your potatoes. I always boil my regular pot roasts the same way after first searing them in a little bit of oil to seal in the juices and I season it as I'm searing it with salt, pepper, powdered garlic, not garlic salt. Cover with water and boil until the meat is tender then add your carrots and potatoes, cook until tender. I use more whole onions in mine and leave them whole. Then once I take my meat and veggies out I made a gravy with the juices left in the pot."

"reviewBody": "Really delicious but gave 4 stars bc cooking time is too long. In my area it is impossible to find a 5lb corned beef so I got one 2lb and one 3lb one. The 2lb one was done after about 2 hours cooking time (on top of the initial boiling) and the 3lb was done after 2.5 hours cooking time (on top of initial boiling). This is an hour difference from the way it was written. I advise checking after an hour and a half and ever half hour subsequently. The meat should be slice-able but soft-- def not shredded. Also pro top- Corned beef SHRINKS. A lot. When figuring out how much to buy, assume it will shrink by 50%. Yes it's a huge scam-- but a tasty one."

I would like to point out that you may want to rent a backhoe, dig a fire pit, and prepare this in a caudron if you have one handy. I have a smaller kitchen and a standard sized stove, and fitting this all into my largest pot was a challenge."

Blended with the immersion blender and turned it into a tasty cream soup."

"reviewBody": "A great start to good recipe. I messed with it since I've made Corned Beef before. Here's my take:\nAdded 1/2 a bottle of Guinness Stout to the cooking liquid.(from another reviewer)\nWashed the meat (significantly reduces amt. of foam scum to skim)\nAdded spice packet + caraway seeds (1/2 tsp) and thyme (1 tsp, at last 1/2 hour cooking).\nSuggest taste broth before adding veggies. It may need salt. \nI removed the meat from the stock and coated with bread crumbs (another recipe) but found it didn't add anything to the dish. Won't do again.\nSuggestion from mother to add butter &amp; salt &amp; pepper to veggies after they are cooked."

Hubby loved it and had leftovers in his lunch next day. One thing I did differant was take the meat out to remove any fat on it. Then I patted about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar on top of the meat then put it in the oven (350) until the sugar bubbled. That is from my sister's recipe, then I let the meat cool before slicing it."

The package says not to, otherwise you wash away all the seasonings. I think that's why some people have thought it was bland. Somehow the au jus makes the cabbage almost buttery, and too good. 18 month old daughter had thirds on meat, and also ate the cabbage, potatoes and carrots!"

I've read where people put a can of beer in with the water and brisket but I personally don't find that necessary at all. We serve this with a hot mustard recipe from the cookbook 'Applehood and Mother Pie'. It's an amazingly delicious mustard recipe with a good kick to it. Thank you for posting this recipe."
