My aunt made this for me when I was a small child and I have always loved them. I am now ready for my 50th wedding anniversary so I have been making them for a long while. They are really good and gives another way to have potatoes."

Yes, a double shortcut but this was part of a huge meal so needed these quick. My result 3 stars or less. Recipe 3-4 stars. Happy St Patrick's Day!!"

It was good but lacked what latkes bring - the flavor of onion. Still, they were good - I'd do them again. To minimize burning the outside before the inside is done - it should say in the recipe at what temp to fry them at on the stove. Trial &amp; error on my stove showed 3 min each side on medium (or just under)."

It would take us all morning to prepare them and they would be gone in a minute once we set them out. Gotta love those hungry Irishmen. He didn't used mashed potatoes though I don't think, as I was quite small at the time. I do remember him adding grated onions to his though. Simply the best!!! When I make them for my family we serve them with real butter and a dollop of our cream.. and a side of applesauce, added some good bacon or sausage links and called it a meal. The kids always got so excited when they heard we were having Boxty for dinner, one of the few times (lol) I could get them to help peel potatoes. oooohhh I am getting so hungry for them now!! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING!!!"

Unfortunately, the family's recipe has since been lost... just a friendly suggestion if you want to tweak this recipe... you should add about a tsp. of baking soda, at least a tsp. of salt (pepper optional), and quite possibly, depending on your taste, some fresh, chopped green onions or chives. Serve with LOTS of butter! :) Oh, and don't use olive oil for frying... use canola or vegetable oil. Irish food isn't supposed to be slimming! ;) Hope I didn't offend anyone....."

I tried to shortcut by using fresh refrigerated hashbrowns (Simply Potatoes) instead of grating the raw potato myself. Yuck. It turned out slimy, and then I had to dry the boxty out in a 350 degree oven. My family still liked it, but go with the freshly grated potato!"

Quick to make, and adjustments can be made to suit your preferences, like adding spices/seasonings, or grated onion and minced garlic, which I have also done. My husband devours them-never any leftovers. Thanks Brooke!"

I am Ukranian background and these reminded me of potato pancakes, which I love and find the potato pancakes on the lighter side as there is less flour in them than the Boxty; however, I will make the Boxty to have a traditional Irish meal on Saint Patty's Day or if I'm entertaining the Irish:) so I can serve the traditional meal. Thanks for the submission as I enjoy making and trying authentic receipes."

To make these up faster for a brunch, I par-poiled the shredded potatoes for 3 minutes in a big pot of water, then drained well before mixing with the rest of the ingredients. This way, I could cook them for a shorter time at a higher temp, so they were even crispier. You have to dry this recipe for your next brunch!"

Also I used spelt flour, I'm allergic to wheat (came out grand). Fed them to my sister and she said they reminded her of Ireland. We ate them with ketchup, but will definately come up with something a little more creative next time. Thanks!"

He would actually use the rolling pin on the mashed to make potatoe pancakes, just like his Irish mother used to do. For the grated he would just squeeze them together and fry. Very different tastes and textures. Don't tell Dad, but this Irish Canadian likes this recipe the best!"
