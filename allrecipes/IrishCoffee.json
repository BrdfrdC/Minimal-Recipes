I use 1 part Irish whiskey, 1 part Bailey's Irish Cream, and 1 part Kahlua coffee liqueur, strong coffee in a tall slim coffee mug with whipped cream on top with a sprinkle of freshly grated nutmeg. Yummy! Being retired, it's my favorite morning pick me up out of bed. If you don't want it as strong, leave out the whiskey."

And I use Rebecca's Creek Texas whiskey because the strong, smooth flavor works well with the coffee. This drink will warm you to the core on a bitter cold morning and tickle your taste buds as well!"

I did and mine was not too strongly alcohol tasting. I left out the nutmeg, but will probably give that a try next time I make some."

The dash of nutmeg is a must I sipped on it remembered the nutmeg added a dash then decided to write a review. Make sure to use vary hot coffee because one you add the other ingredients it cools down."

I cut the amount of whisky in half, but I could still taste it. I think I just prefer the Irish cream, just to taste, and as a flavoring like one would add flavored coffee cream. The whipped cream and chocolate or nutmeg on top were a nice touch. Next time, I will just do the Irish Cream as I have before. Thank you, anyway."
