Alternatively, the sugar-dusted custards may be browned underneath the broiler in the oven."

It was actually really easy to make, and absolutely delicious. The torched crust was amazing, but I think I enjoyed the creamy, rich custard even more. We could definitely taste the Irish creme and didn't think it got lost in the dish at all. I initially considered adding more but am glad I didn't. \n\n**Note for myself: Due to the terribleness of my oven, I had to do an additional 25 minutes at 325 before the custard set."

Kept the rest of the ingredients as listed, and the cook time was spot on. Tasted delicious. I'd never made creme brulee before; I don't think I melted the sugar quite enough with the blow torch - it did crust, but the crunch with the spoon wasn't quite as satisfying as I'd hoped. Practice makes perfect, will be making this one again for sure."

"reviewBody": "Followed the recipe as written but used home raised Duck Eggs (larger yolks!) and vanilla paste (great flavor due to the vanilla beans).\n\nI must have whisked too much because even though I poured the creme mixture evenly into each of the ramekins, each ramekin had lower and lower levels of creme once baked. I believe the very first pour had mostly whisked foam and as I poured the last, that one had mostly creme mixture.\n\nEven with trying the two most creme-volumned cremes, my husband &amp; I could not finish each of our dishes...they were soooo rich...we could only eat half of each! Possibly because of the duck egg yolks or possibly our pallets are changing for really rich, sweet desserts. But, the other halves went back into the refrigerator for another go at it tonight. I also think the remaining cremes will probably be tough since each has less and less creme in them."

"reviewBody": "I've made creme brulee before but wanted something festive for New Year's dessert. I tasted the custard (before baking) and noted that it tasted so sweet even though I cut the sugar by 1-2 TBSP. The Bailey's Irish cream is so sweet on it's own. I would consider going w/ 1/4 cup sugar (not 1/3) but I like my desserts less sweet generally.\nTo off-set the sweetness, I added about 1/4 tsp salt (the Real Salt brand) and it really balanced the excessive sweetness. It tasted like salted caramel! We'll see how it tastes after we do the brulee...\nOk update! I increased to 5 stars because the taste was perfect so I take back what I say about the 1/4 sugar. I think 1/3 cup is ok (maybe less 1-2 TBSP). This recipe was met with rave reviews and I will be making it again. I hope it becomes a tradition!"

Rather than superfine sugar I used the coarser, demerara sugar. My ramekins were shallow rather than the 6 oz. custard type ramekins and needed just 25 minutes of baking time, so the specified baking time is only approximate!"

"reviewBody": "Had to substitue Kahlua in place of the Irish Cream as I discovered my Irish Cream was no good, but this turned out fantastic. I was a bit leery as the last time I made Creme Brulee was 6-7 yrs ago and I made either vanilla or chocolate and figured a box of pudding was just as good - that recipe also had you melt the sugar on the stovetop then pour/drizzle over the custard - it just wasn't the same crispy topping that you would get than if you used a torch. \nThis recipe was super easy and super tasty - I highly reccomend adding a liquer or some other flavoring of your choice.(Instead of going plain vanilla - but that is my personal prefference) \nThis was a hit with my parents, my husband and I as well as my younger thirteen year old brother and my two kids ages 7 and 4 - a recipe for all ages! Everyone loved it! I was almost hoping one of the kids wouldn't like theirs so I could have more!\nNext time I will try it with Irish Cream, but I can bet it will be great either way!"

In French kitchens a Salamander is used to burn the sugar and is still my preference since I don't like the idea of a \"fuel\" torch close to food. When lining the pan with a towel soak the towel first otherwise you may absorb all the water before the custard sets, putting too much heat on the side of the dish."

This recipe turned out waaaay better than the double boiler recipe. We had some blackberries so we places a few on top to add some color and taste. Good stuff!!!"

What a great recipe. really important to follow the directions, especially when tempering. 3 tablespoons of the hot cream mixture at a time to the egg mixture and wisk at the same time. the creme brulee was so creamy and what an incredible flavor. I made 12 ramekins and our guests went crazy. They were really impressed when I pulled out my torch that I purchased at bed bath and beyond just for this dish. Used raw sugar to make the candy carmelized coating. Thank you for a truly incredible desert."

I'm going to have to start over again and try a different methoid."

"reviewBody": "I made this today and it turned out perfectly. Tricks: Slowly bring the sugar and cream to temperature. It doesn't take long, I think medium heat may be too high. Also, slowly pour the cream mixture with the egg yolks. There will be a considerable amount of foam once all of the cream has been mixed; this is where straining it before it goes in the ramekins is so important. If it is not strained there will be a nasty layer on top. Update: I think I have perfected the recipe. Instead of using 1/3 cup of sugar use 1/2 cup. Also, instead of using vanilla extract using a vanilla bean. Split the vanilla bean in half, scrape out the inside, and place both in the heavy cream. Heat the creme and vanilla in a medium sauce pan. In a mixing bowl combine the egg yolks with the sugar."

"reviewBody": "WOW I have to wholeheartedly say, this is probably the best recipe I've pulled from this site. Hubby and I were at a fancy restaurant the other day and had some superb creme brulee, so of course I wanted to try at home. This is even better. It's a tad time consuming, but not really all that difficult. I heated the cream and sugar to about 140 degrees with no problems. I whisked briskly but tried to not get it frothy. I had no lumps or froth. The hardest part is dealing with the water bath, transferring everything in and out of the oven. Mine made 4 medium and 3 small ramekins. All set up absolutely perfect. Husband had a fun time torching the sugar in the raw we used on the top. Which by the way, tasted great but was probably too course to melt exactly right. Simply unbelievable texture and taste! The irish cream with the creme brulee is divine and melds perfectly. Reviewers aren't joking, the irish cream flavor comes through very well. I might even lower the amount if I make it again. I will definitely make this again the next time I have a craving, or if I truly want to impress someone at a dinner party."
