I don't think so, but remember, you are not cooking the alcohol out so it will be strong. I have found that the longer it sits the more mellow it will get. So if you can stay out of it (I can't??) it won't be as strong -tasting. \nWill be making this with the salted caramel liqueur this year.\nWill definitely enjoy."

"reviewBody": "Full disclosure; I did not make the original recipe as-is. I read through other reviews first and made some adjustments...but it turned out FABULOUS! For the first step, I used a hand mixer right in my double boiler, and mixed the chocolates and butter until it was well mixed and smooth. Next, added the sugar and Bailey's and continued to mix until it was nice and smooth again. I added the nuts, mixing by hand, and then poured into my prepared pan. The pan I used was a 9x12\" and lined with a sheet of aluminum foil leaving several inches hanging out on the ends. It made it amazingly easy to just lift the whole thing out onto a cutting board, once set. Peeled the foil off, then cut. East peasy! For the topping, I used about 2 cups of white chocolate morsels, and about 3/4 cup of semi sweet. So, basically swapping the amounts, and adding a tad bit more to make up for the larger pan. I removed from heat as in the directions, but then also mixed the topping with my hand mixer until nice and smooth. SO YUMMY! This is a keeper!"

I found the flavouring very, strong. I will have to come up with a way to reduce the liquor while maintaining the liquid ratio. I also think that if I was to make this again, I would line the ban with parchment paper. It does make more then a 8x8 pan though. If you can get over the strong flavour the rest of it is quite good."

"reviewBody": "I was hesitant to make this recipe after reading some of the reviews. I'm glad I went ahead and made it. Its very rich and taste like baileys, which I'm ok with. I followed some recommendations, and used the microwave instead of the double boiler. I heated in small increments, and added about 1/3 of baileys towards the last heating, then the rest once warmed/melted through. I also warmed the baileys slightly (like 10-15 seconds) before adding it to the chocolate. I did not use foil, I buttered an 11x13 pan. I let it set for about 30 mins, brought it out to cut, left it in the pan and let set for another couple of hours in fridge. I did not cover with plastic to get it smooth, I used a plastic scraper instead and it worked well, and made it shiny.\n\nIt is not your typical fudge process/recipe, hence the truffle in the name. It tastes and has a smooth texture like I would expect in a truffle. No one has tried it yet, but if I get some bad feedback from my taste testers, I will update..."

"reviewBody": "I read quite a few reviews first. I used a 11x13 pan (foiled-lined, a must!) This made a lot of candy! I thought it was the right thickness, as well (about a 110 1-inch squares!) I used the microwave method for melting chocolate and it worked perfectly. I used good quality Irish Cream and did not think it was too strong (my husband heartily agreed!). The only difficulty I had was in spreading the top layer - using the larger pan, the top layer was a little thinner than I would have liked and as it began cooling it became harder to spread. Otherwise, we loved this fudge and will definitely make it again!"

I love the way Irish cream and chocolate work together.\n\nMy only suggestion is to make this in a 9\"x13\" pan (you may want to make a little extra \"icing\" to get a good thick layer). Otherwise, the fudge pieces are really really thick and are difficult to cut."

"reviewBody": "Awesome recipe! Followed recipe for bottom layer but for top layer used 1/2 cup each semisweet, milk, and white chocolate. Used whole amount of Irish Cream stated in recipe. It does taste a little strong at first but mellows out by next day. I also used my hand mixer on the bottom layer when adding powdered sugar and vanilla and beat until very creamy. this was much quicker and easier than stirring and also made the fudge much creamier. I used the hand mixer on top layer also and used a rubber spatula to smooth top layer on and it turned out beautiful. Put in refrig for 10 minutes then sliced into bite sized pieces and returned pan to refrig for another couple hours. If you do this you should not have trouble cutting the fudge when hard. I also used a 9 x 9 pan which worked perfectly."

"reviewBody": "I love this fudge! It's isn't like a sickeningly sweet frosting (thank goodness) Mine turned out with the bottom being melt in your mouth delicious, smooth but not what I would call creamy and definitely not crumbly with a very small hint of the Bailey's (left out the nuts) and the other layer turned out a bit semi-hard because I added in extra butter when I saw my mixture not melting the way I expected. So instead of a ganache type topping I got a thin layer of a semi-hard topping with a strong kick of Bailey's! I found I loved the difference in the texture of the layers and the taste of the Bailey's is not overpowering at all. I left my fudge to sit for 2 days in an airtight container in the fridge before eating so I think it got enough time to mellow out the alcohol taste and marry all the different ingredients together. On that note, this fudge does have a bit of a sweet after-kick to it but nothing too extreme. It just keeps calling me back for more. It is wonderful! Thanks for sharing your recipe."

"reviewBody": "Made this recipe as is for my fiance's parents' annual St. Patty's Day Party. This recipe made a TON of fudge and it was wonderful - creamy and smooth, but did it ever pack a punch with all the liqueur! You took your first bite and when you inhaled you could feel the fumes! Most of the people at the party (grown-ups) liked it, but several people couldn't eat a whole piece because it was too strong, and it is DEFINITELY not for sharing with the little ones. Next time, I will try using maybe 1/2 cup of Irish cream and 1/2 cup of regular cream to make the flavor a little more gentle. I don't want to mess with the consistency, because that was just perfect, but it may need to be toned down just a little..."

I'm sorry, I wish I could give this a better review, I just think it needs some work."

Perhaps 1.5 the top layer ingredients and you'll be fine."

"reviewBody": "I have made this recipe every christmas for the last 3 years. While I love the taste of it I find it very difficult to stir. When I put the semi-sweet morsels,white morsels and the butter together it gets like a brick. I need to have my husband stir it. The first time I made it I threw it out because I thought it had seized up on the double boiler from some water getting in it. I redid the recipe and it did the same thing so I just had my husband stir it and we continued on. I have tried with the double boiler and with melting them in the microwave and it doesn't matter it still is hard. I've read this sites comments but I don't see anyone else complaining about this. Does anyone have any idea of why this is happening or does this happen to everyone? Any Ideals to help this problem? I also just finished making it for this year and I had difficulty incorporating the butter in the top layer it had a lot of melted butter that I had to soak up- it seemed to separate. Any ideals on why this happened? Thanks for your help in advance. I do like this for the holidays and would like for this to be easier. Everyone have a Happy and safe holiday!"

"reviewBody": "My husband and I REALLY enjoyed this recipe. I was doubtful at first making this treat for a holiday cookie exchange after I read some of the reviews. We made it and found it to be very creamy and not too strong on the irish cream. Both layers of this fudge were easy to spread in the pan. The only drawback we found was that it needs to be kept chilled or it gets soft quickly at room temperature. We used a 9x12 pan and it was a perfect thickness. I also took the advice of another reviewer and lined the baking dish with aluminum foil. How easy it was to get out and cut!!! Also, since I have a small double boiler, after I melted the chips and butter, I put the mixture into a saucepan on low heat to add the confectioner sugar and irish cream to mix. It was much easier and creamier. Instead of using just semi-sweet chips, I used half semi-sweet chips and half milk chocolate chips. It mellowed the bitterness. The last change I made was using 3/4 cup irish cream and a 1/4 cup heavy cream instead of the full cup of irish cream. This recipe has already made it into my holiday repetoire for years to come!!! A must have fudge recipe. Friends and family have already eaten all of the extras!!!"

I substituted 3 cups of white chips for the semi-sweet on the first layer (so it was 4 cups of white on the first layer) and did the opposite on the 2nd layer (so that it was 1 1/2 cups of semisweet chips). 2nd layer wasn't spreadable, but that was probably my fault because I switched the type of chips. Taste was delicious nonetheless. Could've just made the top layer and it would've been enough even in an 9x18 pan for straight Irish Cream fudge."
