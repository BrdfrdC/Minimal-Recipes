The only other minor changes I made were, I added 1 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/4 tsp pepper and only crumbled 10 strips of bacon into the cabbage. Next time I make this, and there will be a next time, I will stick to the 1/4 cup of drippings."

"reviewBody": "I've been making this for years..I shred the cabbage instead of chopping it cooks more evenly.\nBIG TIP: you can also use pre-shredded cabbage from the grocery store, which makes it fast and easy.\nI add whatever I have avail. onion red or yellow, celery chopped finely.\nI also have prefried bacon in my freezer which is very convenient. And I keep the bacon grease in the refrigerator for seasoning other dishes. \nMy husband loves this dish. And even if you don't like cabbage, you may want to try this, it just might change your mind on cabbage."

I half them, steam them for a short time then throw them in the skillet. My future daughter in law says, \"I now like brussel sprouts!\""
