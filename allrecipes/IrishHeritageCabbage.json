It was a new, and welcome, taste for us. We will be cooking this often and experimenting with little tweaks to the recipe (which seems almost perfect as it is). By the way, Irish bacon is very close to Canadian bacon, very lean."

"reviewBody": "Boiled cabbage can be boring, but this dish, with the broiled top at the end, was tasty and perfect as a side dish. I made it low fat by omitting the butter and bacon, and just added some extra virgin olive oil to the cabbage after draining it. I also eyeballed the nutmeg, just a few sprinkles here and there and then stirring it in, with sea salt and pepper. I served it with corned beef and potato champs for a St. Pattyâ€™s Day dinner. But my son didnâ€™t like the nutmeg flavor, though the rest of my family loved it. So next time I think Iâ€™ll just leave his side unnutmegged."

I tried it both with and without the vinegar. The vinegar stays by unanimous consensus. I liked it so much I created an account on here so I could write my first review! Thanks ChristinaBunny for the idea of adding garlic to the butter. I did that just before melting and I really like the results. Thank you Joelsgirl!"

"reviewBody": "This was excellent! I was making the recipe from the UK Allrecipes site, and noticed it was on here to. Please note: I did change it up, to taste, a bit. I made 1/2 recipe, as I only needed 2 servings. I cooked some Smithfield thick cut bacon, in the microwave, in a covered bacon cooker. That was very easy to do. I halved the recipe but kept the water and bacon the same. I left out the nutmeg because I do not like it. I didn't notice the vinegar, in the recipe, but it was good without it. I liked cutting the cabbage into wedges instead of shredding it, like most other recipes with cabbage. I boiled the cabbage at about 8 and then simmered it at 3 for the 15 minutes. I did not see a reason to broil the cabbage and possibly burn it at the end. Sorry, for all of the changes, but it was really good anyway."

I made this easy recipie for St. Pattys day with a couple small modifications: I added an eighth of a teaspoon of garlic to the melted butter and I used diced Turkey Ham instead of bacon. It was delicious! Everyone enjoyed it and I liked it so much that I am saving the recipie to incorporate into our regular diet and to modify for future dishes (going to see if the same recipie works well with brussle sprouts...could be fun!)"

I am Irish (born there) so am missing cabbage and had to try this on today St. Patricks Day ;) I altered the recipe some by just shredding the cabbage and boiling it. I fried oh maybe 6 slices of American bacon and totally trimmed the fat, added some slivers of yellow onion fried crisply and tossed these both on the drained cabbage. I added salt and pepper (NO vinegar) and some melted IRISH butter (Kerry gold) and then broiled as recommended. It was absolutely delicious! I served with roast chciken and yellow rice! Definitely will make agaiN!"
