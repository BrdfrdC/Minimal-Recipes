So I put the raisins in a microwavable glass bowl, added the Jack Daniels. covered and let it go for two minutes. Then let it sit covered for 15 minutes. I tried the Whisky Butter, but didnt care for it."

"reviewBody": "This bread seems more moist than your standard Irish bread. I hope that it keeps that way for a while, too. I baked it in a 9\" round pan, sprayed with cooking spray, and it just slipped right out with no problem. I like the additional sweetness and it doesn't include eggs. I used the dry buttermilk, and it worked great here. My oven runs warm, so I checked it at 40 min, and it was already done (probably would have to toss it I went by the time specified). The butter compliments the bread nicely. I ended up using the full amount of whiskey in it; every time I added a tsp, I didn't notice much difference. Happy St Patrick's Day!"

Today I'll make again and use Baker's Joy. That should take care of the sticking problem. I plumped the raisins with bourbon in the microwave...didn't plan ahead to plump them overnight. Used low setting. Yummmm."
