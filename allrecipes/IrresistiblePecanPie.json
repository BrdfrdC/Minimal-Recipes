The filling balanced well with the 2 1/2 cups of pecans. The filling often times can be way too sweet. After a good sized meal over powering sweetness can distract from the dessert. This will now be my go to Pecan Pie! Up date, I just read a few of the reviews. Vanilla was mentioned a lot. I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla to my pie because I felt like a little bit of vanilla never hurts anything!"

I froze one of the pies and it reheated just as well as when it was fresh. I simply baked it at 350 for 20-30 mins until the center was warm. Great recipe, thanks! :)\n\nOh I forgot to mention I lied... I guess I did change the recipe. I did honey instead of dark corn syrup and I instead of light corn syrup I just dissolved sugar into hot water. I doubt it changed the taste, but I felt better about it!"

I added 1/2 tsp vanilla since my old recipe called for it.

I'm so glad I did!) This is my new go-to pecan pie recipe. Thank you so much!"

I also skipped the step where you add 1 cup of quarter-pecans to the bottom of the crust and put only as many pecans on top as I wanted (which probably turned out to be a cup, anyway) so that I did not have too many pecans. Lastly, I pulled out the pie after 30 minutes and covered it with aluminum foil (if I hadn't, I think that it may have burned). I have not tried it as it is the pie is not for me, but my family keeps complimenting it and saying that it looks good. I think it looks good as well. This pie recipe may be good yet!!! :)"
