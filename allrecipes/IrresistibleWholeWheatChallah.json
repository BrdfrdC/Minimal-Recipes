"reviewBody": "The dough was so wet that I could not braid it. I couldn't shape it into a loaf. It was like batter. Extra kneading time did not help. I ended up pouring the \"dough\" into a bread pan and baking it. After 30 minutes, my thermometer read 90F in the center of the dough. Baking it for an extra 20 minutes finally brought the temp up to 190F. Now it's very rich sandwich bread, not challah. Don't trust the recipe as it's written. Don't trust my adjustments either, because I was in \"rescue the ingredients\" brain, not recipe writer brain."

I often cut the recipe in half and use my 1 lb whole wheat cycle on my bread machine."

"reviewBody": "As others have said, I followed the directions exactly and the dough did not rise. I suspect the problem is that the recipe does not call for an initial step of \"activating\" the yeast by letting it sit in warm water (ideally with some honey mixed in) until it starts to bubble, before combining it with the other ingredients. I will not be making this recipe again, but I suspect that if you added that initial step, and followed the other directions, it would probably work."

The texture is so smooth silky, light &amp; stretchy in the good way.I first used this recipe a few years back, and have been making it ever since. I share with friends, and no one believes that it is all ww. Other bakers will insist that It has to be at least half white flour. I don't know what makes it work - I really don't. I've deviated from recipe from time to time - never made it better. Made it worse a time or two. The gluten helps, but it's too not much less without it. Seriously, if anyone shies away from 100%ww because of texture, lightness, etc.. You jhave to try this."

"reviewBody": "I have never left a review for any recipe, anywhere until now (I registered just to do this). In short, this is absolutely amazing. Clearly the failures leading to bad reviews came from baker-error, or bad yeast &amp; not from a faulty recipe. \n I was especially blown away by the texture - so light &amp; silky smooth; elastic, but not chewy. It is so unlike any 100% whole wheat bread I've ever made (or eaten, for that matter). The whole family loved it, more than any wheat bread I've ever baked, and it was gone in very short time. \n I halved the recipe, but otherwise, followed all of the proportions, as written. I used gluten, but did not add raisins. The only changes were in the process, like proofing the yeast first, and order of adding ingredients, etc. These came more from my own dough-making rituals than any belief that I had a better way. I doubt they made my results any better or worse. I made it a round 4-strand Challah. It really looked great, and the way the pieces pulled away from the loaf was indescribably satisfying.\n Now that I know this basic recipe works, there are SO many ways I want to go with it. I'm thinking apples, raisins, cinnamon... I'd like to try it with maybe half oat flour, too. I think it would go well with the honey sweetness. This was SO unexpectedly great. Highly recommended."

I had to add at least 1/2 extra cup of flour so I could work with it without it sticking to my hands like glue. Didn't rise at all. I let it sit for over two hours. I gave up and braided it as is and threw it in the oven. The amount made only one loaf because it failed to rise at all. Baked it in the oven for specified time and the outside was a nice golden brown color so I took it out. After it cooled, sliced it open to find the middle was still uncooked inside. Very dense and heavy. It was sweet and the family thought it was good but I ran into so many issues I won't be making this again."

I looked at some of the pictures and suspect that it did not rise for more people than I, though they did not rate it lower because this is what they had expected. Mine was unbearably dense and not even sweet. Maybe the excessive olive oil played a role? I did delay making the dough, had it in a very warm place and then had to delay so kept it in the fridge overnight, but at no time did it seem to rise much."

Fabulous taste rose beautifully with amazing oven spring. I would note because I was short on time both times I only did a single raise (made the dough and formed immediately then baked - if it hurt the results I wouldn't be able to tell). Second time I did put in 1/2 c of raisins (next time I think I'll up it to 2/3 cup) and rolled the strands in a light covering of cinnamon sugar. But truly the original stands on its own and needs no adjustments."

All others were such heavy and dry failures I had started to think that maybe it wasn't meant to be. I tried to stick to the recipe as much as possible. In the end, the only two changes were to activate the yeast in warm water and a bit of honey first and then kneading in a bit more flour to help the dough be less sticky/wet and more sticky/tacky. This tastes like the nice brand of honey whole wheat bread that you buy at the grocery store. I didn't know it was possible to make such a light, soft, chewy bread yourself. I plan to use it as a sandwhich bread for the kids and also for French toast. Although to me this resembles a whole wheat sandwich bread more than a traditional challah in taste and texture, it is undeniably delicious."

"reviewBody": "(NOTE: make sure your water is hot enough to proof the yeast, a temperature of ~120 for the water should be added to the recipe). Otherwise, this recipe was surprisingly easy, and it's whole wheat flour! The kneading was the hardest part (and was very very easy to knead, compared to all of the other breads I've made before). The bread was beautiful when it came out of the oven, and was chewy and delicious. We made french toast with it the next day and it was delicious in that too."

I haven't made it with raisins or the vital wheat gluten. Everyone who has tried it loves it! It doesn't last long in my house."

"reviewBody": "Amazing. :) This is the BEST whole wheat bread I've ever tasted. Most WW bread is dense and dry, but this tastes like Nature's Own Whole Wheat bread. Only 5x better. I use the dough and then the bake setting on our bread maker, and the loaf rises so much that is pushes the top off. :) It is delicious, and stays moist for 4-5 day. I use it to make my sandwiches, and it tastes delicious microwaved with a little bit of honey drizzled on top. DELISH!"

"reviewBody": "We tried many different challah recipes trying to get something close to a whole wheat version of Cheryl Ann's challah in Boston. Everything else was too dry, but this is very moist. I double the recipe and make 4 loaves at a time and freeze what I don't use. I do all the mixing and kneading in my kitchen aid mixer. \r\n\r\nI have made a few minor changes from a direct doubling of ingredients. I use 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon salt, and 5 eggs instead of 4. I also proof the yeast in 1 cup warm water in a 2 cup measuring cup until it's bubbling near the top and add it as a liquid ingredient. I use the wheat gluten even though it's listed as optional, but not the raisins. I cut the total water to 1.5 cups instead of 2. I also typically need more rise time than the recipe calls for and gt a better result if I can make the time to lunch down the dough and give it a second rise before I braid it. Overall this recipe is a winner even among people who don't usually eat whole wheat. For the Cheryl Ann's fans out there, this is less sweat than Cheryl Ann's but just as moist."

I put it at 375, which works best for my oven, for about 35-40 minutes, and they both came out perfect. This isn't really a heavy wheat bread even though it's all ww. I used the vital wheat gluten so I wouldn't have to wait for it to rise for 2 hours, and made the dough itself in the breadmaker, then went from there. Very nice--thanks for the recipe!"

Everyone went CRAZY when they tasted this! It is super good, moist, very flavorful, with a nice chewiness to it. They asked me to make it again, and often!! I make challah for my husband (and me) every week, and he told me I could switch to this one! I did use the wheat gluten, and I didn't use raisins, since I knew there would be people this morning who don't like raisins. I will make it next Friday for our home challah WITH raisins, since my husband loves them. Thanks so much for this!!!"

Finally, I decided to look for a regular whole wheat challah recipe and make the dough in my bread machine -- I tried this recipe, and it turned out great! I substituted agave for the honey and left out the wheat gluten and raisins. The bottoms of my loaves ended up a little dark; I might reduce the baking time a little. I know I will make this over and over again."

It also didn't rise out of the oven much, and took longer than 30 mins in the oven but it came out to be lighter and sweeter than most whole wheat breads! Thank you! UPDATE: If you first proof yeast with water and then add it when you mix both dry and wet ingredients, It rises much more..... I make this every week for shabbat dinner and have gotten many many requests for the recipe!"
