I got the recipe from a lady I worked with- she found it in a magazine. The only differences are that in our version, you don't drain the mandarin oranges and you also add 1 cup shredded coconut to the batter. It's been my husband's birthday cake for decades. The cake icing in the recipe is 8 ounces of softened cream cheese, 2 TBSP melted butter, 3 cups 10X sugar, 1 tsp vanilla. Mix then beat until smooth."

Anyway my family and I don’t dig the nuts and coconut that traditionally goes in carrot cake like another used said. This cake is amazing and so moist. I made my own frosting by using about half to 3/4 of canned frosting (cream cheese flavor) and then adding a whole block of room temp Philadelphia cheese. I added some lemon juice and some grated lemon zest and orange zest until I got the taste I was looking for. I’m not good with measurements so I just taste until I like. Spread on top and enjoy! Also kept in fridge due to cream cheese. We heated a piece up in the microwave for 20-30 seconds when we wanted one and oh my gosh!!!!"

"reviewBody": "Amazing! I made no revisions to this recipe and my hubby says it may just be the best cake he's ever had. And that's saying a lot because his mom can BAKE!! \n\nA note - I drained the mandarin oranges and sliced them up into smaller pieces before mixing into the batter. Don't feel like you have to get fresh mandarins - the canned ones were excellent (and you can't really even tell they're in there anyway)"

"reviewBody": "Amazing! I made the cake as cupcakes but otherwise followed the directions and they turned out perfectly. My family dislikes the coconut and nuts most carrot cake recipes call for so I was pleased to find this one without those ingredients. It was a huge hit and is definitely a recipe that will be made again!"

"reviewBody": "I just started cooking/baking things and have so far enjoyed it. I made this last night for my mom's birthday since she loves carrot/spice cakes and she freaking loved it! It was so light yet moist and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and used some store bought cream cheese icing and chopped pecans as a topping, which gave it a nice crunch. I'm thinking the next time I make it, I'll substitute raisins for the carrots after using the mixer to see how that tastes and actually make the cream cheese icing. Thank you for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "Kali, your cake is phenomenal! My family loved it! It is not your typical heavy carrot cake and it has a fine and light crumb texture. I love the mandarin oranges and orange zest! My husband didn't know there were mandarin oranges in the cake, but what a way to make a moist cake. Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful cake! I didn't have canned mandarin oranges so I used 3 small fruit cups in 100% juice which are 4 oz. each from Dole. I drained the oranges. I also live at high altitude, 5062 feet. So, I had to adjust the baking soda to 1 and 1/4 tsp."

"reviewBody": "Very moist, very good even though a bit too sweet for me! Great idea substituting pineapple with mandarin oranges. Recipe calls for 11 oz canned oranges. Stores in my area sell only 15 oz cans. Was hard to know how to measure 11 oz, so I added all 15 oz to recipe. Used rest of ingredients as called for, except I substituted vegetable oil with organic coconut oil. Could be the extra 4 oz of mandarins with combo of 2 cups of sugar made it too sweet for my taste. When making next batch, I'll reduce sugar or lesser oranges. Prep time was more than 15 minutes. Took 45 minutes between measuring, shredding carrots, and beating mixture. Baked 45 minutes. Cake's been refrigerated for three days; still a bit sweeter for me. After microwaving a piece, I spread soft butter on it and enjoyed it. Thanks for submitting your recipe.o"
