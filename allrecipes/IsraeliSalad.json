I mixed yellow mustard with red wine vinegar (no white wine vinegar available) and a pinch of sugar. Otherwise I followed the recipe and my guests and I were delighted! \nI made the quiche ahead, chilled it, and reheated it covered in foil at 350° for 16 minutes. It was only lukewarm throughout. The Surimi, Spinach, &amp; Red Pepper quiche that I reheated along with this Rosemary Sweet Potato quiche was piping hot. I served the two quiches with Israeli Salad.\nAll recipes are here on All Recipes."

My olive oil was garlic-infused, but to make sure, I sprinkled a little garlic powder in. I also used sea salt and fresh cracked pepper. I had fresh parsley on hand from a plant that I recently purchased, so that made a little difference. I enjoyed this (scaled down the recipe) with seared scallops and a chilled white wine. Perfect meal on a hot summer night!"

Ingredients of the salad has tomatoes, cucumbers, multicolored peppers, radishes, green or Vidalia onions, green olives and anything you can think to add. Add salt and black pepper. Parsley. Mix it with olive oil and freshly squeezed lemon. The veggies are cut into very small cubes. Similar to salsa. This is served with all meals am and evening, except big meals that are served between 12-3pm.\nI have never seen garlic used with this type of salad. At the cooked meals lettuce wth some vegetable and than garlic is sometime used."

I could do that as had previously made half recipe of dressing so made another half and put in half of all ingredients including salt and pepper. truly AWSOME I did add some dried parsley to dressing. I did not add dressing until needed as am using over 4 days and did not want to wilt before use."

Don't make ahead though, I made the huge mistake of making this the night before and the dressing leached all the liquid out of the tomatoes and cucumbers and it was like soup. When it was fresh it was fabulous. If you want to do anything ahead of time, just keep the dressing separate and dress at the last minute. I should have known this, but I wasn't thinking. Definitely keep the mint, it gives a little something, you can't even tell it's mint, it just tastes herbal and good."

The last few years I started adding in about a cup (2-3) mangoes, small-diced, and substituting the mint with cilantro. I like it this way even better as the sweetness of the mango goes perfectly with the acid of the lemon and astringent feature of the cucumbers. And I always make it the day before and then adjust seasoning a few hours before serving if needed."

I now omit the red pepper and use garlic salt instead of plain table salt due to personal preference. Very addictive and cooling when its hot outside. \nIt makes a huge batch. I re-figured the calorie count and it is more like 55 calories per cup. Can't beat that for swimsuit weather!!"

"reviewBody": "i visited Israel in June and nearly every meal came with this type of salad, even breakfast! even so, i have made this many times and usually emulsify the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt &amp; pepper and then drizzle that over the mixed veggies. blending it helps intensify the flavor IMHO. a tip i learned in Israel is to grate the lemon peel of the lemon used. again, the flavor is just kicked up a notch. nice if you like lemon as I do. (7/11)\n--so i made this and immediately ate a big bowl with a panzella cracker. just super fresh, clean flavors, delicious. i used persian cukes &amp; followed recipe exactly. while licking the bowl it occured to me that chick peas and some feta would make it spectacular. and that second bowl was indeed. (oh yeah, fresh tomato was the only item i didn't have. i did have a can of muir glen diced toms but decided to wait until i put everything else together. honestly, i thot it was perfect w/o them. i only drizzled olive oil as well.)"

WAY too much olive oil. I would at least halve it and drizzle slowly till you get the consistency you want. Too much salt for my liking too so I will play with that. Nice and refreshing and will definately make again though!! Served in a pita pocket with some cream cheese."
