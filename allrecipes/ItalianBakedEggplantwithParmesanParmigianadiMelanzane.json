"reviewBody": "My first try was a dud, because of what happened in the frying phase. It took about 6 batches to get the slices all fried. I did not change the cooking oil between batches. (Maybe that was my mistake.) By the later batches, the oil was full of black, burned flour that had fallen off while frying the earlier batches, and apparently the last batches soaked up a lot of this soot. So the eggplants tasted more like burned toast than like eggplants. I'm considering, next time, (a) oil-coating and baking the eggplants as some commenters have suggested, or (b) frying the eggplants per the recipe but without the flour coating, or (c) breading and deep-frying them all at once in a deep fryer (like they cook fries at McDonald's) so the burnt flour would not have a chance to pollute the later batches. Anybody got predictions about how (b) and (c) might turn out, to spare me some trial-and-error? Thanks in advance."
