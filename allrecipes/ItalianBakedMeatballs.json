I also had italian seasoning but didn't think it would make enough flavor on it's own without using the entire jar. So I also included a packet of Italian Dressing. Other than that I did what the receipe said. They came out a little crisp on the outside, but tender inside. I am still baking the rest of the batch. Can't wait to have it with pasta this week after the flavors get through."

If you simmer on low in sauce it will cook them a bit, but I want them fully cooked before adding to sauce."

Use milk instead of water, and soak the bread crumbs for about ten-fifteen minutes, then forum your meatballs, which should be baked, then cooked in tomato sauce, better know as ragu, or Sunday gravy (or sauce), for at least five-seven hours. Then, you have real Italian meatballs."

I substituted a half pound of mild Italian sausage for a half pound of the ground beef for a little more flavor. I also put them into a pot of warm (not simmering so as not to overcook them) marinara sauce for about a half hour while preparing the rest of the meal. Our guests all thought that they were the most authentic tasting meatballs they've ever had. Will definitely be making these for all of our pasta nights."

I used a little dried Italian seasoning in place of the fresh parsley because I didn't have any, and I substituted milk for the water. I used a technique learned elsewhere to add the milk to the breadcrumbs first and let them soak a minute then add the rest of the ingredients."

I love that they bake in the oven for 30 minutes - time to prepare everything else while they cook.\n\nI think these could easily be adapted to be Swedish meatballs, with a change to the seasonings."

The only substitution was 1/2 a minced onion in place of the onion salt. The texture was good, and the meatballs kept their shape without falling apart as usually happens with homemade veggie meatballs."

The Italian bread crumbs and spices add a nice flavor, plus I splurged on fresh Romano, yum. Bonus for us is no \"icky bits\"--i.e., little pieces of onion or pepper that my son's persnickety palate rejects. We didn't even add sauce or manage to get them onto rolls for sandwiches, just ate them straight from the oven. 10/10 will make again!"

I did use my own homemade Italian bread crumbs, and in the future, I think I'd use freshly minced garlic over garlic powder. I got 17 meatballs out of this (they were about 1 1/2\" in size). I also didn't use the full 1/2 cup of water, because I think it would've been too wet with that amount. I'm not even sure it would be necessary to add in extra water at all. All-in-all though, great meatballs! Thank you!"
