Used vegetable oil to brown at higher temp in cast pan. Leave the garlic in the pan and 400 degrees for 18 minutes in oven. Crusty outside, tender and juicy inside. Served with grilled brussels sprouts, truffle potato smash and Barbera d'Asti wine. Sorry no pics. Pure carnage from wife feral hungry teens."

I had to put them back in the stove to get a little crisp but couldn‚Äôt do too long with risk of burning. Next time I‚Äôll put on a rack on a baking tray. Maybe that will be the trick."

They were tasty but the breading wasn't crunchy enough for me.\nThe second time I made them I switched out parmesan for Parmesano reggiano and double dipped (dipped in egg wash then breading then back in egg was and back in breading again) for a thicker crust. Then I pan fried and finished off in my air-fryer toaster oven for a crispier crunchier crust. VERY GOOD!"

The chops stayed very moist, but kinda tough, like they were over cooked. I would say cut the sear time by half and take at least 5 minutes off the oven time. I doubt I would even try my own suggestion here as I doubt I would ever want to make this again."

The flour helps the egg/milk adhere better to whatever you are coating and thus heps the breadcrumbs adhere better. Give it a try with batter fried chicken or fish, schnitzel recipes, etc."

"reviewBody": "This has a really good flavor. Mine didn't turn out like the picture shows so I will try it again. I agree with the other reviewers that said 3 eggs and 1 cup of breadcrumbs is waaaay too much. Though I only cooked 3 pork chops, I used 1 egg and 1/2 cup breadcrumbs and still had some of each left over. The chops turned out crunchy on the outside but I found the crust came off as soon as I served them. Not sure what I did to make that happen."

"reviewBody": "I made these pork chops last night and my hubby and I devoured them. And my husband does not care for pork chops but he loved these. I used thick-cut boneless chops. I did not change anything in the recipe, with the exception of, I didn't have italian breadcrumbs, so I used plain and added a generous amount of italian seasoning. I also used a bit of panko crumbs, but overall, I used 1 1/2 cups of breadcrumbs. I ended up throwing a lot of the breadcrumbs out. I think 1 1/2 cups was too much. The next time I make this, I will cut down on some of the waste by using only 2 eggs, 2 TBS milk, 3/4 cup breadcrumbs and 1/4 cup parmasean. I'll cut back a bit on the parsley also. I think that will be more than enough to cover 4 porkchops. I will definately be making this again. And it was so easy!"

"reviewBody": "This was absolutely DELICIOUS - crispy and savory outside and tender and juicy inside. My family flipped over it and my hubs said he wanted chops fixed no other way from now on - WOW!\nI did have to make a few changes due to a lack of the called for ingredients: made my own bread crumbs from leftover stuffing crusts from the bakery. Used 1 tbsp Italian Seasoning, 2 tsp fennel seed, 2 tsp garlic salt to make the seasoned bread crumbs. I do like the fennel taste in there, by the way.\nAs I was using cheap chops, I used 1 tbsp. instant meat tenderizer and also rubbed them with the extra seasoning I mixed up. The rest was identical to the recipe. It was easy and so, so good - I'll make this again and again! \nBy the way, I served it with buttered rutabaga seasoned with ground nutmeg, green beans with canned whole tomatoes in Italian dressing. Everyone cleaned their plates.\nThanks for sharing your family's recipe!"

I'll do it again. \n- I used panko instead or regular crumbs with no issue.\n- I did 5 chops, so had to do 3 loads of the fry pan, then transferred to a cookie sheet for the baking. Be sure to re-oil your pan between sets of chops!\nThe poor man's shortcut to the garlic process is to just sprinkle garlic powder in the oil as it heats. Used the leavings to make a gravy."

I only had 2 bone-in chops, so I halved the majority of the recipe. I used Italian flavored panko bread crumbs and added both grated and shredded Parmesan cheese. I also added a little bit of Italian Seasoning and garlic salt. I accidentally cooked the chops a little less than the 5 mins on each side and only removed some of the garlic from the pan (I used pre-minced), but I added 5 minutes to the bake time. They were crispy, moist, and juicy...and SO EASY! This one is a winner."
