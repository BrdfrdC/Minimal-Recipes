I didn't have vermouth, so I used chicken broth as someone recommended and I added a good sprinkle of dried parsley on top before stirring. Everyone loved it (4 adults &amp; 5 teens). Oh! and one of our guests is a bacon-aholic, so I used 2 - 12 oz pkgs of bacon. It was the perfect saltiness."

I used elbow pasta, no vermouth, no cream, and no pepper. I only had the precooked bacon so the onions were sauteed in butter. It still came together into a great dish! I halved the recipe since it was for lunch and my 17 yo ate it all!"

I used a pound of regular cut smoked bacon, Angel hair pasta, cooking sherry instead of vermouth and added about 1/4 cup pasta water to make it a little creamier. Sometimes I work with what I have on hand, which is why I made these changes. I don’t know what it would have tasted like as the recipe stated but it was amazing with my tweaks!"

I think the comments around seasoning in other review are valid, but this recipe is so easy to make your own since it is all put together at the end. Use a good cheese, and use it a lot!"

Then, as soon as the pasta is done, you can stir everything together in a flash. I did add about a cup of defrosted frozen peas -- I can't help myself adding veggies whenever possible -- but they were a very nice addition. Sauteed mushrooms would also be terrific in this dish. Definitely a keeper!"
