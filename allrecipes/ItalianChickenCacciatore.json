"reviewBody": "My family really liked this recipe. We did tweak it just a little. Used kalamata olives. Also used red wine. Used bone in chicken thighs and legs. After getting everything into the pot, we put it in the oven on 250 for about 4 hours - only because my older son was going somewhere and we wanted it for later. The chicken was very tender and not dry. The smell when we lifted the lid was awesome! My younger son says this is what he wants for spaghetti sauce now! Really balanced and full of flavor! We will make this again."

Followed exactly except I used half black olives, half kalmata olives and had to use dried parsley/basil (no fresh available), which I added all four the last 5 min of cooking and did so uncovered. Every bite was better than the last! Definitely will make again and again! Served with side of pasta. Thank you for sharing!"

I used 1/8 cup capers as a substitute for black olives. My husband rated this recipe \"I wouldn't mind having this once a week\" on the \"\"ick\" to \"I could eat this everyday scale\"\". We both agree that I should make this again and try adding a splash of heavy cream."
