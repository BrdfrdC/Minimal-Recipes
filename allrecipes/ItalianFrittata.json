I subbed egg beaters for the eggs, which worked perfectly. Baked this in an 11x7 baking dish for 25 minutes in my oven and it came out so puffed and beautiful! Such a great combo of flavors too! I wouldn't add the salt until you are at the table because youay not need it depending on how salty your salami is. This made a wonderful dinner along with some bacon and a toasted English muffin!??"

Sauteed everything first, then put into the bottom of a glass pie dish. Used five eggs vs the four that the servings size change called for. Cheddar cheese and parm cheese on top. Exactly 20 mins in the oven. Very, Very Good! Dinner plus leftovers for breakfast the next day. I think this would be great to make, cut up into individual servings and freeze for quick microwaveable breakfast on the go!"

I made 2 changes. I used diced ham and Colby Jack cheese. My eggs have got to be done and doner. I was afraid the mozzarella cheese would disguise that because it is so gooey. It really turned out great. So use the cheese of your choice."
