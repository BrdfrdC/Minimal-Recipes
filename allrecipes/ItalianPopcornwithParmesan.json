"reviewBody": "Really yummy! I did use my air popper to make the popcorn. That saved calories from the extra oil. I liked the different flavor using the olive oil. You do get that Italian flavor with it. Never thought to use that. I would consider adding some butter to it, too, though. The spice amounts seemed heavy to me, so I started light and just added more to suit my taste. I don't normally eat a whole batch of popcorn like this at once, so I will just add the parmesan cheese as I have it. A lot does sink to the bottom. Great recipe....thanks!"

"reviewBody": "I really liked this and I will probably never buy commercial popcorn seasoning again. I made it exactly as recipe called for, but using the Kraft powdered parmesan cheese as I did not have fresh grated on hand. ( I used perhaps 1/4 cup of this as it just seemed all I would need ). I also did not have garlic salt so I used 1 tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of sea salt. I will make this again but next time, I want to try it with melted butter drizzled around and the powdered mix sprinkled on separately as this is my traditional method and I would like to compare. I look forward to trying different flavours now."
