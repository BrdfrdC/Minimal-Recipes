Also, when the vegetables were sauted, I removed them from the pan and put the sausage slices back in the pan and browned them. By doing that, I did not have to cook for ten minutes afterwards. The vegetables would have been too soggy. This dish only feeds two. Thanks!"

Make sure the sausages are on top of the veggies and lower to low, put a lid on it and walk away. ~20 later throw em on some fresh rolls (best you can find) and enjoy. Traditionally served without cheese, possibly with mustard (but I choose to skip the mustard), so enjoy"

After simmering the dish had a lot of fluid probably caused by the tomatoes. So I added about 2 tbs of tomato paste and it thickened right up. Delicious recipe which I can make a meal if all this garden produce I’m getting. 😃"

Absolutely one of the best new ways I found to enjoy italian sausage."

The only difference I do is use both sweet and hot Italian sausage and substitute beer for the wine. Otherwise I follow everything else to the \"T\". Mmmm - this recipe will not let you down.

"reviewBody": "You know it's good when it's good cold....\n\nThis was my first time making something like this.. So I followed the used a mixture of the original directions and changed somethings based on others' suggestions. I made sure \n to cook the meat as much (the first link was really pink on the inside). I used olive oil instead of butter, a whole yellow onion, and 1/2 a sweet onion (no red onion). I added salt and pepper to taste to the aromatics. I used a red and yellow pepper (no green), fresh basil (that's all I had), and no oregano. Lastly, I added a can of petite diced tomatoes when adding the sausage back to the skillet because I like saucy recipes! At first I was going to eat it by itself, but decided to put it over angel hair pasta which I'm glad I did. My mom thought it was very flavorful....and I would have to agree. Definitely will be making again!"

Before I removed them, I added a splash of white wine to steam them a little. I removed the sausages, added 1/2 the onion and all the peppers along with 2Tbs of tomato paste with one bouillon dissolved in 1/2C water. 5 minutes later I added the rest of the sliced sausages and onions simmered for 20 minutes."

At first I thought that four cloves of garlic may be too much but mixing with the wine and herbs, it was actually perfect."

But this second time around I added a half teaspoon of salt with the oregano and basil, and used half a cup of wine instead of a quarter cup. The flavors seemed to pop a bit more with those additions. Both times I served it with plain spaghetti, but might try adding a bit of parmesan at the table next time. All in all, a very good, simple recipe."

If you are looking for something relatively quick and easy, then this will fit the bill, just manage your expectations ."
