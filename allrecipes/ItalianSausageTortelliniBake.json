"reviewBody": "Hearty and flavorful! Took a bit longer than I normally spend on prep, so I think if I repeated this I'd do like another reviewer and skip a lot of the boiling/simmering. I tried to follow the recipe as closely as possible, the only differences being: I didn't drain the \"grease\" because for me it was mostly just the onion juice (your sausage may vary), I used a mozzarella/provolone blend (it's what was on hand, still worked), and I left the dish in the oven for a little less than 20 minutes because my dish was biiiiiit too small to handle the final mixture and I feared spill-over. But I should have left it in for the full time; only a tiny bit of cheese spilled over and everything else seemed to be staying in place. I should have trusted the cheese. It knew what it was doing."

"reviewBody": "This was really easy and good. I used 1pkg of spicy Italian sausage from Costco (about 1 and 1/3 lb) and refrigerated cheese tortellini from Costco. Because the tortellini had already been precooked, I eliminated the boiling process (and an extra pot to clean!). Will probably double the garlic next time since my family really loves it. If you like your pasta saucy, you will want to keep covered during the simmering and possibly add a bit of water to it. Make sure to stir a few times during simmering too. This was super simple, and a great, hearty weeknight meal. Thanks for the recipe!!!"

"reviewBody": "I simplified the recipe by using a jar of chunky tomato pasta sauce with garlic and onions already in it. I used Shady Brook Farm's Hot Italian Turkey Sausage which is took out of the casing and broke up as I browned it. Then I added the pasta sauce. I used one pound of frozen cheese tortellini cooked according to the instructions on the package. Those three ingredients were combined and poured into the baking pan. About one and a half cups of shredded mozzarella were used - two just seemed like too much to me. I baked as directed in the original recipe and it came out great! My husband really liked it, too. I will definitely make this again."

I subbed in a bag of frozen bell peppers and onions, so he wouldn't have to cut anything, and the bag of tortellini we used was larger than 9 oz...16 oz maybe? Anyway, we used the whole thing. It came out really well, everyone ate a ton, and my six year old thinks he's the chef of the year. Thanks for the recipe."

I used Barilla 3 cheese tortellini bc I couldn't find frozen tortellini, I just cooked that according to the pasta package and then mixed it in. I also didn't use all the marinara, but I would next time. Its important to let the marinara, peppers and onions simmer together to reduce water content. DONT SKIP that, but if you don't have time, just add less marinara sauce and I think it would compensate. This was delicious. My kids loved it, hubs loved it. Great recipe."

Also added black olives right before I put it in the pan to bake. Turned out amazing though! The black olives are a great touch! Good recipe though!!"
