Instead of using store bought Gnocchi, I made mine homemade. I will be making this more often because it's one of my family's favorites. Thanks for this amazing recipe!"

Because I didn’t use fresh, chopped tomatoes - I used a 14oz can……and because I didn’t think there was enough liquid to “simmer” the gnocchi, made a split second decision and added a second, 14oz can - which was perfect. When I added the second can, also added an extra 1/2 tsp of basil/oregano (1 tsp total). Huge hit, huge flavor and super simple to make! Will make on my busy night winter rotation! Thanks Bren!"

I followed the first step exactly then I added a jar of marinara sauce and 8 oz of tomato sauce let it cook together while I defrosted a box of frozen spinach, squeezed out the water and added I to the skillet with a dash of nutmeg. Stirred it all together topped it with the cheese,covering until melted. It was delicious! This is the first time I've had gnocchi that wasn't boiled then sauced."

My family absolutely loved it! There is a little leftover and I’ll bet it’s even better the next day. Thank you so much for sharing such an easy and excellent recipe. This is one of our faves now!"
