I had everything except savory so looked up what could be substituted and learned you can use marjoram, thyme or sage. Since this mix already called for marjoram and thyme, I used sage. My chicken turned out delicious so I think this must be a good mix."

I like that this recipe has equal amounts of each seasoning so it was easy to adjust down to the amount I needed for another recipe rather than having a big batch! \n\nI used equal parts basil, oregano, thyme, savory, and red pepper flakes, and it made the pizza sauce so delicious. I would add back in the other ingredients based on what I have available in my spice drawer and the italian based recipe that I'm making. Thanks for the good combo!"

The flavor was nice, but I'm sure it would have been better had the herbs been fresher (and therefore more flavorful). We liked the heat from the chile flakes. Unfortunately I live in an area where not all the spices I'm used to using can be found, so the only savory I could find was ground. I have given my rating based on how the recipe would have turned out had I had better ingredients. This one is definitely worth keeping!"
