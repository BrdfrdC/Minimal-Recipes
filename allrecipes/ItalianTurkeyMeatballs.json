Also I use regular bread crumbs instead of Italian seasoned and just add a little Italian seasoning to the mixture. Using parchment paper on my baking sheet makes clean up a breeze. I use a small scoop for my meatballs so I get several more and don’t bake them as long. Probably about 10 minutes."

However, here are the adjustments I made, based on what I had in my cupboards and fridge: \n\n3 tablespoons of Italian seasoning because I didn't have any of the fresh herbs listed; \n\nregular mustard because I didn't have dry mustard; \n\nPanko breadcrumbs due to no Italian breadcrumbs; \n\nCayenne Pepper because I didn't have anything labeled 'Red Pepper', although Google says they're the same, lol;\n\nGrated parmesan cheese because I didn't have any shredded cheese.\n\nAlso, I'm not familiar with the 'melted butter' or whatever is listed. So I melted 3 tablespoons of salted butter in the microwave formed my meatballs on a cookie sheet that was lined with foil, and then drizzled the melted butter over them. \n\nAgain, they were SOOO GOOOD! \n\nSorry, forgot to take a pic, lol!"

I also used dried herbs instead of fresh since that's all I had on hand (used another reviewer's adjustment of 1 Tbsp fresh = 1 tsp dried). After cooking, I transferred them into my slow cooker with a few jars of heated sauce and let them simmer for an hour before serving. Meatballs were just the right consistency - not too hard and not too soft. This recipe is definitely a keeper"

Then, I fried up some Polenta from Trader Joe's to serve the meatballs on and topped it with RAO'S Marinara sauce and a sprig of basil and more Parmesan cheese. This tasted like something I would serve to company. Super good. I'll be making this again!!! Tip - I just put the meatballs on a non-stick pan from Sur La Table, and they stuck to the bottom. Next time I will add a non-stick spray or EVOO."

I put in the sauce and then nestled the meatballs on top and had to layer a few. Only issue is they burned a little. Think I should have e added more liquid. Still learning how to use the Instant Pot."

I also didn’t have fresh herbs but used Italian spice blend and it was very tasty. I’d make these again in a heartbeat but would probably try it with the actual ingredients as listed. I like that it didn’t have an egg in it. The texture was great. They meatball were a hit. I served them with sautéed onion and green pepper cooked with diced Italian tomatoes. Super yummy!"

I also added a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes without draining. The seasoning was wonderful as called for, but I did improvise and use dried herbs and cut back to 1/3 of what was called for when using fresh. I will definitely be making these again!"

I didn’t have Rosemary (dried or fresh) so I omitted that and added dried basil and they were still delicious. We love spice but still thought the crushed red pepper should have been cut in half. I let these meatballs simmer in organic pasta sauce and we ate it for three days straight! Flavorful low fat dinner."

First time, I made them for a pasta dish. The second time, we had friends over and I made them as an appetizer. They were delicious straight out of the oven and disappeared very quickly ! I put out different sauces with them. Will definitely be making these again. Thank you."

"reviewBody": "Loved these! I tried to follow as closely as possible with what I had on hand. No tomato sauce, but I did have fresh tomatoes that I let simmer and puréed into a sauce. The only fresh herb I had was parsley, so I used that, but for the rest I used the same amount that was called for, just dried versions. Didn’t have Italian breadcrumbs so I used regular breadcrumbs and threw some Italian seasoning on top. I have no idea what Melt is, so I didn’t use it. I put some foil down on a cookie sheet, sprayed it with cooking spray, and cooked for 20 minutes. They were so good! I had 1 pound of ground turkey and made 21 meatballs. Definitely making again!"

I only had 1lb ground turkey, but I also had 1/2 lb chicken sausage and mixed that in. For the herbs I did 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 3/4 tsp dried rosemary, 1.5 Tbsp fresh basil as well as the 1/3c fresh parsely. Added 3 Tbsp finely chopped yellow onions, and substituted the crushed pepper for black pepper. I used a marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce and grated Parmesan instead of shredded. For the bread crumbs I used half plain and half seasoned as I thought the chicken sausage would already have enough extra seasoning. Used my cookie scoop to make 35 meatballs. Baked at 385* for 30 minutes. Perfect!! Everyone loved them! Thanks for the recipe!!!"
