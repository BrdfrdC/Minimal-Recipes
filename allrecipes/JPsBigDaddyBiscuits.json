I also like to use a pastry brush and brush on butter when I bring them out of the oven. People who have dense biscuits should check their expiration date on their baking powder. Even if your can has been opened a long time and hasn't expired yet, it will deteriorate and not work as well."

Almost funny. I used a wine glass to cut them out. I didn't think it was going to make very many, so I doubled the recipe. It made 17 giant biscuits. If you are inexperienced at rolling bread dough, do not be afraid of adding flour to the outside. It will make it much easier to roll without sticking. This is a new go-to for me. Thank you."

Don't know where I went wrong. I used Crisco butter shortening and 1/2 cup of canned milk and 1/2 c water. Did not over mix and just patted, not rolled the dough and used sharp biscuit cutter. Did not twist the cutter. So, again don't know where I went wrong?? Maybe next time I'll use self-rising flour."

"reviewBody": "These are great! I have a household full of dairy allergies, so I made some changes! I used about 3/4 cup of full fat oat milk. It was a little too much milk, so I had to let it rest. I patted it out on a floured surface with a little extra flour. I used a cookie cutter and pulled the excess off instead of twisting the cutter. I increased the temperature to 450 like someone recommended, but I ended up having to increase the bake time to about 25 minutes. They were a bit dense, but that is probably because I didn't spoon the flour before measuring it. Because of this I ended up with a little more flour than I was supposed to. They ended up pretty good and still rose"

PERFECTION!! One tip is I don't have the thing to cut the Crisco in so I used the rubber mixers and beat on low until it was like described as a meal, worked wonderfully and I mixed in the milk in 1/2cup increments. I kneaded the dough like 8-10 times and used a juice cup to cut the biscuits!! Thank you so much for sharing this and the tip to not over mix or knead!! Made my SUNDAY"

I always make the dough the night before and let it chill overnight after cutting them. Add more sugar, if you want more of a scone. Add blueberries and baste with cream. If you want a flaky version mix the ingredients, then roll out dough. Take some chilled butter and grate over dough. Then fold dough like a bed sheet. Lol. And continue until you have layers. Chill dough every fold for at least 30 minutes. and then bake. Comes out amazing too. You can come up with different variations with this dough."

I also make them sweet (cinnamon scones), by reducing the salt to 1/2 teaspoon, and adding 1/3 cup dark brown sugar, as well as a tablespoon of cinnamon. I also sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the top, and added a cinnamon glaze on the top. I'm telling you they came out SUPER fluffy and moist with an amazing cinnamon flavour!!!"

If you want flaky - let it rise - keep the dough cold and fold to get layers. that's how you get it more flakey.\nEven though - without a lot of kneading, mine were a bit dense - but no-one objected. very tasty. I'm keeping this recipe in my arsenal! BTW - beer? Ok i'll try it, but soda water may work as well - just saying."

I think next time I make them I wil only knead them a few times. I used a green bean can that I washed out just for these. It made perfect little biscuits. I got 16 biscuits by using it. I also did a butter wash on the top. I loved the taste. It reminded me of watching my Mamaw make breakfast every morning. Now my house smells delicious. Thank you!!"
