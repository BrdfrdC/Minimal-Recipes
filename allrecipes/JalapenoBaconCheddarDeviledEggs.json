Likewise, the eggs were made exactly following the directions and were still runny. I’d definitely cover the eggs after boiling to hold in the heat. Maybe boil, remove from heat, cover 8-10 mins. Anyways, I hope I’m able to salvage this mess of a recipe."

One side note I’d like to make- You can make these the night before, but don’t fry and add the bacon until you’re ready to serve. I made this mistake, and the bacon was soggy and flaccid by morning. I will definitely be making these babies again!"

Some friends were afraid to try them because I labeled them jalapeno, but since I took out the seeds &amp; membrane, they had some kick, but were not HOT. I did half the mustard. The recipe said 3 jalapenos, and to cut 2 into fine stripes, but did not say what to do with them. One picture had them \"sticking out\" of the egg, but the picture with the recipe didn't. That is what I did. It also helped \"labeled them\" as the jalapeno eggs as opposed to the other regular deviled eggs I made. You should explain what to do with those 2 peppers ."

All of those ingredients were pureed and then added mayo, spicy mustard and more hot sauce to taste. I used my large cupcake decorating kit to put into the egg halves and topped with crumbled bacon (adding cheese and jalapenos would look nice as well). I'm not a huge deviled egg fan, but between the guests and myself, this was our favorite recipe ahead of the buffalo blue cheese deviled eggs. This will be my go to party food."
