I used the hot jalapeno slices that come in a jar and a pinch of cayenne instead of crushed red pepper, and it's quite spicy. I didn't have any curry powder, so I tried garam masala instead, and it works quite well. Everything else was the same."

I didn’t have curry or omitted. Found that it had a bit too much garlic for our taste. Next time I may toast the garlic first or just cut back a little. Overall I would say a very good recipe and will definitely make it again."

It was the best I have tried, but it did have a lot of heat. Cut the peppers down by at least 1/4 if you are not into hot dips. Bonus! All ingredients fit in my Magic Bullet mini blender. So no mess."

I doubled the recipe and used a 16 ounce can of garbanzo beans, only 5 tablespoons of tahini(since I've never used the spice before)doubled all the other ingredients. Since we like spicy foods added crushed red pepper and jalapenos. So much cheaper than buying it in the store."

I’m a fan of Madras curry powder and I’m out right now, so I used another curry powder I had in the spice cabinet which didn’t quite measure up. Still, all in all, this is a good hummus recipe, Hummus is so quick, easy and inexpensive to make I cease to be amazed at the money people pay to buy it. Served with Perfect Pita Chips also on this site."

"reviewBody": "Love it. Up here in Alaska we like to get our heat however we can! I 'skinned' the chickpeas before they went in the food processor. Just pick 'em up and pinch--it comes right off. Seems to allow for a creamier consistency. I didn't have any curry, so I subbed coriander. Used one fresh jalapeno instead of the pickled ones, used 5 cloves of garlic instead of 3, and 1/4 ground red pepper, as that is what I had. Also added 1 tbsp chili oil and 1 tbsp of olive oil. Used about 1/3 of the bean juice, and 1 tspn of balsamic vinegar in addition to the lemon juice. Came out wonderfully creamy, not gritty, and will 'set up' nicely overnight in the fridge. Nice light color that easily garnished for serving with whatever suites your fancy. Thanks for a great one!"

When first made, we'd give it a 5, but downgraded it to a 3 because it gets too chalky and thick when chilled."

I just measured out the same amount and put them in the blender whole, with a little water in place of the juice, and it worked great! It was just spicy enough. My husband loves spicy stuff and I like it, but not quite as spicy as he does, and it was just the right balance so that we were both happy with it. Also, I was out of curry powder but I had some Thai red curry paste in the fridge and used that instead, but I don't think that made much difference to the recipe."

I also didn't have curry (and don't care much for it) so I left that out. I love that this doesn't call for olive oil. It's really good the next day when the flavors sit."

I used a little bit of the liquid from the garbanzo bean can and a whole (seeds and all) fresh jalapeno instead of the canned jalapenos. I like things really, really spicy so next time I might add two instead. It is soooo good. I almost ate all of it myself!"

I used 5 tablespoons of lemon juice, 1 tsp curry, 1 tsp cumin, 3 tbls tahini and 1 1/2 jalepenos, 3 cloves of garlic and 1 tsp of sea salt. I like my hummus spicy."

No tahini, less lemon juice, addition of a little olive oil for smoothness, a little more cumin and about 50% more jalapenos. Wonderful."

We used fresh jalapenos and in place of the canned juice, we added olive oil. I found that I enjoyed the silkiness of the texture. We too, left out the curry but instead added some cilantro. That made it epecially delicious if you are a cilantro lover like we are. Terrific hummus and oh so easy."

I used a whole can of beans, drained, and about 3 Tbs of lemon juice - just hate to see a good lemon go to waste - and a bit more jalapenos, and omitted the curry powder as i was out. Next time I'll add it in, but hard to imagine it can be any tastier than it is now! Many thanks for posting!"
