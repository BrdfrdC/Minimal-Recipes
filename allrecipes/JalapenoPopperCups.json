I have also tried using sriracha in place of other hot sauce and crumbled leftover bacon in place of bacon bits. I think I may try making a vegetarian version with diced field roast plant pepperonis in place of bacon. It’s hard to go wrong with this one!"

I did put my own spin on them and took advice of other reviewers.\nI sauteed the chopped jalapenos, then added a couple of tblsp of pineapple jam. added the cream cheese, the cheddar and about a tbsp of apple habanero bbq sauce. Added half a pound of chopped bacon and put all that in a ziplock bag and let it sit over night. The next day, I let it warm up some, and piped it into Scoops. Topped with the other half pound of chopped bacon, and cooked at 300 degrees for about 20 minutes. So good, had lots of party goers come up to me and ask to share the recipe. Will definitely make these again."

"reviewBody": "Perfectly Delicious!\nUsed Tostitos Scoops (not any other chip brand of \"scoops\" because they have round bottoms that won't sit upright on your baking sheet).\nUsed Diced Jalapenos in a jar (3 tablespoons DRAINED for average adult taste). I think fresh jalapenos might be too crispy in this recipe.\nAny hot sauce should be fine, but I used Tabasco since it was the only one labeled as \"pepper sauce\".\nREAL bacon bits in the zipper pouches found near the salad dressing and croutons in the store (do not use \"imitation\" bacon bits...totally different product).\nNOT good for potlucks or large parties where several dishes are set out buffet style. These are not good cold or reheated as they will be chewy or scorched by a chaffing dish. These are perfect for a few dinner guests served as an appetizer at a barbecue or to a hoard of teenagers as a snack. Thank you Jessina!"

I used real bacon, two tablespoons of diced jalapeño from a jar, and made the mix a day ahead so it had time to get happy. I cut the corner off the ziplock bag and piped neatly into the phyllo shells. They took about 25 minutes to bake and were gone in 5 minutes."

Use the phyllo cups, they add a delicate crisp texture and fresh jalapeño so they don't taste pickled. My 23 year old nephew popped one in his mouth and said \"these are amazing\". They were demolished in minutes! Definitely recommend this recipe ??"

I made 30 phyllo cups with homemade bacon bits, fat free cream cheese, and some seeds from the jalapeños. I also did the piping from a bag trick to make it quicker and easier. I will make this again and again and again."

The sausage worked perfectly with the cream cheese and jalapenos and really kicked these tasty jalapeno cups up a notch. I used Cholula for the hot sauce. If you can't find phyllo cups you can use regular phyllo and form to your mini muffin pan or even pie crust would be great. I will definitely be making these again."

I combined the ingredients in a ziploc using reduced fat cream cheese and a blend of full fat and reduced fat cheddar. I microwaved the bag about 15 seconds and snipped off the corner to pipe the filling into the cups. I got side tracked and didn't bake them until an hour later and they turned out fine. Will make again!"

I diced up bacon and added most of it in to the cream cheese mixture, reserving just a little bit for garnish to sprinkle over the top (used the already-cooked kind, 1/2 package when I made a single recipe in the phyllo cups, and a whole package when I doubled the recipe and put it in a casserole as a dip.)"

Definitely use two seeded jalapeños, as the heat is largely reduced by the cream cheese. The last time I made it I accidentally added 8oz of cream cheese and a little extra shredded cheese--it was a happy mistake! Doubled the recipe without reducing the flavor. These are even great the day after!"

I will make again, but a double batch, less peppers &amp; no hot sauce in one batch for me &amp; the recipe exactly as stated for the hot hubby! I did eat two...so they are yummy. Piping the mixture in using a corner-cut baggy was key in not breaking the mini cups. I baked them first for about 5 mins, piped the mix in, then baked again another 5 mins. They were good at room temp &amp; not at all soggy."
