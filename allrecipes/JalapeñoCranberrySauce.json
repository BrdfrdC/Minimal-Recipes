"reviewBody": "I just made this on Thanksgiving. It's very good. I made a few changes, though. I used 1/2 cup of water, and 1/2 cup of orange juice to help the lemon juice out. Also, I didn't have any sherry, so I used 1/2 cup of white wine (pinot grigio), and that really added an exotic taste. I used the 3 jalapenos and seeded them, and that took all the spice out. Next time I would probably leave the seeds and membranes in. Also, the cooking time is too little. I cooked mine for 15 minutes on medium low, and still had unpopped berries. Very nice recipe! Will definitely make again!\n\nNOTE: I wanted to post a photo, but the site demands tiny file sizes. Oh well."

"reviewBody": "This is a wonderful recipe, that we will make each Thanksgiving from now on. I wouldn't change a thing. I did HAVE to change one thing--our store was out of fresh jalapenos, so I used canned ones instead. We used 1-1/2 cans (4 oz. each) of sliced jalapenos, but of course drained and minced them. Despite being drained, I believe they added just a bit of extra liquid to the recipe, so would decrease the water by 1-2 tablespoons if I have to use the canned ones again. But it still turned out wonderfully. A great alternative to the old standard cranberry sauce--but still really easy."

The dish is very easy to make and everyone is pleasantly surprised my the sweet tart flavor of the cranberry in the beginning and the smooth jalapeno taste at the end. I recommend using 1/2 cup of sugar to maintain the tartness of the cranberry and cut out some calories, leave the seeds of the jalapenos in if you like it spicy and allow mixture to reduce for 30 -45 minutes to get a jam like consistency that is ideal for turkey sandwiches."

"reviewBody": "I thought this was very nice. It's missing a little something compared to my usual recipe -- I think maybe I am just too set on allspice in my cranberry sauce -- but that's not the recipe's fault. I think I just got used to allspice in it and now it's weird when I don't have it (I did this same thing last year, added allspice after it cooled.) Anyway, I used 3 tiny home-grown jalapenos and that was plenty (and I have a decent heat tolerance). I think if you're using the big ones from the store, don't do more than 1 unless you're the kind of person who can bite a raw jalapeno and determine how hot it is from that. (I'm not, but I've seen it done!) I used sake because that's what I keep around for recipes that call for sherry and it was fine. I think Grand Marnier like someone else used would've been even better, a nice hit of orange would be great. No one in our family uses cranberry sauce with meat, but we like to put it over cream cheese (or cheese ball) &amp; crackers as an appy while we wait for the turkey. Thanks for the recipe!"

I guess I didn't cook long enough because it took a while for the flavor to die. But once it did, it was very tasty. I used this as a side for Cajun-style Turducken and leftovers to fill corn muffins."

"reviewBody": "I love this recipe, and have made this for years, and have a couple of modifications. First, you have to cook the sherry off. If you follow the directions and remove from heat after adding the sherry, the alcohol taste is so overpowering that it's virtually inedible. Cooking it for a few minutes longer allows the sherry flavor to shine without the alcohol flavor killing it. Second, I always remove all seeds from the jalapenos and use just one. It's still spicy, but not overpowering. I like this best as a condiment on sandwiches, rather than a relish."
