Instead, i make one egg from Bob's Red Mill Egg Replacer. I added a teaspoon of vanilla, brought the temp down to 350 and baked them a little longer. I used fresh fruit in which I ground up in the food processor with just a little sugar added to the fruit. These were so delicious that my vegan kids and grandkids devoured, leaving very little for grandma, lol."

"reviewBody": "Tasted okay with additions of nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and almond extract. Recipe is poorly written—not specific or detailed enough to yield consistent results. Dough was crumbly, cookies remained soft even when cooled. I have nothing against soft cookies—in fact, I prefer soft varieties—but butter cookies should be crunchy. First batch, I used the end of a pen to poke the holes and add apple butter. Second batch, I used my finger and had to reshape and work a ton to keep the crumbly dough together, but that method did yield a better looking result. I added strawberry jam to those ones. They tasted pretty yummy."

I would recommend making the dough and then chilling it for at least 20 minutes, adding more flour as needed (you want it very soft but not too sticky). Adding vanilla to the dough is personal preference. \nAfter rolling the dough into balls, you need to dip it into an egg white bath, then bake it.\nThis recipe also takes between 10-12 minutes, not 8-10."

"reviewBody": "We were looking for a jam filled cookie recipe for a party and decided to make these - even doubled the recipe. I did add 2T of almond extract as some reviews said the cookie itself was a bit bland - these were not bland and delicious. Now even though I doubled the recipe, it only made 3 1/2 dozen cookies as I used a small scoop to keep size of the cookies uniform, rolled them into a ball and made thumb print in palm of hand. This made a decent size 'well' to put preserves in and a bit of a thicker cookie too. Also, put the made but not cooked cookies into the refrigerator for about 5 minutes before cooking them to cool down the butter again - the cookies did not spread out as much. Needless to say, I ended up making another double batch of these as Hubby and kids (and me too) got into them that night and needed to replenish them!"

Also after a rolled the dough into balls and used my finger to make the well, I gently pushed down the cookies with a flat-bottomed cup. I re-shapes the holes a bit and used another reviewer’s advice by filling the jam (I used strawberry) in a plastic bag and cutting a small corner off to squeeze the jam into the wells."

The cookie was very good, not to sweet, and the strawberry preserves made the perfect combination, the pineapple was just to bland for us. They were gone in less than a day..lol..next time I will be doing a double recipe."

I baked these on the least amount of suggested time, and they were perfect texture. The only negative comment I have was that the cookie itself did not have enough flavor, but when you take a bite with the jam, I guess it complimented it. Next time I will add some vanilla extract as other folks did. They look really fancy on a platter! ( put a very, very light drizzle of icing on them to dress them up."

This is an easy cookie and not far off from similar ones, but this needed salt (which I added) and vanilla or almond (I added vanilla). I just felt these tasted really \"flour-y\" and less buttery... Probably won't use this specific recipe again."

I followed a few of the other tips, using 1 whole egg (vs. 2 eggs whites), added 1/4 tsp salt, and experimented with 1 tsp maple syrup for a little added flavor. I used the back of a 1/2 tsp to poke a perfect (and deeper) circle in the middle, which helped keep the jam in nicely. After filling with jam, I put the sheets of cookies into the freezer for about 20 minutes before placing into the oven- this way they did not flatten while cooking. I will certainly make again, thank you for this recipe."

There is someone else who made this comment first and I am just agreeing with her!\nThey are easy to make, 1 Bowl, find your absolutely most favourite jam ever and use it because it will make them just that much more Amazing!! As per McKenzie’s review:\nhttps://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/25100/jam-filled-butter-cookies/reviews/4531315/.\n My Mother and I would make thumbprint cookies, Every Christmas, the ones with nuts on the outside. I followed alot of McKenzie's suggestions and they turned out as Perfect as the ones My Mother and I would make!! They were SOOO good that my Roommate who was going back to Mexico took the majority back with her because, YES, they were that good!! Follow the recipe and they will turn out perfectly... Just like mine!! :)\nPS Merry Almost Christmas :)"

Then I substituted 1/4 cup of the flour for 1/4 cup of Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa Powder. This turned the cookies almost an alarming shade of brown/black, but they tasted excellent! I also added a touch of baking powder for good measure."
