"reviewBody": "This is a good standard thumbprint recipe, but it does need some tweaking. I've made this recipe as written many times and it always yielded dry, cracking dough which didn't roll into balls well. I now make it with 1/4 cup less flour than the recipe says and it rolls out much better. I prefer to bake the jam into the cookies. You can either add it half way through baking or before you put them in the oven so the jam gets nice and thick and won't slide off of the cookie. I'd also warn against over baking these. It depends on how large your cookies are, but I make mine big and 15 minutes is enough time to cook them through while leaving them tender."

Will definitely make them again. See pics for how mine turned out."

Kids love it! dough may seem really sticky/liquidly instead of doughy, but don't add more flour. comes off of wax paper easily, idk about aluminum. good for storing in the freezer then taking them out for another time bc the jam isn't immediately added."

HOWEVER, when it was all baked (I fill them right after they come out of the oven - apple jelly and mint jelly for Christmas), and I tried one of the melted ones - better than Mom's recipe (Sorry, Mom).\n\nThe other thing I changed (I know, shame on me) was I used brown sugar - only because the recipe I was trying to duplicate used brown sugar.

"reviewBody": "I love these cookies, but I do them a bit differently. There is absolutely no need to wait to add the jam until after baking. In fact, it turns out MUCH better if you add the jam to the cookies before putting them in the oven. Not only do you bypass the \"is my thumbprint big enough\" worry, but the jam sets nicely, smooths out with the cookie, and doesn't fall off or jiggle and wiggle unattractively. It does not burn. Just don't put too much jam, only enough to fill the well you've made. It isn't a tricky balance or anything- it's just that if you have a huge excess of jam, it will run off the cookie as it melts. I also prefer them without the walnuts, and find apricot jam to be my absolute favorite filling."

"reviewBody": "I made these with pistachios and raspberry seedless jam. I refrigerated the dough for a couple of hours so they were easier to handle. And instead of rolling the balled dough in nuts, I rolled into balls, created the imprint, brushed with egg yolk and sprinkled the finely chopped pistachios on top. They were delicious and my mom keeps asking me to make them every time the subject of cookies comes up!"

Like other commenters, I added the jam before baking, and the tip to put the jam in a plastic sandwich bag and cut off the corner for filling the cookies was a HUGE help--probably cut the prep time in half. I also added about two tsp. of fresh rosemary to the batter, using apricot jam for half of the cookies and raspberry for the other half. I will definitely make these again."

I did one batch with putting the jelly on AFTER baking them and a second batch putting the jelly on halfway through baking. I preferred the batch in which I added jelly halfway through baking because it stays in place better and it looks nicer, more smooth. I used apple jelly and colored half green, half red for Christmas. The dough was very easy and nice to work with! Make sure you put a DEEP imprint in the cookie for the jelly. The first batch I put a regular thumbprint in the cookies and when they baked, you could hardly see it anymore and there wasn't much of a well anymore for the jelly."

I tried what people mentioned, no egg wash, no nuts, put jelly in for the full baking time...they turned out good, cept I think I may need to bake them longer than 16 minutes, also, the jam tended to ooze off the cookies and onto the baking sheet. I think I'll make smaller thumbprints and put less jam in next time. I used strawberry jam and blackberry jam. The blackberry jam didn't ooze like the strawberry jam did. But, this recipe is definitely a do-over!"

I added a pinch of cream of tartar, and a pinch of baking soda because I couldn't find the baking powder, andI wanted teh cookies to puff up. I added about 1/2 cup more sugar because I was afraid they wouldn't be very sweet, and rolled the balls a bit bigger. I filled half of them with apricot preserves, and the other half with raspberry. I never even looked at the baking time and temps, but I baked them at 325 convection for 12 minutes. Everyone loved them, and I plan to make them again soon!"
