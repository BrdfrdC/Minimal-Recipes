"reviewBody": "Incredibly flavorful and delicious, filling and comforting. It had just the right amount of heat for my tastes-- a pleasant, buzzy, medium spice. I made four chicken thighs instead of eight and marinated for about a full day. The extra sauce was great for the white rice I served with the dish. I simmered the chicken for about a full hour and it was the perfect amount of time; the chicken basically fell off of the bone. The sauce took about another full hour to reduce, so in the end it did feel like quite the process. I do think that I didn't heat the oil quite enough to really brown the chicken the way it did in the video, so I would try to remedy that next time. I also forgot to add the extra green onions at the end and accidentally used the dark parts in the marinade. But no matter, this still turned out to be an A+ dish."

I skipped the habanero pepper because of a guest with a sensitive stomach but otherwise made as directed. I then served hot sauce on the side for anyone who wanted some heat. Everyone raved about it. I'm looking forward to making this in the future with the habanero and freezing half for a future meal."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is fantastic. It reminds me of authentic Jamaican brown stew chicken. I should know I have been to Jamaica more than 28 times. I did make a few changes. Instead of using ketchup I chopped two fresh tomatoes. I also only added 2 cups of chicken stock instead of four. The other change I made was I simmered it out on my big green egg barbecue in a cast iron skillet. After about 1 hour and 15 minutes at 325 degrees I took it off the pit and remove the chicken to a plate to keep warm and then I simmer the sauce on the stove to reduce it a little. I served it over rice. It was perfect! I have more pictures but it only allowed me to put one on here. I used Scotch bonnet pepper instead of habanero since I grew them last year. I froze them in the freezer. I definitely 100% recommend this recipe üòã"

"reviewBody": "Five star recipe without question. My husband was drooling just at the smells and the taste did not disappoint. I only marinated for four hours (unintentionally- I just kept getting distracted and forgetting) and it was still so flavorful and delicious. I'd run out of carrots so added in some zucchini and took the suggestion of less sugar in the marinade and diced tomatoes instead of ketchup. I also served over rice cooked with chicken broth and peas. My race wasn't perfect so I followed his advice and removed the chicken for the last 30 min or so and let the sauce reduce some more. Chef John recipes are so reliable, you really can't go wrong. Another win in my book!"

And, I used corn starch to thicken the sauce at the end when I thought I had the right amount of sauce left. Oh, and I used 10 pieces of chicken instead of 8 pieces coz I didn't want the two pieces to feel left out. It turned out amazingly! It's so delicious. I'm definitely going to make this again."

The instapot would be easier but I'm not sure how well it would reduce.\nNot a lot of gravy, but full of flavor! The braised chicken was oh so tender. This kept well for leftovers too, and in my opinion was even better the next day. \nThanks for something different!"

I really loved the taste of this but it had zero heat or spice to it. I would also cut out a tablespoon of the brown sugar because it makes it really sweet. Also, I would use boneless chicken thighs because the bones and cartilage breaks down during the cooking. Lots of cartilage and bones to pick out of your mouth is no fun! I will make this again with adjustments."
