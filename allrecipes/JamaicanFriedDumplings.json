If you want it to be savory do the salt anyway, even if you used salted butter. Use cinnamon sugar if you want to make it sweet! (even though that probably isn't the point) It's really good.

Also, when frying, use a high walled pot. That reduces oil splatter. The three minutes per side is insufficient - it will take more like five minutes per side at medium heat. Basically cook them until they are golden brown on each side. Yum!"

"reviewBody": "I had a similar problem to one of the other reviewers, I found the dough was far too dry using the measurements provided here (converted to metric and serving size changed to 2.) However this was easily fixed as I was adding water slowly so just continued a spoon at a time until the dough was stretchy, rather than crumbly. It might be helpful if you gave a bit more detail as to the required texture of the dough to give us a better idea of what it should feel/look like. Also, how big are these \"patties\" supposed to be? I intended to make mine into 4 dumplings but when I put the first one in, it browned far too quickly (medium heat on an electric hob) and so was burnt on the outside before it was even close to being cooked on the inside. I lumped the remaining mixture into one bigger dumpling and reduced the heat so inevitably it took much longer than the suggested 3 mins/side. But this is the best attempt so far, after trying loads of recipes. I'll keep fiddling with the details and see how it goes. I love the layout of this site and the conversations, so practical! ; the oil is the right temperature when...; makes x number of dumplings rather than \"serves x number of people\" (maybe others automatically assume that \"serves 2\" means \"makes 2 dumplings\" but not necessarily) Thanks all for the comments and advice!"

I thought I'd give my favorite recipe site a try and see what I could come up with. Boy am I glad I did! I didn't think this bread would go well with ham &amp; beans, but the rave reviews really intrigued me. I can't believe a handfull of such simple ingredients can taste so good just because they're fried. Some crumbled the bread into their bowl of soup, some ate them with butter. One even put a little jam on part of one. Delicious all the way around and everyone loved them. I even got a \"thumbs up\" from my super-finicky 9-yr-old. Now, THAT'S good!"
