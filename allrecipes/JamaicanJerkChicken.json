"reviewBody": "Out of all the jerk recipes I’ve seen on this sites, this one most closely resembles true jerk. But you need to remember a couple of things here: real jerk MUST use scotch Bonnet habaneros; no other variety will m give the authentic flavour. Secondly, the term “jerk” actually means grill. Traditionally really jerk meat, whether chicken, pork, or seafood, was done on a grill with pimento wood charcoal. Since it’s hard to get this wood overseas, you need to at least use real charcoal grill to cook the meat. Gas grilling and, heaven forbid, oven baking, will not suffice, if you’re trying to approximate real Jamaican jerk as closely as possible. Also marinate overnight in a fridge if possible."

As another reviewer pointed out (look through the comments), I added about a half cup of Bourbon and instead of marinading for at least 2 hours I marinated for at least ~24 hours. I really like the Jamaican Jerk Chicken at our local farmers' market, but this was better. Thank you for the recipe! This is a do again for sure."

However, there was the perfect amount of heat from the habaneros, even though it had no effect on the taste. Marinated for 9 hours, but all I could taste was lime, lime, lime. Doubt I'll try again; I've made jerk chicken using other recipes that tasted far more authentic to the chicken I tasted in Jamaica than this citrus showcase."

Using freshly ground allspice and ginger made this recipe so much better than the store-bought paste. I made the following changes: added a tablespoon of rum, used 1/2 cup of water, substituted the habanero for jalepeno pepper, added a teaspoon of ground clove and bone-in chicken breasts."

"reviewBody": "This is completely par for a good jerk seasoning, and it could be put on chicken, pork, beef, goat, lamb, fish, shrimp, it doesn't matter, it'd still be good. However, those that don't like too much spice (first of all stay out of the caribbean/latin america, but if not then...) don't marinade this for so long. Instead, stab your meat with a fork a bunch of times and add the paste only just before cooking and use the excess to baste it. If you do like the spice (meaning \"heat\") to be strong, do this and marinade, and add like 4 extra peppers because 2 over 6 chicken breasts is just silly. Also, this recipe needs rum. I prefer spiced but white is fine. It tenderizes your meat. Good additives: (fresh, cubed) ginger, rosemary (don't ask why, it's just good), amchoor (indian grocery stores-- not traditional but great, it's powdered green mango, very tart), cloves, mine usually has cumin and cilantro, but I learned it from a trinidadian... Serve with black beans and coconut rice. Very authentic recipe : )"

Worked well, but needed more spice. Also recommend putting the chicken and marinade in a freezer bag, squeezing out the air, to get better coverage."

At first glance, I was unsure of it being anything good, but then as it cooked on the grill and I pulled off a small piece to try I was instantly convinced. Served it with Jasmine rice and grilled asparagus. Wow was it great and all that tried it wanted to know where I got the recipe. This is a winner."

"reviewBody": "I like the way the flavours infuse together - it made an interesting (and delicious) rub. I made a few alterations as I didn't have a few ingredients at hand and was marinating fewer pieces of chicken. I reduced the salt to half a teaspoon (as I thought a full teaspoon was a bit excessive), and I think I'll even add a little less next time. I put in about 3/4 teaspoon of ground ginger, as I can't handle eating a lot of ginger. I didn't have the peppers so I put in about half a teaspoon of peri-peri chilli spice. I added just a dash of water to the chicken and lime mixture as I wanted more of a dry rub. Marinated overnight, the chicken was delicious! I served this up with a bed of chicory salad and apricot and ginger cous cous."

Cooked on the lowest temperature on the grill. Served this with brown rice &amp; golden hominy. It was a great meal. Thanks for the recipe!"

Instead of a whole cup of water, I only used a bit to dilute the paste so it's easier to marinade the chicken. I also threaded the chicken pieces on skewers to make grilling easier. Went really well on a bed of white rice."

Instead of using the mixture as a marinade, just put it in the crock pot with either the chicken as indicated or with a good pork shoulder. The flavors REALLY come out in the slow cooking process and gives a very aromatic and great tasting jerk flavor. Note though, I used one habanero pepper. If you really like it hot, add more, but know that you get the full effect from the pepper in the crock pot!"
