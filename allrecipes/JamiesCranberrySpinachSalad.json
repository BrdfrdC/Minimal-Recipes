"reviewBody": "TLDR: The dressing is too sweet so add less sugar and definitely add blue cheese crumbles. I was really unsure about the dressing. After a few hours in the fridge, I went to pour it onto the salad and the vinegar smell seemed overpowering, but it doesn‚Äôt taste overly vinegary. I love anything sweet, but the dressing was too sweet even for my taste, which I would‚Äôve thought was impossible. Next time, I‚Äôll cut down on the sugar. I added blue cheese crumbles and I can‚Äôt imagine the salad without them. They add a tang &amp; saltiness that offsets the sweetness of the cranberries and dressing. I‚Äôll definitely make it again."

One odd thing I've noticed is the web version and the magazine version are different in a few ways. The dressing calls only for 2 tbsp of the vinegars, sugar and only a 1/4 cup oil. It , also only used 1/3 cup of almonds not the 3/4, I'm making more tonight üôÇthank you for an awesome recipe that we'll use many more times."

"reviewBody": "This is hands-down the best version of this salad I‚Äôve ever made. I think the secret is toasting the almonds, which really adds a depth of umami flavor to the whole thing. I made it exactly as written with the exception of the poppy seeds, which I didn‚Äôt have on hand. Others have said that they drastically cut back on the sugar. I think the sweetness is needed, but the quantity of dressing was quite a bit more than I felt was needed for the amounts of the other ingredients. I made the dressing according to the recipe, dressed the salad with about 1/3 of the dressing and refrigerated the rest. It‚Äôs a matter of personal taste, of course, but I thought it was perfect that way. I‚Äôve made the salad two more times using the leftover dressing. Thank you for a delicious recipe!"

"reviewBody": "One of my favourite salad recipes, and I have lots. However, I alter it a bit by adding a cubed cooked beet and 1 cubed apple. I fry 1 cup of crushed walnuts until lightly brown then continue to fry briefly with 4 TBSP of maple syrup (easier than caramelizing almonds and kids love them), then let cool and break them up. The best part is adding chunks of goat cheese. This combination is great with this salad dressing and other ingredients. You can decrease the amount of sugar in this dressing a tad. It‚Äôs quite sweet, and there‚Äôs enough sweetness with the apples, walnuts and cranberries. If not, it still tastes fantastic."

"reviewBody": "To make it slightly healthier: 1) use a sprinkle of sugar instead of the amount called for - I sometimes sub with coconut sugar, brown sugar... have omitted it entirely before and it's still good, just not as. 2) you can toast your almonds without the butter, or with just a thin coating. It's not as rich, but still deliciously toasty. And yes, freshly toasted almonds is totally worth it. I've literally been making this salad since I found it in 2013, and have made it for many a party and potluck. It's true that it's always very well-received. I never have the poppy seeds though, and started eyeballing all the ingredients rather haphazardly about six years ago. Amazing as written, and still good if you believe in making salads as unfussy as possible like me!"

As others have mentioned, it makes a lot of dressing so I just used part of it on the salad and saved the rest to use on other salads. I made the dressing the day before then mixed the salad right before serving and added the dressing. Make sure to whisk the dressing again before adding to the salad. I‚Äôm going to try it next time using goat cheese as others have mentioned. Definitely a keeper!"

I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and added some crumbled unripened goat cheese. I will definitely be making this again!"

As spinach wilts so easily, we avoid this by applying the dressing to individual portions only. (And feta or crumbled goat cheese makes a great additional as well!)"

You can buy the dried cranberries with 50% less sugar than regular, because they do contain alot of sugar. I like to keep the toasted almonds in a small container and use them at the time I eat the salad rather than mixing them into the spinach, because they can get a little soggy otherwise. The dressing is so delicious. I make it about every other week and sometimes two batches per week. Soooo good!"

It was still plenty sweet. When I trialled it last week with the planning committee, everyone said the dressing was just right for sweetness, and it was also suggested to leave out the poppy seeds. It is true, they don‚Äôt really add anything to this salad. The salad itself was mixed greens, cranberries, toasted almonds, sunflower seeds, and a few slices of apple (tossed in lemon first)."
