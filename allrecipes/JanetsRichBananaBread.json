Based on my personal preference and on what some others said in the reviews, I did mash up the bananas rather than using slices. It worked beautifully (although I'm sure the original slices work just as well). I also added a quarter cup of grated dark chocolate and put turbinado sugar and finely chopped nuts on top before baking to enhance the crust. Will keep this recipe for sure."

"reviewBody": "First of all, let me say that I have made hundreds of banana breads over the years but my search for the perfect recipe has come to an end! I followed the recipe exactly with two minor modifications. I increased the amount of bananas to five… Yes, five. I mashed up 4 1/2 of them and saved half of one for the top of the loaf. I added a half a cup of the mini chocolate chips if I had had walnuts, I would’ve added that but alas I was out. This loaf came out beautifully. Rich and moist and now I have only myself to blame for not making two. I took 1/2 of one banana and sliced it, placing the individual “coins“ into the top of the batter along the center. Then drizzled honey, across the top of the batter before baking it."

I made the recipe as is except I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them. I cooked it for 55 mins (my oven sometimes bakes faster than instructions say.) The crust on it sets it apart from other banana breads. My go to used to be the banana split banana bread recipe on this website, but this one is a lot simpler. Both are amazing!"

PRO TIP #2: If you’re feeling indulgent, make yourself some French Toast with a couple slices 😋"

"reviewBody": "I wanted some comfort food and had ripe bananas in the house. So, I thought banana bread. I love this recipe! It's very easy and simple to make, and the ingredients are most likely in all our cupboards already. Instead of walnuts, I used pecans (what I had in the house...lol) and I added semi-sweet chocolate chips. YUM! To ensure the chocolate chips were evenly spread throughout the bread. I poured half the batter in the pan, then sprinkled the chips and pushed (w/finger) in the batter, then poured the rest of the batter and added the remaining chips on top and pushed them in. The amount of chips is at your discretion (smile). The result was extremely tasty and comforting. The only criticism I have is the recipe calls for sliced bananas to be added, and the video shows the bananas being smashed and added. I did both. Perfect combo! I got an immersed banana taste and the creaminess of the sliced bananas throughout. Lastly, if you go with sliced bananas, make sure you refrigerate the bread (after it's cooled down), this will keep the sliced bananas from turning brown as you enjoy the bread. slice, toast and butter! Sooo good and comforting!"

I simplify the put together process a little by just doing wet ingredients + dry ingredients, increase the banana to 3 and mash instead of slice. You can also sub yogurt for sour cream if you have that handy. Janet! You’re a goddess. Thank you for this bread."

I used at least 3/4 of a cup (if not a full cup) of nuts and I used two large mashed bananas instead of medium sliced bananas. Also, I used softened butter, not melted, and I creamed the white sugar and butter before adding the vanilla and eggs. It took exactly 1 hour to cook and it was delish!"

Took them out before i wanted to bake so they could thaw out, cut off the top and squeezed the banana out of peel. Also, add 1 3/4 c. of flour, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, used softened butter not melted and (another review) bc the bananas had been frozen they were already mushy to mix with the butter. Thanks for this recipe! As you can see I havent been able to stop eating it."

This is different because of the sliced bananas and a little sour cream. The walnuts I toasted for a few minutes in the oven before chopping and adding. My husband and I agreed that this bread is a little like a good fruit cake, so we enjoyed a slice of it with a tiny glass of cognac! It's also great with a glass of milk."

"reviewBody": "Yum! Went way off the reservation with this one, using craped out on-hand nectarines blended up with a stick blender plus 1/4 cup Splenda rather than bananas. Probably ended up using 2 cups of blended fruit in total (based on how much it looked like banana bread batter all-in. I also subbed in 1C Splenda for the sugar plus, used 1t baking powder as well as the salt and soda called for in the recipe. Other than that, I followed the recipe for blending of dry and wet and did melt the butter. Oh and no walnuts. The Splenda sub chopped 775 calories out as well as 200 carbs out of the recipe. Went from 218 cal/ serving and 27 carbs to 166 and 14. That half a loaf is only 10 minutes old, so very popular. This has to be a bullet proof recipe to be so tasty after all the changes."

I added a tablespoon of maple syrup to the batter, to give the top a little sugary crisp edge. I only had pecans, so I toasted &amp; rough chopped them, and used them instead of walnuts. I roughly mashed the bananas. And, we love chocolate - so I added about a cup of dark chocolate chips when I folded pecans into the batter. This was so good, so moist! I will definitely be making this again!"
