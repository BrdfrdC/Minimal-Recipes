I wrapped about a fourth of it up in foil and came back to Kansas City, (from Texas). We unloaded the car and I put the cake in the upper cabinet above the sink, and promptly forgot about it. A year later I found it and opened it up and it was just as tasty as it did a year earlier."

I had a lot of leftover icing so, next time, I may make 2 2-layer cakes and give one as a gift or serve one for Thanksgiving and one for Christmas. It makes a very large cake."

An excellent accompaniment to the holiday dinner after eatting so many very sweet treats during the holiday season. It is also very impressive to look at with 4 layers! I garnished the top with extra raisins, coconut, pecans and a sprinkle of all the spices in the recipe!"
