As far as the glass noodles it was way too bland. Added more soy sauce and sesame oil to taste. I skipped the asparagus and added cooked spinach. Super easy to make!"

I prefer blanched spinach instead of asparagus and added scrambled eggs (fried like a pancake then cut into strips). I also like a high vegetables to noodles ratio. For this approximate size recipe though, like other reviews mention, you need about double the soy sauce mixture and sesame oil than called for to get a good flavor."

I omitted the asparagus and sesame seeds, and substituted the fresh mushrooms for the dried. Other vegetables like broccoli or celery could be added too. \n#AllrecipesAllstarsCanada\n#lunarnewyear"

I bought shredded carrots and used a handful. I bought a bag of finely shredded slaw mix and added a handful and a half. I also used an 8 oz bin of fresh sliced mushrooms. And followed the recipe otherwise. Turned out really good!!! So good my daughter had leftovers of it the next morning for breakfast. ha ha!"

I also had to add much more soy sauce and sugar for this recipe. I guess because I used glass noodles. Everything else I followed the recipe as is. So yummy!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe turned out very much like what I eat at the Korean restaurant we frequent. My husband, who is Korean liked it very much as well. I did use spinach instead of asparagus, just my preference. I also added tofu, just because that's how I usually get it at the restaurant. My husband would normally eat this with some beef or pork in it but he liked this and is happy to eat a vegetarian version of it, as I'm vegetarian. I found myself adding extra sesame oil and soy sauce but I may have used more noodles than the recipe really called for. Thanks for the lovely recipe!"

Tastes just like the noodles I love at every Korean bbq place, you know, the ones that come as one of several small dishes with the meat you order. I make it just as the recipe dictates, and it's perfect. Add whatever veg/ meat you like or have on hand. I don't know how authentically Korean it will be, but it will likely taste amazing."

"reviewBody": "Kind of strange to have asparagus with japchae, so I replaced it with spinach. This is sort of bland as is, so next time I'll possibly do 1.5x the soy sauce + sugar mixture and double the sesame oil. I also put in a bit of rice vinegar into the sauce mixture, to give it a bit of tang. Be careful not to add too much oil while stir frying (although the noodles stick to the pan easily...) or it'll become a bit too oily. Yummy and much cheaper than buying it at a Korean supermarket!"

I used a whole onion &amp; I was too lazy to cut match-stick carrots, so I shredded them instead (that might have made them a little wet, but it was still good). I used spinach instead of asparagus &amp; fresh mushrooms instead of dried shiitake. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!"
