In my opinion, it's not so much plain, just different from the strongly spiced rices others might be used to. This is an excellent base for fried rice recipe, as well. My only differences were I used coconut oil, and I didn't put in peas as I dislike peas. That's all."

Used all chicken broth and shredded carrots with the peas. Simple but just enough flavor to compliment a stronger flavored maincourse. Enjoyed will make again."

The only things I changed on a regular basis, is that I use chicken or beef bouillon in my water for more flavor, which means I can cut down on the salt added to the recipe. I also usually add pepper to taste, as well, and sometimes substitute corn for peas. I will probably never use another recipe for white rice."

I didn't measure the oil, onions, or peas, so I likely added more than the recipe calls for. We had some breeze coming into the kitchen and blowing the gas flames on the stove top so I had to adjust the cooking a bit. Brought to a boil with the lid on and then turned down to simmer with lid still on, for about 20 minutes. Then moved off heat and let sit for 20 more minutes with lid still on. I also added a bit of fresh basil.\n\nFluffy, moist, tasty, mild rice that was perfect for our Chinese shrimp dish."

Just enough flavor from the onion and the bay leaf. This was an excellent foundation for \"Halibut with Tomato-Basil Sauce,\" also from this site. Very pleased!"

I did not have any peas so I grated 2 large carrots and added to garlic and onion. Added 1 1/2 cups of jasmine rice and stirred to coat. Poured in 2 cups chicken broth and 1 cup water. Added 1 bay leaf, chopped fresh basil, and some ground black pepper. I did not add salt since I used the chicken broth which is high in sodium. Brought to a slight boil then put on low until all liquid was gone stirring occasionally. Took off heat and covered for 40 minutes. It was the best rice I have ever cooked. Thank you for the base recipe. You can do so many variations with this one. Enjoy!"

"reviewBody": "This is good if you like mushy rice, but if you like the grains to still be solid and separate, reduce water to 1.5 ratio instead of 2. So that would be 2 1/4 cup liquid for 1 1/2 cup rice. Other rices do need more water, but jasmine and basmati do better with less. I do love peas in my rice, so great idea."

"reviewBody": "3 things are missing from this recipe: minced garlic, fresh sliced mushrooms and chicken or beef broth (depending on what you serve the rice with). Add the minced garlic with the onions to saute. To the onion/garlic saute I also added salt, pepper,basil and a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes. I added 1 cup of sliced fresh mushrooms with the peas, rices, etc. For 1 cup of rice, I used 1 cup water and 1 cup broth. My rice was slightly under cooked, so I'd recommend letting the rice simmer for about 10 mins before reducing heat. Had the rice been perfectly cooked and with these 3 additions, this recipe would be 5 stars."

The preparation is great- I have struggled for years successfully boiling rice (the one thing I could never make) and the instructions here brought perfect results. Allowing the rice to sit after cooking seemed to be the trick. I would suggest making this with a strong flavoured side; I made it with Chinese Roast Pork and Chinese Green Bean Stir Fry, both from this site. The strong flavours of these two dishes and resulting sauce from the pork combined for a fantastic dinner and my guests raved. \n\nSo, great recipe, easy preparation, foolproof cooking instructions and very subtle flavour. I'll certainly make it again to accompany a stronger dish."

However I did use a combination of frozen peas and carrots because I did not have just peas. I also buy authentic \"jasmine rice\" from the international section of the grocery store ( mine comes from Thailand) which I believe tastes better than the ones you can buy in the regular rice section of your supermarket and it's cheaper! I also made it as an a side to a wonderful asian chicken recipe I have which I may share on here later. WONDERFUL RICE DISH! Thanks Brian!"

I wouldn't suggest this unless your meat has a lot of flavor. Also, all I had was a can of peas and carrots. I though this needed more vegetables though and next time I would double the amount."
