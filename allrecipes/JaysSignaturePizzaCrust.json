Everyone that I have made pizza for have loved it, even the children at the childcare center where I work at and many parties nd for home. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would! All I can say is it stands up to as many toppings as you want. It also freezes well. I usually make a single batch for home, divide it in half and freeze one ball of dough. Later I will pull. It out of the freezer, let it thaw, and use a little flour to roll it out on. It will make two large crusts that are not too thin or too thick, they are just right! Just know that you an roll them out pretty thin, they will rise in baking."

I've also used bread flour for a chewier crust. It beats out the just add water dough mixes and premade doughs. It's easily customizable so you can add spices, honey, etc to add flavor if this is too bland. This makes enough for 2- 12\" pizzas"

I followed the recipe exactly and it kinda tasted like cardboard crust. It makes a lot of dough. I got enough for 2 large pizzas. Will use the other half of the dough for breadsticks but not pizza. Won't be making this again."

I added 1 1/2 teaspoon of this in with the oil which was added to the yeast. I added 4 1/3 cups of flour to the yeast to mix in my Kitchen Aid mixer and mixed for 2 minutes pushing down dough if needed. Then I mixed it on speed 2 for 5 minutes to complete the kneeding. I added 1/3 to 1/2 cup of flour to my counter and continue kneeding the dough with my hands for another few minutes until it was just slightly sticky. Then I set it in an oiled bowl to rise. Best crust ever!"

"reviewBody": "I love this recipe. I think I've been using this recipe upwards of 20 yrs. In the area of PA I'm in they seriously lack good pizza and those that were good went on the cheap during the pandemic. Thanks to Jay I can make pizza upwards as good as I used to get in NYC. To make it so easy I use the dough cycle of my bread machine and it comes out awesome. I play with what I put in the dough from fresh garlic to honey to a variety of spices. I generally use bread flour and milk instead of water. Next time I'm going to try it with half bread flour and half sprouted whole grain flour. \n\nTry this recipe, you'll love it..and don't be afraid to play with it. It's a very flexible basic recipe.\n\nThe thing that holds pizza back from being as good as a good NYC pizzeria is it's impossible to buy the best mozzarella, name brand Grande, retail. No fault of the crust on this."

I used pans so they got to rise for about 15min before topping. I brushed the crust with some olive oil and garlic too. Baked as recommended and the pizza was absolutely FANTASTIC! Highly recommend this recipe"

The dough expanded a bit outside of the plastic wrap but the ziplock bag kept it contained, and had a yeasty/beer-like smell - apparently is totally normal. Next time I will split regular quantity of dough in half to make 2 smaller, flatter pizzas and pre-bake the crust to get it browner."

"reviewBody": "So easy and very good. It is a lot of dough. I use a large pizza stone and a small stone. I pat the dough out onto parchment paper, let rise before adding toppings. It’s easy to slide a cookie sheet under the pizza to transfer it to the hot pizza stones. As another reviewer suggested it’s best to cook it on a lower rack to avoid burning the toppings. We use sun dried tomatoe pesto instead of pizza sauce and it makes a flavorful pizza."

"reviewBody": "FIRST TIME PIZZA MAKER: This was my first time making a pizza crust, and im glad i went with this recipe.\nTHE DOUGH MIX:\n I took the advice of other reviewers and added some garlic + onion powder ( about a tablespoon of each) and half cup Parmesan cheese to the oil mixture. When you're kneading the dough, the garlic and onion will be very fragrant, but not to worry--- when your pizza comes out, you may wish you had put more b/c your crust will just be flavorful and not super-duper garlic-y. \nPIZZA PANS: \nI used 2 regular/rectangular, large aluminum baking pans to put my pizzas in. I oiled the pans and generously \"floured\" them with Semolina flour(a substitute-- i didnt have any cornmeal-- you can google other substitutes). maybe will seem unnecessary to you, but help with texture of crust/evenness of baking the pizza. \nBAKING TIME:\nafter pressing the dough into the oiled/ semolina floured pans, I prebaked my dough for about 8 mins and then took then out to throw regular Marinara sauce on top, a little bit of jack cheese, clumps of fresh mozzarella, mushrooms, sausage. I baked for a longer time than the directions said... about 40 mins total. the center seems more crispy on outside and soft on inside throughout when i baked for longer. \nMARINARA, LESS IS MORE:\nLike some websites mentioned, i totally agree that even though you want to put more tomato sauce on the pizza... DONT. That will make it very soggy-- i took this advice and totally great pizza."

"reviewBody": "I've made this recipe a couple times, pretty standard pizza dough. I add about half a tsp of baking powder for extra fluffiness. I also add quite a bit more salt than the recipe calls for, I've been burned too many times by bland dough. I also set the oven to 450 instead of 425 for about 10 minutes depending on the size/thickness of dough and toppings on pizza. This dough rises nicely so I usually roll it out on the thinner side and make 2 pizzas out of the recipe. I also like to brush melted butter on the crust before baking for some more flavour and colour. I remove pizza from pan almost as soon as pizza is finished cooking (bottom is usually golden perfection) and place on cooking racks so it doesnt get soggy."

Then, put all the fixings on and baked at the same temperature for 12 to 15 minutes. Perfect! I did also use olive on on my pans and liberally scattered cornmeal on the pans before placing the dough on. I will definitely use this recipe again as it was crusty on the bottom and perfect on the inside."

There is actually no bread in the stores either so it was innovative when I was able to make my own pizza bread. I substituted straight flour for 1/3 part tortilla mix in the bag and whole wheat flour. It turned out good. Also, I added 3 tbs. of brown sugar instead of the called for 1 tbs. This dish was delish and made making my first pizza easy, plus, there wasn't any weight gain like if I had gone to a commercial pizza place. I added so many vegetables on top that it was like a deep dish pizza pie. Thank you All recipes for the recipe!!"
