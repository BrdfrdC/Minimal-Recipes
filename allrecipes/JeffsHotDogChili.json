It was so greasy following the recipe but I saved it at the end drained most of the grease off.. also it is a little runny if you want it thicker add tomato paste a little at a time until you get the consistency you like. my advice though cook the burger first drain it then put all in the pot to simmer for the 20 mins and you will have a decent, fast hotdog chili I tried this one because I didn't have any fresh onions or peppers on hand that I do with my version.. just had spices on hand today."

"reviewBody": "Made this last minute for a quick chili dog dinner. I was looking for a hot dog chili similar to our Varsity chili dogs’ in Atlanta. This wasn’t exact but was very good so I’m definitely saving it! I made it to the letter since it was a first try and the only thing I’d change would be to leave out the sugar. I think the ketchup has plenty. For those saying it was runny, I worried about that too, but boiled the heck out of it on medium for about 25 minutes and it was perfect. I did blot the top to get some of the grease out - not sure how to avoid that &amp; get the right consistency. Using the potato masher worked great. My husband gobbled his chili dogs up - success!!"

We had it once with chili dogs (for that one I used half the meat but still the same sauce), and we'll have it tonight with some spicy cheddar biscuits we got from our neighbors. It's delicious! I didn't have any issues with it being runny, even using half the meat. I just simmered it until it was thick enough. OH I did omit the sugar. I'm sure it would taste just fine with it, I just try to eat fairly low carb so the amount of sugar in the ketchup is just fine for me."

I used 85% chop meat and cooked it in the water and it was pretty good. If you used 80% chop meat I think it would be too oily. \nI loved how you could change the quantity of the ingredients depending on how much you want to make, it made it so simple.\nWonderful recipe I'll be making it again."

The first time I listened to the suggestions in the comments and it was ok, the second time I followed the directions and it came out much better.\n\nBrowning the beef changed the consistency, it made it much more clumpy and dry so use lean beef and don't brown/drain. I also used beef broth which overwhelmed the other flavors instead of the water which would bring out the flavor of the spices.I ended up with something closer to Taco Bell ground beef both in flavor and consistency. It wasn't bad, just not what I wanted.\n\nThe second time I followed the directions exactly and it came out much tastier and with a more sloppy consistency."
