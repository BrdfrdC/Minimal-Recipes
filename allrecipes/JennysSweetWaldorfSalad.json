,"description": "I couldn&#39;t ever find the perfect Waldorf salad - one that wasn&#39;t too mayonaise-y tasting, yet one that still held enough of the original flavor to be called a Waldorf. So I mixed and matched and experimented, and finally came up with a perfect twist on the classic Waldorf Salad recipe. Now I get requests for it at every family get together!"

I can't stand Granny Smith apples, so I used a large Ambrosia apple, a large red delicious apple and a couple of Golden Delicious apples. I used 2 Great Value Vanilla Yogurts (6 oz. each), and Great Value Cranberries with Honey Roasted Pecans instead of just regular almonds. Since the nuts and cranberries were sweetened already, I did not add the white sugar and added the brown to my taste.....a little at first, then more later after chilling and tasting."

I apologize I had to make a few changes because of the ingredients I had on hand but this is still a 5 star salad. I couldn't find plain yogurt so I used vanilla and cut out the brown sugar and cut back on the white sugar by a bit. I didn't have a pear or almonds so improvised by adding an extra apple and used toasted walnuts. I didn't add raisins which is a personal preference. I like how versatile this recipe is and it will be my go to for Waldorf Salad. Next time I'll plan ahead and use a pear and almonds. Thanks for sharing this recipe Jenny."

Had no plain yogurt so substituted chobani 2% pineapple, mayo and added 3 tablespoons of lite sour cream. Trying to make it healthier, cut out all sugar, raisins, and used 1/2 cup of walnuts instead of almonds. Mixed dressing and fruit separately until chilled completely and then mixed 1 hour prior to dinner. Turned out wonderful and just slightly sweet, there was just a hint of the pineapple. Next time I may add jicama for extra crunch."

"reviewBody": "Great Recipe!! Very simple and it looks great too. I made it exactly as listed and added some red grapes. I made it about 4 hours ahead of time so the fruit would chill in a separate bowl, and the dressing chilled in another. Family and special visitors loved it. I did pay attention to the many reviews that indicated too much dressing. I simply put the dressing in a small pitcher and let everyone pour it on their own serving and mix it in. Some opted to go without dressing. This approach worked perfectly. I do agree, it would have been way too much liquid for the fruit if I had poured it all into the serving bowl. This way, the leftover fruit will keep much better as well. The leftover dressing - it is soo yummy. It is going on oatmeal in the morning. Next time, the only thing I will change is to eliminate the pear, and add a variety of apples since my husband, who doesn't like pears at all, was able to detect it in the mix (I thought he would miss it!). Love it!"

I also substituted a red pear, because I couldn't find an asian pear. If you are making this the night before, save the marshmallows to add shortly before serving as they will melt overnight in the dressing."

One of the children really turned up his nose when he saw it, so I told him to just touch it with his finger and taste and if he didn't like it, the others could have more. As soon as he tasted it, his eye lit up and he said, \"Grandma, is this dessert!?!\" The only change I made, was the use of vanilla yogurt since I didn't have plain. I think I will continue to use vanilla. VERY good recipe!"

I followed another user's suggestion and used cottage cheese instead of the yogurt (because that's what I had on hand).

While it was o.k. for hubby and I to have as a side with lunch, it's nothing that I would serve if I were entertaining guests."

"reviewBody": "This salad turned out great! However, I used the recipe more as general guidelines than strict instructions. I used 5 small/medium Fuji apples, two large stalks of celery, 1.5 cups of grapes, and 1 cup of dried cranberries. I left out the pear and raisins and used 3/4 cup of walnuts instead of the almonds. I followed the dressing instructions fairly closely except that I used fat-free mayo and reduced all the ingredients by around 1/3. (I also tossed the chopped apples with the lemon juice so they wouldn't brown.) I appreciate a recipe that can be tinkered with this much and still turn out so delicious. The cinnamon was a great touch. The salad was almost too sweet, so I'd recommend taking care with the sugar, especially if you use the full amount of raisins and dried cranberries."

Then I used a 1/4 cup yogurt, a 1/4 cup mayo, a half a lemon juiced and a sprinkle of white sugar (possibly 1 Tbsp). It was perfect! Thank you Jenny for sharing your twist on a Waldorf!

The flavor was very good and I didn't have the fat - and way less sugar. So mine is definitely for the health-conscious!"

Well, I followed the recipe but added the pinon nuts. Another thing I did was I left out the rasins and used red seedless grapes instead of the green.
