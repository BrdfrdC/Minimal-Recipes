"reviewBody": "This was beautiful. I was most nervous about the boiling time- I usually let my eggs spend 10 minutes or so under rapidly boiling water to make my hard-boiled eggs, so I was a bit unsure about the instructions here. This technique produces a very soft, bright yellow yolk that i'm not used to- it felt undercooked to me. But lo and behold, by the time everything got chopped up and combined, the salad tasted perfect.\n\nI like to add a healthy pinch of paprika and a tiny amount of cayenne, but the salad is also great as is."

Glad I did, the egg salad really came out just right."

However, after doubling the dressing, I still didn't have enough for 12 eggs, so I ended up tripling the dressing to get enough for 12 eggs. I didn't have a lemon, so I used 1 tsp lemon juice, and thought that gave it just enough zing. I also added 1 chopped celery stalk to add some crunch. Overall it has good flavor, and I'll be making this again."

My version I use 1/2 teaspoon Capers chopped in the food processor (strong flavor, so a little goes a long way), instead of onions, and since not always I have lemons or limes in my pantry I substitute with approx. 1-1/2 teaspoons of Cider Vinegar. If you don't have Dijon on hand, just use 1 teaspoon of Yellow Mustard. Haven't tried it in a sandwich with avocado, but will try soon."

But, being a huge sushi fan, I replaced the Dijon mustard with wasabi (Japanese horseradish paste). It added a nice kick and I served it on wheat bread with spinach leaves. Delicious!"

My mother in law asked for the recipe and my houseguest who swore he didnt eat egg salad had a couple sandwiches. I think it would be good with a little rooster sauce too. 5 stars."

This recipe can easily be customized to suite anyone's taste. I made it according to the recipe, tasted it then decided to add black pepper, dill weed, celery seed and a little bit of dill relish. This is SO yummy and I will make it many times in the future since DH is such an egg salad fan. Thank you for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "UPDATE: I have a lot of egg salad recipes that I have saved in my inbox, but none fo them seemed to have peaked my interest. This is the one I came back to and that I'm craving for right now! This the only egg salad that I will make from now on. Definitely the best egg salad recipe on this site. OLD REVIEW: The lemon gives a nice refreshing zest to the egg salad, but like many others, I didn't add all the lemon called for in the recipe. I cut about a 1/4 of a lemon which gave me 1-2 tsp of juice. I found it to be plenty for my taste and the dressing wasn't so runny. I used 6 small eggs and it was the right ratio to the dressing. If you decide use the juice of half a lemon, then I recommend that you use large or extra-large eggs for an nice balance. One thing to note that is not mentioned in the recipe, is to run the boiled eggs under cold water several times and/or leaving them in a cold bath for a few minutes, to make it easier to peel (without taking any of the white egg attached to the shell). This is a yummy recipe and I would definitely make it again. The recipe as written seems enough for 2 hungry people, but I would suggest doubling it for a family (only if using small eggs like I did). Thanks for sharing your recipe, Jen!"

"reviewBody": "A really great foundational recipe. The proportions are exactly on. I used the exact amounts called for in the recipe, and it came out perfect. I got about a 1/4 cup of lemon juice from my 1/2 lemon, and I was scared it would be too much, but it was perfect! It cuts the creaminess of the mayo, and you don't really taste the lemon, but it brightens everything up. I had to boil my eggs a little longer, but I live at high altitude, so maybe that has something to do with it. Would be amazing with green olives or capers. Great on crackers, toast, a piece of lettuce, and delicious stuffed in a fresh tomato! I added about 3/4 tsp of salt and a 1/4 tsp of pepper and it seemed right for what I needed it to be. Just a perfect springboarding recipe as the dressing is right on. Refrigerating for an hour or two really helps it come together and mellow out too. I would definitely recommend that. Delicious!"

"reviewBody": "The flavors in this recipe are great-- I love the lightness the citrus adds to the salad. I'm not a huge fan of really creamy salads though, so I cut the mayo down to 3 T. Per others' suggestions, I cut down the lemon juice too (I actually used lime, but it turned out great!)- about 1-1/2 T. I added 1/4 cup finely diced green bell pepper, and 1 finely diced clove of garlic. If you throw the garlic in the lemon juice, it takes the bite out of the garlic, which is nice. I definitely want to try this again-- maybe I'll use the dressing on chicken, and add some curry and raisins."

I was cautious about adding the lemon juice after reading other reviews, but ended up using all the juice from half a lemon as called for in the recipe. I don't see what the problem is. I didn't have any green onions, but I added a little diced red pepper, which was very good. I don't think I would have liked this as much without the added crunch and flavor pop of the peppers. A little diced pickle would probably push this over the top for me. Yum."

Even with having to make these substitutions, this egg salad was incredible! I will make it again and again. To make it a bit healthier, I used olive oil mayo rather than the regular stuff."
