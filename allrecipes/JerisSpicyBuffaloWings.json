Recipe says it serves 8, not sure if 2 lbs will feed 8 people. I halved the recipe into a pound (12 wings) and it was a perfect size serving for my wife and myself."

I used parchment paper on the pan to prevent sticking and make cleanup easier. I also cut up some chicken tenderloins (too small, unfortunately) for some boneless wings. If you're going to do that, either use the tenderloin intact or at most halved. I'll be making this recipe over and over again."

"reviewBody": "Best wings! Spiced the wings overnight, turning them occasionally, and when ready to cook blotted them dry before rolling in flour. Knock off the flour and when browning them there was enough flour to make a nice casing. I put them in a foil-lined pan and let them sit, uncovered, until baking time. Next time I will crinkle up foil to put them on to prevent sticking. Letting them cool didn't hurt at all. They stayed crisp and the full baking time was perfect. I think the vinegar with the salts was a great idea and the garlic, butter and Franks Hot Original sauce was perfect. I have four hidden to eat later;-) /served with blue cheese dressing and celery sticks."

"reviewBody": "Just made this exactly as written. These are the BEST I've ever had - restaurant or homemade. I used Louisiana Gem Habanero Pepper Sauce for the hot pepper sauce and Trader Joe's organic unfiltered Apple Cider Vinegar. I also bought a fresh brand new can of Crisco shortening. Make sure you have the large bowls, baking sheet (I used a jelly roll pan), skillet, paper towel-lined platter, and serving dish out and ready because things happen fast towards the end. I had them marinate in the fridge overnight. I have two more pounds of wings in my Costco bag of frozen wings and I will make another batch using this same recipe. Perfect amount of heat and so delicious! Didn't feel the heat on my lips until I was done ;-) Thanks Jeri!!!"

I baked them as directed the only change I made was to brush some of them with Sweet baby Ray's kickin bourbon wing sauce and glaze. which was pretty darned good. but if I hadn't used this marinade on them first, it would have been pretty darned blawzay! I will use this from now on. Best tasting wing I have had in YEARS, even hubby loved them. Thank you so much for this GREAT recipe!!"

"reviewBody": "I absolutley love this recipe. It is so simple. I made some for when I was visiting my family and they gobbled it down before I even had a chance, thats how good the wings are. I normally use chicken breast and make cubes because I hate my lips being on fire. With the 2lbs of chicken I do double the recipe except for the butter and I never use just one clove of garlic maybe 3 or 4 cloves depending on the size of the clove and how much I am making. This is by far one of the easiest and tastiest recipes."
