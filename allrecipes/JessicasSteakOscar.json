"reviewBody": "This steak Oscar is similar to a recipe I did a few years ago for Christmas only I used crawfish etouffee. The concept of the recipe is great and it makes a beautiful holiday meal with a nice bread on the side. I would suggest adding some lemon to the crab and maybe some garlic powder along with salt and pepper to the steaks because I thought it was a little bland. Otherwise, my family seemed to have loved it. Plates were clean as a whistle when they were done."

I made the Bernaise sauce first, then stir fried the asparagus in garlic butter and when all was ready, we BBQ the steaks. Our company raves about the steaks as well. Sublime! Thank you for a great recipe."

I did it as a special dinner for my Husbands' Birthday and made sure to get a great cut from my local meat processing market and WOW! I separated the potatoes and the asparagus from the steak, but covered the asparagus with sauce, too. Thank you so much Ms. Jessica for such a great recipe that even a novice can make amazingly ;-)"
