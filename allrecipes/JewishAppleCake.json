I accidentally burned the bottom of the cake and thought it was ruined - it was not - just cut off the burnt part. This was a welcome home cake for my husband, so I felt a little sad about it burning, but he really liked the flavor and moistness of the cake. Next time I will be more careful with the bake time."

If not, it needs about 15 more minutes."

Moist, perfect texture, just the right everything. I covered it with a caramel sauce, which was the right touch. Served it with a side of vanilla or butterbrickle ice cream. I followed the tips of the lady who made it for 35 years. She definitely knew what she was doing. I believe those tips are the first listed on the tips. Great fall dessert!!"

"reviewBody": "Made it to try something new as opposed to the usual pineapple/carrot bundt I always make. Tastes really good! I would recommend adding more apples. I added about 4 small/medium sized Gala apples and wish I would have added more. Next time 6-7 would hit the spot. I'm also thinking to make 3 layers next time. One on the very bottom, pour batter, then another, pour batter and then the last. Then, there would be apples on the top of the bundt. Also, if you want it to turn out more moist, add 2 cups of flour and I added a 400ml can of crushed pineapples. I also substituted orange juice for 1/2 cup of lychee nectar. I also reduced the amount of sugar to about 1 cup because the pineapple gives it a more natural sweetness to compensate."

Because of the wetness of the apples it may fake you out into baking it longer than necessary. I would use a pan that you are familiar with and, honestly, expect realistically between 55-110 minutes. Heavier/darker pans will give you a hard crust which is not bad, just not what you may want."

The only things I changed were that I followed one of the other comments and did 3 layers of batter with the apples inbetween (batter/apples/batter/apples/batter) which keeps all of the apples nice and moist inside the cake instead of dried out on top (personal preference). I also used 4 apples instead of 3 because they were small and mixed the cinnamon/sugar mixture with the sliced apples in a bowl instead of sprinkling it on top. I baked it for exactly 75 minutes and it was perfect."

(Apples mixed in unmeasured sugar and cinnamon, add juice from apples, more apples, 3 layers of each, 1 tbsp vanilla, order of ingredients.) The batter is very thick and delicious.

My husband loved them so much I had to make another batch just so I could make more muffins! I made the recipe as stated except I followed the suggestions of sprinkling the sugar and cinnamon on the apples and letting them sit about ten minutes before I used them. I also reserved about 2 to 3 tsp cinnamon sugar mixture and added it to the batter so the whole cake (and muffins!) would have a cinnamon sugar flavor to it. I filled the muffin cups up about a quarter way with batter, put the apple filling in, then topped it with more batter to fill them up to about 3/4 the way and then baked them about 20-25 min. They came out so moist and had a wonderful apple cinnamon taste. I loved the apple filling in the middle of the muffins!I'm definitely going to save this recipe and make more muffins in the future! Its a 5 star recipe and my husband agrees!"

I followed this recipe to the letter and the dough was like greasy bread dough, it said pour into the mold...but this you had to lay out it was so stiff. It didn't even rise, the apples were overdone sticky, and the cake is so heavy it could be used as a weapon. Worst recipe I have ever followed. I should have stayed with my own recipe instead of trying this one."

"reviewBody": "This was my first bundt cake and I must say I am quite pleased with it. The texture is awesome - crispy on the outside and moist and tender inside. I would not recommend making 1 1/2 times the batter as some have suggested. The volume of the cake is just right as is - it bakes into a perfect ring shape. I guess if you wanted more of a volcano shape, you could use more batter, although I'd be afraid it would overflow as it baked. My personal tweaks were as follows: I diced my apples (12 oz. - about 3 medium) and tossed them with 1 tablespoon cinnamon and 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of using the 2 tsp. cinnamon and 5 tsp. white sugar, then folded them into the batter. Having no orange juice, after wracking my brain I decided to use Triple Sec instead (1/2 cup), which seemed to do nicely. I also increased the vanilla to 1 tablespoon and added 1 tsp. nutmeg for extra flavor. Finally, I topped the cake with a simple caramel glaze (1/4 brown sugar + 1/4 cup butter + 1 tsp. milk), which was awesome. The only thing I'd do differently next time is increase the amount of apples (probably a full 16 oz.) and this cake would be truly perfect. BTW, mine baked in only 65 minutes, so keep a close eye on it."

For Apple Cake: Used 6 medium apples, 1/2 c for the 5 t sugar, OJ 1/2 cup, no salt. Baked it in a 9x13 glass pan, 50-60 minutes. I have had this recipe for ages, just a bit different than what is posted...still I am sure all variations are good! I also added chopped walnuts to the top! Put the batter in first, then apples, then sugar cinnamon mix, then the walnuts."

I have made recipes where the apples were folded into the batter, not in a layer in the middle and a layer on top, so I think I will stick with that. That being said, the cake part was tasty."

Instead of using 3 cups all purpose flour, I used 1.5 cups of all purpose flour and 1.5 cup of whole wheat flour. I also used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup of Splenda. I combined the cinnamon with 5 tbsp (yes Tablespoons) of Splenda Brown sugar blend and mixed it thru the sliced apples (I used 5 apples), setting them aside while I mixed the rest of the ingredients."

"reviewBody": "This cake looked really good for Rosh Hashanah and the reviews seemed positive. I used the suggestion of applesauce for oil and Rum for OJ and I also used Splenda for sugar, however my cake came out very dense and the cake part wasnt flavorful at all. I would add 50% more batter too, because double is too much for the pan but as is is too little to coat the apples. The apples were tasty, but then again its hard to screw up cid/sugar apples in the oven unless you burn it. I also baked it for just 50 minutes. It was so much work that I probably wont attempt a re-do. Oh well."

Keep checking doneness with a butter knife not with toothpick because it's too deep to reach bottom. I used brown sugar for the 5tsp to mix with cinn to replace the white sugar. I also used an extra apple. It would not be enough with three unless they are huge. This type of dense (pound cake) type is better served the day after baking. But is still tastes good the same day just not the same texture. Very yummy recipe."

The only problem I've ever had is that one of the first times I made it, the cake stuck in the pan and broke while taking it out. Since then, I've always greased the pan with a mixture of equal parts flour, shortening, and vegetable oil, and the cake literally falls out of the pan every time. I also use this to grease the pan for other types of baking with great results. I usually glaze the finished cake with a mixture of icing sugar, milk, and cinnamon."

Also, if you want the apples to be softer, cook them with cinnamon, sugar and a splash of rum before hand over the stove."

I also used apple juice instead of orange (didnt have any) and to that I added the juice of one lemon and a swig of beer (I was drinking it and thought it might be good). I also added lemon to the apples mixed with nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves and sugar. I mixed the dry ingredients (except for the sugar which I mixed in with the eggs, oil and vanilla) separately from the wet and then added them to the mixing bowl cup by cup, alternating between the wet and dry ingredients. The batter looked like velvet and left ribbons across the top! I also put the sugar covered apples in the bottom of the bunt pan and mixed the juice from the apple/spice mixture into the batter before pouring the batter on top of the apples. The apples caramelized and each bite just melts in the mouth!!"
