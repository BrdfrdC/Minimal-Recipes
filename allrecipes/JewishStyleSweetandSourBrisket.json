I still sliced it all in a casserole dish when it was done, poured the juice over it to marinate, covered the casserole dish in aluminum foil and put it in the fridge overnight. I reheated it covered in the oven for 10 minutes and had it for dinner the next day. It was still a winner! Everyone loved it. Even my youngest who is a picky eater decided to have it in a sandwich and ate it all that way."

I have also used other cuts of meat, pork chops with and with out bone trim off all fat the first time I use the chops there was a larger amount of grease in the sauce. Also use flank steak comes out just like the brisket, going to try chicken next. I use more onions and extra sauce, there usually isnt a lot of leftovers. I’m making this for Christmas dinner I’ll upload a photo."

It was close but not quite as good. In any event, I had a 2.5 lb brisket &amp; made exactly as stated (I did not reduce the sauce ingredients). After 3 hours I figured it was done, rested it then sliced. It was tasty but not as tender as I had hoped. I sliced the leftover beef &amp; refrigerated it overnight in the sauce In a casserole dish. Day 2, I heated the casserole at 350 for 40 minutes....it was definitely better...so tender &amp; flavorful. So I think slicing it &amp; waiting a day to eat it adds a lot to this recipe."

This does turn a piece of inexpensive meat/brisket into a very good dish. I trimmed the brisket of excess fat diligently before cooking. The 'rest' overnight in the sauce, I'm guessing, is to infuse and 'pickle' the beef in the vinegar? I will make this again and cook more toward the 3.5 hour time. Thanks for a memorable recipe."

The trick is to be patient and slow simmer as long as it takes to get fork tender, which could be over 3 hours. I used a thin cut of Angus beef brisket. Remember to sear it first on both sides before adding the other ingredients. I used a Dutch oven with a cover. I substituted apple cider vinegar and used 2 large vidalia onions. Thank you for this recipe! You've made a cook of me at last!"

I would’ve liked to taste the actual meat and not just the sauce with the texture of meat."

I do have to admit that my review is mostly for the sauce, because unfortunately I did not have beef brisket and used chuck roast (came out delicious cooking it as the recipe states, though only for around 2 hours). The sauce has a delicious home-made barbecue taste to it, but I personally had to make a slurry (2T flour + 2C of the sauce) so it would be more on the gravy-ish side. This will be made again!"

Also I tiny sliced small onion and put it on the bottom of aluminum form, then put a brisket and pour sauce over it. Covered form and baked for 2hrs at 375F. Then sliced brisket and baked another 2hrs. Came out supper! ! ! However when I reheated it next day it came a little bit dry.
