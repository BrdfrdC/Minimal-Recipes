"reviewBody": "I use this recipe as base. Usually for a “clean out the fridge “ casserole . Great to have on hand for weekday quick snacks, meals. Microwaves well. It’s the best breakfast casserole I’ve ever made. The secret is to use approx 10 slices of bread . Cut them - then tear them smaller . Also, use the hand mixer for the eggs and milk ( or half and half ) so that it’s more easily absorbed by the bread , while you let it set OVERNIGHT in the fridge. DO NOT OVERCOOK . Mine took maybe 30 mins . WATCH IT and you’ll have a dense , but light custardy egg bake. Turkey bacon also holds up well to this recipe. This last time I used that, sautéed crimini w/ onion, threw in spinach, and for cheese I tore up pepper Jack slices . The layering can be random but put most of the bread in the bottom . With tge layering competed , make sure all of the bread is pressed into the egg mixture and refrigerate. YUMMY!!!!"

I made it again because I like to meal prep and this time made it with shredded hashbrowns. It was still a very good recipe. Next time I will add two more eggs. But the recipe on its own is really good and you have to let it cook because the center takes a really long time to cook."

I’m not real found of the texture of mushrooms so I chopped them a little finer and I added 1/2 of a 4 oz can of chopped mild green chilies for added flavor. For making half of the recipe place in 8”x8” buttered glass pan and bake at 325 degrees for 25-30 minutes. Enjoy!"

Plenty of flavor thanks to the sausage, but I recommend keeping a good hot sauce handy to add some kick after serving up."

I use 11 eggs, 1 16oz package of regular sausage and an 8 oz package of hot sausage. I add 1 can of diced green chiles, and 1 medium seeded tomoatoe. Super easy and delicious. Just make sure to make extra copies of the recipe because you will be asked for it after your guests taste this dish. P.S. It makes amazing leftovers too. I am eating a piece as I type this. :)"

It came out great - even without being able to allow any time for the egg-milk mixture to really soak into the bread before baking! I used extra cheese to top it, but did wait to top it off with the cheese until the last 15 minutes of bake time. The cheese topping was still nice and gooey that way - not in any way overcooked and rubbery. I will definitely serve this delicious brunch casserole again!"

I added green bell peppers to the optional veggie list and kept out the mushrooms. As far as the bread, I cubed a braided loaf of brioche bread. My husband and toddler loved this dish and it’s been added to the keeper list."

Notes: I substituted 6-8 cups frozen hash browns (thawed) for the bread; I used a dozen eggs (instead of ten); I substituted 1/2 cup half-and-half for 1/2 cup milk (next time, I’ll substitute 1 cup for 1 cup). I also froze one casserole, while I made the other the night before. The frozen casserole was more watery, but I drained it off before serving and it did not seem to significantly effect the flavor. I served with cinnamon rolls and banana bread. Delicious!"

"reviewBody": "I've been making this for several years. The reason for refrigerating overnight is to give the egg-milk mixture a chance to soak the bread... it seems to meld it. I sometimes make it in 2 pans and freeze one (already baked). Let it warm enough to cut into servings (or freeze in servings) and nuke it for about a minute. Salsa or sliced tomatoes make a nice side. I find 12 eggs and another 1/2 cup of half and half work well when dividing into 2 pans. Be careful with the salt if you're using sharp cheddar."

I'm glad I didn't read reviews and prepared the recipe as is. It turned out perfect. I did not refrigerate ahead of time so I have to wonder if that impacts the reviews of those saying it was too wet. I baked for 55 min using 10 eggs and 3 cups whole milk, but no tomatoes or peppers. I used the broccoli instead. The family loved it. The only minor change was that I finished up a bag of cheese which added about 1/2 cup. Saving to favorites and will be made again. Thanks!"

Cut back a little on the milk - used 1.25 cups instead of 1.5 since others said theirs was soggy and sautéed red bell pepper and onion with the sausage. Baked for 50 minutes - not soggy at all. We are nearly at sea level though so that might have had an effect. My husband didn't think he was going to like it so I was surprised when he said \"yeah, you can make this again, I'll eat it\" From him, that was a big compliment - he's pickier than a five year old when it comes to what he'll eat."

The person who taught me this recipe years ago also spread a layer of Campbells condensed cream of mushroom soup (right out the can) on the top of the last layer before sprinkling with cheese.

I layered the bottom with one crescent roll tube followed by half the ingredients. Then I repeated the layer with the second crescent roll followed by the cubed bread. If I were to do it again, I would probably put the cubed bread beneath the second layer of crescent rolls so that they don't stick out as much. The very top layer was cheese.\n\nI made this overnight and left in the fridge. Then, I baked it the next morning and it was fine! I didn't have to pre-bake the crescent rolls either.

I followed the recipe according to a teenager's requirements: eggs, cheddar cheese, sausage, bread and a little spice. However, I used cubed Sourdough and Italian bread combined. The sourdough was day old, very day old actually. I did not experience the soggy center as some reviewers did but did cook it for 60 to 70 minutes. There were NO leftovers. I did make it the night before."
