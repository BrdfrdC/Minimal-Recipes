Used only 1 pound of sausage and about 2 cups of cheese. 1/4 cup each of celery, green pepper and onion and almost 2 cups of mix made 22 sausage balls. Found a dip recipe made with sour cream, mayo, and grainy mustard. Delish!"

"reviewBody": "I've been making these for 20 years. All my co-workers and family request them at the holidays. My tips to make them perfect: 1. let the sausage come to room temperature before trying to mix everything, but you will still have to get in there and use your hands to mix (use the biggest bowl you have). 2. Mince the onion and celery and garlic really fine. Don't leave them out, they really improve the taste. 3. Don't use any other type of sausage than Jimmy Dean and they won't be too greasy. And for god's sake, don't pre-cook the sausage! 4. Make sure to use Baking Mix (like Bisquick or Pioneer). Plain flour will not work! You will have golf balls. 5. Bake them on parchment paper on baking sheets. Anything else and they will stick (because of the cheese). 5. Make the balls a uniform size. About an inch seems to work best for even cooking and a slightly crispy outside. 6. My sister told me a few years ago about adding cream cheese to the ingredients. I add about half of a package and it adds another layer of flavor."

I do add the onion and celery, omit garlic (so far) but do add worcestershire, which puts this right over the top deliciously good. I add about 1/4 c. water to mix together, just drain off any excess, put them in the fridge even overnight, to make it easier to make into balls, and cook on a broiler pan so the grease drains off into the pan below. My hubby loves them too and I will definitely make these again :) Oh yes and flavored sausage makes it perfect, maple is good but sage is the best!!"

I rolled the balls as big as large walnuts. I used parchment paper. they took @ 30 minutes to brown. they were a hit. this recipe will be made many more times!"

We didn't like the sausage balls...I agree with more spice needed and a sweet dipping sauce.\nBaking on a rack over a pan will help with the grease drippings..wouldn't make them again. Glad I tried it before serving to company. Reviews are very helpful."

I always add the additional baking mix and cheese for firmer texture and less grease. I use PAM to spray the baking sheet to prevent the melting cheese from sticking! My son requests these any time we have a reunion."

"reviewBody": "I make these every year for either Christmas Eve or New Years Day. I use panko bread crumbs instead of \"baking mix\". I always mix 1 package of regular with 1 package of hot Jimmy Dean sausage because I found they lack a little kick if you use all regular. \n\nMake them ahead of time and freeze then take out about 15 mins before needing to put in the oven. Spread out into a single layer so they thaw quicker. I keep them fairly small so they are more of a pop 'em size. If you go smaller adjust cooking time to 15 minutes!\n\nI have had people ask for something to dip them in but I generally dont serve with a dip. If anything I use a spicy brown or dijon mustard.\n\nTIP: If you bought regular sausage and want some kick add 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for 2lbs of sausage. Mix well!"

I've used extra spices if I don't have a hot sausage. They are a top favorites and everyone loves them. Anyone else have a problem with them sticking to pan? Still trying to work out that small problem. They Bake well from frozen and so are a great make ahead appetizer or to have on hand."

Added onion to jimmy dean sausage, 1 hot and 1 mild, kneaded in. Then added dry ingredients and kneaded then added cheese[4 cups]. Mixed together and made 1\" balls. Cooked on a broiler pan so the grease would drain off[ A MUST ]. Cooked on 350 until brown on top then turned each ball and browned the other side. They will make you slap yo mama!!!"

It can be made without the onion or celery, although I prefer them, and the pepper can be cut back a little for those who prefer less. The sharp cheddar can be substituted with other cheeses on hand like mild Cheddar, Colby Jack, or Mexican blend. I usually put them on paper towels to soak up some of the grease before moving them to a serving plate. I have been requested to make these during the Holidays many times!"

Be sure to dice the onion &amp; celery very fine. Used the other tip and used my broiler pan so some of the grease ran off. Will make again and again"

They are delicious by themselves, but I prefer to dip them in pancake syrup! My mom makes the variation listed at the bottom of the recipe with more Bisquick, (that's what she prefers to use) and 2 cups of cheese. AMAZING! I recommend to anyone for a nice weekend breakfast, or a party appetizer!"

I can remember sitting and mixing with my hands when I was little! These are the best.. I've had them too dry, too greasy, you name it.. but if your a sausage ball lover this is the recipe.. Never had I had them or made them with onion and celery.. I used hot sausage to give plenty of flavor.. I wanted to spread the celery and onion love and used my mini-processor to finely mice them.. instead of the 2 teas. garlic I used 1 teaspoon of garlic salt and 1 teas. of reg salt.. Used low carb bake mix(carbquik) -- This make these very low-carb.. Yum.. hot or cold grab and go goodness.. For all who are first0time sausage ballers- Yes they are greasy- hey you got 2# of sausage and a # of cheese. what do you think?? drain on paper towels out of oven.. Make sure your baking sheet has sides.... Yes they are stiff to mix.. Put all your ingredients in a bowl and let come to room temp.. These are almost impossible to mix with a spoon.. so... Wash those hands and take off those rings and dig in!! Never tried it but maybe a good processor would do the job... Gonna make some more today... Like I said with the low carb mix these guys are awesome for snacks!!!"
