I have been serving this EXACT recipe to thousands of customers since. I have made enormous sums of money from customers coming in for these amazing cookies and becoming lifelong customers. THIS is the ultimate peanut butter cookie. The balance of ingredients and preparation is something i could spend hours writing about. Do not change one thing. It is sheer perfection. PERIOD."

"reviewBody": "These cookies are absolutely DELICIOUS and not dry! I baked mine @350 for 12 minutes.\n\nThe dough is a little loose. I only ever bake one tray of cookies at a time, and refrigerated the remainder. The next day, the consistency was perfect and could easily be rolled into balls (also then rolled in sugar).\n\nI'd recommend refrigerating the dough for at least a few hours PRIOR to baking."

"reviewBody": "There were a couple missing details. This recipe was a little bit of a rollercoaster cause if you watched the video or skipped out on the reviews, your batter will make you question if you did something wrong. I'm just here to tell you to push through it and share some of the hiccups I ran into. I think the reason some people didn't like this recipe is because we're used to a certain texture when we're done mixing our batter. Mine came out mushy, yet still moldable enough to give me the impression I could have those perfect circles... I had to give up on that idea. There were no fork marks on my cookies. Then when you bake them, everyone's gonna have something different, so keep a close eye on them. (Mine baked at 375 for 16 mins) They looked burned when I took them out yet they felt like marshmallows when I slide them over to the drying racks. They looked clumpy but they tasted great. People weren't dying to know my recipe but I never had any left overs when I left them around my friends or family. Lastly, I used crunchy peanut butter.. just as a preference and they were fine. So, I hoped this helped someone out there."

I let them bake for a few minutes to soften in the oven before pressing them down with the fork due to the crumbly effect that was happening. They turned out soft in the middle and nice and golden after 8 mins in my convection oven. Will definitely make again!"

Unfortunately I have to agree with some of the people who wrote not so great reviews in that they are a bit crumbly although once they cooled they stayed in one piece which was good. As far as flavor, I’m thinking they maybe could’ve used a little more salt and I’m a person who is not a big salt eater. Also, I rolled into the size balls they said to in recipe and I got 50 cookies! I may continue to keep looking for a better peanut butter cookie recipe."

Yes, rolling them into a ball can be a little hard, and they stick to the fork when you press the criss-cross on them. Solution? Dip the fork in flour before pressing each cookie, and for rolling the halls, spray your hands with Pam."

If you make your cookie batter balls too large, then you must cook them longer: the batter spreads as it cooks, but the criss-cross imprint holds well. Do let them cool before transferring to the rack. They batter was very light: like mousse, so keep the balls small and tight. I'd make these again!"

I see other reviewers have described the texture as chalky or pasty. I would agree. The cookies didn’t really spread or raise when baked. This recipe also uses less sugar than most so if you like a not-so-sweet cookie, you might like it. After baking the first pan, I decided to roll the remaining cookies in sugar before baking. We liked those much better, but not enough to make again."
