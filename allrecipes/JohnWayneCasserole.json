No biscuit dough so I used a pie crust,no jalapeÃ±os-substituted chipotle in adobo, and added some leftover rice to the peppers and onions while sautÃ©ing..the basic recipe stood fine. I will try it again as written to taste the difference in the original."

"reviewBody": "Really enjoyed this return to my childhood. My mother made this often and we always cleaned the dish. The only difference was there weren't any canned biscuits back then so she used lightly sweetened (like 2 Tbsp) cornmeal mush for the crust. We also all liked black olives so occasionally she would throw them into the mix. To the lady with the raw onion problem, if you read the recipe again you'll see that you cook the onion with the peppers before you mix all the filling ingredients together. I don't care for raw onions either so I always saute them at least until transparent or I go whole hog and caramelize them. Or like the other cook leave them out and use onion powder."
