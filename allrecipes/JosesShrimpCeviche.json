This ingredient list is pretty close to what is the local's, looked the same after I made a batch.\nTo #Allrecipes: You show yield information with your recipes but I rarely see the actual serving size in the nutritional data. Given that weights may differ from person to person, batch to batch with the same liquid/juicy ingredient when using cups/milliliters makes the \"per serving\" measurement a bit lame. For this recipe I used about a ? cup basis but an actual weight would be better."

"reviewBody": "I ate a seafood ceviche in Dallas a few months ago, and I liked it so much that I wanted to try making it at home. I made this shrimp ceviche for lunch today. Didn't have any avocado and my DH doesn't really like celery in things, so I left those two optional items out. I used my mini food prep machine to finely dice the onion and jalepeno so they wouldn't overpower the taste of the other ingredients. I also cheated and used pre-cooked, shelled, and deveined shrimp. I think it would be even better with fresh shrimp, but that isn't always available here because we're too far from the coast. (Shrimp in the butcher's case here has always been frozen.)\n\nThis was really good. We tried it with cracker, soft tortilla, and tortilla chips. We decided the chips were the best. Thanks for a most enjoyable recipe."

However, it's always the same, tomato and onions and shrimp with a bit of jalapeño, I went searching and found this recipe so I could make it myself. This is a great recipe and I love the use of the avocado. For a really nicely presented ceviche, make sure to dice all the vegetables and the shrimp (as the recipe states). Also, I like to add mango and finely diced zucchini but I omit the celery (not a fan). The dicing takes a while but worth it!"

I would cut the lime juice amount in half when doing it this way. Otherwise, I did the recipe as written, but cutting the ingredients by 25 % to accomodate the 12 oz pkg of shrimp. Everyone absolutely loved it. It makes tons, so for a smaller group, definitely cut it in half. I will be making this again and again."

"reviewBody": "I prepared this recipe mostly as it suggested but needed to let my shrimp marinate longer than they stated because they werem still quite raw after 10 minutes. my limes may not have been acidic enough to work fast. I decided to cut them up smaller and let them go longer until they firmed up a bit and no longer appeared translucent inside. I also grated a small amount of fresh orange peal and added it to my dish along with the juice of 1 orange just before serving. It rounded out the flavors of the dish nicely."

"reviewBody": "Rating is on this particular recipe only. If the shrimp are raw, the time given is NOT even close to long enough. For best results, I leave raw shrimp in lime juice over night in fridge to properly \"cook\" them. At least 6 hours if I don't have the time to make the night before. For quick prep, I use cooked and peeled shrimp. I add other ingredients several hours before serving to let everything absorb and mix flavors.\n \nI also add Mangos to this recipe for some extra flavor."

"reviewBody": "Wow! This was so tasty and simple to prepare. My boyfriends mom is an excellent Hispanic cook and he said these were pretty darn close to hers which are fantastic! We were a little leary about just using the lime juice to cook so I added the shrimp to boiling water for about 2 min then put them in an ice bath before chopping up and adding it to the lime juice. I then let it 'cook' in the lime juice for about 30 min. I followed the recipe as written from there. I served the ceviche on fresh corn tortillas That were baked till crunchy in the oven. Excellent recipe, I know this will become a fresh, healthy staple in our house!"

If I had been brave enough to use fresh, raw shrimp I would let it marinate longer just for good measure even if pink/opaque shrimp is the sign of it being done. I really enjoyed the flavors in this dish, despite not being a big seafood fan. I made it for my husband who loved it."

Easy dish to make for a lot of people. 4lbs of shrimp served about 8 adults and 4 kids. Thank you!"

The recipe is worth making, but I recommend cutting the shrimp up and then letting it marinate all day."
