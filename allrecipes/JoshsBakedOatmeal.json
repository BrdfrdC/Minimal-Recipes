It was delicious, even with all my changes and I filled my 8X8 just fine. I think this recipe is very forgiving and customizable. I would like to try it with less sugar but that's personal preference. It smelled really good baking and I will make this again!"

I also cut back the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and only used 2 Tablespoon of maple syrup. With the crainsins I then added same amount of chopped walnuts. These changes saved over 100 calories per serving. Because of this I ate 2 servings and will consider adding a dollop of plain greek yogurt for tomorrow."

We've had them for a mobile breakfast, re-heated with a side of vanilla ice cream for dessert. Next time, I'll add more dried fruit &amp; more walnuts to make it even more substantial."

We also like to heat it up and serve it with vanilla ice cream for a special evening treat! My family loves cinnamon so I more than double the amount that the recipe calls for. This oatmeal also freezes well but has never lasted more than 2 weeks in my freezer since we tend to devour it pretty quickly . I also like to pour heavy cream on top, customizing it to each persons thickness/thinness preference. This is a delicious recipe that has become a family staple. Thank you joshllorio!"

"reviewBody": "My family really enjoys this. I always DOUBLE the recipe and make a few changes: decreasing the sugar from 1.5 cups to 1 cup, replacing melted butter with non-fat greek yogurt, decreasing maple syrup to 1/4 cup. Sometimes I toss in raisins or dried cherries, sometimes not. The recipe is very flexible and even without the changes it's a great, filling breakfast. I bake it in a 13x9 pan for 45-50 minutes and cut it into 8 servings. Make it and eat it for a week and you won't have to freak out in the morning and end up eating a cinnamon roll and then descending into a shame/stretchy pants spiral. Highly recommend it!"

"reviewBody": "LOVE this recipe! I've made it several times. I decrease the sugar to about 1/2 cup because I increase the fruit by quite a bit. I've done raisin/craisin, raisin/craisin/date/apricot, and just plain craisin. I spread the mixture in a 9x13, so it's a little thinner than it would be if you used a square pan. I usually eat it cold from my hand! As written, I think the recipe would be too sweet for my taste, but it's so easy to adjust the sugar to make it work for you. Thanks for this easy breakfast I can make on the weekend and enjoy all week!"

I don't like the \"soup\" method of making oatmeal, hence why this recipe works so good for me.\n\nI usually split the recipe in half using the calculator and round down. There are no fresh cranberries where I am. Here's the current adaptation:\n\n[DISCLAIMER: Half recipe!!!]\n\nSo it's...\n1 cup rolled oats\n1/4 brown sugar\n1 tbsp honey (we don't usually buy maple syrup)\n1/2 cup milk\n2 tsp cinnamon\n1 egg\n1 tsp vanilla\n1 tsp baking powder\n1/4 melted butter or 1/8 canola oil\nPinch of salt\n\nMethod\nPretty same but I beat the egg with the vanilla to get rid of the raw smell of the egg. No cranberries to fold in. \n\nI have experimented with using ramekins and a smaller square pan in a Breville oven. It's usually around 22 - 25 mins + preheating.\n\nHope you enjoy my adaptation :)"

I wouldn't change a thing if making this as a special indulgent breakfast :) Since this has become my 'go to' breakfast I made a couple minor changes to save (just a few)calories. I prefer steel cut oats, so I used those. I cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and substituted applesauce for the butter. (My husband loves the butter taste so I \"butter\" the top when serving.) I double the recipe, and freeze individual squares in separate sandwich bags - they are perfect for a grab-n-go breakfast to heat quickly at home or work."

It's a little rich for a weekday breakfast with the family though, so when I'm just making it for the kiddos, I cut the butter, the brown sugar, and the salt in half. The end result is drier than the original recipe and the consistency is similar to a fluffy scone, but it's still delightful, easy, tasty, and even my toddlers enjoy it. This is also a very versatile recipe as well. One variation I like is to add a cup or two of chopped apples, plus an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, a half teaspoon of nutmeg, and a quarter teaspoon each of ginger and cloves. Thank you for a wonderful recipe and a new breakfast staple in our home!"

"reviewBody": "Alright: I have made several baked oatmeals from Allrecipes and up until this one, the one with blueberries was a hit in our home. We just had this for breakfast this morning. I made it with a few common changes in baking: replaced half the butter with applesauce. Lowered the brown sugar to about 1/2 cup, maybe a little less (did not measure). I added an apple and some chopped pecans as someone suggested. I stuck WITH the maple syrup and sued Canadian because well, it is a healthy edulcorant imo. When I mixed it all, it was a bit of a dry-looking mix, so I added one egg, which I had use in other oatmeal recipes. What is outstanding about this is the flavor. With the nuts, maple and cranberries, it is just... old school. Barely sweet, nutty, cinnamoney, and yummy. Hats off, joshllorio :)"

I also add frozen cranberries to the mix and that has to be one of my favorite ingredients! We have tried all different kinds of fruit and it always turns out wonderful!"

This morning I made it again using only a half cup of brown sugar and replaced the butter with a pureed apple and apricot I had on hand. I also threw in a few spoons of canned cranberries (I had no dried) and replaced the butter with pureed apple, apricot and apple juice. We also used almond and coconut milk. Very delicious with just the right amount of sweet."
