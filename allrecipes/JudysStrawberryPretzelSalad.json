"reviewBody": "My Mom used to serve this \"salad\" at holiday gatherings back in the 70s, so I wanted to honor her at our Christmas celebration this year. The sugar looked like a lot, so I cut it back by 20%. It was still pretty sweet. My children did not understand why it is called a \"salad\"; they thought it was much more of a dessert. I was happy to share the essence of one of my early childhood foods. Next time, I may cut the sugar even further. All in all, a delicious walk down memory lane."

"reviewBody": "Notes: - double amount of pretzel crust - be sure sugar completely dissolved in butter before combining with pretzels - bake crust no more than 10 min - chill jello only for 10-20 min before pouring into pan or it will start to congeal. - Double Jello to keep in proportion with cream cheese layer - Strawberry syrup idea was good: for each box of Jello, use 1 cup BOILING water, stirring while on stovetop if necessary to fully dissolve mix (or it will be gritty and congeal too quickly), and 3/4 cup strawberry syrup - fewer strawberries (0.5-0.75 lb) was better than full pound. This will fill a 9”x13” casserole dish, and recipe can be halved if desired. Was delicious!!"

I absolutely agree with the step of cooling the jello mixture before pouring over the cream cheese layer. We t keeps the cream cheese from melting and breaking off into the jello topping. I also use the boiling water. The only difference in our recipe is that we add one tuna sized can of drained crushed pineapple to the cream cheese mixture. Absolutely delicious! I haven’t met anyone who doesn’t love this! It goes with dinner or as dessert!"

I weighed out 16 ounces of cut strawberries. I put those a bowl. I then took some and pureed them in my blender. I used a cup of those pureed berries and used that for the cup of cold water to make the jello. I saw several people wondered if you could use fresh berries and i was able to.. There was about a cup of pureed berries left over. I used that to pour over the cut portions of this (dessert?)."

The only difference was I used fresh strawberries, rather than frozen and, rather than \"floating\" them in the jell-o, I placed them on the top of the cream cheese/whipped topping layer. Then, after waiting for the jell-o to cool and thicken slightly, I poured that gently over the top. It was a HIT!!! I will DEF make this my \"Go To\" for summertime potlucks!!!"

The layers were neat and defined. I made a second batch with crushed pineapple mixed into the middle layer and into the jello, just make sure the pineapple is well drained."

Using a glass to press it down helps. Be sure to seal the cream cheese layer all the way around the dish or the jello will leak into the crust. Cool the jello before adding. Side note: We’re always careful to call this a salad as the title suggests even though it’s jam packed with sugar. Family joke."

So was I suppose to buy the sliced strawberries with sugar in a tub instead of literally just strawberries that are frozen?And I only had 1/3 less fat cream cheese on hand but will not be using that again. It turned out a little runny...so the presentation wasn’t the best. So I hope someone learns from my mistake."
