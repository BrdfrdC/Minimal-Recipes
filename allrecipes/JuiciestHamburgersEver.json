"reviewBody": "I made this recipe but, I used 50% chuck steak, 25% hanger steak (any steak like this such as flat iron works too) and 25% boneless beef country style rib meat. The total was 5 lbs. After I coarsely ground the meat I added 20% by weight of smoked bacon, raw (1 lb) Then measured out my 2lbs of ground steak and bacon, proceeded with the recipe. I also substituted Chipotle powder for the cayenne as my sister doesn't like cayenne I make the exact substitution in my Cajun or Creole dishes. Being a former desert rat, an 1/8 tsp became a half tsp or more, don't judge. Well beat me with mommas flip-flop and call me Shirley ! I will never go back to store bought ground again. These were, without a doubt, the juiciest, tastiest burgers I ever remember grinding my molars on. Didn't take a lot of chewing, but I was put in mind of eating the tenderest steak I ever had in my life. No bun, no condiments, just pan-fried and slipped onto a plate. I can not stress this enough. Never buy ground round (dry and needs help) or \"ground beef\" (what parts of the \"beef\" ? ) to make these delightfu burgers, the extra work results in a very beefy, moist and juicy burger. If you are fortunate enough to have an actual butcher nearby, you can ask them to coarsely grind this up for you right at the counter. I used a Kitchenaid stand mixer with all metal grinding attachment. I went through all 6 lbs of meat quicker than Grant took Richmond. Took me longer to wash and dry the grinder than it took to grind the meat. Enjoy."

The burgers were still not as flavorful as we would have liked. They were not at all dry, but not as juicy as they should have been with 1 lb. 80% beef and 1 lb. 94% beef. These definitely have potential with more seasoning and perhaps some liquid smoke. Will try again. Thanks for the recipe."

"reviewBody": "For lack of Worcestershire sauce (doh!) i ended up making some substitutions while doin my best to hold to the spirit of the recipe. I kept the meat, garlic, evaporated milk, etc ratios the same and used a bit of fish sauce, soy sauce, and bbq sauce to take the place of the Worcestershire. It came out well, although if I had used Worcestershire or even anchovy paste, I think it would have tasted better. \n\nAnyway, I used ground beef with 14% fat. The role of the bread crumbs is to act as a binder and also to absorb some of the fat that would ordinarily drip out during cooking. Not so healthy, but it makes for a nice treat once in a great while. I do agree with previous comments that say the texture of the meat changes. It does - it’s more like a soft meatball, but it also is easier to eat in a party setting because it doesn’t crumble."

I highly recommend however to be careful how much evaporated milk you use cuz your burger will fall apart even if you take the meat right from the fridge to the grill. I am single so I always halve the recipe And I used more evaporative milk than I should have but it still tasted amazing. I wonder how this would taste as meatloaf. I don't use hamburger buns when I make a burger. I just top it with a tomato and ketchup and it tastes amazing."

Also, the bread crumbs I used are Italian style.\nWhat I got: 15 chunky, juicy, round and not flat patties"

"reviewBody": "We LOVED this burger. I only had one lb ground beef, so I halved the recipe. I used the egg white instead of a whole egg, and I didn't have evaporated milk, so I just left it out. I grilled them on a cast iron skillet with raised grill features. The burgers stuck a little and tried to come apart, but they all made it out in one piece. Not sure if I just didn't have the skillet hot enough or if it was the difference in the egg or the milk. Still a winner though! My husband kept interrupting his chewing to tell me how great it was!! And my 15-year-old son loved it too!"

And since I had no other use for evaporated milk, I just used some thinned yogurt. \n\nIt's important to get the grill really hot so they sizzle right off the bat. We cooked them about 4 minutes longer so they were cooked through."
