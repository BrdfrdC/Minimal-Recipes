Each time the chicken has been succulent and not \"swimming\" in butter as the ones-tar reviewer claims. It's about changing things up according to your own oven quirks and your tastes. If something doesn't turn out the way you expected, then CHANGE IT UP instead of never making it again after seeing consistent 4 and 5 star ratings. Just a thought."

"reviewBody": "Made this horrible recipe for Thanksgiving with two chickens and they both bombed to the point of being inedible. It's the Paula Dean method of soaking everything in butter to avoid dry meat by adding 20,000 calories. First off, 75 minutes is completely inadequate time to cook chicken. It was bright pink at that time, and sitting in a 3 inch pool of butter with no ability to actually bake. I left it in for another 45 minutes to void getting salmonella poisoning, and the meat was evaporated. Gone. Like, no meat at all. I went from two extremes in one shot. It completely ruined Thanksgiving dinner and I wouldn't make this recipe again even at gunpoint. Horrible."

I get under the skin on the breast with olive oil and seasoning as well. Then follow the exact directions for baking to the letter, and it's PERFECT every time I made it. So tender, juicy, perfectly cooked meat; the white meat is glistening tender and juicy. Thank you. This has been my new go to recipe when making holiday for two; my husband and self."

"reviewBody": "The grocery store was sold out of rotisserie chicken and I’ve sucked at cooking whole chicken in the past. I don’t mess with margarine, oil and butter are pretty equal in fat and I love some unsalted butter. To get the effect of margarine, I recommend putting butter inside the cavity with the celery and fresh garlic or minced. Brush or drizzle a neutral oil on top of your bird, alittle goes a long way. If you use Cajun seasoning like another person recommended I suggest using a no salt or low salt one and adding salt after to keep it balanced. This is better than rotisserie, my life has changed! I saved the drippings and broth in a mason jar and will either make a soup or gravy with it this week. Ate part of the chicken for dinner with the celery and shredded the rest of the chicken to make some delicious chicken salad to meal prep for the week. You can freeze cooked chicken for up to 3 months."

I checked on it after 45 minutes to baste with a brush, but there were no juices at that point. But was browning nicely. I did cook an additional 15 minutes. It did finally leave a small bit of juices when finished so I basted it good and let it rest for 30 minutes. After carving, I would suggest 1 hr 45 minutes cooking time. My bird was around 3lbs. This is an excellent recipe ! Juicy and tender with tons of flavor ! Looks awesome !"

I always have to cook it for about 2.5 hours. I think that's because the recipe is written for a 3 lb chicken and I usually get one over 5 lbs so it needs a bit more time to cook."

Only change I made was butter over margarine (personal preference), but it's spot on and full of flavo AND leftovers can be used in so many dishes!"

'Not blaming the recipe, but maybe the chicken? 'Remember it being juicy, but this time was bordering on greasy. 'Not blaming the recipe since it isn't basted frequently. 'May have liked the granny smith apple better, too - or both - but that wouldn't affect the grease factor. 'Used perdue, big 7pounder, this last time. 'Maybe it was another brand w first review. 'Probably decrease it next time, just to be sure ... 8 20 17 Used 6T. 2T in + 4T on = YUM! 3-2022 'Tried 2T marg in pieces inside &amp; 2T thinly sliced on. Half garlic, half onion powders.
