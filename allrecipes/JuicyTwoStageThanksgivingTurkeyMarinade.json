"reviewBody": "I was searching for a brine recipe of the ingredients I had on hand on Wednesday before Thanksgiving and came across this recipe. I didn't have enough time for the 2nd day of the process but used the brine recipe overnight then seasoned the outside of my turkey with salt, pepper, smoked paprika(had on hand) after rubbing with olive oil. Stuffed with onion, orange and rosemary. VERY moist and flavorful! Will plan ahead and do the second day next time. Didn't have a pot big enough so I put the brine inside a trash bag which I had placed in my vegetable crisper drawer then the turkey and put it in the fridge overnight- worked great. It's a keeper!!"

It was so tender that the breast meat actually slid off of the carcass in the oven and into the pan below! The meat is tender and unbelievably juicy. The flavor is wonderfully savory and fragrant. Definitely worth the work! Highly recommended! Me and my parents have been picking at the meat all morning and are making plans to buy another bird to use this recipe with!"
