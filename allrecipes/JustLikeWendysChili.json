Instead of pre-mixed chili seasoning, I used the suggestion of another reviewer and used 1 Tbsp. cumin, 1 1/4 tsp. salt, 1 1/4 Tbsp. chili powder, 1 tsp. oregano, 1 tsp. basil and doubled them. I used heaping amounts of the cumin &amp; chili powder and salt &amp; peppered to taste. I was too afraid to add the vinegar at the end. I thought the tomato products had enough zing to them. Next time I will add a little vinegar and see how we like it. Will be making this again and again."

I drained the ground beef fat and replaced it equally with \"cooking\" olive oil before adding ingredients. I added 1 diced fresh garlic clove and 1 cup of shitake mushrooms. I also used white wine vinegar and added 1/2 cup after the chili was done simmering. Great recipe that \"I think you could play with\" Although I used the Rotel, I did also add some fresh red pepper flakes as well."

I dislike kidney beans and using them to make a copycat chili will change the texture and the flavor ever so slightly. But if you like them and their texture when you bite into them go for it. Also, use a higher fat content of ground beef, which is usually cheaper and omit the olive oil. Seasoning in this recipe is very good."

At first I was almost afraid to flatten the ground beef and leave it alone for 8-9 minutes. Do not skip this step. It’s an important part of the recipe. A flat bottomed pot helps, too. This recipe has won our neighborhood’s annual chili cook-off since I started entering it, at least 6 yr in a row. Everyone loves it &amp; always goes back for 2nds.

I followed the ingredients exactly and I’m very happy that I did. Adding the 1 Tablespoon of white vinegar took this chili above all others. Great-Great Flavorful Chili."

For an added kick, I do 1 mild and 1 hot chili spice mix. Never added the vinegar but I don’t think it needs it."

We made it earlier in the day and followed the recipe except that we prepped the meat, and veggies in a Dutch oven then put it into the slow cooker and added everything else there. We made it for dinner but have already had a couple small bowls each for lunch! It’s our new favourite and will be going back to this and recommending to everyone."

I might have rated this higher had the title of the recipe not indicated that it would. Overall I would probably make this again. The only thing I would do differently is to chop up the stewed tomatoes before putting them in the pot. They did not break up easily with just a spoon."

I added some garlic powder, and chili powder, but I’m sure those spices were already in the package of chili seasoning. For me it’s the VINEGAR THAT MAKES IT TASTE LIKE WENDY’S CHILI. When I initially made it I forgot to put the vinegar in and it just didn’t taste right. It tasted flat..blah. When I reheated the leftovers I added the vinegar. I was like WOW, what a difference!! But that was my opinion. I’m definitely adding this to my regular dinner rotation. And a heads up, if you’re a small household I recommend you cut the recipe back. Unless you wanna eat it for a week straight."

I used fire roasted diced tomatoes once as that’s what I had, black beans instead of pinto, diced red pepper instead of green. Corn bread or baked potato on the side is great! Thank you for sharing!"
