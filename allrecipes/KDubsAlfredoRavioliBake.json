I did not add chicken at all. I left out the mozarella cheese and only used some grated parm on the top, again to reduce the calories and this was very good. I made it earlier in the day and then baked later. Super easy."

I used fresh four cheese ravioli from the refrigerator section. for the chicken I cut up into small pieces and used Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder. And then I cooked it in a pan with butter and 3 cloves of fresh garlic. I did this because the Alfredo sauce in the jar can be bland and I wanted the dish to have more flavor. once the meat was cooked i added the Alfredo sauce to the pan with my chicken and warmed it up. Then I layered sauce, pasta, sauce, cheese. and I did that untill I had two pans. served it with salad and garlic bread. it was awesome!"

I made it as posted, next time I probably would just cut my chicken into smaller pieces just because I can, and perhaps I would experiment with a little bit of garlic - but my friends definitely said I should make it again. I made it a day ahead of time and then baked it the following day. I used a glass baking dish and it looked so beautiful the way it slightly browned. Definitely a keeper. My co-workers are eating leftovers as I write this review!"

I also added garlic salt and some fresh minced garlic to the chicken in addition to the Italian Seasoning as it was cooking. I recommend cutting the chicken pieces smaller than 1\" to make it a bit more bite-sized and easier to spread on top of the ravioli. My first grader said \"thank you for making this\" at least three times!"

I used what I had on hand, not because I wanted to change the recipe but because we were having a huge snowstorm and I keep my freezer and pantry stocked for our cold Illinois winters. I had some refrigerated cheese ravioli and Alfredo sauce that came with it. I also had some fresh mozzarella but only Parmesan from the \"green can.\" I also pull rotisserie chicken from the bone and freeze or refrigerate to use in casseroles. When I knew we were having the storm I got two of them. We are huge vegetable lovers so I added fresh blanched asparagus. This was so delicious! This would be great as written or with broccoli as well."

I used Classico sauce which was fine but store brand ravioli which had very little flavor. I wish they still sold the Barilla dried tortellini in my area! Thanks for sharing your recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This was very tasty. I used shredded chicken that I already had on hand (first I mixed in the butter and italian seasoning for maximum flavor) with chicken ravioli. Used an Italian blend cheese that had many types of cheese including parmesan so I skipped the last step of adding parmesan. I layered a few fresh spinach leaves with each layer which gave nice color. My 9 year old didn't even gripe about the spinach because I think it looked like basil in there... hmm that would be good too."

I boiled some chicken on the bone(saved the stock for another use,of course) shredded it and made an Alfredo sauce using Laughing Cow wedges, Parmesan cheese,flour,milk and garlic powder. I had a bag of spinach ravioli and Munster cheese which I used. I even added a 1/2 can of chopped tomatoes and 1/2 cup of corn &amp; peas, they looked like little colorful jewels amongst the white back ground. Super easy and fabulous flavor! I Really enjoyed making this! Thanks a Heap K-Dub! Another Winner Winner chicken dinner:)"

After sauteeing, I used the same pan to sautee 4 minced garlic cloves, 1/4 chopped onion and a 6 oz bag of baby spinach. Mixed all with the cooked cubed chx and proceeded to build the casserole. I opted to use tortallini as we had recently had ravioli for dinner. I used Classico Lite Asiago Romano Alfredo Sauce - very yummy. Topped with pecorino romano. Definitely will be making this dish again! Thanks K-Dub for a winning recipe!"

I would also salt/pepper the chicken instead of the entire dish. And last but not least I would change the type of ravioli. I like cheese raviolis but don't love them, but this recipe is versatile so you could use just about any type."

I had a couple of packages of the refrigerated chicken and cheese ravioli and approx. 1/2 of a container of the alfredo sauce that is sold with the pasta. I added that alfredo to a jar of mushroom alfredo from the pantry and it was perfect. Using the 2 packages of pasta, the top layer was 1 or 2 ravioli short but it wasn't noticed. I sauted some onion and a little garlic with the chicken, seasoned well and backed the Italian seasoning down to 1 TBS. Perfect for our taste and received many compliments. Thanks for sharing, K-Dub! We will enjoy this often."

I loved the flavors/richness of this dish and the fact that you can add whatever you like and come out with a simple, yet tasty meal. Made this a bit ahead of time and just baked it when I was ready, and that worked out well. I servd this w/ a salad and garlic bread. A definite keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)"

I used spinach and cheese ravioli and forgot to put the parmesan on, so I just added it once the pasta was served. I used a little less mozzarella to save some fat, but I think I also used a smaller package of ravioli, so it worked out to a good amount of cheeseyness anyway. Excellent recipe K-Dub!"

It turned into a happy accident BTW I also tossed a handful of fresh basil leaves while layering cuz my basil plants are shivering and threatening to turn. In spite of my changes, this was excellent. Very velvety and yummy. Sparky gave it a very big thumbs up too. Assemble the ingredients and keep them chilled early in the day and quickly layer and you have dinner on the table in 30 minutes.Nice enough to serve to company too. Crisp chardonnay, crusty bread and a romaine wedge balances this nicely. Thanks so much for sharing this K-Dub. Excellent!"
