I used Crosse &amp; Blackwell capers, which have a different flavor than most. As I blended it in the food processor, I added a bit of mixed olive juice (left from the bowl where I had measured out both types of olives) to moisten it up a bit as well. I must have had just the right olive ratio, as a later batch had mostly green and we thought it was not as good."

I don't generally keep capers on hand, but I Do often have pickled jalapeno slices, so I minced a couple of those instead for a very similar flavor, but with a good bit of a kick. I also don't have a food processor, but I probably wouldn't have used it even if I had one, anyway. Finely minced is equally delicious and more appetizing looking, in this case. I also omitted salt and pepper, because....olives and jalapenos.\nI had this with hummus, smoky roasted red peppers, pickled banana pepper slices, and toasted pita strips, and it was awesome. I am thinking about making a muffaletta with the leftovers.\nThank you!!"

That being said, it did make a delicious dip for wheat thins and a gluten free cracker I served. Wild be great over cream cheese or with crostini"

Like to slice and toast a baguette and spread this on the toast. Perfect! \nYup, it's salty. Sadly this is probably part of the appeal for me."

I added a clove of garlic because I'm a garlic addict, substituted basil for parsley because that's what I had, backed off the olive oil and lemon to 1 tbsp each (it was still plenty moist.) Finally, added a pinch - perhaps 1/8 tsp - smoked paprika. I used this variation as a relish with grilled chicken breast. This recipe's a keeper, will keep tinkering, as it has endless potential."

The goat cheese cuts thru the over saltness that comes from the olives, and since a cheese spread you minus the lemon juice in that it will my the cheese spoil. It may sound off the wall but I work in a cheese shop and all my customer rave about it and when I don’t have it are like “darn that was good”. Try it and let me know what y’all think."

"reviewBody": "Other reviewer suggestions were helpful. To achieve nicely chopped olives &amp; avoid the \"canal bottom\" sludge appearance (thanks 4 the laugh, Charlie B!), I put rinsed pitted olives - one can at a time - in the Ninja container with enough plain water to 2/3rds full so the olives could move freely, then pulsed the power button just until the olives were rough-chopped, drained them in a sieve, dumped them in a large mixing bowl and repeated the process using 3 cans of green olives &amp; 2 cans of black olives, roasted red peppers, capers, garlic, thyme, oregano, Dijon mustard, S&amp;P, lime juice, a small squirt of Sriracha and oil to nearly cover it. (1/3 EVOO to 2/3 canola since EVOO solidifies under refrigeration and I wanted to avoid that.) Refrigerated several hours to let the flavors marry. Liking it as a topper on broiled salmon as well as zucchini 'noodles.'"

I think it will be even better after it has sat in the fridge for a bit to \"meld\". Following the suggestions of other users, I made the following modifications: I did not put in the blender, but rather finely chopped everything by hand, I subbed in a handful of black olives to mellow out the flavor (plus, as we are olive lovers and always have lots, I tossed in a few green olives too!) and I didn't add any additional salt. Also, as I did not have fresh parsley I added 1 tbsp of dried - seems fine! Really good, thanks for posting!"

"reviewBody": "This is my first tapenade. I've always bought it, but since moving to rural Idaho, I've found a lack of options at the grocer. I can't knock the recipe too much, because I only loosely followed it. But I did want to offer my experiences. Like other reviewers, I did not blend it, bc i prefer a chunkier tapenade. I also added black olives and pimento stuffed green olives to add color. I did not add any additional salt and I found mine came out too salty. For reference, the kalamata and pimento stuffed olives I put in had between 210 and 240 mg sodium per 4-5 olives. The black olives had less, so I added more. Next time I will look for lower sodium content in the olives I use. Hope this helps!"

Our vegan and gluten intolerant friends loved it! I served it on sliced baguette, but like other reviewers suggestions to add goat or cream cheese while serving it to cut down the saltiness a bit. That would complement it well. Thanks for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "I made this to use as a spread to jazz up plain chicken sandwiches for a cold meal on a hot summer night, and eh...I made it exactly per the recipe (except for halving it for my small family), and it was very sharply garlicky. I love garlic, but it was a bit much for both myself and the hubs. Also, I agree with others that it needed no extra salt, cause I was very glad after tasting it that I had chosen not to add any more. The capers and the lemon are dominant flavors, but the garlic should definitely be finely minced or put in as a paste via a microplane before you make it in the food processor, cause the garlic overpowers the spread. I may try this again with my ideas of modifications, but I doubt it, given the cost of kalamata olives in my area. Sorry, this one isn't going into my faves."

But, I have to agree with a previous reviewer that the lemon makes it a bit \"sharp.\" Next time, I would put in 1/2 to 3/4 of the lemon juice and see if that mellows it enough. I also omitted the salt. Another small change was that I blended all of the ingredients together into a puree, except for the olives. I hand chopped them and recommend others do as well. I will be making this one again. I love how I can make a big batch and don't have to rely on the little jar at Trader Joe's anymore!"

If you have any leftovers, it's also really delicious mixed in with tomato sauce to top your pasta. I usually double the recipe, and use green olives for the 2nd cup of olives. I also nix the salt as I find the olives and capers to be salty enough, and use slightly less garlic than is called for, as it can turn out (can't believe I'm saying this) too garlicky.
