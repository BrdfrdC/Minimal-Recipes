"reviewBody": "Very good basic Kalbi recipe that is no frills and has most of the important ingredients listed, and none of the extraneous niche ones that you might not have around or are hard to find. My only notes are that adding toasted sesame seeds to the marinade to taste is a good idea, and that many soy sauces (that aren't reduced sodium) are too salty, so it's usually good to dilute the soy sauce with more water before adding it. Maybe even as high as a 1 to 1 ratio of soy sauce to water."

"reviewBody": "It's bit salty and too much sauce for 2 lbs of meat. I make Korean BBQ Ribs quite a bit and meat does not need to be floating in sauce. I recommend adding more green onions, garlic and sesame oil and blending them together in a blender or hand held blender. Also, as suggested by another reviewer, instead of water, add either Saki or Rice Wine (unsweetened) - it'll help tenderize the meat. Be sure to taste the sauce before adding to the meat to make sure you it's to your liking."

"reviewBody": "Thanks for sharing the recipe! I made a couple tweaks based off other reviews and my own experience and overall it tasted delicious. I omitted the water step and had to cook my short ribs for 30 minutes vs. 20 minutes. Lastly, I flipped the ribs before I broiled them. I don't have a grill so this technique made them as good as grilled. So glad I don't have to buy marinades anymore. I love being able to make it from scratch and know exactly what is in that sauce. I will make it again since the family (of 6) loved it! I served it with steamed napa cabbage and Lumpia Shanghai."

I will make it again when I know what I'm working with, and I will try the idea someone had of using pineapple juice instead of water. I will also marinate it longer (I did 3 hours). I had to use tapioca flour to thicken the sauce for serving with sides - it wouldn't cook down in the 25 minutes I had. The sauce was delicious on our rice."

I didn't have short ribs, so I just sliced a round roast into matchstick sized pieces, substituted the water with coke (as someone suggested) and marinated for 24 hrs. After the 24 hrs, I placed them on a grated grill and put them on a hot bbq, stirring every minute or so until the meat was caramelized on the outside, which didn't take long. I then served them as Korean tacos and they were devoured by the whole family, everyone absolutely loved them!"

"reviewBody": "I am half Korean and always in search of a \"go to\" kalbi marinade as there are so many versions out there (including my mom's tasty marinade). After much trial and error of many recipes (including my mom's), this is now my go to kalbi marinade recipe. Even my own mom (who is an excellent cook) said that this marinade was better than hers!! I made a couple of tweaks and have the following suggestions:\n- Instead of 3/4 cup water, I used 1 cup (think another reviewer also suggested this)\n- I used tons of garlic (I must use about a head of garlic)\n- I peeled a kiwi and then minced it to add to the marinade. Kiwi helps tenderize the meat.\n- I usually double the marinade as I made 2-3 packs of the Korean style kalbi meat and use a huge size ziploc bag to place the marinade and meat\n- Definitely marinate this over night (and flip the ziploc bag to the other side in the next morning).\nGreat kalbi marinade!"

Make sure you get good ribs though. We got cheap ones and had to pick out bone shards..."

Per side on the stove top grill. They were cooked and just pink inside. Very tough. I always thought short ribs were either braised or cooked low and slow. I will not make this again with short ribs. I will however try the sauce with skirt steak. I think that would be a better choice of meat. I was so disappointed this didn't work for me. Did anyone else experience tough meat?

"reviewBody": "Amazing taste and very easy to do. The only thing I added was some grated ginger and more garlic to the marinade. I also let it marinade for 2 days in the refrigerator (not planned it just worked out that way). Also make sure you buy a well marbled flanken rib, such as from Sam's Club, to ensure your end result is tender. After all these are still ribs and I'm sure you wouldn't expect ribs that have been grilled for 10-14 minutes to be tender??? So marbling is important. This is a keeper and we will be making them again! Enjoy!"
