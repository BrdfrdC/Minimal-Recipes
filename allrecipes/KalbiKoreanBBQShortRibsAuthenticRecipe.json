"reviewBody": "I used a pretty thick boneless short rib instead of korean style cut. Marinated for 4-5 hours. The marinade gives a good flavor and the ribs were tender indeed. My only complaint was that I wish the ribs had more of the marinade flavor! Maybe using the thinner cut will prove to be more flavorful. I will definitely be teying this again when I find some. Great share!"
