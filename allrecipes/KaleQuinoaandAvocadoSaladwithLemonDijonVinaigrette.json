I said I have some delicious healthy recipes. Usually I serve this with salmon steaks but tonight I served it with baked yams. For four of us I doubled the recipe and had a little left over. I also really enjoy a balsamic glaze drizzled over this! It's delicious on its own but the balsamic glaze kicks it up a notch! In the attached photo, I had not yet added the feta cheese. . . That's important! ;-)"

Thank you, next time I have to double the recipe. I usually make healthy dishes once a month as a little treat after class and serve them in the teeny, tiny tasting bowls, but this time, they looked at me like I was crazy...so it was requested for our next treat as a full lunch. Isn’t that some nerve??."

It's really fulling and tastes real good."

I also used 1 cup of quinoa instead of 2/3 cup. I think next time I will wilt the kale a little longer then 45 seconds as mine was still a little bitter. My husband put some olives in his and also some dried cherries since he said it needed something.\nBoy was the dressing tart! I tasted it once it was done and after reading some of the reviews I put in about 2 Tbl. of honey, can't remember exactly. It was much better so for these changes I give it 4 stars but without changing the dressing I would have given it 3."

"reviewBody": "I usually make a recipe I find on here that looks delicious and it ends up alright and not how I expected it to taste. . This one was incredible and was beyond my expectations. I was nervous when I taste tested the dressing by itself, but once everything is mixed in together it is amazing. The dressing may seem salty, but I promise it balances out once mixed in with everything. Don't leave a single step out! I don't think I have ever left a review on Allrecipes and it is my favorite site. This was review-worthy. It is so easy to make too! I added more cucumbers, avocado and bell pepper. I also used tri color quinoa because it's all I had on hand but I doubt that made any difference whatsoever besides add contrast to the presentation. Delicious!!!"

I really liked the way everything came together except for the dressing.....just not to my liking, for me there was too much Dijon. I will definitely make again, however; I will do my own oil/lemon dressing or oil/vinegar dressing. Another option I will try is an Asian flavoured dressing. But all in all a great healthy meal! Thank you Stephanie."

The Dijon, feta and lemon juice in this recipe give the salad just the right amount of flavorful zestiness."
