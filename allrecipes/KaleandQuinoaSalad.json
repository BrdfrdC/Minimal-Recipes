I also go heavy on the dressing (not quite double, but I tend to overflow my measuring spoons). I also swap in goat cheese for feta when I’m feeling a lil crazy- but only about 1/3 cup (a little crumbled goat cheese goes a long way). Nutritious n delicious!"

I came across this recipe but didn’t have a full larder so I made some substitutions. For ingredients I switched out currants and used dried cranberries instead. I also didn’t have any feta, so substituted in an aged sharp cheddar instead. I cooked the quinoa in a rice cooker. The menu says a 2:1 water/quinoa ratio which I used although the package stated a 4:1 ratio. I will try upping the ratio a bit and see if it is a bit more fluffier."

"reviewBody": "My first time using Kale in anything and I'm a vegetable lover. Instead of currents I used Craisins and instead of pecans I used slivered almonds. I liked it and people that are salad and vegetable lovers liked it but not sure some of the guys were over the moon about it. It's not something that I would serve or eat weekly but occasionally having kale is not bad."

I used golden raisins over currents since it was all I had. Goat cheese over Feta. It was perfect and made a lot of salad. Luckily, kale keeps well overnight and I had the remaining salad the next day. Couldn't tell the difference."

"reviewBody": "So delicious! I made this to take to a salad luncheon and I used fresh kale from my garden. I opted to use dried cranberries instead of the currents because that's what I had on hand. I also left off the feta cheese even though I love good feta I didn't want the other flavors to be overwhelmed by the feta. It was SO GOOD! The dressing and the other ingredients had just the right flavor and texture blend. The people at the luncheon complimented me on it and when my brother tried it he said (by way of a compliment) \"This doesn't even TASTE like kale.\" I'll take that as a pretty good compliment because I'm always trying to get my parents and family to eat more kale and sometimes they are reluctant. But both my parents as well as my brother and sister ate this and seemed to enjoy it."

"reviewBody": "This recipe has great bones. This isn't a kapow! dish, but any issue with bland flavours might be due to too little salt or olive oil. I took the other reviewers' comments and made a few alterations to make sure it was flavourful. I massaged the kale with salt and good olive oil which made it amazing and soft. I also cooked the quinoa in vegetable stock. For the dressing, I put the garlic, salt, mustard, olive oil and lemon juice in a mortar and pestle and ground to a purée and added some dried herbs. Then it sat for the 15 minutes it took the quinoa to cook which helps the garlic flavour get into the dressing. I prefer walnuts, so toasted them in the stove before adding. I ate the salad warmed from the quinoa, which was amazing. In the future I will add some cherry tomatoes. Delicious."

Kale and quinoa are two daunting ingredients and although both are thoroughly nutritious, I've steered clear of them due to not having the confidence to prepare them well. This was my first stab at using both kale and quinoa and the salad turned out amazingly well, and healthy to boot! I followed the recipe almost exactly, except that I couldn't find dried currants at the local grocery store. Instead, I used Mariani dried tart cherries (they add sugar to them). One tip for prepping the kale: cut out the middle stalk on each leaf and discard before shredding the lettuce. The stalk is pretty tough and doesn't go well in a salad."

One thing I will try next time (and there will be a next time!) is adding a little honey to the dressing, as I think it could use a little more sweetness to counter the salty feta. All around, a solid base recipe!"

I dared to order the quinoa and kale salad at Zupas but their dressing was high on vinegar. I've since ordered it again and it was perfect so it was just that batch. So I wanted to duplicate it. This comes very close. I've added my own twists to it but it's great just the way it is. For a slightly different taste, I added baby sweet corn, a couple of sweet small, sweet peppers, and a sweeter vinegarette. You might see the pattern here. Have a sweet tooth. Also added cilantro. So, it's great the way it is. But it's also great with a little sweeter taste."

The salad was more quinoa than kale, and I would prefer it with more kale than quinoa. The salad dressing was not the greatest. I added some white balsamic vinegar and that seemed to make it taste better. I liked the Best Greek Quinoa Salad, Quinoa &amp; Black Bean, and Mediterranean Quinoa Salad recipes on this website better than this one. TIPS: From what I read on the other recipes, it's best to rinse water over the quinoa before cooking. I also set aside the stalks and ribs of the kale for my morning green drink and only use the leafy tender part in salads."

Do salt and pepper to taste as I found the salt to be a bit much but taste it by dipping a leaf or two of kale; off the spoon it's VERY salty but with the kale it goes perfectly. I preferred about 1/2 the amount the salt and 1/4 the amount of pepper as the dijon is already peppery. The garlic was way too overpowering for me. 1/4 the amount as well, if at all. I actually preferred it with garlic powder."
