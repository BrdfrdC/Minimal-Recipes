Used an 8lb bone in pork shoulder and Morton’s coarse sea salt and liquid smoke. Before returning shredded pork to juices, strained juices into a fat separator. That helped cut down on the grease. Will definitely make again!!!"

It takes me back to the day I first hit Hawaii and was starving, waiting for our rental car, and my sweetheart of a girlfriend walked down the street for food and brought back this same amazing Kalua pork. Taste takes me back to that time every time. Bittersweet. Amazing recipe, and SO EASY! Thank you for sharing."

Even with a non smoked salt, I think a tablespoon of liquid smoke would be overpowering Other than that, the only other issue is with all slow cooked food vs. smoked food, it tastes similar, but the texture is different (more mushy with crockpots) I would definitely do again, so easy and tasty"

"reviewBody": "This is wonderful! I have made it several times, using hickory liquid smoke, and this last time with applewood liquid smoke-both work great (I usually end up using a couple TBS to cover the roast thoroughly), as does using kosher salt (I never have Hawaiian salt available) If you put it in a big bowl in the fridge overnight, most fat congeal on the top for easy removal. This is great plain, or you can add BBQ sauce or salsas and make sandwiches, tacos, burritos- whatever you are in the mood for! My family loves it! One tip, my big oval Crockpot has 3 settings: Hi, Lo and Warm. I start this for an hour or two on Lo, then switch to Warm for the last 16 hours or so, as the 2 higher temps are too much for the long, slow cook time. Delicious!"

But… to make it taste like the authentic stuff you need to use Mesquite liquid smoke. Kiawe wood (a sweeter type of Mesquite) is used in Hawaii. It gives the meat that special flavor. You can find it next to the hickory stuff in the grocery store."

"reviewBody": "So easy. So Good. Huge hit. I looked at over 30 recipes to \"get\" this right. There was no mention of the huge fat flap to keep or remove. I keep it when I cook in the oven for Puerto Rican Pernil. But chose to remove it for a slow cooker. Good choice. I had no Hawaiian salt, I used Kosher Coarse Salt. I cooked as is but adjusted the salt/smoke to the meat weight. It's all a matter of preference. 3/4 way thru I added more smoke. The huge part of this is after the meat is shredded and defatted, to put it back in with the juices and cook another hour or so. The flavor is in the juice! If you miss this step, you miss all the yummy flavor. I added a touch more smoke again for my taste. Perfect. I fretted over the missing details. Hope this helps."

I also think there must be a difference in brands of liquid smoke as I found one tablespoon to not be enough. Finally, my slow cooker has a low setting that is much hotter than other slow cookers. My pork was completely tender in eight hours, so knowing your crockpot is important. Very delicious. I might make it for Christmas!"

I Pierce the raw shoulder, all over, rub with coarse sea salt, put it in the Crock-Pot skin/fat side up, with 2 whole bottles of liquid smoke, and cook it on low for 10 hours. Perfect and juicy every time. When it's done, I take it out, remove the big chunks of fat, and the shoulder blade, shred it the meat, then put all the meat back in the Crock-Pot with all the juice/liquid smoke. Then serve. We like to eat it on rolls, or just by itself. I'm not sure how you can get much flavor with just 2 tablespoons of the liquid smoke. That sounds kind bland and dry."

The wife ate it on Hawaiian sweet roll buns and liked that better. On the plus side it makes a lot from a very inexpensive cut of meat."

"reviewBody": "This was delicious!!!! I made an 8.5 lb pork roast in my slow cooker last week and it was brought to feed us fam of 4 twice plus have enough for two meals in the freezer. I was afraid that this would be too salty and smoky since every time I’ve eaten kalua pork at a restaurant that’s been the case but my hubby loves restaurant kalua pork so I gave it a shot with this recipe and I could not be more pleased with the results. I had to increase the portion amount for my larger cut of meat using the all recipes calculator and it work perfectly. The salt level and the smoke level were absolutely perfect. My final concern was that 20 hours would be too long and the meat might begin to deteriorate or dry out and be flavorless... it was PERFECT. Totally worth the wait and I will do this easy recipe over again regularly."

Used Stubbs liquid smoke. I let the slow cooker heat up for about 20 mins and cut the pork into chunks to help with thorough cooking and rubbed down the meat with the sea salt. Left on low for about 22 hours. My sister made a great coleslaw to top it and guests could chose their bbq sauce if they wanted some. I even had someone who cooks slow cooked pork from the south come back for seconds. This is a BIG crowd pleaser!"

"reviewBody": "I was given this recipe from a family at church who are from Hawaii, so it's the real deal! So easy. There's nothing more to do than poke, salt, and rub! When adding the liquid smoke, either use a brush to apply or wear gloves to rub it on to save yourself from stained stinky hands! I don't measure the Hawaiian salt nor the liquid smoke, just generously apply both after poking lots of holes. I use a large carving-type fork that has long substantial tines so it goes deeply into the meat (all around) with minimal effort. After pulling the meat apart I add enough of the cooking liquid to moisten it, and then use the rest to make sticky rice in my rice cooker. So if it calls for 1 cup of water I use approx. 1/4 c. pig juice and 3/4 c. water, depending on how salty the juice is. It makes great rice! You couldn't make an easier or tastier piece of meat. Also, I like to get 2-3 smaller boneless pork roasts (I have a large slow cooker so several 2-3 lb roasts fit) instead of one large roast. \n I have tried it both ways and prefer the tenderness and quicker cooking time using multiple smaller roasts. You won't be disappointed with this easy and delicious recipe. I make so much for just one person because it freezes very well. After pulling the pork and making the flavored sticky rice, I just portion both together into a meal size container and pop into the freezer! I usually end up with enough to eat for 3 dinners when freshly made, give 2 portions to a friend, and have"

I removed the pork and set it aside, then added the water and liquid smoke to the pot and put the pork back in. I used Himalayan salt, grinding it over the top of the pork (I used less than half what the recipe called for). Set the timer for 90 minutes, followed by a 20 minute natural release and done. It was the best Kulua pork I’ve ever had, not fatty or greasy. My family loved it."

Also, just so happens I was finishing up a bag of smoked almonds. I scooped up about a tablespoon of the seasoning from the bottom of the bag and rubbed it all over the roast along with the salt. It was large - over 9 lbs - and had been neatly tied up by the butcher. There was a good covering of fat on one side. I made slices along that side and poured just one teaspoon mesquite liquid smoke over it. Still can’t believe how delicious this recipe turned out yet was so simple."

This recipe is very similar to how I make pork for pulled pork sandwiches. \n\nIt came out great! I couldn't find Hawaiian salt in time, so I substituted pink Himalayan salt. It was still delicious but I definitely want to try it with the Hawaiian salt.\n\nI served it with an Asian inspired coleslaw (shredded cabbage, carrots, green onions, and cilantro with a store bought ginger dressing) and macaroni and cheese. I looked up traditional Hawaiian sides and didn't have access to some ingredients. I found out macaroni salad is a traditional side dish, but my kids hate mayonnaise. Someone else suggested that macaroni and cheese is also traditional, so I made that because the kids love it. We also served it with yeast rolls because none of us care for the sweet Hawaiian rolls. All the components of the meal complimented each other really well.\n\nI will definitely be making this again!"

I’ve cooked it for 12-20 hours, depending on how early I remember to start it :) I used red Hawaiian salt and black Hawaiian salt and an extra TBS of liquid smoke cause I love that stuff. Don’t know if it made a difference but I also sliced a banana in half and placed it on top of the roast. Discard it when it’s all done. I pull the roast out before serving, to let it cool a little so I can shred it... while it’s cooling I use a gravy separator with the juices (usually just adding ice to it so the fat floats to the top) and pour back in most of the juices sans the fat. Add back in the now shredded pork, let it warm back up a bit and dinner is done :) served with rice of course.Never been to Hawaii but it tastes just like the one I had served at a Hawaiian restaurant and my hubby says it’s on par with the real thing in Hawaii.

"reviewBody": "This is an acceptable recipe. However, it is missing half of its flavor. When I had to transfer from Hawaii to NY then OH and VA I would order from my local florist two banana leaves and one bunch of ti leaves. Wash them thoroughly and then trim the green leaf off of the spine of the banana (one leaf equals two long green strips. discard the spine). On the back of each ti leaf, gently press a knife blade across the spine to break it. Fold the leaf and peel the bottom half off the spine of the leaf. Next, depending upon the size of your meat, lay out a big square of foil. Then make a flower in the center of it with all your ti leaves (tips together in the center. Then lay your four larger banana leave on top in a crisscross or basket weave pattern. Take your meat and rub it generously with sea salt. Center it on the leaves. sprinkle well with Keawe/Mesquite liquid smoke. Fold the banana leaf up flat over the meat. Then, repeat by bringing each petal of the ti leaves up and over. Finally, bring the foil up and over and tightly wrap so that all the leaves are completely covered/secured. I put a small wire rack in the bottom of my slow cooker and fill with water to the bottom of the wire. Then I sit the foil package on it and put it on low for about 16-20 hours. The leaves are a very traditional way of cooking the meat in the imu and they impart a flavor that is subtle and so 'ono (delicious) also, they help absorb fat. When the dish is done, take the lid off and peel the foil"

We love authentic Kalua pork with Ti Leaves but you can't really get those on the mainland. I'm sooooooooo tired of bbq pulled pork. I like the smoky-saltiness of kalua style. This recipe is not only extremely easy, it's the closest I get to the real thing. It's our go-to meat for crowds or multiple meals. You can eat it alone, on a hawaiian bun/rolls, as lettuce wraps, stuffed potato skins, salads you name it. Love this recipe."

"reviewBody": "Wife and I just made this last night in our slow cooker. We bought a 6lb pork shoulder for this. Don't have Hawaiian sea salt in our local stores (looked in asian and non-asian). We substituted Himalayan Pink salt instead. Had a hard time finding liquid smoke as well, Googled a substitute and found some smoked paprika. Cooked in slow cooker for 9 hours and we wrapped our in banana leaf. Didn't turn the roast over due to the banana leaf would have torn. We did add about 3-4 ounces of water..since we were uncertain if the banana leaf would burn in the slow cooker.\n\nWe found it okay..not super special or outstanding. We have not tried traditional kalua pork, so we don't have a means of comparison or reference.\n\nThe side of the meat that was in contact with the liquid was easier to shred than the side that wasn't (of course). The smoked paprika flavor did come through as did the infused flavor of the banana leaf. After shredding with 2 forks, i put all back in the slow cooker with the juices (removed the banana leaf). The shredded pork did gain the flavoring from the juices.\n\nHowever, found this difficult to eat with rice, not saucy enough for our palate. I did use some in a wrap with some hickory smoked bbq sauce and it was fine. If you prefer pulled pork this is 1 way to go if you intend to use your favorite sauce and some veggies with it in a sandwich/wrap.\n\nHowever, we prefer this one for making a pulled pork style dish : https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/141678/"
