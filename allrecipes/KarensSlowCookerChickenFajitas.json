I also held out the remainder of the onion and the bell peppers and put them in about a half hour before we were going to eat. Readers are correct there is A LOT of liquid, However we used tongs to lift the meat out and it was lovely. I will definitely make this again. Oh-I did not use seasoning packets, I found the Allrecipes recipe for fajita seasoning and made up a jar full-used about 6 tablespoons of it with the salsa. I have the rest stored in a jar for future meals!"

It wasn't until I went to make it again that I saw the recipe actually called for two, but it was so good the first time, I just continued to use the one packet. I'm such a rebel!"

This was all in addition to the original recipe. It turned out well and I’m happy with the result!"

It was great! Better then sauteing the vegetables in a pan. The second time I made it I added frozen chicken breast to the slow cooker and as others have said it comes out too soft. Shreds very easily, but I like having a chunkier piece of chicken in my fajita. I will definitely make again with left over chicken."

Make dinner the way that YOU want. Unless they are allergic to an ingredient, there is no reason to make a separate meal."

The flavor was great, but it was very watery.\nI'll check other stores for the powder mix next time.\nI froze the leftovers and will use it to make a Soup - I'll add corn, canned tomatoes and black beans."

I order by the box on Amazon. We make this recipe at least 2 times a month!!!!! Thank you Karen for sharing!!!!!!"

I also ran the salsa through a strainer so she wouldn't have any vegetables mixed in; just salsa juice. I used 1 cup. I shredded the chicken since it was falling apart anyway. I used queso cheese on the tortillas before adding the chicken and toppings. Both batches came out wonderfully. I used the leftovers on top of baked nachos... yum!"

The chicken fell apart to the point we renamed the dish \"Pulled Mexican Chicken\" Plus the meat was dry and the veggies were soggy even though I put them when it only had 45 minutes left, and it was way to soupy.. to the point it turned the tortillas soggy when we assembled them, Tried draining, but no luck. I never had dry meat, but I had to drain juice off.. I did like the idea of the salsa instead of water. Next time I think I will make fajitas the old fashioned way and use the slow cooker to keep them warm. The searing helps keeps the breast meat moist."

I also had stuff that would be used for a taco(refried beans, lettuce, tomato etc, I have 3 teenage boys so I have to make food last)all I can say is this is a 5 star recipe. I have been told I will make this again in the next two weeks. Thank you for such a great recipe."

It was very well received at dinner last night, but next time I would add the peppers half way through cooking. My peppers/onions were basically cooked away even though I sliced them fairly thick. I would probably also increase the amount of peppers/onions and garnish with chopped cilantro. I used the liner, which was absolutely wonderful! Thanks, Reynolds!"
