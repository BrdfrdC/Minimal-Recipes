We just used all of the normal hamburger toppings and buns and they were so good. My parents are from Iowa and said these aren't like typical maid rites, but I think they had way more flavor."

Very sloppy joe-like, but different from the Manwich I typically use for a quick meal. Thanks Kendra :) ***UPDATE*** I made these again tonight, and once again, I only had one pound of hamburger. However, I forgot to halve the rest of the ingredients, and they still turned out great! Since they were extra sloppy, we used the potato chips I had made to go with it as scoops. This leads me to believe this would be great over mashed potatoes or wide noodles, for a nice change from buns :)"

I liked that the ingredients are something I always have on hand, but I had to almost double the sauce ingredients. When I got to the simmering part the meat tasted a little bland and was so void of liquid it wouldn't hold together. Afraid of it burning while it sat there for 20 minutes I threw in some more of each ingredient and added some garlic powder as well. I would make this again if I needed something to throw together, but I don't find myself serving it to company or adding it to my cooking repertoire on a regular basis."

I've never lived in an area that had one! Hope to try one someday. Anyway, I enjoyed this recipe, although I wish the meat came out a little juicier. I only used 1 lb of beef, therefore I halved all the other ingredients. Next time I will take another reviewer's advice and not half anything, because that will keep the meat jucier, like I wanted. Also, I stirred all the sauces/sugar/vinegar, etc into a bowl first, then poured that whole combined mixture over the meat. Very tasty, great flavor!"
