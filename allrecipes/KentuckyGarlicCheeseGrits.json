Did not have milk so subbed for milk a mixture of greek 2% plain yogurt 66% and water 34%. The grits were wonderful. Will be making this again--with milk or 2% Greek Yogurt."

I have added a dash of Worcestershire sauce in my individual servings and will probably add in future when making it. But excellent either way. I have lived off of it for past 24 hours!!!"

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe twice this past weekend - the first time I made it x6 and the second time x2. So the first thing I'll say is that it scales up well. I found that the result was not firm like cornbread either time, but it was still tasty and people liked it. The second time I left out the butter entirely because the butter just formed a large pool of melted grease on the top. The second time I also didn't put any of the cheese on top - I mixed it all in. The second version was much better. I used half extra sharp cheddar and half pepper jack. I also used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Next time I will add even more hot sauce."

As others noted, I only had an 8 oz bag of shredded cheddar, and that worked out great. I used about 2/3 in the recipe and 1/3 on top in the oven. The top layer added a nice crisp to the texture."

I used less of the garlic (about 1 tsp) as other recommended and I'm so glad I did. It would have overpowered the dish. I really like the flavor of hot sauce so I added more. I'll be making this again."

"reviewBody": "Five stars as a great base for consistency and flavor! I did use low sodium chicken broth in place of water, about 1/2 cup of crumbled bacon and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese in addition to about 8 oz of shredded cheddar. The biggest notation here, though, is the GARLIC! I love garlic but, heeding other reviews, I reduced the garlic by half and it was still a little too much IMO. I use a premium, American grown garlic with zero filler - maybe it's just stronger than some other brands. I did not put the cheese on top because we like to fry our grits before serving them, so I added a little more to the grits, as noted above."

I added half the cheese and sprinkled the rest on top, then re-covered it to let the cheese melt. They were still amazing even if I made them wrong. I served it with grilled shrimp--such a great combination! Thanks for the recipe!"

Of course, using less garlic powder or substituting real garlic is easy enough to do. I also do not like grits cooked as firm as cornbread. I checked them at 30 minutes and then cooked them just barely past the jiggly stage."
