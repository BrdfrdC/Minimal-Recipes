I sprinkled more grated Swiss cheese on top of the meatballs before serving them. For those that like a little more spicey heat, it is easy to add more spices before forming the meatballs."

"reviewBody": "I thought this was delicious! But let me be clear, I DID NOT MAKE THIS \"KETO STYLE\", I was drawn to this NOT for the keto but because it sounded good. I used ground turkey (generally when i make any type of meatball i do a 50/50 mix of turkey/beef, I did NOT do that this time but will next time..the turkey alone was too much for the hubby.) I used (homemade) bread crumbs in place of almond flour (kept adding until i found the consistency i like, approx 1c). I also cooked these in some broth in the bottom of the pan. And because i read some of the reviews that said the sauce was too thin, i made a roux first (using 1.5 tbs butter, 1.5 tbs olive oil and 3 tbs flour). I used 1 c skim milk &amp; 1/2c heavy cream and omitted the water. It came out very creamy and rich. I served them over brown rice that i cooked in chicken broth."

I followed the recipe exactly, I let the ground chicken mixture “sit” for about 2 hours after putting everything together and that made making the meatballs easy. I served it with garlic butter green beans and it was all devoured. We are a family of 5 and we all agree: 5 stars!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe had a great flavor and I will make it again, however I have 2 semi-cons. In preparing to cook, I first cut the ham as directed. When I started to put the chicken mixture and ham into meatballs, the idea of biting into a chunk of ham in the center did not appeal to me. I cut the ham into 1/4\" cubes or so--mixed it all together and cooked them. I found I needed much more than 1T of olive oil and almost double the suggested 3 minutes on \"each\" side. Balls do not have \"sides\".\nMy second semi-con, I prefer my sauce a little thicker. I wondered how the sauce would thicken with no thickening ingredient. It didn't. I much prefer to have the sauce cling to the meatballs. That all said, the meatballs with the small ham cubes mixed in and accompanied by the sauce made an extremely tasty entree. I now know why there are mistakes in raters' reviews. This setup makes it impossible to go back and\n edit my review. Very annoying."

"reviewBody": "Recipe creator here! If your meatballs are dry, you are likely overcooking them, or using too lean of ground chicken. As is the norm with keto, try using a fattier blend of ground chicken, which uses dark meat (85% lean), instead of using pure ground breast meat (98% lean). As for the cheese not melting properly, I would encourage you to use a finer shred size and to only add about 1/4 cup cheese at a time, whisk to incorporate, then add more until completely added. Also, using too high heat will cause your cheese to seize up and not melt properly, so heat gently and as evenly as possible while the cheese is melting. Enjoy!"
