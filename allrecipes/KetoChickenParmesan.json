I would stick with unflavored regular pork rinds to keeping the dish from being too salty, and I used crushed garlic instead of garlic powder. This one is a keeper."

One tip, use a mini or full size food processor for the pork rinds. I had made my first batch of homemade tomato sauce- no sugar added. I made whole-wheat pasta and zoodles with mushrooms. I used my 12 inch stainless steel skillet for the chicken and to broil it. I removed the chicken, put the pasta and zoodles on the bottom, then chicken, then cheese, then sauce. Broiler for 5 minutes. It was perfect!!"

I was using a home made arrabiata sauce, which is spicy, so I left the pepper flakes and black pepper out of the breading. I would have added it if I was using a less flavorful sauce. Excellent recipe"

"reviewBody": "This is genuinely the best Keto recipe I have ever made. I made an allrecipes account specifically to praise how good it is. I've had a lot of bland food on Keto and this spiced it up quite a bit\n\nMy only notes would be that you can make way more than just one chicken breast with the single egg (I guestimated on the pork rinds, so idk for that mixture). Also I had to put it in an over at around 170F to get the cheese to melt, but that might be because I used sauce from the fridge. Lastly chilli powder or paprika can be a good substitute for the red pepper flakes\n\nOverall, I could not recommend this enough for anyone on a Keto diet"

"reviewBody": "Following the keto diet (have been in ketosis for about 5 weeks now, could consistently losing weight) and made this recipe exactly as-is. It was absolutely delicious and I cannot say enough about the crunch - so good! Enjoyed one of the chicken pieces with San Marzano crushed tomato (~3-4 g sugar) and mozzarella cheese as described --- still in ketosis. The amount of carbs/sugar for one piece with cheese and tomato will not (and should not) kick you out of ketosis if you're not exceeding daily macros."

I drained I 16 oz jar of my own canned San Marzano tomatoes, then added the strained tomatoes to the garlic. I added 1/2 tsp basil, oregano, and 1/4 tsp course black pepper, and about 1/2 tsp salt. I let that simmer about 15 min while I incorporated the dry ingredients. After I processed the pork rinds, about 1/2 of a 5 oz bag to yield about 1 cup of finely ground rinds, I added all the remaining ingredients and included a tsp of flaked onion. I didn't have garlic powder on hand so I used 1 tsp garlic salt and omitted the suggested salt on the recipe. I made my own Italian seasoning with 1/2 tsp basil, oregano, marjoram, parsley flakes, and 1/4 tsp black pepper . I didn't use ghee, but really good butter work!"

Had no ghee, so used around half each of butter and bacon grease to fry the battered chicken breasts. Used a generous amount of mozzarella, but still didn't look enough, so added a bit of parmesan on top, too. Also, I used a good marinara sauce vs just tomato sauce (Lucini Organic Sauce Roasted Garlic Marinara--all organic and NO sugar added). I doubled everything because I had 3 chicken breast halves. Served it with fresh spinach with garlic, salt, and pepper sautéed in butter and bacon grease."

"reviewBody": "I did not follow the recipe exactly, some part from necessity and other parts from preference. For 1, even sugar free marinara is too high in carbs, so I used Alfredo sauce. I also don’t have ghee, so I cooked it in olive oil. I also finished the chicken off in a 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes because no way is 3 minutes on each side long enough to cook the chicken through. I did give the recipe 5 stars, though, for brilliance. Using pork rinds instead of bread crumbs as a low carb option is so smart, it blew my mind. It doesn’t taste like pork rinds, it just tastes like eating delicious, high carb chicken Parmesan."

I made the whole dish a couple of hours ahead of time and put in oven at 350 covered for 20 mins or so until the chicken came back up to temp and then removed the foil and turned the oven up to broil (low) until the cheese was nice and bubbly. Served with zoodles sauteed in lemon infused olive oil and a cesar salad (minus the croutons). This one is a keeper."

I calculated the macros and it comes out to be less than 4 grams of carbs per chicken breast.
