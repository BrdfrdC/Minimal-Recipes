"reviewBody": "This is a pretty good keto cereal. :-) I didn't have walnuts, though, so I did 1/2 cup of almonds instead of 1/3. I also used Stevia (the 1:1 ratio kind). I tried a little bit with coconut milk to see what it was like. Not bad. \n\nHowever, 8 - 10 min is definitely too long... I kept checking it, because I was afraid it was gonna burn. I ended up taking it out after 7 min, but I should have taken it out after 6. Some of the nuts started to burn. Next time, I'll take it out sooner. I'll also probably add a bit more Stevia. It suggests adding a little artificial sweetener, but that's not keto, so adding more natural non-sugar sweetener would be good. \n\nBut yeah, it's a good keto cereal to have with almond or coconut milk."

I don't like artificial, and usually do without. I chose coconut sugar, 2 tsp for the whole batch (1g. Sugar per serving). This came out perfect. Crunchy, and just enough sweetness to bring out the cinnamon. I'll be keeping this recipe!"
