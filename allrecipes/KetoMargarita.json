I used Polar tangerine lemon seltzer. Additionally, I added Angostura Orange Bitters for more orange flavor. Fresh and mostly organic. Refreshing. A brand new Keto drink to add to my weekend lineup of choice Keto drinks. Thank you."

Living in Florida, a margarita really hits the spot and it's good to know I can enjoy one without totally falling off the keto wagon! I have made this with the sweetener and without. I like it better without because I am not a big fan of sweet drinks anyways. I think the lime juice adds enough sweet/tartness. But that is my personal preference."
