Excellent recipe and I will definitely be making this again, love that it's Keto with Cauliflower \"rice\" which provides some fiber to the dish!"

However, as there was nothing left and everybody kept asking ‚Äúwho made that?‚Äù, I guess looks can be deceiving because it was a hit! It was easy, a quick make, and common ingredients were on hand."
