I also replaced the red onion with green onion. I added a half boiled egg on top with paprika for garnish, like my mother always did. This was delicious and light. We love it"

I usually eat tuna with crackers, but since I'm doing Keto, I used plain pork rinds as a dipper. Easy, quick, and delicious!"

Frozen, finely diced red onion added straight from the freezer since this is for tomorrow's lunch. Bet it's even tastier tomorrow! 5 stars for simplicity while being surprisingly yummy."

If you can remember the needed ingredients, you can almost always make a delish tuna salad by just throwing it in together. I was surprised at how the lime juice livened up the dish quite a bit."
