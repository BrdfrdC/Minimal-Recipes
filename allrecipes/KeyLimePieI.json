My pie took more than 15 minutes baking time to set, but i’m Not sure if that’s due to the coconut milk or my oven. I could not find key limes, so I just used regular ones and a tiny bit of zest. I also added 1/2 tsp of ground ginger to the crust. The pie has a pleasant flavor. It is very sweet."

It was light and had the perfect amount of tang, loved it! I have never even seen key limes or juice in our area so I mixed half lime with half lemon juice like a few other reviewers suggested. I also had to let it bake for about five minutes extra. Other than that, I followed it perfectly and we all enjoyed every bite. Thank you for sharing! (Also, to those who are key lime pie experts, if all you want is the real thing then I suggest you plan a vacation instead of reviewing a recipe like you are Gordon Ramsey. These are simply recipes to try at home, not a contest)."

I also add in the zest of about 5-7 key limes however in a pinch the zest of two regular limes will do as well. I make mine in a 10.5 in springform pan so i usually have to double the recipe to get it to even out. I've been serving this at my kitchen for the past few weeks now, in Florida. All the locals love it and I'm getting asked for the recipe constantly from other chefs in the area. Great pie here, and thanks."

For the whipped cream I used 1 cup heavy whipping cream, three tablespoons of powdered sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla (my favorite whipped cream recipe). It was very light and with lots of citrus flavor. I also used a prebaked crust and had no trouble getting out of the pan. I found it needed about 18 - 20 minutes to cook to firm up. It cooled for an hour then I put it in the freezer for two hours before we ate it. I think the firmness was from the extra cook time rather than the freezer but either way it was delicious. I would definitely make this again!"

"reviewBody": "I followed this recipe completely as written except the pie crust. I followed another reviewer's suggestions and used 1.5 cups graham crakers, 6 T butter, 1/4 cup sugar. \n\nThe pie comes out very fluffy and has an awesome texture (if you like fluffy pies!) but is extremely tart!! I've never really had key lime pie before, so I don't know how tart it's supposed to be. \n\nSome other reviewers stated there wasn't enough filling for a 9\" pie pan, but I guess with the thicker crust this isn't a problem because mine filled up to the top perfectly and did not overflow. I ended up baking it for about 16 minutes."

My notes on the recipe: I made some adjustments to the crust as well. I eliminated the sugar, and like other reviewers, I reduced the butter to 4T, or 1/4 cup. For the rest of the recipe, I followed the directions as written, except I added 1 tsp grated lime zest. I allowed the pie to cool for 30 minutes before placing it in the refrigerator for an hour. I then froze the pie for one hour before serving, and the consistency was excellent."

We used cool whip instead of heavy whipping cream for the decorative topping, and it worked out just fine, probably even easier to do. This pie is a perfect summer treat."

"reviewBody": "i have made this pie many many times. Everyone loves this pie. it really is the best key lime pie i have ever tasted. The only thing i change is that i need more grahm crackers. I use about a 1/2 cup more. i also add another tablesoon of butter to the crust. The only problem ive been having recently, is that the crust sticks to the bottom. i have tried many ways, but i cant seem to make it not stick. but the crust is what makes this pie so amazing im not going to change it :) definately worth the hassle. id like to address the reviews where people were saying this pie was light and airey. It is not, i dont know why your pie was doing that, but mine always come out smooth and creamy. i dont use fresh lime juice, i use key lime juice from a bottle that i buy at the grocery, ive never tried it with any other kind of lime juice or fresh limes."

Let cool at room temperature (the pie finishes cooking as it cools), then refrigerate overnight-- do not freeze! Thanks for a great recipe!"

But I entered it in a dessert contest that had LOTS of entries and it won 2nd place (and was subsequently devoured before I could get to it). So, with that feedback and the the raving I heard from the judges (amazing! perfect tartness, etc.), I feel comfortable giving it 5 stars. I made more crust (as one reviewer suggested: 1 1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar and 6 Tbl butter) but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. I am going to make another one and keep it for myself:-)"

The first time I tried this recipe I substituted the key lime with lemon/lime juice, and while still pretty good, doesn't compare to the second and subsequent times I've prepared this pie using the authentic key lime juice. One thing I'd like to add for everyone commenting on the color, it isn't supposed to be green! A true key lime pie is yellow, so please don't feel that you should be adding dye to an otherwise lovely pie."

"reviewBody": "This is a nice and light key lime pie recipe. I used to make key lime pie with egg yolks only and it was much heavier and more custardy. The first time I made this pie I didn't freeze it and the filling was too soft (about the consistency of whipped cream - light and fluffy but didn't taste like a pie). Now I always freeze it to make it firmer and I serve it right out of the freezer. The texture is perfect - exactly what you'd expect for a key lime pie but without all the extra egg yolks. It's a great recipe for summer since it's cold like ice cream. I wouldn't recommend using this recipe if you don't plan on freezing it. I also chose to use a pre-made pie crust because graham crackers have high fructose corn syrup while the pre-made pie crust does not."
