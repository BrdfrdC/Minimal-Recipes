I made my 5 Graham cracker and almond crusts, then discovered I had no sweetened condensed milk! That is the only way I had ever made it. Thank goodness for Google and Allrecipes! I read thru reviews and decided to increase the lime juice (Nellie and Joe's) and decreased the water accordingly. I treated the procedure as if I was making a cream pie. Had no trouble with setting up nicely. Covered with lightly sweetened whipped cream. Will have to wait for a taste tomorrow from what is leftover but from tasting the mixture while preparing, know it was delicious."

However, I would recommend the pie crust is very very baked to the point where its almost burned (but not quite) because otherwise the mixture makes the crust on the bottle slightly soggy. Also if you really like that kick of lime I would add in a bit more of the lime juice. However, turned out very well and highly recommend."

It's the opposite of Lemon Meringue.\n\nI changed the recipe around a bit. I used 1-1/2 cups of water instead of 2 and 1/2 cup of Fresh limes (10 Limes). I added green food coloring (paste) instead of liquid and followed the rest of the ingredients as it stated on the recipe. \n\nFor a 9\" pie, I might double it the next time just to see how it works. Perfect for an 8\" pie. That's because I like more fillings in my pie."

"reviewBody": "A huge success! I had my trusty bottle of Kermit's Key Lime Juice with me, but I forgot to buy sweetened condensed milk. I felt that there HAD to be a recipe that didn't use it. How lucky that this one appeared as the top Google result!\n\n I made sure to cook the filling for quite a while, until it thickened well, and then I cooked it a total of five minutes longer after adding in the Key Lime Juice. ADVICE: keep tasting the filling (I used up lots of spoons and eventually forks!). At first it wasn't \"limey\" enough for me, and so I kept adding a bit more of the Key Lime Juice until it tasted just right for my friends. (If I were going to eat the pie all my myself, I would have added even more juice.) \n\nI had used up all my butter for the crust (I made a graham cracker crust, because it's my favorite), and so I didn't add butter to the filling. 2nd ADVICE: you don't need the butter! I also had no cream of tartar on hand, but guess what, if you whip the egg whites long enough, you don't need that either! (Remember to stop beating the eggs once they reach peak consistency.) 3rd ADVICE: I used only 3 T sugar in the meringue. It's not super easy to spread the meringue on the filling; it takes more time than frosting a cake. Be patient! FINAL ADVICE: Keep an eye on the pie once it's in the oven! Mine got too brown on top. I cut away the too-brown parts and it tasted fine. 5 out of 6 asked for seconds!"

The first time I followed the recipe and found I needed extra corn starch to thicken after adding the lime juice. It was also SO sweet that I threw it out and made a second one. The second time I used 1.5c water and 1c lime juice, plus added a half tablespoon extra corn starch in the beginning and it was MUCH better. I also made fresh whipped cream instead of the meringue as it was still very sweet. I guess in the end I just don't like my deserts sickly sweet, even with a zing of lime. Here's a picture prior to the whipped cream!"

"reviewBody": "Husband's favorite dessert, so I decided to make one totally from scratch for his birthday vs. buying one like usual, but wanted fewer calories than other recipes. I didn't have the greatest luck with this recipe. Besides being extremely labor intensive, used suggestion of doubling lime juice, attempting to hand squeeze all, but ended up filling the rest with store bought juice. Getting a T. of lime zest took a long time. Pudding didn't set over night, so had to spoon out of the shell, cooked longer adding 1/4 c. sugar because it was so tart, a little corn starch &amp; water to thicken, fixed the setting problem, but it and the overly sweet meringue made it too rich for my preference. If I were to make again, I'd follow directions to a T, but would probably leave out the zest, cook the pudding longer the first time &amp; cut the sugar for the meringue in half."

"reviewBody": "I made this pie for my parents, who are crazy about key lime pie. This pie came out beautiful and delicious and everyone RAVED! It has the perfect balance of sweet and tart and it’s so full of key lime flavor. I had never made anything with key limes before this pie and I was surprised with how small key limes are, so I had no idea how many I would need to get the amount of juice and zest needed for this recipe. The limes I used were cherry tomato-sized. It took about 7 limes (1/4 lb.) to get ¼ cup juice and an additional 3 limes (10 total) to get the 1 Tbsp. zest. I think the trick to getting the pie to set up after adding the juice and butter is to bring it back up to a boil. I also stirred the mixture a couple of times while it cooled in the pan a little before pouring into the crust. I used a graham cracker crust (brushed with an egg wash and prebaked at 375 for 5 minutes) and the meringue turned out lovely as written."

My lemon meringue recipe calls for adding the lemon juice after removing from heat, too, I'm not sure why, but it works fine for me. Just be patient and let the mixture thicken well before removing from heat. It was going to be awhile (maybe 2 hrs?) before I made the meringue, so I put the whites in the refrigerator, letting the other cool in saucepan, just stirring occasionally. When I made the meringue, I didn't wait for the whites to return to room temp. and it came out marvelous. Will try that again. Thanks for the excellent recipe."

I made the recipe exactly as it is written.I will make this refreshing pie again and again.I think there are mixed reviews do the pie not setting up properly. The recipe should state that the mixture must come to a boil for 2 minutes as with all pudding pies."

Reading the other reviews, I was worried about the thickening of the mixture but it turned out just fine; I kept all measurements the same as given except for the key lime (added a little more than 1/4). I'm not a big fan of meringue so I skipped that altogether. It came out looking great."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is excellent. I've made it many times and now also use it for lemon meringue pies (substituting the same amount of lemon juice and zest for the lime). I especially like it that no condensed milk is required, so the fruit taste really stands out--cheaper and healthier without the condensed milk, too. Also, this meringue recipe is better than the one I used to make--simpler and never fails. Two tips: Make sure the filling doesn't look thin before you add it to the pie shell. If it does look thin, cook it a little longer at a slightly higher temperature until it has a pudding-like consistency. Second, make sure you clean your beaters thoroughly before doing the meringue, and see that they're cool. I put mine in the fridge (along with the bowl and utensils) until it's time to use them. You can also make the meringue first so that you don't have to clean the beaters, etc., before you use them to do the egg yolks. (If your kitchen is warm, put the bowl of meringue in the fridge until it's time to top the pie.) Anyway, thanks very much, Jack, for this great recipe. Can't wait to try it for orange, pineapple, and other fruit-juice pies."

"reviewBody": "Okay, first of all, it's true that the use of water instead of condensed milk really enhances the flavour of the lime. But what I can't understand is why the recipe states to add the lime juice after the rest of the filling is cooked. In my case, the filling was nice and thick up until this point, but the lime juice diluted it so much that it was like soup when I poured it into the pie shell, foolishly hoping that a brief stint in the oven would help it set. Well, it never set, even after a night in the refrigerator. But I hate to waste, so the next day, I poured out the filling, reheated it with a little more flour until it got thick, then poured it back into the pie shell and baked it again. This time it came out beautiful and perfectly set, even without refrigeration. So I would definitely recommend this recipe - just don't do what I did and pour in the filling unless it is thick enough to form ribbons when stirred. If it is too soupy, add more flour or cook it a little longer, but don't hope for it to set up in the oven, because it won't!"

"reviewBody": "I was looking for a low carb key lime pie with the more traditional meringue element, which is why I chose this one without sweetened condensed milk. At first I tried it with splenda instead of sugar but it just didn't set up right. (It still tasted good though!) For my second attemtpt I took the lime water suggestion from another reader one step further and used 1 cup diet lemon lime soda, 1 cup water and only a 1/2 cup sugar. The mixture was a little frothy in the beginning but thickened to look exactly like my first attempt. It was so so good this way. I also baked it without the crust both times, which worked fine, but I had to extend the cooking time a bit. I did this by turning off the oven after 10 min. and letting it sit for about 15 min more in the hot oven. It held it's shape well when chilled and served with a pie server."

I like a graham cracker crust, so I used this instead of a plain baked shell. And I don't like meringue, no matter HOW it is made, so I omitted the meringue from my pie. Over all, an easy to follow recipe with excellent results and with a low cost."

This was outstanding! Stood up so nicely, was not soupy, cut into nice slices and sooo creamy. I think the flour is the key to creaminess. The only mods. I made were to add more lime zest, and used 1/2 cup of key lime juice and cut the water accordingly. I also used lime-essence water instead. The lime water is great if you can find it. I get it at CVS drugstore in the dollar aisle! It is simply bottled water with a faint essence of lime. This recipe is a keeper. I used the french pastry pie crust from this site and it all turned out so nicely. **remember to keep egg whites at room temp when making meringue and make sure that beaters and bowl are free from any oil or fat or meringue will not set up."
