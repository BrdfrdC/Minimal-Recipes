I also substitued 8oz of real whipping cream instead of the whipped topping. (whipped it up with a couple tsp of sugar)."

"reviewBody": "Another good key lime pie recipe. I didn't have a pie crust on hand, nor did I have a graham cracker crust, put I did have a box of 'Nilla Wafers ®. I wanted these for a \"Girls Night Out\" dinner, so I decided to make mini bite-sized pies. I put one wafer in a mini cupcake cake paper, mixed the filling ingredients as directed, and used my small cookie scoop to fill the cupcake papers. These set up nicely in the refrigerator and held their shape for 1 1/2 hours out of the fridge. Yes, they got soft, but they didn't \"melt down\". This was a fun way to serve this pie to a group of women. Everyone had a few of them and there were some for the ladies to take home. I got 42 minis out of this recipe."

It took a while to set so I couldn't eat it the same night I made it. I put it in the freezer over night and by the next day it was terrific. I did NOT add additional sugar because I found the condensed milk &amp; pudding mix was sweet enough. Next time maybe I'll do only 1/2 cup lime juice and 1/2 tbsp of zest to tame the tangyness. Great &amp; super-easy recipe though!"

"reviewBody": "The vanilla pudding and Cool Whip are very prominent flavors here. I disliked it for that reason. Everyone else that ate it thought it was definitely 5 stars! They were particularly thrilled with the mousse-like texture, which was in fact quite nice, really. I would not reduce the lime juice; keep it at the full cup unless you hate sour desserts, in which case, this might not be the right one for you :) I tinted mine green (spilled the green food coloring -- made it a horrible minty color) and garnished with lime zest. Don't garnish with lime zest overnight -- it looks funky the next day. Just an FYI on that one. Thanks for the recipe!"

I also recommend making (and baking 8 min) your own graham cracker crust. And ditch the Cool Whip ....use fresh whipped whipping cream instead and you won't regret it. Note: only add 1 tsp powdered sugar to the whipping cream. This adaptation is VERY rich, but has just the right tartness and not overwhelmingly sweet."

I use the wee little limes from Mexico, since I live way too far away from FLA to get the real deal, and I give myself carpal-tunnel while reaming every single one of those little suckers for every drop of juice they will yield, but the mouth-watering tartness is totally worth it.

I also only used 1/2 of an 8oz container of Cool Whip and it filled up a deep dish pan. I also used the Graham Cracker Crust recipe from the site."

I get key limes, which are available at Trader Joe's if you have one near by. I use my garlic press to juice them. One bag of key limes makes a little less than a cup, but it turns out great. Be careful not to put too much zest in though because it will make it a little bitter."

I used a graham cracker crust then drizzled it with some white chocolate that I heated up with a little whipping cream and butter. Instead of just garnishing with whipped topping sometimes cover it. I also added a little lemon juice to make it more tart and a drop of green food coloring! This is a great pie to make in quantities too! I have always made 3 at least at a time. One time I did not have the required amount of lime juice and I found lime pudding at the store, this came out great. Another time a spiced it up and used coconut pudding and added some chopped coconut to the mix and it was great for our luau! This is a recipe i make over and over by demand, and I can't get enough of it!"

I only addded 5 ounces of whipped topic and feel like I'd pull it down even more...maybe down to a couple ounces so that it has more of a heavy texture. I also used key limes (took me forever to get all those things squeezed but the flavor was worth it). The flavor was absolutely delicious!! Dreamy and perfect. Will definitely make again!"

I also tried this crumbling a graham cracker crust into individual size footed glass bowls. They were adorable and delicious (without the pudding!) Lastly,I found a *huge* difference in using fresh limes vs. bottled key lime juice. The bottled juice left a stong imitation lime after taste. I'll only use fresh lime juice now."

And for those of you who are wondering what the nutritional numbers are when you substitute reduced-fat graham cracker crust (Ready-Made, Keebler brand), low-fat sweetened condensed milk (Eagle Brand),and Lite Cool Whip, here are the details per serving. I used regular Jell-O Instant Pudding because the fat-free/sugar-free was 1oz and the recipe called for 3.5oz and I wasn't sure it would work. (cal/fat/carb/prot) Pudding\t(45/0/11.5/0), Crust (100/3.5/15/1), Whip (62.5/3.1/9.4/0), Lime Juice (8.25/0/2.8/0.14), Condensed Milk (162.5/1.8/28.7/3.75), TOTAL per serving (378.3/8.4/67.4/4.9)"

I made a few changes: I omitted the rind, I added two drops of food coloring to get the light green color, I used fresh key lime juice - about 24 key limes. It takes a while to juice but well worth it. I hate cool whip so I used canned whip cream but only 1/4 cup since I love the fresh, tart flavor. For those who love tartness you can increase the key lime juice (way better!) but if you like sweetness then reduce the juice. I used a store bought graham crust. Let it set in refrigerator for 2 hrs, great taste!"

Keep in mind it is a no- bake kind, so it does have a different texture than the traditional kind. I use the Nellie and Joes key lime juice you can get in the grocery store. Why use plain old lime juice when the key lime stuff is right there? I have made this four times. If you use the Nellie and Joes and like a tart flavor, go ahead and use the cup. If not, use 3/4 of a cup and it is still great. If you make it all low fat, I would stick with 3/4 cup of the key lime juice or else it turns out extremely tart. (but still good...)"
