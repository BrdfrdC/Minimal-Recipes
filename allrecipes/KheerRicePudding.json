That is how I had it in an Indian restaurant recently, and it was exceptionally good! \n\nSome other commenters warned not to change the proportions of milk and rice. I too was concerned that it would end up too soupy. However I followed the recipe exactly, except for the blending part, and it turned out just right!\n\nThe flavors and this recipe blended well , and were subtle. The thickness is easily fixed by adding a little extra milk. I will make this again!"

"reviewBody": "Great recipe! I grew up eating Kheer, since my grandmother was Indian and made this for \"pooja\" all the time. This recipe has been the closest I've tasted to hers. I made a few modifications: used 4 cups of whole milk and simmered the rice for about 45 mins to 1 hour. I also used 6 whole cardamom (i LOVE cardamom!) which I shelled and crushed up in my mortar and pestle and dropped in during the cooking process. In the end, I'm glad I used whole cardamom instead of ground because the little crunchy bits of cardamom throughout wasn't overpowering the entire dish, but it added to the texture nicely and gave a nice punch of flavor when you bit down on one. I also used about double the amount of sugar and omitted the coconut milk altogether, as I don't remember my grandmother using it. It came out great! My American boyfriend, who isn't the biggest rice pudding kind of guy- couldn't get enough!!"

I did not use the rose water as I can't stand it, it takes over all the flavors of what ever its added to. I used 1/4 tsp of cardamon, increased the raisins to 1/2 cup (golden raisins) and as for the coconut milk I used the can of lightly sweetened. I cooked the pudding until began to get thick removed it from the heat then added 1/4 cup of fat free 1/2 &amp; 1/2 to make it creamy. The result was terrific and we enjoyed it while it was still warm."

I also replaced slivered almonds with 1/2tsp almond extract since I don't like the crunch of nuts in most of my food."

Used seven cardamom pods and didn't have crushed pistachios so left them out unfortunately. I think I might have cooked it ten or so minutes longer than called for as it was a bit thick, but I prefer it to be a bit thicker anyway. Very rich and creamy if you use whole coconut milk."

"reviewBody": "So, I tried this recipe, mind you I have grown up eating kheer. A few things, I saw some of you mentioned about cooking time, what I did different was put this on high heat instead of low. It was done in a reasonable time. My problem didn't have enough milk in the house. Anyway, I added toasted coconut shavings (did them on stove top before making the kheer) and nutmeg powder as one of the reviewers recommended. Also I have a horrible sweet tooth, so I added a little more than 1/4 cup of sugar to this recipe. you don't really need coconut milk, made this with whole milk brought at gas station."

"reviewBody": "FINALLY!! A kheer recipe just like my favorite Indian restaurant's. It is spot on with the ingredients I just tweaked the ratio for my preferences. It was my first time trying, so I took the recommendations and omitted the coconut milk and used whole milk instead. I like the texture to be more soupy than pudding like so I would decrease rice amount or increase milk amount for that. Also I cannot get enough of the cardamom spice so I doubled it. I only had whole cardamom so improvised and put 1 teaspoon amount into a tea bag and steeped for half the cooking time to infuse milk as it boiled. It was also my first time using rose water for cooking and not for my face! LOL it tasted great in this recipe. Thanks!!"

Try cinnamon or nutmeg if you don't have cardamon.)\n- 1/8 C raisins\n- 1/4 C almonds\n\nIt was yummy! I will try it cold when the weather warms back up."

"reviewBody": "I eat at an Indian Restaurant near my home at least twice a month and their kheer tastes EXACTLY like this recipe. I didn't use rose water but everything else was spot on. I even paid more than I was comfortable for the ground cardamom but as soon as I opened that jar of spice, I knew I was on the right track. I agree that kheer is served cold and even though the mixture was really runny when I put it in the fridge, it started soaking up the \"juice\" and became creamy and good. I did end up cooking it longer than the recipe said only because I lost track of time while I was cooking other things. I stirred it every few minutes and by the time I looked at the clock it had been cooking on the stovetop for 50 minutes. Didn't seem to affect it one bit. I am wondering how well this would do in a crock pot on low for several hours? That may be something I will try soon. Goodness knows, I need to use up that cardamom that I paid royally for!"

"reviewBody": "Amazing Kheer recipe! This is my first time making it. I've eaten Indian food about five times so far in the past few months. The closest Indian restaurant is about 40 mins away. I crave chicken jalfezi, gulab jamen and kheer many times. This recipe is supreme compared to the restaurant. My parents loved it! I couldn't wait for it to chill as I was tasting as it was cooking. I could eat this as oatmeal! I used 7 tbsp of Dixie sugar. I had to shell about 20 pistachios and beat them in a plastic bag. I cooked the rice for about 25-30 mins. Heating on 2 was too slow so low heat of 3 and 4 is ideal. I will keep this recipe forever."

I'm always on the look out for something to fatten up my 3 year old son with and he always enjoys rice pudding when we go to our favourite Indian Restaurant.\n\nA few notes:\nI did not add the raisins or pistachios as my son doesn't like them. As a result I would add less sugar next time I make this as I found it a touch too sweet without the offsetting saltiness of the nuts.\n\nI also added a smidgeon less cardamom to cater more towards my toddlers taste buds. \n\nThis however is a very delicious kick rice pudding!"

"reviewBody": "Fantastic recipe! Turned out exactly like \"real\" Kheer from my favorite Indian restuarant. I used more milk than coconut milk (2:1) and doubled the recipe, as I had some regular milk close to expiration I needed to use up. Used skim, fyi. Still ended up with a nice, rich, coconut taste. Recommend mixing the powdered cardamom into a a few teaspoons of sugar, then adding this mixture to the cooked pudding. Otherwise, the cardamom may not disperse throughout the pudding, leaving small, dark lumps. I normally use less sugar than called for in recipes, as I don't like very sweet things, but I felt this recipe could use a bit more. No problem to add it at the end, so just make it as is, then add more if needed."

The rose water, cardamom, and coconut milk are the main flavorants of this dish and I would not skip them. Otherwise, you will miss the flavorful touches that make Indian food so good. I found rose water in the ethnic section of Shoppers grocery store. The note of rose reminds me of rose gelato."

"reviewBody": "Wonderful -- best Kheer I've had. I'm cursing myself because I freaked out at how soupy it was, and added another 2 or 3 Tbsp rice -- big mistake, since it came out too thick, like an English rice pudding. The rice/milk ratio would have been perfect as written.\n\nAdaptations:\nI boiled 12 pods of green cardamom in the milk/coconut milk, rather than using ground cardamom, and spooned them out after about 20-30 minutes... the flavour was perfectly infused in the milk. I also used a bit too much rose water (about 1 tsp) by accident and it was perfect.\n\nI also used coconut cream, rather than coconut milk -- and I used whole milk too. My Indian friends always tell me that you can't get the proper taste with low fat milk, and the creaminess of this Kheer was excellent.\n\nI highly recommend taking the time to toast the sliced almonds... it takes the flavour of the nuts to a whole new level.\n\nThanks to Patrick7 for posting this recipe!"

I also didn't use rose water because I didn't have any at the time, but the taste was still very good. I also added a tablespoon more sugar, as we have a bit of a sweet tooth. Also, after chilling it, it may be necessary to add more milk as kheer is supposed to be a bit runny. Also, be sure to cook the rice long enough so that it is soft. Don't be surprised if your cooking time is over the suggested amount. Overall, Yum!"

I don't have anything against raisins but I left them out because the restaurant version I had didn't have them. It was simply delightful anyway.

Just a couple of things to keep in mind, however: Don't be surprised if you find yourself waiting for about 45 minutes or so before the pudding actually thickens. The suggested 20 minutes is a little short. Also, be careful not to overcook it. Kheer is supposed to be more watery than typical rice pudding, so don't panic! And it may appear at first that 1/2 cup of Basmati rice is not enough compared to all of the liquid needed, but it is actually perfect; don't add extra rice, or else it'll be too thick! \n\nI hope my suggestions helped!"
