I add a sweet onion cut into half inch wedges, half of a red onion cut into half inch wedges, a green bell pepper, salt, pepper , garlic powder and olive oil. I toss everything with olive oil and the seasoning (to taste) and roast in the oven until vegetables are done. I’ve used red potatoes, gold Yukon potatoes and russets (russets take a bit longer to cook) and a mixture of all 3. This recipe is very versatile! It’s one of my fiancé’s favorite dinners."

"reviewBody": "I live in Guatemala and have to \"make do\" with sausage here. I usually make this with longanizas (like chorizo but not spicy) and then adjust the flavor with some good smokey paprika I brought back from the US. Like others, I usually add garlic because garlic, and grow herbs here so normally toss in some thyme and parsley or cilantro. But the base is what is important. And the base is easy, nutritious, inexpensive and relatively quick to make. Here it is called salchi-papas, for salchichas and papas. And to make pan cleanup really quick, just a few minutes before serving add a little water to the pan as it finishes cooking. The veggies will be perfectly soft and the food won't stick to the pan."

When the garlic has a nice roasted texture and the onions had caramelized, I put in the potatoes. I used small red and yellow potatoes with fine tender skin. I sliced and cooked the kielbasa separately. This lowers greasiness and makes timing the doneness easier. Add together, then add chunky sliced onions. Let cook for a few minutes then add peppers. Cook until peppers are just tender."

I placed them in the pan first, then the kielbasa on top. This dish turned out wonderful!! Very satisfying, and even better the next day for breakfast with a fried egg on top!"

I did add salt, pepper, and garlic. The garlic was great with this recipe. I used butter &amp; olive oil instead of just oil to help with cooking the veggies. I cooked the onions &amp; carrots first since carrots usually take awhile to cook. After 7-10 minutes, I added the garlic &amp; cooked for another minute. Then I added the zucchini &amp; kielbasa &amp; cooked for another 5 before adding the canned potatoes, which I did cut into quarters. I cooked all of that for another 20-25 minutes. I did stir it often, more than only every 10 minutes, based on others' comments that it stuck to the pan. Delicious! Will definitely make again."

"reviewBody": "Quick week night meal. Out of preference though I skipped the oil and let the kielbasa create the oil when frying. I let it get nicely browned &amp; then I added some onion &amp; garlic as others suggested. After the onion &amp; garlic fries for a few minutes I put in the diced red potatoes. Make sure you dice small and it doesn't need to cook as long. Finally added my red peppers &amp; had a veggie with it. Very filling. You don't need salt because the sausage has enough. I may try andouille sausage for a little more kick. Will make again."

Added mushrooms and yellow pepper to that skillet. Added kielbasa to the potatoes then the vegetable mixture. Put some vegetable broth in as well. Separated the kielbasa to get it browned nicely and then returned it to the dish. It was excellent! Will definitely make again."

"reviewBody": "I read many reviews and decided to use ideas from a couple of them. I boiled my kielbasa for about 20 minutes to help get rid of some of the fat. I cut the peppers, some onion and potatoes into pieces approximately the same size. I tossed them all in olive oil and seasoned them with Mrs. Dash original seasoning. I put the potatoes on a sheet pan 1st as suggested by one reviewer In the oven at 375 and then added the peppers and onions after about 10 minutes. I browned the kielbasa in a cast iron skillet and added it to the vegetables. Right before the vegetables were done I added some grape tomatoes that needed to be used. It was delicious. There was a small amount leftover which I heated in the microwave and put an over easy egg on top for my lunch today. That was very good too."

"reviewBody": "This is a great recipe that can be adjusted to suit your needs. I used a package of 5 Hillshire Farms cheddar sausages. I cut them up and fried them in a small amount of olive oil. Added them to a glass dish along with the peppers and potatoes. Added some Italian seasoning, garlic salt, salt and pepper. Baked in the oven until the potatoes and peppers were tender. The hubby had seconds and thirds. We love the recipe. It's a quick and satisfying meal. Thanks!"

They didn't get browned enough when sautéing everything at once. When they are almost done, I'll add the peppers to cook for a while and then I'll add the kielbasa and finish. I will also try adding some sliced onion next time."
