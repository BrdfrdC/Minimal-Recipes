This recipe might be palatable if you play with the measurements. I would add sugar or decrease the flour but it needs work."

I think Iâ€™d put more ginger, maybe even sugar (which I almost never want more of). I think if I ice it, itâ€™ll be better. As far as eating, itâ€™s not my favorite. I was hoping for more of a butter cookie texture, these were very solid, but not in a crispy sweet way. B/c of the texture, I think this may work GREAT for building."

"reviewBody": "I made the cookies exactly as per the recipe (exact American cup sizes) set the oven temp to 20c lower then in recipe as using a fan oven. They only need 10 minutes as 12 will make them harder. They are perfect to ice or leave as is. I did not cut back on any ingredients or make changes. They turn out soft and puffy, but keep their shape well. They remind me of the German gingerbread. I think for any body leaving a negative review it could be because you are not using the correct measures....With regards to the dough being crumbly you need to make sure you have a cool work surface, you need to work at a medium pace so the dough has time to adjust to room temperature (slightly) but not so much that it gets soft. The oven needs to be set to the correct temperature (adjust for fan assisted) and do not substitute as that is when things go wrong..."

Instead of icing them, I let the girls put crystal sugar sprinkles on them before baking. They are perfect and so delicious! Next time, and there will be a next time soon, I will roll out some a little thinner. I like a crispier cookie with my tea!"

Next year, I will keep the molasses where it should be and you should too to avoid cardboard comparisons."

"reviewBody": "I did as other reviewers stated and decreased the molasses to 3/4 c and doubled the cinnamon, omitted the cloves, and added a teaspoon of allspice. These were incredibly difficult to roll out unless warmed up a bit, and even then, not ideal. You have to be extremely gentle with it while rolling or it crumbles. They came out dry and tasteless and I was very careful while rolling out not to incorporate too much flour. Tried rolling out between wax paper sheets and that was worse, it stuck to the paper even when straight out of the fridge. I will return to my mother's recipe and probably not make these again. Lacking flavor and moisture."

"reviewBody": "If you want a cookie that isn't too strong then this is an okay recipe. I however, prefer more flavor and to me these were just bland - thats after I added twice as much cinammon and extra cloves. In my opinion the amount of ginger should probably be doubled. I also added a tablespoon of orange rind which is probably the only thing that saved them from being tossed... I also ended up covering them in a glaze with ginger sprinkled over the top in an attempt to get more flavor out of them. The recipe was easy to make though and the dough was very nice to work with, and didn't have much spread so your gingerbread men wont lose their shape! Ill still be finding a different recipe next time!"

The color was white when I took it out from the oven and not the typical darker gingerman colour."

Now I am making some icing to decorate them. It is 23:15 and they really better turn out great because I won't have time to make another batch.\n\n2:45am; I only kept the dough refrigerated for 1h30. They turned out really great. I made some royal icing and with or without the icing they taste great. Yeah!!! However 12 minutes is too long; I kind of overcooked the first batch. but the ones after were good."
