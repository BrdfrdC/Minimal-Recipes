Not bad but just unexpected. The tortillas soak up the sauce and become very soft and almost indistinguishable from pasta. Overall the flavours are good here but it’s not something we’d make more than once in a while."

I tweaked the recipe slighly No green bell peppers - sub'ed in poblano peppers, and sub'ed in tortilla chips rather than the raw tortillas. everyone raves over this chicken dish. It's tasty and filling, but don't be shy with the tortilla chips - some of my work crew members ate this like it was chicken dip. Its a fantastic recipe."

It was almost like a delightful Ice Cream..."

"reviewBody": "This is the closest to actual King Ranch chicken recipe that I've seen in a long time. I learned to make it in the 70's in south Texas from a native of the area. I don't know why she cuts the tortillas into quarters, just lay them in there whole. I won't go into all the finer points but sometimes celery is added, just not beans or corn. Beans are served on the side and just put them on there if you like when you eat it. If you just must, then ok, it's for you. Cheddar cheese, yes. For extra kick, that's what hot sauce is for. Each person makes their food as hot as they want, or leave it like it is. Rotel alone has a bit of heat it in for lightweights. If you want the actual thing, follow this recipe and you'll have it."

Skip the chicken broth, or at least reduce it to ¼ cup. This is the only recipe I've seen that uses it, and I took to heart all the complaints about the sauce being too soupy. But the taste is great! So my advice is to make it, just leave out the broth."

I knew something was a bit off with this recipe when my sauce mixture looked like throw up but i kept going. Then when it came time to layer there wasn’t really any binding agents on the first 3-4 layers so I was confused how it was supposed to hold together. I used quite a bit of cheese but it only held on the top half where the majority of tortillas were. It tastes okay, I would have added more cheese and tortillas personally but the sloppiness is the reason behind my rating. I never rate stuff but the recipe ruined my day tbh."

I made it close, used poblano pepper instead of bells. Added peas because that is how we always had it before. Did not add the broth, as that makes it soupy. Then after baking covered for 30 minutes, I added more cheese and nacho Doritos as my family doesn't like soggy tortillas. Uncover and cook for 5 more minutes, great. If you have left overs, it is fun to roll them tight in tortilla and fry them, then serve with cheese or salsa dips."

I feel like more detailed instructions could be beneficial like do I drain the Rotel? I say this because when the casserole was done and I started serving it, it had a lot of excess liquid in the pan . All the photos looked the same as my finished product until we started to scoop out of the dish.. Anyone else have this issue? Other than that it's a good dish."

"reviewBody": "I've seen King Ranch Recipes over the decades and have never tried one until today. I followed this one almost exactly except I added 8 oz. of fresh mushrooms and zucchini because I wanted to add more veggies to the casserole. Am glad I did because there was so much sauce that I had some leftover. The flavor was great but I thought it was way too saucy even with the added veggies (even though I didn't add all of the sauce). Hubby liked it and said he would eat it again and so would I with a few modifications. I would also add about 3-4 ounces sliced black olives and bake it for 55-65 minutes instead of 40 as the recipe states. It wasn't quite hot enough in the middle after 40 minutes. Otherwise, a simple meal that warms the insides on a cold day. Good flavors, too!"

I also suspect his tortillas are much thicker than the ones most of us buy in the grocery store. Flavor wasn't bad. But using two different kinds of special chili powders? Naw. Be sure to use a DEEP 9×13 pan. I might try this again, but I will make it simpler. Just mix chicken into the soupy mix &amp; I won't quarter my tortillas as well as use more tortillas. I will also add more red bell pepper."

I took my advanced flight training at NAS Kingsville surrounded by the King Ranch and learned a little history. Richard King acquired the land and established the ranch in 1853. He became a blockade-running sea captain in the Civil War and may be the model for Rhett Butler. He had no sons, only two daughters who married the Kleberg brothers, so the ranch has been owned and operated by Klebergs ever since. In hours flying over the ranch I saw cattle, an occasional horse, seldom any people, and even when going to the family compound on the ground didn't notice anything like a chicken house."

Now its a staple at our house especially when kids are over. Thanks for sharing."

Excellent flavor from those two spices! I totally botched the Assembly of this casserole because I was distracted. I started adding the chicken to the sauce but halfway into it realized I made a mistake. started trying to fish out the chicken from the sauce but gave up. Proceeded as directed. Still turned out awesome! I also forgot to add the sour cream but had a little on the side and it was nice! I would love to try this sometime with chorizo! I also want to say this would make an incredible Crock-Pot dip for a party just leave the tortillas out and use chips for dipping! Thank you Chef John and I wish you could tell me the proper proportions of the powders to make a taco seasoning!"

Made according to recipe but I did cut by 1/2 the 2 types of chile and still found it just a bit to hot for our individual preference. Also thought there was too much liquid in the dish. Next time, will probably omit the chipotle chile and just use 1 tsp of Ancho chile. Also will omit the chicken broth and I think this will resolve the watery consistency. We did enjoy this. If you are not feeding an ARMY, maybe cut the receipe in half. Thanks for the submission. Although I'm not from Tx (sorry), We did enjoy this."

We have a mushroom hater so used 2 cans of cream of chicken and it worked just fine. I used some sweet onion and red onion, and a little red bell pepper because I had them cut up. Substituted 1 poblano pepper and 1 seeded jalapeno pepper instead of green pepper. I used the RoTel Hot tomatoes, and fiesta blend cheese instead of cheddar. I used regular chile powder for the ancho because i didn't have any. Then i used about 4 cups of pulled rotisserie chicken that I sprinkled with a home made (low salt) taco seasoning. Broiling at the end, as Chef John suggests, gave the top layer of tortillas and cheese a little crisp texture for contrast. Delicious, I am sure it would also be great as written and will probably be even better tomorrow."
