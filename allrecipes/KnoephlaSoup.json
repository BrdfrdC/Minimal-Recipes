I halved the “butter” (I used plant-based), used plant-based milk, and used vegetable stock instead of chicken bouillon. I needed to add more flour to the dough (maybe 4-5 T?) but it wasn’t difficult to figure out. I will make this again! :)"

My mother made her version of \"potato soup\" when we were younger and none of us has the recipe. this is close enough that I was very pleased! so good although maybe a little heavy on black pepper for some. I'll definitely make again but may omit a bit of the black pepper to experiment a little. I want some right now!"

Followed the recipe to the T, and it was probably the best soup to ever come from my stove. It’s absolutely perfect. I even quadrupled the recipe to serve at my sister in laws restaurant, boy was that a job lol all those perfect little dumplings ?? \n\nI highly recommend this soup. Good for all ages and you’ll look like a rock star chef whippin this bad bear up this winter. Nice work."

"reviewBody": "When I originally read the recipe I saw that this used two separate pots, which seemed burdensome to me. I've always made my potatoes in the broth and added in the dumplings when the potatoes were almost done. Much easier than this way, but the cooking the potatoes separately in butter added a great new level to the broth. I will most likely use this technique again as the broth was fantastic. 5 star for sure. However, the dumplings were 3 star at best. They would have benefited from more egg. It makes them a little less dense. Also the dill was completely out of place. I'm not sure about the parsley because the dill was so strong. So I like this recipe, but the dumplings need help, which is ok. I also thought that there was too much pepper, and would likely cut that by close to half next time. The last thing is that the broth didn't thicken up, and it could stand a little thickener (corn starch &amp; water) towards the end of the cook time."
