Do let the meat and spices meld for a couple hours for best results. I’ve only made them with ground them and followed the recipe for all measurements. When trying to make it quick we just make them into balls and bake them. They turn out delicious that way too."

I didn't have time to make the paste so I just dumped the minced garlic and salt into the meat mixture and mashed it all together. Made a tahini and yogurt sauce to dress it with and made wraps with pita bread. I was also too much in a hurry - because rugby was coming on - to choo fresh parsley so I used dried parsley from the Indian market down the street. Nevertheless, this was absolutely delicious and I whipped the whole meal up in like 20 minutes... and ate almost the entire pound of ground beef mixture by myself in one sitting."

It is NOT nearly as spicy as what I have had in India but still the quality is good.

I am someone who loves cilantro but for the first time in my life I understood when people say they taste soap when they eat it (coriander is the seed of cilantro). If I didn't taste \"soap\" upon eating this I think I would have really enjoyed it. That's the only reason I didn't give it a higher star rating. Served it with saffron rice and a quick tomato cucumber salad."

I actually use the garam masala recipe from this app and adjust the amount to match the amount of spices listed here. I make a large quantity so this ends up being really easy to prep. I always make tzatziki and have hummus and pita or naan bread with this. Roasted tomatoes with feta cheese and oregano also make a great side with these"

So I use a blend of ground beef (as done by Indian street chefs) and chorizo (about a 2:1 blend). I also chop up some green bell pepper to go with the onions and add a teaspoon of clove powder for that slow heat. Finally, lacking easy access to a grill at my apartment, I cook these in my oven at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes and that works just great."

I cooked the skewers for 6 minutes each, 3 minutes per side, for a beautiful medium. I did use cubed lamb chop, instead of ground lamb because I prefer steak to ground meat. I simply put all of the seasonings into a bowl and coated the lamb with it. I did need to use a little bit of olive oil to make it all stick and give the lamb a nice crust of the seasonings. It was absolutely delicious!"

For cooking I place 4 of the kebab balls to one large metal skewer. Used ask many skewers as required based on how many servings I required.. This made rotating them during cooking very simple while being able to cook many in one sitting. While the ground beef turned out well the next two times I made them I used lamb and they were awesome. Everyone in the family loves them and will continue to make as per this recipe."

I don't have access to a grill, so I rolled them into 18 small meatballs. I placed them on a foil-lined sheet and baked @ 350 deg F for 25 min. (I had plans to broil a bit, but they browned up nicely just baking them.) I made a little of the garlic sauce mentioned by the top reviewer, and it was excellent with these! I get the gamey taste of lamb, so I'm going to try with beef, as others have mentioned, the next time. Great recipe - thanks!"
