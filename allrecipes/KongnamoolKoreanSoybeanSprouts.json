However, me and another foodie tasted it and we both agreed - \"Needs something\". . .I think the ratio of sesame oil to vinegar is off - way too much oil and too little rice vinegar. Even with the soy sauce in there, it may need some salt too, to taste. I was excited to use Korean red pepper flake for something other than my kimchi."

I started timing once the water came back to a boil and they came out perfect. I didn't have Korean chili powder so I used cayenne (a lot less than 2 Tbsp. ), a little less sesame oil, and I used finely chopped leeks instead of green onions cuz that's all I had. Came out fantastic. The longer it sat, the better the flavors melded. I've added this to my recipe box and will definitely make it again. I'm sure the dressing would go very well on other lightly blanched veggies too."

"reviewBody": "These soybean sprouts were delicious. The chili sauce/paste was a bit too smoky, but I didn't knock off any points to my rating bc I used regular chili poweder in lieu of Korean chili powder (as I didn't have the Korean type on hand). This might have made a difference on the smokiness. I balanced it out with the juice of 1 lime and a splash of rice vinegar. (I also followed previous posters' advice and lessend the amount of sesame oil. The paste/sauce was quite tasty when mixed in with the sprouts. The recipe as is was deserving of my 5star rating. However, I chose to add something crunchy: I sauteed raw top ramen noodles, slivered almonds and sesame seeds with butter on a skillet and then toasted them in the oven. I crumbled them up over the sprouts and it was just the right touch."

"reviewBody": "I always use a large bag of soybean sprout simply because it has a nicer texture and the added crunch from the soybean gives it a better taste overall. I boiled my sprouts in hot water for 1 minute, then drained in a colander. For the seasoning, I did not use the full 1/4 cup of sesame oil called for in the recipe. It is a tad bit too much sesame oil and a waste of oil. I was taught to just eye ball and season to taste. For the most part I usually start with maybe 2T, then mix and taste. I left out the rice wine vinegar. I also used two green onioin stalks, finely sliced, a little rock salt to taste, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds, which were toasted in a pan. I leave out the korean hot chili pepper for personal preference. (most of my family cannot handle the spiciness). However, you don't need to add a lot of the korean pepper as it will get stronger as it marinates. I make sure all the sauce coats the sprouts well before chilling. I let the sprouts sit in the refrigerater to marry for a few hours before eating, though you could eat it right away. The flavor is much better when you let it sit for a while. I serve this with, \"Kalbi(korean bbq ribs),\" and \"Korean-style Seaweed Soup,\" also on this website."

I am a huge sesame oil fan but if you are watching calories you can use an 1/8 cup instead of the 1/4 cup and it still has plenty of sesame flavor. I blanch the beans for a minute or two. I skip the vinegar. I don't care for it in this recipe as I do other Korean recipes. My husband is Korean and he thought this recipe was delicious! My Korean mother in law is an amazing cook and I like this recipe better than hers. Please don't tell."
