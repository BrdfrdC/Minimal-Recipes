I also added a few table spoons of honey to this as my family and I find that the extra sweetness balances the spice from the black pepper and garlic very nicely. We grilled these a 4-5 minutes on each side after getting them to room temperate and they were amazing. The slight charring from the BBQ adds that extra something that a slow cooker can't give. I don't think I'll ever use store bought Korean BBQ marinade again."

I added 1 1/2 cup of vegetable stock with 1 tablespoon or corn starch since I was serving with rice and wanted enough liquid. Other than the heat the taste was great. I will make it again with 1 teaspoon of black pepper."

I used rice vinegar instead of regular white vinegar and it definitely made a difference. Also, I used Demerara sugar instead of regular brown sugar and it definitely brought out more flavours. I didn't have a regular white onion but it didn't seem to make a difference. Next time, I will try adding in either Pepsi or Sprite instead of water and I'll add in some fresh ginger as well. But all in all, this recipe is a slam dunk and tastes just like the short ribs I get at my favourite Korean BBQ restaurant in Toronto. Thank you so very much for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "I had to use regular beef ribs instead of short ribs, because my supermarket was sold out. Because beef ribs can be tougher, I decided to throw these in the slow cooker for about 6 hours on high, and they turned out wonderfully tender. They just fell right off the bone. I added chili oil and ginger, and doubled the garlic, but these still turned out too sweet for our taste. I think next time I'll add more chili oil and decrease the sugar. I was concerned about it being overly salty after tasting the marinade, but the final product had the perfect level of salt. I can't wait to try this with actual short ribs, and broil them instead of slow cooking."

Kiwi is essential and the secret ingredient. traded out sesame oil with sesame seeds (to make less oily) and used rice vinegar and added couple tablespoons of mirin for more authentic flavor. Lastly add potato, carrot and shitake mushroom for ez one pot dish. Serve with rice and garnish with green onion. It's a ez party pleaser for sure!"

I've eaten my fair share of short ribs, as it's one of my favourite dishes especially the Korean BBQ kind. \n\nOne note, be careful how much onion you put in, they say half a large onion, but I found that to be too much (The large onions that are about the size of a orange). Half of the smaller sized ones is perfect!"

Also, we broiled the meat since we live in an apartment and don't have a grill. With some white rice and kimchi ordered in we enjoyed a wonderful meal! I will definitely be making this again."

The ribs marinated for about 5 hours. \nI baked the ribs on a shallow pan in foil at 275° for almost two hours. \nI put the remaining marinade in a saucepan adding 3/4 cup more brown sugar. Reduced in half cooking slowly with a constant stir. Added cornstarch and water to thicken a bit more. \nBarbecued the ribs basting with marinade glaze. They were so tender and moist, melted in your mouth."

"reviewBody": "Really enjoy the flavours of this. washed meat before hand after reading a review. Marinaded beef ribs for approx 30 hours. Used pineapple for the last hour to help break down the meat to tenderize it. Worked great. However I made enough ribs to try two different methods of cooking, I've done the grill before and it wasn't operational from the cold weather so I fried them in the frying pan and tried slow roasting in the oven. The oven method did not turn out well. I think they need to be cooked fast. The frying pan was great to cook them. Fresh out of the pan they have a lot of flavour."

I lived in Korea for two years and this recipe doesn't taste like the dish I ate when I lived there. I tried it in the crockpot, as one reviewer suggested, that was terrible and not very flavorful as the crockput ends up having too much water and the meat was tasteless. The second time, I broiled it thinking it would be better and didn't care for the taste of the meat that way either. I marinated it a long time and was very disappointed. I will not make this again."

I can't always get short ribs with the bone in so the boneless large pack at Costco works just fine. I add a bit of crushed pineapple or minced Kiwi to the marinade to tenderize the meat. My Korean gf gave me that suggestion and it works wonders."

I had more meat, so I doubled the marinade, excluding the garlic, onion, and sesame oil. I also added 2 ends of a green onion. I'm not a big sesame oil fan, thats why I didn't include the double amount. Regardless, great recipe. Will definately make again, but marinate longer."

Last night I just cooked it for 40 mins on 375 degrees but the ribs were still pretty fatty. I like them a little drier so I would cook them at 350 for maybe an hour on a rack (so they aren't sitting in a pool of grease) and then broil them for maybe 5 minutes. I think that would dry them out a little more and they would be a little crunchier. I also recommend keeping a little of the marinade separate from the beef and heating it up to serve with the rice with dinner. Just de-lish!"

I reduced the amount of black pepper and sesame oil by 1/2. \nAfter tasting the sauce mixture, I found it to be too salty and acidic for my liking, so an additional 2 tablespoons of brown sugar were added. It is also the middle of the winter, so bbq grilling was not an option. Instead of slow cooking it as others suggested, I then pan fried it to a medium-rare to get that browning on the edges. Also, instead of discarding marinade, I actually kept it and used it to cook with the meat as well. As the marinade cooked and reduced, it became a great gravy sauce to top the short ribs with.\nWhole thing came out very delicious. It's a keeper!"

So, we have them a couple times per month. An Okinawan lady told me to put an Asian pear in the blender with all other ingredients. (Asian pears are shaped more like an apple and have greenish yellow skin) The pear will tenderize the meat and it produces an unbelievable taste. I've also put pineapple juice and fresh pineapple in the marinade before too."
