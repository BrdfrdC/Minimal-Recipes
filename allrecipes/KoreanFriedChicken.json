"reviewBody": "Delicious! It was my first time making fried chicken (!) and other than having a little trouble controlling/regulating the oil temperature—I didn’t have a deep fryer, so I just used a Dutch oven, whose heat retention could have made it trickier to more quickly change the oil temperature—I would call it a success! The flavor was great. The coating worked like a charm and didn’t fall off at all. Husband and 4 kids aged 9-42 loved it. Since I wasn’t in a ketchupy mood, I didn’t end up using the Chef John’s Korean fried chicken Sauce recipe but another highly rated Korean Fried Chicken sauce recipe here from AR that uses gochujang instead. We weren’t crazy for that sauce, so some of us just ate the chicken sans sauce. Next time I will make the Chef John’s sauce to go with this."

The next time I make it I will not take the time to put shredded onion etc on as I did not see the difference from leaving it out. I will put some seasoning in and use the batter. The sauce was good. The very best chicken you can buy is broasted chicken. There are some in the USA and we have eaten at lots of these restaurants. It is a franchise and the first one that comes to mind is in Lake Havasu, City, AZ. “Scotty’s broasted chicken”."

"reviewBody": "Awesome crispy recipe! \nI followed this recipe as written using the suggested substitute for the self-rising flour I did not have on hand. \nThe only deviation I made was in using small pieces of sliced skinless chicken breast meat instead of quarter skinless thigh meat. This recipe doesn’t suggest any particular oil for frying, I used a combination of olive, coconut, and vegetable oil. I also used my cast iron dutch oven with about 2-3” of oil. \nThis chicken had great flavor and a wonderful crispy battered crust. I will make this again, for sure. \nSome tips I offer are: Use plenty of oil, make sure your oil is HOT. Don’t put more than 4-5 small pieces at a time into hot oil. Batter is runny, allow excess to drip off prior to setting in hot oil. Don’t worry if the crust is not brown after first fry...it will be a beautiful dark and crunchy after the second fry."

"reviewBody": "I’ve made this recipe so many times my family just says, “will you make that chicken?” The first few times I made it I had a lot of batter left. I now make about triple the recipe, keep the dry ingredients in a air tight container, the use about one cup, add ice water and that is plenty for a package of ‘wings’ about 14-16 pieces. I’ve made this recipe with boneless thighs as the recipe calls for, bone-in thighs, legs, and our favorite is the wing package. I bought a deep fat fryer just for this recipe. It was so worth buying. Enjoy! \nP.S. The sauce that goes with this is fabulous. Just be sure you really like HOT if you add 1 tsp. red pepper flakes. I use about 1/4 tsp and that is perfect for us and we like spicy and hot. Another Chef John winner all around. Thank you so much!"

Two step frying was a great trick to get supper crispy chicken, definitely in my top 2 fried chicken recipes. The sauce recipe that goes with it is very good but you might prefer some other dipping sauce to go with this. Using thighs made this a boneless chicken paradise"

"reviewBody": "I am a deep frying virgin! I tested this recipe, as I have a luxury vacation rental, and I am always on the look out for simple and delicious food for my staff to cook for guests. \n\nThe chicken was tender, crunchy, and delicious. I followed the directions exactly as stated, although I can't be sure of the timing on the frying. I didn't pay close enough attention to that! Didn't seem to matter, everything was cooked and still moist.\n\nI didn't make the sauce. I live in a small pueblo in Central America, so these ingredients weren't on hand. I ate mine with Sriracha sauce, and it gave a nice zing to the meat, plus it was super easy.\n\nI cooked 3 thighs, and one large breast (both sides). I had ~20 pieces after cutting to make everything a similar size.\n\nI grated the onion and the garlic. Next time, I'm going to try to Ninja them, as that would be easier. (My grater is a cheapy one, so it's not as sharp as it should be)\n\nI had lots of batter left. Next time, I would put half the dry ingredients in a baggy, and save them for the next batter.\n\nI wouldn't have minded the batter being a bit saltier, and even spicier. Next time, I might try putting cayenne in the batter\n\nThis batter looks like tempura to me, my chicken looked quite pale. Some pieces I fried a third time, and they were fine! Still moist. Again, without a thermometer, it's possible my oil wasn't as hot as it should be.\n\nI used my wok for frying and that worked out great."

We had it for supper tonight, paired with the Korean Fried Chicken Sauce [delish!!] and Korean cucumber salad [really helps to lower heat factor for those who find the sauce to be too peppery hot]; both recipes found on this site. I made double the recipe thinking there would be enough for lunches tomorrow but no such luck... The little bite sized pieces are truly addictive. I ate 4 pieces before sitting down to dinner. Think I'll make bigger, less 'snackable sized' pieces next time; though not sure that will help. Thank you Chef John!!"

I opened one of the wings with knife to check it. I sever ed it with the sauce that chef John described."

Fried in deep cast iron skillet with peanut oil. One large bl/sl chicken breast cut into 4ths and two thighs cut in half each. 3 to 4 mins. per side. Next time I will use remaining batter for onion rings, zucchini, etc. Almost tempura-like. Great recipe, Chef John! Thank you!"
