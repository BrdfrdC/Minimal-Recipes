I made this for my Korean wife and she raved about it. She actually said it was better than hers. If you know anything about Koreans, that's like a six star review. I'm familiar with the heat of gochujang so, I omitted the red pepper flakes (for my benefit). I tell you what, it was spicy enough for her and tame enough for me. I'd say on a heat scale from 1 -10 it's about a 6 without the red pepper flakes."

(Well I just remembered I left out the red pepper flakes for the kids and it was still plenty spicy for us!) It was DELICIOUS! I make a lot of Korean dishes, but I really liked how this one turned a very american cut of pork into a delicious Korean dish! Try it! You won't be disappointed! As far as some comment that it tasted to vinegary I totally disagree! I used straight rice vinegar (the the seasoned kind) and it was delicious."

(Use ice bath under the marinator.) \nI used pork loin and it came out juicy and tender. I garnished with fresh scallions. The flavors were very good, but I was expecting something bolder, or spicier. \nI will make this again but next time I will double the crushed red pepper, and add a touch of sesame oil."

The flavor is wonderful, but my face is about to melt off! I'm eating it now, and I had to take a break because I thought I would need medical attention if I continued. Maybe my paste is more potent? Definitely handle with care if you're sensitive to hot foods. I'm going back in for round two now ... wish me luck!"

"reviewBody": "I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I reduced the hot pepper paste to half of a 1/4 cup and red pepper to 1 tablespoon, and I added 1/4 cup of Spicy Korean Cake sauce. I didn't have green onion, and I used ginger powder instead of fresh ginger. I also used pork chop meat instead of pork loin. I didn't have rice wine vinegar so I used rice vinegar instead. I didn't think the vinegar taste was strong but the ginger; it is possibly because I never really like the ginger taste. I suspect that many reviewers used apple cinder vinegar instead or rice vinegar since ACV has a stronger vinegar taste than rice vinegar. Hot pepper paste is really HOT, and whether the recipe calls for too many hot pepper paste is really a matter of personal taste. To sum up, the favor is good, and I will definitely make it again."

I only added one tablespoon of crushed red pepper and it was plenty spicy (and I love spicy), and I used one tablespoon of crushed ginger paste in lieu of the fresh ginger root. The Korean hot pepper paste definitely gives it the flavor typical of restaurant style bulgogi. Overall, very tasty, this would be great with chicken or beef as well. Nice flavor."

It was good, but too hot. the gochujang chili sauce had a better balanced flavor and was obviously more authentic. Also, the meat marinated better. We had it with short grain white rice and some of it with boston lettuce leaves. Try this recipe today!"

You must also add some sesame oil to the marinade for an authentic flavor.\nVinegar is not really a traditional Korean ingredient. Most people who live in a built up area can find Gochu Jang which is Korean hot bean paste. Substitute that for the vinegar."

"reviewBody": "Amazing! I did some stuff differently, some not on purpose though. I halved the chili paste and red pepper flakes. I didn't think I would be able to handle it full on. I also ran out of white sugar so I used brown. Then I added a few drops of sesame oil. These were small changes and it tasted amazing. It wasn't too hot either. My husband loved it. Usually he has a complaint about everything. He said this was great. Thank you very much!"

"reviewBody": "This is my husbandâ€™s favorite when we dine at a Korean restaurant. Overall, the recipe is close to what weâ€™ve had, but a bit sweet for our taste, so I would cut down the sugar to 1.5 Tbsp. next time. We made two meals out of this; the first night we had the pork over rice, with Korean kimchi and stir-fried veggies on the side. The next day, we made tortilla wraps with the left-over pork, with dollop of sour cream, sliced avocado, and shredded lettuce â€“ wow, it was da bomb! By the way, Kochuchang (Korean hot pepper paste) can be found in any Asian grocery store, usually in the same refrigerated section as miso (soybean paste) and such. Thank you funinthesun for a great recipe!"

My SO and I love spicy foods. I didn't have hot pepper paste and substituted Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce and would bet the outcome was as good or better. Thanks for sharing this one. Can't wait to serve it."

I couldn't find the pepper paste in any store, so I substituted with a Vietnamese chili paste and that was WAY too spicy, the heat overpowered the taste; next time I'll have to find the real stuff for this recipe. This is awesome when served with lettuce leaf and rice.\n*when we have had this at restaurants it is served with a paste-like condiment- do you know what that is and how to make it?\nThanks for delicious authentic Korean Recipes!"

It was PHENOMENAL. A very tasty dish. Preparing it without the red pepper flakes will take some of the heat out for those who are not into spicy foods. I found that without the red pepper flakes, the heat was just right for my taste."
