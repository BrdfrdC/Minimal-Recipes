My only advice is to watch the time in the oven. I used a meat thermometer to 135 degrees F. It was done 1.5 hour before I thought it would be. I am not sure if it is our oven or location, but since it was just our family it was fine. perfectly done they way we like it, medium rare still pink inside. Hope this helps. Enjoy."

"reviewBody": "I reviewed this roast and gave it 5 stars and I still do. At that time I hadn't read many of the other reviews and I want to add to the comments of others. Purchasing meat today is not necessarily getting what you pay for. You cannot make a USDA Select piece of meat into a USDA Choice+ quality roast. If you know your butcher it will help a lot. Knowing what a good quality piece of meat looks like is of high importance. My grandmother said, \"If you don't know your meat, you better know your butcher.\" Second, do NOT use table salt! Large crystal salt (like rock salt) or kosher or sea salt are what to use. Don't skimp on the salt! Further, if I'm cooking a large roast (5 lbs or more) I take it out of the refrigerator 2 hours before putting it into the oven. Next, know your oven! Some ovens are off by more than 50 degrees! Not only should you have a meat thermometer, you should also have an oven thermometer and you should be able to read both without opening the oven door. Watch your meat thermometer! It will look like nothing is happening and then start to rise. When that happens, it will go up pretty quickly. Let it rest for 30 - 45 minutes before carving. Don't get anxious. This is a great method for prime rib. I have never had salt encrusting fail. Hope these help."

Then put it in your fridge for up to a few days before cooking. It concentrates the flavor so much and really makes it pop!"

Ladies and gents, that is NOT the recipe's fault, it is the cook's fault. Always make sure the meat is rolled and tied securely (if you have a boneless type) and ALWAYS, ALWAYS be sure to REMOVE ALL OF THE SALT before untying or carving the meat!!!\n\nIf you follow the directions of this recipe E-X-A-C-T-L-Y and remove all of the salt before untying or carving the prime rib, you will have a flawless result every time."

The crust which will indeed break off easily once the roast has cooked and cooled down. If you fail to add enough salt to form the crust, you will end up with salt saturated meat. One minor change I made was to slather the meat with olive oil and chopped garlic prior to salting. Excellent taste!"

The meat was tender and juicy and only the end piece was \"to salty\" ( I did not get all of the salt off the posterior end area prior to carving ). I did follow the recommendation to moisten the meat with water to get the salt to stick to the edges and sides, this worked really well to create a \" total encrusting .\" My rationale for giving this 3 stars vs. 4 is that by using the salt encrusted method you do not end up with usable drippings for au jus. I made au jus from beef broth using another recipe and it was not bad, however, I do like using drippings for sauces and graveys."

Also, like some others, if you want rare/medium rare, then you only cook 115 to 120. it will rise another 10 degrees as it sits. if you want medium to we'll then cook longer, but that's kind of a waste for such a great cut of meat. There is another recipe on this site that is reverse seared prime rib. It's the best way and I tried a few. you will love it"

Whether you sear it first, rub mustard on it, or add whatever you want to the rub mix, the low and slow cooking method on top of a bed of kosher salt leaves you with an extremely tender and flavorful roast. \nIn fact, at one party where I cooked this meal a couple met and later went on to get married. Was it the roast or love at first sight? Who knows, but at their wedding reception they served Prime Rib :)"

Since I was short on time I cooked it at 350 for 20 mins then decreased the temp to 270 for 3 hours until the meat thermometer hit 130. I removed it and let it rest for 30mins before cracking the crust off and slicing. It was a perfect med rare. Key element is to use all the salt the recipe asks for (I added water to the salt to make a paste so it would stick better) and follow the meat thermometer! the prime rib was soo juicy that the au jus I made on the side wasn't really needed. I won't look at any other recipe besides this. It was a success for my first time making prime rib!"

"reviewBody": "For the minority of people who didn't like the recipe I can only guess that the salt wasn't applied correctly, a meat thermometer wasn't used or possibly just a bad piece of meat to start with. \n\nFor the meat thermometer, invest in one that I digital with a probe the inserts into the meat and a small heat-proof cable that goes to the digital part and allows you to monitor the thermometer without opening the oven door during the roasting process. Mine was around $25 and is well worth it. Ignore the clock an pay attention to temperature. \n\nSecond, there seems to be such an issue and debate with the salt and maybe this will help. Just remember back to when you were a kid and you would go to the beach. Remember how the soft, wet sand felt? Remember the consistency that made the best sand castles? That's what you're aiming for here - get the consistency of your salt to the consistency of wet sand and then 'entomb' your meat in the wet salt. I can hear it in the reviews - people are trying to rub it in or sprinkle it on and it's not working, the roast is coming out salty and that is why. Hope that helps! :-)"

Did a 5.5 lb oven-prepared prime rib roast for Oscar night, seasoned the roast all over with pepper and a package of Lipton onion soup mix,then pasted on a mixture of coarse kosher salt, Montreal steak seasoning and water. I roasted at 425 for 20 minutes, and then at 215 until the temperature reached 140. I let it sit for 15 minutes, cracked/scraped off the crust, and it was perfectly medium, tasty and juicy!"

And yes, like the other reviewer said, it does look like a snowball when you are done! And yes, even though the recipe doesn't specify, you DO coat the cut ends with butter and your seasonings if you choose and then the kosher salt. I brought the roast to room temp before I through it in the oven. It was a five pound roast and at 215 degrees F it reached 130 degrees F in 2.75 hours with browning at 425 degrees F for the first 15 min."

"reviewBody": "I have been making this recipe for Christmas for the past four years...everyone raves about the meat. The salt layer under slow heat does form a crust that is easy to remove. One thing I have noted is that small end of standing rib roasts (while oh so great quality beef!) lack fat at the top of the roast or some butchers cut it down. I get a quality large end roast with a SMALL TO MODERATE (can't see the pink of beef shining through) amount of fat layer on the top and find it helps to keep the meat from becoming salty. The fat heats to form the crust layer with the salt. It and the fat peel back to reveal the most juiciest rib roast ever. Hope this helps. Making it again tomorrow....enjoy!"

IT MUST REST REST!!!! the salt will lift off like a helmet and you will not taste it. if you want gravy, make with bouillon, the drippings are not good for gravy. i have made this recipe several times, it is by far the best."

There is no danger of over-salting because the crust comes off after cooking and the meat is amazingly tender and flavourful underneath.

"reviewBody": "The roast turned out great, but I made a couple of improvements.\n\nI marinated the prime rib with olive oil and rosemary for two days prior to cooking.\n\nInstead of black pepper, I used a dry rub of ground green and pink peppercorns and ground coriander seed. Just put all the dry ingredients into a coffee grinder. I also coated with a little bit of a vegetable-based garlic spread. That's easier than trying to make garlic cloves stick to the meat.\n\nWhen done, I served with a basic gravy made from a dark roux (margarine &amp; flour fried at high heat), beef broth, au jus concentrate, red wine, and juices from the roast. Everybody commented on how well the gravy turned out, despite the fact that I didn't have any beef drippings."

Let sit covered with a towel loosely in the microwave for about an hour and the temp when cut was perfect. My first attempt so will go with a larger cut with more people now I have the confidence! Used a dry mix Au Jus sauce because you cannot make one from the drippings. Get a good horse radish sauce as well."

I did add water to the salt and for fear of it being to salty(yeh i know I read ALL the reviews and yes it is not salty!) I took cheese cloth and wrapped it twice around the middle, this protected the end pieces, to get the salt to stick on the cheesecloth i put olive oil on it and the salt stuck perfectly! The top and the bottom did not have any cheesecloth and the salt made a perfect crust. When I removed it 125 let it sit 20 minutes, removed the salt crust and popped back in the oven at 350 for 10- 15 minutes, I prefer my prime rib warmer, It was cooked perfectly, everyone RAVED! took it out at 135 degrees medium rare perfection. When cooking prime rib YOU MUST USE A THERMOMETER!! period! it was tender juicy and had a wonderful flavor. I sprinkled garlic powder all over it before I put on the crust, for those disappointed on no ajus, just buy \"Johnny's Au Jus\" located somewhere around the BBQ sauces and ketchup in your local store, it is concentrated and is way better than Au Jus I can make and is 100 times better than the pkg mix!! Problem solved! Enjoy and try this don't be scared it is wonderful!!!"
