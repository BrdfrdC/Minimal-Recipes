I didn't have shredded cheddar, so I used a pizza blend cheese (mozzarella &amp; cheddar). I also added a little garlic powder on top of the casserole for the last 5 minutes of cooking, because I love garlic. So yummy!"

I had the Kraft Deluxe Macaroni and Cheese product with the squeezable cheese packet. I only used 1/2 cup of milk instead of 3/4 cup. The casserole was excellent."
