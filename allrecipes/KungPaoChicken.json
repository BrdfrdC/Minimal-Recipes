"reviewBody": "This was fantastic. Like other reviewers said, I doubled all the ingredients except the Chicken. I had a little over a pound of chicken for the 2 of us and it was great so Jeff had leftovers for his lunch. I didn't have enough peanuts so I used 1/2 almonds. Jeff wished I used cashews. I also didn't have water chestnuts so I used some snap peas and red peppers. But I added those veggies at the VERY end so they didn't get soggy. Next time I will use rice vinegar for more flavor. I didn't know how much an ounce of chili paste was so i used 2 big tablespoons of it. I cooked it in a cast iron pan which stuck at first but then I added more clean crafted wine and water too. So delicious!"

I did find it was too much cornstarch because I continually needed to keep adding water as I heated it. I did swap out white wine for Shaosing Rice cooking Wine but that is just preference. I Wok fried my chicken first (then removed), then some white onions and two zucchini, skipped the chestnuts. Added it back together and then added sauce. Very versatile sauce that is a great starting point for your chicken and choice of vegetables. I suggest tasting it as you go, try to find the perfect sweet, sour and spice for your taste buds."

I used combination of dark and light soy sauce, and shaoxing cooking wine instead of white wine just because I had a big bottle of it from another recipe I tried. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I didn’t know what chili paste the recipe was referring to, so I used half a teaspoon of the fried chili in oil I had and the dried red whole chilies for aroma. I had my friend who is a foodie when it comes to Asian cuisine, and she agreed it tasted like the takeout minus and guilt of consuming too much sodium."

All easily found in the asian aisle and absolutely adds to the authenticity. Low sodium/lite soy also recommended so salt isn't overpowering. Apart from those minor suggestions prepare per recipe. They will be fighting for leftovers !!"

"reviewBody": "As written, this is a good Kung Pao. To make it 5 stars, I use the sauce (minus the cornstarch) as marinade and \"soak\" for 24 hours, giving it a good shake every once in a while. You can still use the sauce (make sure to add the cornstarch here), just make sure during the heating process, you reach a boiling point and you will probably want to boil for 5 minutes (keep stirring so it doesn't burn). Or, you can make new sauce. I have used the marinade as the sauce several times with no problem."

Broccoli, a shredded carrot, and mushrooms can be cooked separately as a side dish or added to the sauce toward the end of the cooking time. It is delicious and is incredibly close in flavor to the one that we get at one of our favorite local Chinese restaurants!"

"reviewBody": "Having cooked for over 50 years and not having eaten it yet, I would say this is a tasty recipe. There are actually 4 T. of liquids in the sauce, counting the oil. Later on, you can see that at least another quarter cup of water was added, so the result is not dry. It's a total of a half-cup of liquid. If the chicken itself turns out dry, you've over-cooked it. Chicken in small pieces takes only a few minutes to cook."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was a big hit with my teenage daughter! I made it as only one serving for just her. I used 1 boneless skinless chicken breast (about 1/2 lb). I made the sauce and marinade with same proportions as the recipe calls for except I completely left out the chile paste (instead a minute sprinkling of red pepper flakes) and left out the water chestnuts. I substituted cashews &amp; probably only used 2.5 - 3 oz. rather than the 4 oz that the recipe calls for. I marinated the chicken for probably close to 90 minutes. Served with jasmine rice and sautéed green beans. A GREAT meal! The amount of marinade and sauce that the recipe calls for was perfect for the 1/2 lb. of chicken."

I did make a few changes, I used carrots in place of water chestnuts which gave it a crunchy sweet taste to off set the spice. I used 1 tsp of corn starch in the marinade and 2 tsp in the sauce. I also used more garlic, about 4-5 tablespoons all together. We will be having this again!"

I bought a can of water chestnuts but forgot to add them. Didn't miss them though. \n\nThe change I did was to sous vide the chicken chunks in the marinade. 149 degrees for 90 minutes. The chicken was sooo tender and able to cut it with a fork! I used the marinade from the sous vide bag and added brown sugar and vinegar to it in a separate skillet with the onion, garlic, and peanuts. The two sauces tasted pretty much the same but the one from the sous vide had a light brown color while the other one was dark reddish. I 4x the sauce ingredients and didn't need the extra sous vide sauce."

It was by far the best kung pao I've had since moving back to Idaho (my efforts to find good Chinese here is dismal). At first I thought more chili paste, but it had a decent hot kick to it. Maybe it was the reduced sodium soy sauce or maybe next time I will try more brown sugar (my daughter thought it lacked a slight sweetness). Either way there will be another try at this recipe. Thanks!"

I only used chicken because my kids are picky- may need even more sauce if there’s veggies in there."
