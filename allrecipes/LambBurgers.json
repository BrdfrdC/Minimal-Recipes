I've tried other lamb recipes with the cumin/cinnamon flavors which are good, but I liked the simplicity of this. I halved the recipe and baked on parchment paper in a 325F oven for 40 min. The patties do shrink. I did not make this into a sandwich. just had it with mint jelly, which I usually do, and also made a tzatziki sauce from this site. Will make again! Thanks for the recipe."

My lamb patties were pre-made but I seasoned them with Italian seasoning (rosemary, thyme, oregano, etc), Gaelic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. I used Roman tomatoes abs fresh spinach. The Mayo I used to make the sauce had olive oil and avocado in it. I mixed that with Dijon mustard and a little miracle whip. I also added steak sauce and ketchup. Cooked to perfection"

I had fresh thyme and fresh rosemary so I skipped usedry herbs.NOTE: If your ground lamb is good quality mixing in ground beef misses the point of eating lamb.\nI followed the recipe but added one tsp of dry sherry plus one tsp of white wine vinegar. Moist,juicy and delicious.\nI put these on a brioche bun with garlic butter spread on the bun then I toasted the bun on the charcoal grill above the grilling burgers. Let them set for about five minutes then built the burger with a slice of tomato,feta,dijon-mayo and field greens. WOW"
