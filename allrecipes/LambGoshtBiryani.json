I made as written and it didn't look like anything in the picture. while it had several spices listed, it didn't have that aromatic smell or taste like Indian restaurants I've visited. I really felt it needed some cumin in it, maybe some coriander, turmeric, garam masala, and/or nutmeg. Maybe anise star? I love spices and for a dish that is so flavorful and intense, this really lacked what I was looking for. Thanks for the recipe anyways."

I added only 2 chili peppers and I regret it! It came out so spicy. It's still edible but definitely make note of that. Other than that it is a great recipe!!"

Cant wait to make again.\nModification- Step 6: Instead of oil use Ghee(clarified Indian butter). When the onion start turning brown add a handful golden raisins followed by some raw cashews (Do not use the salted or seasoned kind like Planters-- you can get the raw cashews at the Indian stores, they are like $4.99 for quarter pound)."
