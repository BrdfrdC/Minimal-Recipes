Browning the meat isn't necessary. Served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it."

I am Arab and usually find that most middle eastern recipes on the internet are watered down and flavourless versions of what it’s supposed to taste like. NOT THIS. \nI didn’t have time to take all the steps of sautéing everything separately, so I put all the ingredients, EVERYTHING, including vegetables, into a big bowl, added my lamb, and mixed it well. I also added potatoes that I washed, peeled and cut in half. I then spread it in an oven pan. Sealed it with foil and the pans’ lid and pushed it into the oven. I baked it at 375 for 3 hours. Just perfection. Falling off the bone. I will be holding onto this recipe forever."

BUT, first of all it was way to sweet, and was such a mish-mash of too many spices that the taste and smell was over-powering. Eating it was not a pleasant experience to me at all. I could try again and adjust by reducing cinnamon, omitting honey, and adding fewer spices. However, not knowing whether these adjustments will make it taste any better, I will give up on this one and find another version. Very disapointed."

I followed most of Oranaise’s review recommendations, including skipping the meat browning step, using beef broth instead of chicken, and adding caraway and allspice. I thickened with the optional cornstarch, as described. I served with plain orzo instead of the heavily flavored Moroccan couscous recommended, and that was the perfect accompaniment. I also served the cucumber/Greek yogurt salad, but I wouldn’t make that again. This is definitely a great way to fix leg of lamb!"

"reviewBody": "I consider this recipe a great starting point, and that's what I want from a recipe: shove me in the right direction and then I'll let my intuition take over.\n\nI adopted some of the suggestions from the review by Oranaise, using caraway and allspice. Also her suggestion to eliminate saffron was right on. After reading the list of spices, my own thought was, \"Saffron will be lost in here.\"\n\nI made a few more changes: I used sumac instead of fresh ginger and added chopped up dried apricots. Those two things seem to be touchstones of Moroccan cuisine for me. I mounded the cayenne. I like it even hotter than that, but that was me holding back for my foodie guests and it was just right for their taste.\n\nSome reviews complain about grease. With lamb, it's particularly important to trim fat. Unlike most proteins, lamb fat lends a dish an off-putting, gamey taste. In my opinion, too much fat is the reason most people who dislike lamb, dislike lamb.\n\nI would definitely make this again, with one further change: that's a lot of carrot and if you add it at the beginning of the cook, it ends up much too soft for my taste.\n\nAs for flavor, this recipe has it. And the smell is wonderful."

Everybody loved it! It was amazing! Will definitely be making this again, but will probably double-up on it so we can have a repeat the next night! Next time I make it, though, I will not put the saffron in the marinade - another reviewer (Oranaise) is right about two things: 1) you don't use chicken broth with lamb. Use beef broth instead. and 2) Saffron is too expensive of a spice to waste on a marinade. Instead, prepare it the correct way ahead of time and add it to the mix, when it's time to simmer for 2 hours. I will, also, add in the other 2 spices Oranaise recommends (1/2 tsp caraway and 1/2 tsp allspice)."

If I make it again, which I am likely to do, I will put the carrots in (I also added parsnips and cauliflower) in the last half hour or so."

I would also recommend adding salt to this dish, as it enhances the flavors tremendously. \nI wanted to make it a one pot meal, so I added some eggplant and a little potato along with the carrots and onions, and it worked excellently. I didn't have sundried tomato paste, so I had to do without. I'm not sure how much of a difference it would have made, but we loved it without! I'll try it again when I find some - should be even more complex."

I used wild goose instead of lamb as to me lamb is similar to venison and I thought goose would match the spices. I marinated overnight and the next afternoon when I started to cook the goose, there was almost a need to wear a bib! I was salivating very strongly due to the delicous aroma coming from the dutch oven. Best of all, the flavour lived up to the smells. I will definitely be making this again with venison, elk, and chicken. Very nice with served up with millet."

"reviewBody": "Wow- this is even better than the fancy Moroccan place in town! \n\nI marinated my lamb in the spices overnight (minus the saffron) and added all the ingredients (with sautéed onions, garlic and ginger) to my crock pot the next morning. After work I tasted it and found it needed a little something, so I added about 5 saffron threads, which really brought out the complexity of the spices and blended well with the honey notes. I doubled the cayenne and added harissa to taste after it was done cooking since we like it hot!\n\n*Just a side note that preserved lemons are pricey ($6 each at my specialty shop) and harissa isn't cheap either. You could accomplish the same approximate flavor by going to an Indian grocery and purchasing citrus pickle, or \"achar.\" Save yourself some money by going that route if you can."

The main ingredients in curry powder are: tumeric, coriander, black pepper, garlic, fennel and cumin. Since it has most of the spices listed in this recipe I figured it was worth a shot (besides, I have a LOT of it. Lol!) The end result DOES NOT taste like curry AT ALL! It's just this, honest to goodness, I'm in heaven, no you can't have mine taste! It's waaaay better than traditional American beef stew!\n\nWord to the wise, ALWAYS double this recipe.

I needed dinner faster than that. :( Anyway...the meat only marinated an hour and the simmering was only for 30 minutes, but it was still delicious. I ended up using chicken and lamb together, chicken broth and omitted several spices like cloves, coriander, and cardamom (b/c I didn't have them). My husband and I enjoyed the flavor and my toddler gobbled up the meat served with rice. This recipe is a keeper even if you're not good at planning ahead."

To make the rice, I put some jasmine rice I had into the rice cooker and added some cinnamon and raisins to the water. Yummy! It is a little greasy and it is basically lamb stew but the spices add a delicious twist. Next time, I'd like to eliminate the oil and add more cornstarch for a thicker stew."

If you happen to have a stove-ready clay tagine pot, it was made for this.\n\n **A note about saffron... others have said it isn't really a marinade ingredient. This is true, but if like me you love saffron and have handfuls of the stuff you bought at a spice market, by all means, throw in a large pinch and then throw in some more while the lamb simmers. Its unique flavor is irreplaceable.**\n\nI used a little smoked paprika (1/4 tsp max), ground up a little caraway seed and added a dash of allspice. In place of the tomato paste I used finely chopped oil-cured sund-dried tomatoes. I skipped the carrots but added a can of rinsed and drained garbanzo beans near the end with a half pound of dried apricots and a couple of TBL chopped preserved lemon peel in place of the lemon zest. I even tossed in a few wedges of an old-ish tomato I had laying around. Once you have the lamb tender enough, you can really play around with the rest of the recipe.\n\nIt was served with couscous topped with toasted slivered almonds, steamed zucchini matchsticks on the side and I raked in the kudos...."

I enjoyed how well the seasoning blend together and the flavor of lamb. \"Ras El Hanout\" seasoning can also be used in place of most spices. I usually bake my lamb everytime I prepare it, however; I decided to try a new method for cooking lamb and this is a great recipe!! A good combination of food to have with lamb are rice and cabbage. The recipe mentioned 1 1/2 to 2hrs, but it only took my lamb about 40-45 minutes to simmer. I used lamb steak, therefore; it did not take as long."

"reviewBody": "I am blessed with having experienced North African cooking at it's best -- in the everyday households around Morocco. This recipe produced the best tagine I've had outside of Morocco and definitely my best personal effort. I followed \"lumiere's\" review -- don't brown the meat as that is never done in traditional North African cooking! I haven't made preserved lemons yet, but instead I added juice of half a lemon at the very end -- added it to the broth and stirred gently. A Moroccan tradition (and possibly Algerian and Tunisian?) is to use 7 vegetables: alway onion and the 6 of the following: carrots, parnips, potato, turnip, zucchini, yellow squash, pumpkin or other squash, tomato, green beans -- you get the idea, whatever is fresh and in season. I also substituted chicken for the lamb. I love lamb, but chicken is easier to find than good lamb, which requires a trip to the local halal meat market. I am not a fan of turnips, but just one small turnip will add a rich flavor and if I end up eating it thinking it's a potato -- well, the sauce is enough to mask the strong taste for the most part. :) As they say in Morocco -- b'sahatik! To your health!"
