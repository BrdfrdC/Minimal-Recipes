Sprinkle with half of the other ingredients. Repeat layer. Cover with damp cloth. Leave on counter overnight.\n\nIn the morning, bake at 350o for 30-40 minutes or until lightly golden brown on top. Invert on a serving plate. Let stand 3 minutes. Remove bundt pan. Enjoy!"

I have assembled it in advance and before leaving it to rise I cover it with foil and freeze it and then just bring it out before I go to bead and it is perfect in the morning. I have also forgotten the cinnamon and it is still wonderful. The is a fave in our family and I have given it out many times. I agree there may be too much sugar but I don't worry about it."

They were both a huge hit, so thank you!"

Then as it cooled it deflated. I layered sugar and butter on bottom, middle and top - so I'm not sure how I could do it different next time? Obviously I'll need to let it rise less. It was 12 hours by the time we got it in the oven. Hmmm, I really want to get this to work."

If you sprinkle 1/3 of the sugar mixture in before the dough goes in, then only add 1/2 the dough, then 1/3 more of the mixture, then the remaining dough and remaining sugar, that would eliminate a problem that I ran into - a lot of the sugar and raisins ended up clumped together at the bottom after you turn it out onto a serving plate rather than evenly spread throughout the dish. It was still delicious though, and so easy!"

The last time I tried in a 9x13 pan, and it worked perfectly. Rich, buttery and divine. This one's a keeper!"

I mixed the brown sugar mixture well and put one row of rolls on the bottom of the pan then the mixture then another row of rolls. I also used the icing recipe from another reviewer and they were spectacular. This recipe also works by separating the rolls into two cake pans."

I panicked because I didn't have a bunt pan (thought I did, must have wandered off somewhere...) so I made it in a shallow, glass casserole dish. Only problem was that it rose so much that the buns stuck to the damp towel. I would use a deeper dish next time.\nI omited the raisins because I don't like them and drizzled my own cream cheese icing over them when they were warm - mmmm, mmm good!"

Roll them in the dry cook and serve pudding.(sprinkle remaining dry pudding over the top of rolls). I melt 1/2 C. butter and 1/2 C brown sugar in the microwave to make a syrup and pour that over the top. This recipe is fabulous, thank you for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "Yummy! However, I'm not sure why some thought these were too sweet. I didn't use raisins so that might be partly why I didn't get that overwhelmingly sweet taste. I cut down on the sugar and added more butter but wished I had more of the topping so next time I will add all the sugar and add a little more butter. The good thing about the topping is that it runs off when you turn the buns out of the pan, then you can just pour as much of that mixture as you like back onto the buns. I did use the icing recipe from the \"Clone of a Cinnabon\" recipe from this site. For that I would add a little more milk so that it doesn't get stiff like cake icing. Then I was trying to get the same taste as the Caramel Pecanbon from Cinnabon, so after I put the white icing on, I drizzled a little caramel over that and topped with pecans. It was too good to be so easy! This would make a great addition to a brunch menu. However, I'll probably cut the recipe in half when I make it just for my family as it made quite a bit."

I would definitely recommend adding about 2/3 cup brown sugar instead of 1 cup so they aren't overpoweringly sweet! I would even suggest trying a powdered sugar frosting in place of the pudding mix. Anyways, with a few corrections, I think they would be great. They are very easy though and they would be fun to make with kids. I do give 5 stars for the name of the cinnamon buns!"

In the future, I will use 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. white sugar (to decrease the crunchy/hardness factor). I will put 1/2 a stick of melted butter on it the night before and add the remaining 1/2 stick that morning."

Rhodes frozen dinner rolls were fantastic in my recipe - a welcome break from canned biscuit dough. I used the quick thaw method &amp; proofed the entire bundt after layering in the oven. (To do this, preheat to 200 degrees, microwave dough balls for 30 seconds each side; layer recipe as directed; put dough in and turn the oven OFF; wait a couple of hours; bake as directed.) I love the sprinkling &amp; layering - so easy! Who knew??? I did use more butter. This one will be a staple at our house!"
