I did dip them in chocolate, but the only thing was that the actual cookie part was a little lacking in flavor. I would suggest to others to add a bit more vanilla or something when you make them. But, overall, a great recipe!"

My chocolate chips started to cool before I got all the cookies dipped and then the cookie would break when I tried to pull it out f the chocolate. I would suggest adding something like butter to the chocolate chips to thin it out."
