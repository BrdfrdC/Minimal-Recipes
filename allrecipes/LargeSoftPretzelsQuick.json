"reviewBody": "I made these pretzels today for a German Assignment. The first time, it was really hard to roll out as it kept sticking to the board. To help it not stick, I sprinkled flour on the board and then rolled it out. It helped so much more. When it was done, my pretzels had puffed up so much, they looked like bread. \n\nI tried a second time and made it smaller. This time, it looked like a pretzel. \n\nThe taste for these pretzels however is debatable. It doesn’t taste like a pretzel. It tastes like bread shaped into pretzels. Damper to be exact. So I tried adding some milk, some egg and some more sugar to add taste. If you want, add some salt too!\n\nI gave some out to my friends and they tried it with ham and cheese! It was so good! So maybe it doesn’t taste exactly like a pretzel, but serve it with some stuff, it will be a good snack.\n\nThis was great!"

"reviewBody": "If I were to correlate the time and simplicity along with this review, I'd give it 5 stars. I do proffer this recipe 4 stars though because this was more like a dinner roll bread feel then an actual pretzel. I did find that if I allowed the dough to ferment a little longer, then the pretzels came out more, well, pretzel like. I also added an egg with the dough when mixing it along with the egg spread on-top of the mixture. This recipe is great served with mustard, brown helps."

"reviewBody": "I really like this recipe, but it's not fair to call it a pretzel recipe. these are really just bread or rolls shaped like pretzels. That being said, these are great dinner rolls! the first time I made this recipe I followed it exactly, except I ran out of white flour and used about 2.5 cups of whole wheat flour with 1.5 cups white flour. The result was delicious. This time I used all whole wheat flour and upped the sugar to about half a cup--I have a sweet tooth, what can I say? I also skipped the pretzel shape and rolled them into balls. I had the perfect amount of dough for 20 balls in a 9x13 baking dish."
