"reviewBody": "This was a great recipe base for my best leftover Thanksgiving Turkey chili ever! As in typical Allrecipes fashion, I have to make adjustments (mandatory). I took the canned corn, canned green chili advice. 2x pinto bean cans, 1x black beans. No tomato soup, instead the highest quality tomato pur√©e and diced tomatoes you can find, about equal parts. Throw 2 hot sausage links in to brown with carrots and/or your raw turkey. 4 or so mins later, throw in the celery. A few mins later throw in the onion. Finally, throw in fresh garlic, instead of powdered, for 3 or so mins tops. If you have tomato paste, throw 2 tablespoons in, stir to incorporate, then *do not touch* until carmelized - about 6 mins. Next, throw in about 2 tablespoons of red wine, let simmer for 5 or so mins. This adds a bunch of flavor. Proceed to add in your remaining ingredients like cooked leftover turkey, if youre using that instead, and tomatoes. I added some spices you may be interested in trying. Moroccan Ras El Hanout - about a tablespoon. You could substitute with curry powder or paste, although it wouldn't be the same. About a tablespoon of Urfa pepper. If you're not using smoked leftover turkey like me, add a dash of Liquid Smoke and thank me later. I used more of the spices then called for in this recipe, but I just taste and see. Slightly under season, give it a few hours, add more. I added 15 oz of water, likely 2-3tbps of chili powder, etc. Cheers m8s"

I didn't have low sodium tomato soup, so I used regular, and because I only had one can of soup, I used 1 can of store bought tomato sauce. Everyone loved the flavor, and it was great for leftovers."

I did read the reviews before cooking and made the \"tweaks\" recommended. 1. Used ONE WHOLE CAN of tomato paste instead of any of the tomato sauce 2. Used TWO cans of the MILD Tomatoes with green chili's (the small cans from Walmart-I drained about 3/4 of the liquid before pouring in the crockpot) 3. Used ONE TB Chili powder instead of two (honestly didn't see it was two but one was just fine!) 4. Used OLIVE OIL to brown the turkey and that was just fine; I also threw the onion in there with it and browned it all together and that worked out great! My husband told me it was a \"keeper\" and to \"def make again\" sooooo, I would say it's a HUGE SUCCESS!!!!"

"reviewBody": "I love this recipe. I have been making it for almost a year now. I enjoy the ease of using my crock pot so having a great recipe is always a plus. I don't eat beef so Laura's Turkey Chili is just perfect for me. I took several tips from others who commented. I only used one can of kidney beans and I substituted one can of tomato soup (Campbell's low sodium) with a can of Rotel tomatoes. I didn't have any Allspice seasoning, so I just added a sprinkle of cinnamon. Because I am watching my sodium intake, I drain and rinse my black beans and the kidney beans. Makes it a little bland but it is still delicious. I have been experimenting with the Red Pepper Flakes. The amount listed makes it TOO hot for my taste buds. So, I've been decreasing the amount every time I make my chili. I'm done to 1/8 teaspoon. After it's done, I top my chili with avocado slices. OMG!! It makes up for the low salt and it's healthier. Sometimes I'll top with a small amount of sour cream but not often. I previously ate Tostitos multigrain chips with my chili. But I am now in love with the Simply Organic white cheddar Doritos. Yum-yum! You've got to try it. It's the only time I enjoy these chips. Even though it's blazing hot outside, I actually have a batch of Laura's chili cooking now. It's really that good! Enjoy y'all."

If I were home all day I could have spotted this and stopped the cooking process, or added some water. I ate it anyway, but the children said it was bland so I gave them some sour cream. Perhaps more spices. We were disappointed with this one. K."

I think the next time I'm going to try elk.\n I wouldn't be a proper reviewer if I didn't make some changes to fit my own taste. lol I like a chunky, hearty chili. So this is what I changed, instead of 1 lb of meat. I use 1.5 lb and that works out better for me. Instead of the tomato soup, I use one 28-oz can of Red Gold whole peeled tomatoes. I dump them in and then I use my wooden spoon to crush them against the side of the pot. Some may choose to add some water, but I don't. Other than that, I keep everything the same.\n*Pro tip: If your chili comes out too soupy. Use a potato masher to crush up some of the beans, but not all. This will thicken up your chili pretty good. Enjoy"

I also use two cans of green chili and tomatoes. three cans black beans (my fave), 2 cans each dark and light kidney beans. I also use two pounds of ground chili since we like our chili chunky. I obviously make this is large quantity so I use the serving option in the app to adjust the quantity of spice. I do also add about a teaspoon of turmeric and a teaspoon of smoked paprika and it adds to the flavor. thanks for sharing this recipe! it's a keeper!"

I, too, found one can of kidney beans and a can of black beans sufficient. I suspect there are a bunch of variations that will work and will try some the next time I make it. I made it in my 4 quart slow cooker; it served 4 people with only a small amount leftover. I thought it was spicy but my guests added a bunch more chile power and a lot of Tabasco.
