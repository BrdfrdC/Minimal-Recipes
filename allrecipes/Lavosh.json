Just put all of the mixed ingredients with unincorporated flour bits onto the kneeding board and they will work in.\nI tried some other recipe ideas ...like using olive oil instead of egg white ...DON'T... it made it way too heavy. The egg white is perfect. Sesame seeds work well, esp to not compete with other dishes. Next time I'll press them in...but I also did some with fresh rosemary and sea salt and liked that too."

These are delicious, very easy to make (although a bit time-consuming) and can be customized to your tastes by replacing (or adding to) the sesame seeds whatever spices you like--this time I used Kosher salt, garlic pepper, and red pepper flakes. I would suggest only preparing one egg white at a time to use for brushing on before baking as I found one to be more than enough for me. A second would have just been wasted. Also don't be tempted to remove them from the oven too soon. Browner = crisper."

"reviewBody": "I love this recipe; it's exactly like expensive store-bought flatbreads at a fraction of the cost. I typically add a bit more butter to the dough for a richer flavour. I've also experimented with different toppings, adding some nigella seeds (sometimes called black sesame seeds) along with sesame seeds. The only downside is rolling out all those thin sheets of dough is very labour intensive. But there's no flatbread so delicious as a homemade one - it's worth the effort."

I'm in the process of making it again, and I think I'll just use less liquid. It does turn out much like a cracker (great for fruit salsa or yogurt cheese), but if you want a softer bread, bake for less time. Also, I tried topping the two of the bread each with cayenne, parmesean, crushed garlic, and sesame seeds (like it says), and I also made a plain batch. All of them are very nice, especially the parmesean (it gets all wonderfully golden and crunchy). The plain one was kind of bland, but still alright. This recipe goes in my recipe box."
