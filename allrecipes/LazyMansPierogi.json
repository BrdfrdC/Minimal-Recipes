Let's just call it what it is.\n\nThis stuff looks like , but tastes like heaven. \nI did a few alterations, to add more flavour:\n- used a 1lb of FRESH button mushrooms (don't use canned - yuck!)\n- don't strain the sauerkraut. Keep that extra marinate flavor and add it all in.\n- sautéed the mushrooms and onions in the bacon fat (didn't use the recommended butter extra step; waste of a pain and why add a new fat?)\n- used a full 1lb of bacon. YUM. \n\nThis is a new fav of mine.\n\nDefinitely easy and can be modified with lower fat options (ie. remove bacon fat, low/no fat mushroom soup, ect)"

And the variations noted in these reviews are typical variations depending on whose Mom gave you the recipe. We use a version with kielbasa, 1/4 # bacon, undrained sauerkraut, touch of Worchestershire and garlic--in addition to what's noted."

(I used turkey bacon and it tasted delicious). I also added the sauerkraut straight out of the jar, juices and all...it adds so much more flavor to the dish! I added about 2 teaspoons of Worchershire sauce and omitted the mushrooms completely. I love mushrooms, but I don't feel they belong in this dish, the few that are in the soup are sufficient enough for me. Lastly I added an envelope of Lipton onion soup mix...really takes it over the top!! I found that because of the thickness of all the ingredients combined, I DID have to add a splash or two of milk to give it room to groove."

"reviewBody": "This dish is very popular in Buffalo, where I live-especially during football season, and I make it often. The only issues I have with this recipe are: 1. that it presumably uses the drippings from a half pound of bacon in which to fry the onions. Seems like a lot of grease to me. I just leave a tablespoon or so in the pan. 2. I double the amount of mushrooms. They cook way down and add a lot of flavor and texture. 3. I drain and squeeze the sauerkraut dry, but do not rinse it. Rinsing makes a much blander dish. It's just as easy to double the recipe, considering all the prep and dirty pans, and makes great leftoivers"

My boyfriend, who HATES sauerkraut liked this well enough that he gave me permission to make this one again. Not a fancy dish but it is filling and tasty. Thanks Joanne."
