I even sauteed the cabbage and onion in olive oil to add flavor, and added a little bit of sauteed green peppers. I sprinkled the top with garlic cheese bread crumbs, then baked it on 350 for 10 minutes. It still just mostly tasted like cream of mushroom soup... Not sure how I will tweak it next time, but definitely want to try it again! My hubby loved it! :) Maybe garlic? Definitely Polska Kielbasas would be delicious but then this couldn't really be called a Pierogi Casserole... :)"
