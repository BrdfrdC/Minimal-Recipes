I did add black pepper at the table after tasting it , which improved the taste somewhat."

I should have known - paprika &amp; cream of mushroom soup as the only seasoning for ground turkey, a very bland meat? All I could smell was mushroom, and it turned out a weird pink color from the paprika. I'm sorry to say, it smelled awful to me &amp; was barely edible, the tastes were so strange. Oddly enough my sister enjoyed it. To each their own..."

Well, it was fast, easy, and husband, toddlers, grandpa, and I all loved it. I did add a teaspoon of chopped garlic when after sautéing the onion, and about 1/4 cup of sour cream at the end but I’m sure it would’ve been just as good without adding anything. I’ll probably be keeping the ingredients for this on hand for last minute dinner rescue. Takes about the same time as hamburger helper and tastes way better!"

I found the gravy to have very little flavour and the meatballs too much all spice flavour. Its possible that sour cream gives the gravy its flavour, but I felt like I was eating meatballs and noodles with margarine and parsley on it.\n\nI'm sure adding sour cream makes it more flavorful, but I dont think I'll make this one again."

I drained the water once but I think the next time after adding soup I might also add some flour to thicken the sauce."

"reviewBody": "Today I prepared for you a Creamy Shiitake Mushroom Turkey Stroganoff and Tomato-Spinach Rotini. I didn't have any Mushroom soup so I made some using freeze dried shiitake and made a roux cream from scratch. I used the water that the mushrooms seeped in, added an (extra ) chicken bouillon cube to it and mixed the mushroom-chicken brine into the roux and continued to add milk, garlic, salt and pepper. I glazed the pan with butter and fresh chopped garlic and added 2/3 cup of onion (instead of a tablespoon) to a pound of turkey and browned it really well while the roux thickened. Dont be afraid to brown the turkey well because once it goes into the roux it will absorb a lot. These methods injected flavor into the dish and given turkey burger is notorious for being dry and tasteless -- I impressed myself. Yum-yum."

I then cook about 8 oz fresh brown mushrooms sliced or quartered (done it both ways, up to preference) with 1/2 an onion diced thin, along with 2 more cloves of garlic until the mushrooms start to brown and the onion is soft. I then add the turkey back, add the soup, add 2 tbls of sour cream, a dash of milk or cream, dash of paprika, black pepper, and salt to taste (depending on the soup used, may not need to add any salt). My wife loves it, as does my son!"
