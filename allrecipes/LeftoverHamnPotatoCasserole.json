I do have one complaint though, your prep time is WAY off. Peeling and cutting up potatoes into half inch squares, finely cutting up an onion, cutting ham into half inch squares, not to mention the cooking of the potatoes, onion etc. The preparation of the cheese sauce before putting everything into a casserole dish. All that is prep time before baking. It takes much, much longer than 15 minutes."

I used my dutch oven - cooked the onions up in the butter then added 3 cups of chicken stock (vs. milk) and then the ham and cubed potatoes. Once the potatoes were cooked - drained reserving the 1 1/2 c of the broth - added the flour to thicken sauce and then the cheese. Put potatoes and ham back into the dutch oven - covered with the sauce and baked according to the recipe. Fantastic."

Flavor was a bit heavy (lots of butter) yet a little basic. Needs some additional spices, perhaps paprika? Also, I would broil for the last 5 minutes in the oven to brown the breakcrumbs a bit."

I messed up and made the “cheese sauce” first, but i just took it off the heat while doing the onions and ham. It was a very thick sauce to “pour” over the casserole but i “placed” it gently over the casserole and baked it. I laughed while serving it to my family thinking we would have to run out for a pizza but it tasted really good! They liked it! I can’t wait to try it again with enough milk!"

I did make a few changes. \n\nInstead of the potatoes I used a frozen bag of pre-cooked hashbrowns (which I recommend thawing in the fridge the day of making this recipe). I added about 12 cloves of smashed and minced garlic to the hashbrown and onion mixture. \n\nIn the sauce I used 5 tablespoons of butter, and (accidentally) used 16 ounces of cheese (mozzarella instead of cheddar.) I wouldn't call it \"sauce\" as it had a much thicker consistency, and spread over the casserole more like a congealed frosting. We also couldn't wait for it to bubble and brown because oh, my lanta... when we tasted a bit off the spoon it was too good to wait for. \n\nAnyway. We really loved this recipe... one thing, though, if you use the bag of hashbrowns like I did is that I'd consider using both more ham and more onion. \n\nOh! We also skipped the bread crumbs as we didn't have any on hand, and I don't think we suffered for it... but some french's fried onions and maybe some chives on top would have REALLY made this recipe POP."

"reviewBody": "7-17-20. I went heavy on onion (1 large) and used Mexican blend for cheese (our preferences) and Panko breadcrumbs which did slightly brown. Baked 20 minutes on top shelf in oven, let set for 5 minutes before serving to allow sauce to thicken. Minor prep changes included letting potatoes simmer for only 15 minutes, removed from heat and then let sit in hot water to further cook and keep warm while continuing with the remainder of recipe. Layered 1/2 ham/potatoes mixture and 1/2 sauce. Repeated. Done to minimize having to mix in casserole dish. Great use of leftover ham!"
