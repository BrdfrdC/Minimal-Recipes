Our house doesn't really like leftovers, but using leftovers to create something else is a win. These with omelettes made with leftover ham were a hit. Thank you for the recipe."

Yummy"

"reviewBody": "I did make as written as not fair to rate a recipe that has been altered. Did not care for breadcrumbs. My grandmother always made potato pancakes, at least once each week, but used a tiny bit of flour on outside and then were served with sour cream or applesauce. Funnily enough, I just finished dinner and logged in to find this recipe. A friend just cooked something similar but he used ground pork and seasoned with salt, pepper, cumin, italian seasoning and a little tomato paste. Once pork was cooked he used leftover mashed, placed a good portion in hands and put pork in middle. Formed into a 2 inch ball, dipped in beaten egg and then in breadcrumbs and fried. Delish."
