"reviewBody": "Absolutely delicious! This was my first attempt at making risotto and after reading the recipe and tips it turned exactly like I imagined. I did cut the olive oil in half and added butter to make up the difference to sauté the onions and celery. Also, I added creme fraiche (about 4oz) once I was finished with the stock and just before the asparagus. It gave an even creamier texture. It is a labor of love and I’d recommend getting all of the ingredients measured out and laid out in order of use by the stove. The process is involved it’s easier to have you 1/2 cup of wine ready for you by the stove. Thank you for such a great recipe!"

I use 8 spears if they are thicker and about 15 if they are thin. Love keeping the burner on medium while mixing in the broth. Really cuts down on cooking time and still keeps rice slightly al dente. I turn the burner down to medium-low when mixing I have more time."

The lemon is really good here, giving it a nice, fresh, springtime flavor. I skipped the lemon zest. Thanks for this great recipe that I'll surely enjoy again! UPDATE: Used half asparagus and half mushrooms. Very good! I added mushrooms with celery/onion saute; may be better to saute separately and add at end with asparagus. UPDATE: If adding mushrooms, much better sauteeing for ~5 min separately, then adding when asparagus is added."

I didn’t have quite enough chicken broth, so I added some of the water from steaming the asparagus in with the broth I had, and it’s worked out just fine. I used two scallions instead of regular onion, and I tripled the amount of garlic (we really love garlic!). I did not include celery since I had none on hand, And after the risottos was cooked and removed from the heat, I added about a half a cup of half and half along with some extra Parmesan as the risotto I grew up enjoying was extremely creamy and cheesy. It came out perfectly! I served it along side my homemade shrimp scampi, and it was a nice change from the pasta I typically serve with it. THanks so much for a fantastic recip!!!"

Steamed the asparagus as directed, then sauteed the onions and celery in the IP, using the saute feature. Added the garlic, wine then only 2 cups of chicken broth. Sealed and set on manual for 6 minutes. At the end of the 6 minutes, I released the pressure, opened the pot and added the asparagus and switched to \"keep warm\" until hubs finished cutting the lawn! Right before serving, I added the parmesan and lemon juice as directed. It was really good, and I'll make it again, this very same way."

Then wilted some spinach and mixed that in with fresh basil and cilantro. To me, it took what was good and made it great."

The flavour of the parmesan, hinted by the zing of the lemon juice and zest, together with the creaminess of the rice were perfect. My husband loved it. I made 1.5 batches at once so I could freeze some for later too!"

My broth seemed to absorb or disappear too fast and yet I needed more than the 4 cups of broth for the rice to be tender (not a full cup more). It took about 35 minutes from the time I added the wine to achieve a nice texture. I followed the recipe exactly outside of the timing and used canned lemon juice, no zest. The flavors in this dish are WONDERFUL!"
