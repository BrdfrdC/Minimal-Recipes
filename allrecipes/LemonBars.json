I baked the shortbread for 10 minutes, and I used aluminum foil instead of parchment paper, and the shortbread got stuck like a rock,and the curd stayed runny,so I couldn't even cut it into squares. I ended up throwing away my baking sheet. I will try again using parchment paper, and I will use buttermilk, instead of subbing with the milk and lemon juice mixture."

"reviewBody": "I've been cooking since I was eight and going to the Institute of Culinary Education. Lemon bars are my specialty. Here's a few other things you can do to make them better than they already are! \n1. Add pumpkin spice! \n Trust me on this one... A dash of pumpkin spice to the crust (bottom layer) will add a ZING to it! It doesn't even make it taste pumpkiny! \n2. Freeze it. \n Right after your top layer is finished cooking and your lemon bars are cut into squares, freeze them! Not over night, more like half and hour to an hour. Take them out and let sit for about ten minutes, and they will be perfect! \n3. Lime! \n If you really love citrus fruits (like me) then don't be afraid to squeeze a lime over your finished lemon bars. And once the lime has set in, add the sugar!\nI really hope this advice helped you and made your lemon bars the best they can be!"

I actually did the following: used white sugar instead of confectioners' sugar for the base and only baked crust for 15 minutes and then added an extra large tablespoon of lemon juice. In addition, if you want to use a rectangular pan rather than a square one, just make the recipe 1.5 times the amount. It works really well. Everything came out perfect and I even made homemade lemonade. Lovely, lovely recipe."

My only gripe is that I got about 12 decent-sized squares out of this recipe, not the 16 it accounts for. I also have a funky oven so I didn't need as much baking time for the second round. But it was so delicious that it's still getting the full 5 stars. By the way, these were my FIRST *homemade* lemon bars, so thank you SO MUCH for this lovely recipe."

You don't use the 'rind' as indicated, I think they meant the zest. Grate some of the zest into the crust for better flavor. Do no melt the butter, mix cold butter cut up into the flour/sugar as when making a pastry crust."

Maybe not needed but they came out of the pan very easily and it didn't seem to hurt anything. Thanks for a great recipe, Sallie."
