And, of course, the second time around and went easier on the garlic! (Which I love - perhaps my cloves were just too big.)"

I served it with Pasta e Olio, also from this site."

The pesto was fresh and very tasty, it added a little kick to the steak without compromising the flavor. We didn't change one thing for this steak, we followed the recipe exactly and the finished product was terrific. I recommend this to any cook, because it was easy for me to make and I am definitely just an amateur chef."

For anyone worried about or having trouble with pesto falling off or burning on their steaks, I marinated my steaks in about 2T pesto (don't worry, you'll have plenty for topping) loosened with a splash of lemon and olive oil. You can shake the excess off - or not, I didn't - when you're ready to grill. Awesome. Thanks for the recipe!!!"

The garlic rubbed on the meat didn't do much good; it burned off while the meat was cooking, but that's a small quibble. My husband and I loved this. I served it with sliced tomatoes and roasted cauliflower. Thanks for the recipe, desi!"
