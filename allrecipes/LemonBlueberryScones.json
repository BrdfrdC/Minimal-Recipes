I was looking for a sour cherry scone recipe so I substituted thawed frozen cherries for the blueberries. I also used grated frozen butter and just stirred instead of the food processor. They taste very good and are easy to make."

I doubled the glaze, just using up the lemon juice from the lemon half I squeezed and adding powdered sugar a spoon at a time until it was a good consistency to drizzle. Otherwise, this recipe is perfect. It's a new family favorite!"

After they were finished baking they looked great but they do fall apart very easily. They do, however, taste very good. I was expecting a more crunchy texture and these came out almost cakey inside. Had I realized this, I might have chosen a different recipe. These are good, just not the hard cookie-type scone I was expecting."

Better than “Cobs”!!\n\nMade with ingredients as listed with the exception of using light cream instead of heavy cream - that was what I had in the fridge. \n\nAnd I did not use a food processor- I cut in the butter using a pastry blender. To answer someone else’s question about using a mixer: this would ruin the texture. \n\nWill make this again. We love the flavour combo of lemon and blueberry."
