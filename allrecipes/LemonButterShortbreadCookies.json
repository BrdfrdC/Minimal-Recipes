"reviewBody": "Love this recipe! Definitely use unsalted butter, I made it both ways with salted butter and with unsalted. Both are good, but I prefer with unsalted butter. Love the flavor. I’m going to try to make these with the lemon zest in the cookie itself as well as in the icing. Trying to stay away from sugar as much as possible. My cook time was about 11 minutes sometimes 12, so probably just my oven. I make these for the cookie corner for my church and everybody loves them. Thank you for the recipe. This photo was taken before they are iced. Also I hate to roll out cookies, so I scooped with a medium cookie scoop and pressed down With damp fingers and then with a damp saucer. This is dough is very user-friendly."

"reviewBody": "Amazing! These are dangerous. I just made them and ate three. I cut the recipe in half to save time (and butter), but accidentally used the full cup of sugar in the dough. I think that made them better. Based on reviews saying the cookie was bland w/o the glaze, I went ahead and used the full amounts for salt, baking soda and lemon, too. Made glaze as normal, but left out lemon zest. They were phenomenal! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"

I did sift all the dry and added some zest to the dough. Instead of rolling and cutting, I put the dough clear wrap in a log shape. Chilled the dough and sliced it. I only used half of the glaze, it was so good."

I have two questions… What size cookie cutter is intended for this because mine came out a little bit small. And the other question is about the glaze - mine wasn’t as pretty as the picture. Was I supposed to have sifted it first? Anyway this will be a recipe I try again and again until I get it right!??? My family Loved these!"
