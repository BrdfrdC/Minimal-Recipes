"reviewBody": "I literally have never left a review for a recipe but I felt I should do that given the different things that I saw. I read the positive and negative comments about the cake. I copied what one reviewer did and added half a cup of cream cheese and did 1/2 cup less of butter. I also added about a fourth a cup of sour cream. That left me with one stick of butter (1 cup). I also decided to add in a couple of tablespoons of lemon juice to the batter in addition to the extract because several people said the cake did not taste lemon. That helped a ton. I probably only added about a cup and 3/4 of sugar because I like a less sweet cake. The frosting on top made it perfect. I’ll give it a four stars because without this helpful template I would not have made this cake. Also appreciated the other reviewer‘s input."

I also adjusted the sugar to the cake: i used 1 cup honey, 1 cup sugar, leave out the extra half cup. Mixed in a cup of blueberries with the extract and added a tablespoon of zest. Cooked for 68 minutes exactly. Everything else was the same as listed. Definitely a must try!!"

"reviewBody": "Oh my Lord in Heaven! Sarah Copeland Sawicki-this dessert aficionado (and her family) owes you a debt of gratitude for this winner of a recipe. I made it for a family birthday party and we had only 2 (small) pieces left over. Everyone raved about it. Our 7 year old granddaughter proclaimed she had never tasted a cake so delicious, and she’s one of those people, like me, who prefers chocolate desserts.\n\nI followed this recipe to a “T” except for the lemon extract in the cake. I didn’t have any, so I used 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice instead. Everything else was per the recipe, including the buttermilk. We fought over the stray pieces of cake that were leftover in the cake pan once I transferred it to a serving platter—it was that good. I had never beaten cake batter for 10 minutes before, so I think that—along with the rich ingredients, and especially the buttermilk—is what makes this cake so outstanding. It’s definitely restaurant quality. It has a bit of a crunchy crust in spots which adds to its deliciousness. I was worried it may be too dense or dry, but it was perfect. The glaze is superb too. I may try this with a strawberry glaze next time. \n\nNote: I baked in a dark Bundt pan and it took 55 minutes using the toothpick test. I only mention this because some reviewers said they had to bake theirs longer than the 60-75 minutes of recommended time. Be sure to check for doneness a few minutes early. Thanks for the keeper."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is very good. I actually went a little overboard with the baking time as I was reading so many people saying that theirs was coming out raw in the middle. It is dense but moist. I will make it again, but as a preference I would cut down the sugar of the mix and the glaze. Next time, I will worry less about the baking time and just adjust the sugars to my preference and that is it. I recommend to do a test run depending on the type of pan you will use. Dark ones tend to brown and dry out the edges pretty quick. I will keep in mind as this was the first time I was using this brand new small fluted pan. My next tip would be to lower the temperature by 25F if your pan is dark regardless of its type/shape. This cake benefits from slow baking at a low temperature. Which leads me to my last tip: do not to haste the cake, take your time and add minutes accordingly, but let it bake for the first 45 minutes without opening the oven. Resist this temptation by any means. The first 45 minutes are crucial same as the long slow baking."

I didn't have lemon extract (mistake reading the ingredients) so I used 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and the zest of 2 lemons instead. I was afraid this would affect the lemon flavor but it didn't at all. Everything else I followed the recipe exactly. My family and I could not stop eating it!

I added 1Tbsp lemon zest to the batter along with squeezing about 1Tbsp of that lemon into the batter. I also agree that it's important to whip this batter for 10 minutes to get it light and fluffy as stated. I poured my batter into 2 glass loaf pans and 1 little one and it took close to 90 minutes to bake through the large loaves. I made my frosting with 2 cups of powdered sugar beat with 3Tbsp melted butter 1tsp of lemon extract and added lemon juice to obtain the right consistency. I think it turned out great! I want to also say that had I had meringue powder I would have tried the frosting with 2 cups powdered sugar, 2Tbsp meringue powder and 1tsp lemon extract for a hard frosting but maybe next time."

The lemony smell as it was baking was divine, the only thing I added was I put a little bit of lemon zest into the batter with the lemon extract. It came out perfectly, got a great rise which was very surprising based on the amount of baking sofa but the 10 minutes to beat the egg and sugar to a fluffy soft consistence go a long way to keeping this cake light."
