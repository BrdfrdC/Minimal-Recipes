I made them gluten-free with gluten-free shortbread cookies for the crust and gluten-free flour in the filling. I had to bake a lot longer than the 25 to 28 minutes called for, before the center was set. I would estimate that it was about 45 minutes total. I just kept checking with a toothpick until the center was set."

I combined and pressed into a 9x13 pan (lined with foil), and baked for 20 minutes at 350F. (Cooled it down) Then followed recipe for filling as written. It was nice and tart, creamy and very lemony. After cooling, I chilled it, the removed the whole cake using the foil and cut it into bars. Took it to a Christmas potluck. It was a hit."
