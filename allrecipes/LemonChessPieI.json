"reviewBody": "I have been looking for a lemon chess pie recipe like that used by Rich's (a Southern dept. store) years ago. This one is pretty darn close. :-)\nI used evaporated milk and the juice of three lemons rather than just two. The next time I make it, I'll reduce the sugar a little, because it *was* a little sweeter than I remember.\nA standard 9\" pie crust was a little too shallow for the custard - next time, I'll try a deep-dish pie crust. And I'm still trying to work out the perfect baking time.\nAll in all, this is a great recipe - with a little tweaking, I think it'll be perfect!"

Not what I expected at all. My husband loves lemon pies but he did not care for this. Sorry, but I will not be making this one again."

"reviewBody": "Agree with other reviewers that this pie is very easy to make. Used evaporated milk (for extra creaminess) and added grated rind from one lemon (for more lemon flavor). My family enjoyed it, although I found the filling a little too sweet. The pie is also very good eaten cold. Baked for approximately 25 minutes at 350 degrees."
