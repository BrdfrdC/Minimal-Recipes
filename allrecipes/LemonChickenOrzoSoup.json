I didn't have broth so I used chicken bouillon and a couple of veggie bouillon since I was out of celery and only had 1/2 an onion. I also cooked the chicken and orzo in the broth, and I only added maybe a tablespoon of lemon juice to it because my hubby isn't a fan of lemon, and I figured I can always add more to my bowl. Hubby tasted the soup, and he likes it! Will make this again, hopefully with the proper ingredients."

Will make again with much LESS LEMON, and try uncooked orzo as one reviewer suggested (fewer pots the better). Served with grated parm and diced avocado. Husband isn't usually a big fan of soup, but really enjoyed this. Great way to get daily veggie servings, too!"

I cooked a chicken thigh &amp; leg in the broth then shredded the meat off bone to add to the broth. The soup need more meat so I made small turkey meatballs and added them (raw) to the soup. I didn't have orzo in the pantry so I used 1/4 cup Ditalini #63 . That was plenty. Add more it you like a lot of pasta in your soup. Just remember that the pasta will absorb a lot of broth. You could cook the pasta on the side and add to the broth just before warming up a bowl. I also added the juice of one lemon a little at a time tasting until I like the flavor. Delicious!"

"reviewBody": "Savory and delicious! During quarantine I looked for recipes that included ingredients I already had. This one was close, but I made a few swaps:\nOrzo=brown rice\nChicken=turkey legs\nChicken broth=vegetable broth\n\nI simmered turkey legs for about 6 hours in vegetable broth with celery tips and white onion. Let cool and refrigerated over night. Made for a very flavorful stock. \n\nNext day took meat off of bone, then put bones back in with all the veggies and seasonings. Added meat and cooked brown rice towards the end. \n\nWhen eating, I added a squeeze of lemon and a squirt of Sriracha for some spice. Reminded me of lemon grass soup from a local Vietnamese restaurant. \n\nMy dad and husband loved it!\n\nPerfect rainy day food-will make again for sure. Thinking of halibut in the soup next time?"

I then remove the chicken, chop it up and add it back at the end of the soup. I also used chard instead of spinach since that was available from my garden. My kids devoured this soup. I will be making it again. Maybe next time a little less orzo."

I LOVE thyme and bay, and they really gave the soup a nice, fragrant taste and smell. Personally, I found that this amount of lemon was overpowering, so I corrected by adding a bit more water and some chicken bouillon (I didn't buy any extra chicken broth). In addition, I really bulked up the veggies in this dish to make it a hearty, fulfilling soup."

The lemon was a nice touch though a bit more than suits my taste. This may fade a bit as the soup sits overnight and is reheated. Also, I thought it could use a little more vegetable to make it more substantial. That however is an easy fix."
