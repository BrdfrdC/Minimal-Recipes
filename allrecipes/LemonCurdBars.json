"reviewBody": "Well, the taste was delicious! However, mine did not stay together like nice square bars, I'm thinking I didn't use 3/4 of the crumbly mixture pressed to the bottom of my pan; it was hard for me to tell how much 3/4 was. I wanted to make sure I had enough of the crumbly mixture to cover the top? Consequently, maybe I had too much for the topping thus, mine was all crumbly? If anyone has any suggestions as to what I may have done wrong; ( other than this measurement snafu) I followed everything to a tee! Please I'm open to suggestions because, as I stated, it still tasted scrumptious! I would love to try it another time....I'm not a beginner either, I usually have very good luck following the recipes? Do you press the top crumbs like as in the crust? It's worth 5 stars and more."
