(My review for the curd is #10--worth the trouble of looking it up.) These cookies are good but crumbly because of the flour, but the taste is good--missing something, but still it was well-received by my g-f family members."

I made my lemon curd from one of the recipes on this site. \nMy cookies spread slightly when they were baked. I also baked the cookies 25 - 30 minutes. \nOverall, the cookies turned out pretty good."

"reviewBody": "12.24.20 The shortbread cookie dough consistency was a little different than what I’m used to, and the cookies did not spread out when baking. In the future, I’ll flatten the cookie balls a bit before adding the lemon curd. I used Chef John’s Lighter Lemon Curd on this site, and I used a wine bottle cork for making the indentation on the cookie for the filling. I scaled the recipe to 12 servings, used a 1-1/2” cookie scoop, and ended up with 20 cookies."
