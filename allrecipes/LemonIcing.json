It was smooth, creamy &amp; not too buttery, we even used a piping tool to make nice patterns with it. I did use lemon juice from a bottle, (no fresh lemons around) &amp; just needed to add a bit extra of the lemon juice to make it the perfect lemony taste. Remember to put the icing in the fridge if you are going to use a piping tool with it, (10-15 minutes)."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is a really good basic recipe. Room temperature butter is critical to it not being too stiff. I needed to make frosting for two bundt cakes with the intent to frost the top only. The cakes are for a summer fund raiser and will need to withstand an overly warm room. The frosting will either stay put of attractively slip down the cake a little. Hopefully :) Keeping proportions of ingredients roughly the same as the recipe, I used one bag of confectioners sugar and the juice of two lemons. That was more than the 4 tablespoons that would have been called for. I balanced to spreading consistency by adding more butter. I also threw in 1/2 tsp of lemon zest for kick and appearance. Whip the daylights out of it and it should be fine. It was very smooth and absolutely no curdling appearance with good body for frosting."

I made the original recipe, as mentioned, way too sweet. I might use salted butter next time to cut the sweetness. I added more lemon choose and a pinch or two of salt and this helped the flavor a bit, however it wasn’t enough to cut the sweetness. Ended up having to soften 8 ounces of cream cheese and whipping it in, as well as add about 1/2 C to 1 C more sugar, jest to have enough to ice a 2 layer 8 inch cake."

I added an extra teaspoon of white sugar and an eighth of a teaspoon of water, along with one extra tablespoon of vanilla extract. Mine turned out very grainy, and when I attempted to spread it onto the cake I made, it ran down the sides and collected more as a watery glaze. I don't know what I did wrong, but I will not be using this recipe again."

I didn't get the buttery taste others mentioned, but then I like lemon so I probably added more than anyone else. Next time I'm going to add lemon zest as well! Consistency is regulated by how much sugar you add. I needed mine to be real thick as I'm using it in between cake layers, so I'd say what I used was closer to 4 cups. This is a wonderful, fast, and easy icing!"
