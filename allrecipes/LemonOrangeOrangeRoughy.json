"reviewBody": "I used cod and could not even taste the freshly-squeezed orange and lemon juices, only lemon pepper seasoning. Adding the juices to the fish at the beginning and then flipping the fillets left you with zero fresh juice flavor. This cooks so quickly that there’s no time for the juice to infuse the fish and when you flip to the other side to finish cooking, the juice just quickly evaporates…hope that makes sense to you. If I were to make this again (unlikely), I’d wait until the fish is nearly cooked on the other side and then drizzle with the juices. It also could use a garnish of some sort like chopped parsley or cilantro, has no eye appeal."

I sprayed the fish and shrimp (I used 8 oz of raw shrimp also) with butter spray and seasoned with old bays, Ground himalyan pink salt, fresh grpund pepper, lemon pepper and I also used a little garlic powder on the shrimp. I used 1.5 tsp of olive oil, 3 cloves garlic (2 minced, 1 sliced) 5-6 chopped leaves of fresh basil. I warmed it all up in the oil before adding the fish, shrimp and juice. Fish cooked for 5 minutes added shrimp at halfway mark."

I need to buy more next time so I can go back for seconds like they did.\n\nI did make this in a cast iron skillet which I strongly recommend. It created a lovely sear on it. I put it on high to get all the juice to evaporate, then lowered the heat to medium or so to get the sear and allow it to cook through. It probably took 10-15 minutes, not 5."

My husband (who's trying to watch his cholesterol) kept asking how much butter I put in this to make it so good and buttery. He was shocked when I told him none, just a tiny drizzle of olive oil in the pan. Just put oil then fish in pan, poured juice of one lemon and one orange over top, shook on some lemon pepper and let it simmer until it was flakey. I did grate a little of the orange and lemon peel into the juice. Couldnt be easier!"

Went great with peas/carrots mix (using the marinade from the fish) and some white rice (not my favorite, but I needed something quick).

I like to heat the oil in a large saute pan, cook the fish about 4 minutes over med-high heat until just browning, then flip, pour the juice over it, cover and remove for heat. In about 5 minutes, it's perfect every time. The 'sauce' is fantastic over rice, quinoa or couscous straight up, reduced or thickened with a little corn starch. Works great with lemon or lime juice, whatever's on hand. Love this recipe and it's so simple even the kids can make it. Thank you!!!"

"reviewBody": "Ok...I overcooked it.....but that's not why the 3 stars.....lacked flavor. In addition to the recipe ingredients, I added some fresh lemon zest and some garlic powder right before baking .....still lacking. Served with fresh baby spinach sauteed in olive oil and fresh garlic ....that I thought saved the meal. I did use cod instead of roughy. Prolly wont make again ...sorry."

I didn't realize that it was overharvested until I looked for a recipe for the fish that was already in my freezer. Guess I can always prepare another fish this way, perhaps tilapia as others suggested?"

I can't give it 5 stars because it's not a restaurant quality recipe. It's adequate, not complex or mouthwatering, but it's good. I'd make it again because it's healthy and convenient and my UBER-picky 4 year old loved it."

I didn't have any fresh oranges or lemons so I just used juice I had on hand and it was great. I also have tried this on shrimp and that worked well too. Garnish with a slice of orange and it looks so pretty on the plate too! Thank you for sharing! :)"

When The Fish Was Done Cooking I Placed It On A Plate And I Added A Small Amount Of Argo Gravy Thickner To The Orange And Lemon Sauce, To Thicking A Little. And Poured It Over The Fish. This Recipe Was Good And Very Easy. Side Dish Was Frozen Creamed Spinach , And I Had A Fast, Easy, Healthy Meal. With Little Clean Up (Yeah) Thank You So Much From Florida!!"

I was afraid my husband would not like it since he is a hard core fishy fish lover, but he did! The preparation is a cinch, the flavor is fresh and delightful. This is a refreshing change from the old reliable dill or Old Bay spices."

I put the lemon pepper on the fillets and let them set for 10 minutes and then fried in a little bit of olive oil on med/high. After browning both sides, I put on the lemon/orange sauce and cooked on medium to reduce the liquid. It was so excellent and I served it with quinoa/mushroom dish from this site. The fish had a beautiful orange glaze on it. They complimented each other so well. One of my favorite healthy dinners!"

It wasn't bad I just found the citrus flavor overwhelming."

They usually eat it (not so much because they love it) but because they have to have a little bit. But tonight they wouldn't eat it. I don't know why. I think the citrus was a bit much for them.
