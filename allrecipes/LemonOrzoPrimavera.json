Put carrot in first with orzo to sear then add 1/2 the squash for the 2 minutes, then the rest with the broth and lemon juice. Never takes longer than 15 minutes. Stir often.

I added chopped sweet red pepper and I used lemon juice instead of zest. Also to be healthier I only put the cheese on each plate, thus using less. Per other reviews I cooked the veggies first, then the orzo and combined to heat through before serving. I only gave this 4 stars because I think it would have been quite bland had I only used zest. I will definately be making this again. Thank you for sharing."

We love the flavor of the lemon with the orzo and use this as a base recipe that we adjust to suit our tastes. I don't care for a strong thyme flavor, so I use a lesser amount and also use chicken broth most often because I have it on hand. The chicken broth gives it a great flavor. Our favorite additions to this recipe are mushrooms, onions, and fresh spinach. At the end of the cooking process, I stir in fresh spinach leaves into the hot pasta. I have made the orzo a few times with just the spinach, onions, and mushrooms and it is delicious. Thanks for sharing! :)"

I didn't have zucchini on hand so I substituted the zucchini with yellow squash. I also had green beans to use up so I added those in along with the carrots and squash. I would say normally you will need more liquid than just the one (14 oz.) can of broth. I cooked up 1 1/2 cups of pasta and I think I used about 2 cans of broth. I just judged how many cans to use based off the amount of liquid left in the pot and how done the pasta was. The end result though was spectacular. I pretty much followed the recipe again just substituting some veggies. I would make this again in a heartbeat and it's super easy to make!!"

I also left out the thyme, just because I don't care for it. I'm not sure how a few of the reviews didn't end up with enough liquid- I followed everything (other than the garlic &amp; thyme) to a \"T\", and it came out great. Thank you for sharing!"

Added a bit of fresh spinach like another reviewer, 3 cloves of garlic instead of 1, and obviously added salt &amp; pepper. I used vegetable boullion instead of canned--it's waaaay better. Try Rapunzel brand found at healthfood store-all organic/vegan ingredients. Did not make 4 servings..increase ingredients if you want larger portion sizes..Thanks LitleLisa1!!"

I always use more than 1 of each to make it more healthful. Having a quality broth makes this dish taste much better. I use 1-2 tsp dried thyme in place of the fresh, and add black pepper as needed. Also, as an onion lover, I tried adding them to this dish and I did not like the result. Adding some fresh, chopped spinach was a nice addition though. Overall, very good, very easy."

"reviewBody": "I played with the proportions in this a lot. I used 1.5 cups of orzo (after I'd added the grated zucchini/carrot, I noticed that there was way more veggie than pasta, it seemed off, so I quickly toasted up another half cup of orzo), increased the broth to 20 ounces, increased the garlic to four large cloves, increased the Parmesan to about 1/2 cup and (as suggested by other reviewers) added juice from half the lemon and a teaspoon of fresh ground sea salt at the end. It turned out really well (though I felt like too much of the lemon zest flavor came through). I'm giving this four stars because I feel like if I hadn't made the alterations that I had, it would've been a little bland and unbalanced. I will definitely make this again-with the same proportions I used this time, but with about half the amout of zest."

I boiled the orzo until it was almost done, drained then set aside. Then I started cooking the veg. in the oil and lemon. Just as the veg was getting tender, I added the orzo and some chicken stock and continued to cook until the orzo was ready. I added small amounts of stock as I went to get the perfect consistency."

"reviewBody": "I love a great risotto, but this didn't really do it for me. I felt like it just tasted like a weird, lemony chicken broth. It kind of reminded me of wild rice - don't really know why. I think it had something to do with using vegetable broth as the base instead of chicken broth and wine. Also, I usually make risotto using arborio rice (because it's cheaper), but this time I went for the orzo pasta. Maybe I'm just not an orzo fan. All in all, I won't be trying it again."

There was just the right amount of liquid to cook the orzo, from the broth and the vegetables. I have a ton of fresh lemon thyme, so I used that, which probably made it a little more lemony, but it was delicious! Will definitely make again, thanks for a great recipe!"

The pasta starch combines nicely with the broth to trick your taste buds into believing this dish has cream. A slight variation on the original, that I will try next time: a touch more broth, for a little more sauce, and served on top a bed of fresh spinach leaves."
