Put carrot in first with orzo to sear then add 1/2 the squash for the 2 minutes, then the rest with the broth and lemon juice. Never takes longer than 15 minutes. Stir often.

I added chopped sweet red pepper and I used lemon juice instead of zest. Also to be healthier I only put the cheese on each plate, thus using less. Per other reviews I cooked the veggies first, then the orzo and combined to heat through before serving. I only gave this 4 stars because I think it would have been quite bland had I only used zest. I will definately be making this again. Thank you for sharing."

We love the flavor of the lemon with the orzo and use this as a base recipe that we adjust to suit our tastes. I don't care for a strong thyme flavor, so I use a lesser amount and also use chicken broth most often because I have it on hand. The chicken broth gives it a great flavor. Our favorite additions to this recipe are mushrooms, onions, and fresh spinach. At the end of the cooking process, I stir in fresh spinach leaves into the hot pasta. I have made the orzo a few times with just the spinach, onions, and mushrooms and it is delicious. Thanks for sharing! :)"

I didn't have zucchini on hand so I substituted the zucchini with yellow squash. I also had green beans to use up so I added those in along with the carrots and squash. I would say normally you will need more liquid than just the one (14 oz.) can of broth. I cooked up 1 1/2 cups of pasta and I think I used about 2 cans of broth. I just judged how many cans to use based off the amount of liquid left in the pot and how done the pasta was. The end result though was spectacular. I pretty much followed the recipe again just substituting some veggies. I would make this again in a heartbeat and it's super easy to make!!"

I also left out the thyme, just because I don't care for it. I'm not sure how a few of the reviews didn't end up with enough liquid- I followed everything (other than the garlic &amp; thyme) to a \"T\", and it came out great. Thank you for sharing!"

Added a bit of fresh spinach like another reviewer, 3 cloves of garlic instead of 1, and obviously added salt &amp; pepper. I used vegetable boullion instead of canned--it's waaaay better. Try Rapunzel brand found at healthfood store-all organic/vegan ingredients. Did not make 4 servings..increase ingredients if you want larger portion sizes..Thanks LitleLisa1!!"

I always use more than 1 of each to make it more healthful. Having a quality broth makes this dish taste much better. I use 1-2 tsp dried thyme in place of the fresh, and add black pepper as needed. Also, as an onion lover, I tried adding them to this dish and I did not like the result. Adding some fresh, chopped spinach was a nice addition though. Overall, very good, very easy."

"reviewBody": "I played with the proportions in this a lot. I used 1.5 cups of orzo (after I'd added the grated zucchini/carrot, I noticed that there was way more veggie than pasta, it seemed off, so I quickly toasted up another half cup of orzo), increased the broth to 20 ounces, increased the garlic to four large cloves, increased the Parmesan to about 1/2 cup and (as suggested by other reviewers) added juice from half the lemon and a teaspoon of fresh ground sea salt at the end. It turned out really well (though I felt like too much of the lemon zest flavor came through). I'm giving this four stars because I feel like if I hadn't made the alterations that I had, it would've been a little bland and unbalanced. I will definitely make this again-with the same proportions I used this time, but with about half the amout of zest."

I boiled the orzo until it was almost done, drained then set aside. Then I started cooking the veg. in the oil and lemon. Just as the veg was getting tender, I added the orzo and some chicken stock and continued to cook until the orzo was ready. I added small amounts of stock as I went to get the perfect consistency."

"reviewBody": "I love a great risotto, but this didn't really do it for me. I felt like it just tasted like a weird, lemony chicken broth. It kind of reminded me of wild rice - don't really know why. I think it had something to do with using vegetable broth as the base instead of chicken broth and wine. Also, I usually make risotto using arborio rice (because it's cheaper), but this time I went for the orzo pasta. Maybe I'm just not an orzo fan. All in all, I won't be trying it again."

There was just the right amount of liquid to cook the orzo, from the broth and the vegetables.

The pasta starch combines nicely with the broth to trick your taste buds into believing this dish has cream. A slight variation on the original, that I will try next time: a touch more broth, for a little more sauce, and served on top a bed of fresh spinach leaves."
