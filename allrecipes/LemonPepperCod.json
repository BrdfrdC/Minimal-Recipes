"reviewBody": "A tasty, basic recipe that doesn’t cover up cod’s naturallysweet, buttery flavor. It is lacking salt though, so I would definitely add a sprinkle, and I found the cook time to be too long for the thickness of my cod pieces (about ¾” thick). You could also get away with using less oil than called for. I would also add the lemon juice after searing, otherwise it tends to 'steam' the first and makes it difficult to get a good sear. I served this with roasted veggies and rice."

"reviewBody": "This recipe looked perfect. Unfortunately I was in a hurry by the time I goofed around and read awhile and by that time I needed to eat right away! I preheated the oven to 375° F. Put cod (any fish will do) in pan that had been generously sprayed with regular Pam, seasoned fish with salt, pepper and lemon pepper then sprayed with Butter Pam and put in oven. When fish looked slightly brown on top, removed it, flipped fish and repeated seasoning. Put back in the oven and when the cod smelled extra good I took it out and ate nearly 5 ounces right out of the pan before I even got a side dish going! I’ll do this again when I get in a pinch and will definitely try the above recipe too!"

This dish is what I call 'stupid simple', and results in perfectly cooked, beautifully seasoned fish. DH wants it in my regular rotation. Great recipe!"

I just rubbed the filets with olive oil and laid them on a preheated grill at medium temp and followed the recipie from there. It was a hit and went pretty quickly. My husband LOVED it. and the kids did too (i didnt put any pepper on theirs)."

It is somewhat bland, so I added a sprinkle of dried dill to it. --update-- I make this a lot with both cod and tilapia. It's quick and tasty. I now use 1 T butter and 1 T veg oil. If I don't have lemon juice, I sprinkle on lemon pepper instead. It's great served with a pasta side dish and a veggie."
