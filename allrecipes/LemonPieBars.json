I am worried that simply doubling the filling will result in an overly tart flavor for us. I will have to experiment a little, but think it is worth it. I also recommend tapping the pan on the counter a few times, before placing it in the oven, to remove any air bubbles."

Eventually I figured out the mixture ran underneath the crust and so my filling was under the crust. It was upside down lemon bars. I feel like the instructions should have specified to make sure the crust goes up the sides a little so the filling will sit inside. It is a recipe after all so the instructions should be clear."

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe according to the directions in spite of many comments that the crust was too thick in proportion to the filling. The recipe calls for 2 1/4 C flour total but later states to add 4 Tbsp flour to the filling. So I used 2 C flour for the crust and the remaining crust ingredients. I also added a pinch of salt but that was not enough. My only constructive comment (and reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is the crust does not have a lot of flavor. I would suggest 1/8-1/4 tsp salt or use salted butter. I also added a pinch of salt to the filling. Other than that, I thought these were terrific. The amount of filling to crust ratio I thought was just fine. Maybe some folks are looking for filling depth closer to pie filling. But for bars, I thought these were perfect and the recipe couldn’t be simpler to follow. They go together quick. While the crust is baking, make the filling. I added the filling to a hot crust and put back in the oven. They are delish."

It didn’t make the golden brown look so much after 25 mins of baking at 350 so I took it out to feel it and it felt like it was done so I just went on with the recipe. \n\nAgain the size of the pan was an issue, even after going down in size a little, the wet mix barely covered the crust. \n\nI baked it at 350 for 20 mins and when I took it out it looked like my pic above. \n\nAnd just to touch on the size of the pan again. \nDid others have an issue with that too or are these supposed to be rather thin? \n\nThat being said, it actually tastes really dang good so at least the flavours"

The top cooked for 20 minutes and it came out perfect. I cooled it for about an hour on the counter, in the pan, then sifted some powdered sugar. It was delicious warm."

However, the thing that kept me from rating it a 5 star was the crust. Being the first time making it and only once before tasting it, it seemed the crust was doughy, not crispier like I thought it would be. However it looked like the picture so maybe I was expecting the wrong thing. I will continue to use the recipe and enjoy it."

I’ve made these a few times and this time I made 1 1/2 times the filling as other people recommended and they did not come out as good. They taste fine but it’s too much filling. I’ll be sticking with the original recipe again. Thanks!"

The flavor was more complex. The third time I doubled the custard, added 1/4 tsp of salt and 1tbsp of lemon zest into the crust, also double the lemon custard, and it had a right balance of custard and crust for us. So...I’d say just experience with whatever limes/lemon you have and be surprised. We do like the combination of limes and lemons. It didn’t taste like a traditional lemon bar, but it was more fun."

At least the bottom of the crust was browned. The lemony topping was extremely thin using the recommended 9x13 pan, whereas the accompanying recipe pictures showed that layer to be nearly 1/2 inch thick. Where I did differ from the recipe is at the end. Instead of dusting the lemon bars with sugar, I topped them with a layer of dark chocolate. While the finished bars were tasty, they were not thick enough or lemony enough. If I make this again I will double the lemony layer."
