I made a lemon glaze for it as well why it is a bit shiny. The end result was just sooooo good. I had to adjust my baking times and should have used a 10\"bundt pan but I used a 9\" but it is a hit. Half of it has been eaten as I am posting this. If not for our current stay at home I would have went and got my pans but for the foreseeable future we have to make do with what we have. Stay safe everyone!"

If you're using shorter pans like I did, I recommend using a lower temperature."

I used 3 tablespoons and it was plenty. half that would have been ok too.\n\nI cut out 1/2 cup sugar. Next time i may try substituting unsweetened apple sauce for part of the butter. \n\n1/2 cup lemon juice and 3T zest is about the juice and rind of 3 lemons (my lemons were small so a added just a bit of bottled juice to make up the difference)\n\nI used plain greek yogurt because that was what I had on hand.\n\nDO NOT OVERMIX. After you finish beating in the last egg and you mix the dry ingredients, Mix with a spatula or wooden spoon (not a mixer) just until it is all moistened\n\nI got 1 loaf and 7 muffins from the batter. check the muffins about 15-20 minutes. They will bake much faster than the loaf."

"reviewBody": "This loaf has real flavour and was easy enough to make. However, we found the texture to be quite dry. This may be down to differences between yoghurt in America and Britain (our yoghurt tends to be thicker and richer here in the UK), or something about the recipe itself. If I made again, I'd be tempted to try the recommended alteration of increasing the yoghurt and decreasing the butter, just to see if that helps. Overall, though, lovely flavour, nice crisp texture on the outside, and I love poppy seeds, so definitely not too many for me!"

Some like just a hint of lemon and then there are those who are like me - I want so much lemon that it makes me pucker up! So I add lemon extract and generously measure that 1/2 C of juice and zest. Also, I add a glaze of lemon juice and powdered sugar to the tops of the muffins when they've cooled a bit. My kids LOVE them."

The result was a very crumbly, overly sweet muffin with barely a hint of lemon. Having already promised to take these to a gathering, I had no choice but to try to quickly improve them, so I mixed some lemon liqueur with powdered sugar to make a glaze, hoping it'd improve the flavor (or would at least make the tasters tipsy enough not to notice the crumbly texture). The glaze helped a bit, but I will not be using this recipe again."

I added more lemon zest than the recipe calls for, and only a 1/4 cup of poppyseed. The bread turned out pretty moist, but I think next time I will use even less poppyseed. We didn't have any confectioners sugar to make an icing, so I used evaporated cane juice crystals (you could also just use white sugar) and flour as a substitution. First, make a flour and sugar mixture. Place 3/4 cup into a seperate bowl with 3 T lemon juice and 1 T water. Stir well. Add more flour/sugar mixture until texture has reached desired point. =) Serve over bundt cake. HINT: Tastes even better when served still warm from the oven! =) Enjoy!"

I was looking for a lemon loaf recipe that did not require extracts (almond, lemon, vanilla, etc) but simply lemon rind and juice, and I found it here. I did not change any ingredient or amount. My only change/suggestion is that if you want a lighter/fluffier loaf you should separate eggs - the yolks are added to the sugar/butter batter and the whites are whipped (to add air to the mix) and folded in just to incorporate at the end (when everything is already mixed)(do not overmix after you add the whites, otherwise this procedure has no purpose)."

I subbed in splenda for the two cups of sugar, fat free plain yogurt Instead of regular, and did half and half all purpose flour and whole wheat flour. I also used extra virgin olive oil instead of butter. I like an extra lemon kick also so I added a teaspoon of lemon extract along with the recommended amount of juice. I also cut back the poppy seeds to 1/2 cup. I also cooked it in a decorative bunt pan for kicks. Everything turned out great. Of course it will not taste exactly like the original recipe, but it is a good start to a more spot one low-cal replication. My friends and family enjoyed it. Next time I will try a bit more lemon extract and probably a half a cup less splenda."
