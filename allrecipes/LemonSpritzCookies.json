"reviewBody": "i grew up making spritz cookies. there is no need to use a mixer, its super easy and quick to just put on some gloves and mix by hand. you can feel the sugar and flours incorporate and it takes less time than to put together the mixer. i usually make 2 batches at once, but this time i made one. \n\ni have a new cookie press, and its been a while so i forgot the #1 trick to cookie press, do not overfill the cookie press tube, make sure there is room for the plunger\nsmells wonderful baking"
