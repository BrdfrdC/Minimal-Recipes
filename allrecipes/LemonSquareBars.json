I did end up adding the zest from 3 lemons to the sugar mixture, and I would definitely recommend it! They were tart, lemony, and not overly sweet. My bars only baked for 25 minutes, but they ended up being a little brown on the top. Next time I would check them at about 20 minutes. I cut these into bite sized pieces and dusted them with confectioners' sugar."

This recipe is probably 3/4 lemon and 1/4 shortbread and truly makes the lemon shine. Also I am lactose intolerant so I used lactose free butter and the bars still came out phenomenally!"

"reviewBody": "I make lemon square bars at least twice a month. I usually make an 8x8 size. I use the zest of one lemon and a 1/2 (yes, one half) cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice. So when making a 9x13 inch batch, that would be the zest of two lemons and 1 cup of fresh lemon juice. I (and friends/colleagues) LOVE the intense lemon flavor. The amount of sugar in the recipe keeps that amount of lemon from making you pucker. (I also prefer to cut cold butter into the flour/powdered sugar for the pastry crust...melted butter doesn't affect the taste, but I think the crust is much more tender and delicate this way.) Happy baking!"

I added the amount of lemon juice called for and added lemon zest from 1 lemon to it as well. I messed up and only used 1.5 cups of sugar in the doubled recipe (I usually like to use less sugar than called for, but I WOULD HAVE used 3 cups in this case) and I'm glad that I did because it was perfectly sweet enough for me. I can't imagine what 3 cups of sugar would have tasted like!"

I had to cook mine for 20. Also for those not used to making lemon squares, I didn't know that it was okay for them to still be \"jiggly\" in the oven and would finish setting once they had cooled completely.\n\nStill came out great though!

"reviewBody": "I love anything with lemon in it and this is no exception! I changed the recipe just a tad. For the crust, I used softened/room temperature butter, not melted. (5/8 c is 1/2 c plus 2 tb) I used a pastry cutter to mix all the ingredients. I sprayed a tiny bit of oil onto a pan that was smaller than a bit smaller than a 9X13 pan because with a 9x13, the bars were too thin. I lined with parchment paper and sprayed again, a must! The dough was very crumbly, but so easy to put in the pan. I just used my fingers to spread. I also added an extra 1 rounded TBL of flour to the custard because last time it came out too gooey. I only used 1 3/4 c. of white sugar. I cooked the crust for 20 minutes and then cooked the entire thing for 30 minutes. After the 30 minutes were done, I shut off the oven and let it stay inside for 5 minutes. Overall, a delicious recipe."

I did bake the crust longer than the recipe stated as every oven is different and I used a glass 9x13 dish. I baked until the edges were golden. The crust was a perfect shortbread. The lemon flavor was intense and perfectly balanced with the sweetest of the recommended amount of sugar. Only one piece left over that tasted even better the second day!"

I loved that I didn’t have to cut the butter into the flour for shortbread base, mixing it up was a breeze and the texture didn’t suffer at all. I added only one thing: the zest of the lemons I squeezed for the juice and it was a nice addition. I took these bars to a dessert fellowship at church and the platter was soon empty. Will definitely make these again and they are on the list of recipes for tea parties!"

"reviewBody": "The 2 star rating is for the modified recipe by other bakers. \n I found that if you are cutting the butter into the dry ingredients for the crust you need the 1 c. butter the recipe calls for. Otherwise, like my crust, there is not enough fat to keep the crust from cracking. However, if you plan on melting the butter then adding it to the dry ingredients per the recipe, the amount of butter can be cut down to 3/4 c.\n In my opinion, because the modifications (which I agree with) call for 3/4 c. fresh lemon juice plus lemon zest to boost the lemon flavor, the 2 c. granulated sugar which the recipe calls for is accurate. Reducing the sugar to 1-1/4 c. causes an imbalance of tartness to sweetness. The taste was akin to under sweetened lemonade. To save the lemon squares I made with the modified recipe amounts I made a vanilla icing to try to balance out the flavor.\n One last thing, the squares bake up pretty flat in a 9x13 pan. Either make 1-1/2 the filling or use a smaller pan."

This is my go to lemon bar recipe for sure!"
