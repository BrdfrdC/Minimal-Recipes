Changed out the white sugar for dark brown, and added in the juice of one of my lemons. Extra cinnamon, because cinnamon. I know there are those out there who scold for changing a recipe and rating it. Sorry. I use this site for inspiration, not as the police. I think if you need to follow recipes to the letter, great. I have been cooking for over 55 years, and always make changes, but give credit to those who inspire me."

First I doubled the recipe because one is never enough and someone in household doesn't like walnuts-I do. Then in addition to the lemon zest I also added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. I also added a bit of real vanilla extract, because it is so strong, only a bit is necessary. Oh! My goodness can you smell the lemon! Even when it's cold the aroma is so good, go ahead have another slice!"

Next time going to try subbing the sugar with agave, honey or maple syrup and a flax egg for the egg to make it vegan and definitely more lemon and maybe blueberries. The possibilities are endless!"

I also took the advice about making a lemon glaze for it which my husband LOVED, and he's not a lemon fan! The bread was moist and amazing. This is a keeper for me, thank you!!"

"reviewBody": "This was great! Nice lemony, warm-spiced flavor. All I changed was subbing half the oil for cinnamon applesauce, putting in a touch more cinnamon, and using lemon-flavored Greek yogurt (with some milk to yield the traditional yogurt texture). I also did as another reviewer suggested and made a glaze with lemon juice and white sugar melted on the stove. I may have waited until the bread was too cool as it didnâ€™t absorb very well and I had a ton of extra glaze. But since life handed me extra lemon glaze, I made lemonade! Just added water and ice cubes and stirred. Best lemonade ever. Happy baking (and beverage-mixing)!"

I think that's what my husband didn't like. I'll try again next time but leave out the glaze and just make one loaf."

I also made the light glaze mentioned by many reviewers, it was a nice touch yet I'm not so sure it is necessary. The glaze had such a light flavor that I bet the bread would taste the same without it. At any rate, I will make this recipe again."

These are very moist and dense and the glaze adds to that texture a bit, although tasty. I used less sugar. I used a green zucchini and a yellow zucchini squash. For regular MUFFINS these need to bake 23 minutes. 20 was undercooked."
