To make 2 quarts of lemonade, I used 2 cups of lemon juice and 1 cup of sugar. I brought the sugar and a half a cup of water to a boil then I poured it into a 4 cup freezer container and added a few ice cubes. When it was cool, I added 2 cups of lemon juice. I was able to make a total of five containers of lemon juice for the freezer. Now when I want to make lemonade, I simply defrost one container, pour it into a 2 quart pitcher and add cold water to fill up the pitcher."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is perfect. I had another, which involved slicing the lemon then pounding the slices to release juices, then pouring in water. I could never figure out at what point to remove the slices because the peels would cause the lemonade to get a funny taste. Juicing the lemons first is a better option, and you can add more or less sugar depending on your taste. When I pour the lemon juice in, I pour it through a strainer to remove seeds and pulp. Simple and perfect! Just how I want lemonade to taste."

NOTE: For those looking for an easier way to juice lemons, Grandma taught me to roll them on the counter while gently pushing down with the palm of your hand to get the juices flowing."

It's not brain surgery. I also made ice cubes from the lemonade the day before, and added them so it wouldn't get watered down. *UPDATE* We had some left over and tasted it the next day; it's true, the sliced lemons make it very strong, almost bitter. If you garnish with pretty lemon slices, be sure to add them just before serving, and remove them if you have leftovers."

Don't water this down with ice! Freeze some lemonade into cubes or just pass on ice. Thanks for the recipe, it was nice to make lemonade with my husband and then enjoy it's fresh-squeezed taste together!"

"reviewBody": "This is as simple as it gets. I read several reviews, and the idea of making a simple syrup is ridiculous. The sugar dissolve just fine in the water and with the lemon juice. Because lemons vary so much in size, just taste the darn thing to see if it needs more tang or more sweetness. I always add lemon zest too. This brings out the flavor of the lemon without having to cut into more fresh lemons. Also, it's fine to add lemon juice that isn't freshly squeezed if you think it needs more. We really enjoyed this, very refreshing and super simple."

Adding ice quickly dilutes the taste of the lemon flavor. With the modifications I made to this beverage, I would give this recipe 5 stars. This is a good basic recipe to start with, but with everyone's taste preference when it comes to lemonade, (sweet lemonade verses a tart lemonade) I think one should add ingredients that suits their taste buds."

In case anyone needs to know;\n\n4 lemons = between 9 and 12 tablespoons of juice.\n\nI used the recommended amount of lemon juice, and doubled all the other ingredients to make 2 quarts of lemonade. \n\nPS. A previous reviewer mentioned making the sugar into a syrup. Excellent suggestion. Makes for a much smoother drink."
