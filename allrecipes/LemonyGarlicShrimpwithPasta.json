I made it a second time and added cut up asparagus and sliced mushrooms, which made it more of a meal-in-one. Very pretty, colorful, and nutritious with the vegetable addition. This is easy yet elegant enough for company, making it a favorite in my rotation of dinners. You can change up your veggies, or leave them out, and change up your pasta. Very versatile."

I also used the zest of a lime, 1/8 teaspoon of hot pepper flakes, and 1/4 cup of lemon juice. I thought the lemon juice would be overpoweringly acidic, but it settled nicely, as it cooled. To help absorb the flavors, I undercooked the pasta and finished it to al dente in the sauce, adding a scant ½ cup of the pasta’s cooking water. Delicious and fresh tasting."

"reviewBody": "I made this twice -- the first time without brining the shrimp and the second time using the brining method. The first time it was fine -- tasty, well balanced flavors. The second time (using the brining process) it was a COMPLETE DISASTER! Unfortunately I made this when company came and the brining process made the shrimp so salty it was like eating a teaspoon of table salt with each bite of shrimp! We could not eat it. And before you ask, YES, I followed the recipe exactly and NO, I did not use too much or the wrong kind of salt or too little water, etc.. I brined it for only 2 of the 2-4 hours recommended, used Kosher salt, rinsed thoroughly in cold water afterwards, patted dry -- the whole shebang. Horrible does not begin to describe how badly the food was ruined. If you make this, skip the brining!"

Squeezing fresh lemon juice at the end really makes a difference when it comes to taste and it always comes out delicious! It's quick and easy too!"

"reviewBody": "Deliciously complex. Full of intense flavor and such a treat. I doubled the sauce to be sure I'd have enough. It was enough for about 3/4 of a box of pasta (but I like my scampi saucey.) I did about 1 1/2 times the garlic, and it was very garlicky but in a very good way. I definitely agree with the other reviewers who said to add the garlic after the wine/lemon. It would have been overcooked, otherwise. The zest was the perfect addition; I was surpised at what a difference it made. I may add just a bit less fresh lemon juice next time, because I had to add 1/4 tsp. of baking soda to cut how incredibly lemony it was. (Or maybe I'll just add the baking soda again, because it turned out amazing in the end. I don't know if it may have been) I didn't have flakes and used ground cayenne instead (half the amount). It was still definitely spicy that way. You could pair this with linguine or angel hair; it would be heavenly either way."

The shrimp tasted fine but nothing special, the sauce was definitely nothing special, and the amount of noodles should have been cut by half. I ended up picking the shrimp out of the noodles. The only thing that gave the flavor more depth is the chili flakes and we added Parmesan cheese. I will stick with my normal scampi and ceviche recipes."

Adding more salt to taste after mixing everything together. As long as you don't overlook the shrimp, this seems like a fail safe, easy recipe... with results that wowed everyone! I used thin spaghetti and a Pinot Grigio for the wine and a bit more garlic than called for. Perfect. Lovely for company."

I did not soak them in the brine. Instead I put them in the fridge to thaw the day before and then I added water and kosher salt for just a few minutes while I removed the tails. Very delicious shrimp. I used double the amount of garlic and sprinkled generously with parsley"

How could I resist? Cut the recipe to 4 servings and it was excellent both on the day I prepared it and the next day as leftovers via the microwave. Wifey said better than a 5 * restaurant. HOWEVER, please be advised that quantity of liquid ingredients ought to be increased by a factor of 2. I'll double the wine, oil, lemon and butter next time.\nPS: We used Dreamfields angel hair for our pasta as wife in on primal diet and I'm type II diabetic. It has been a Godsend."

It was very pepper hot and it seemed to be very parsley heavy. I personally didn't care much for it but my boyfriend liked it except the heat. I ended up pouring in some left over alfredo sauce to try to calm it down but that didn't help much. Next time I'll probably drastically cut down the ingredients and use the full amount of butter as well. My boyfriend doesn't eat butter so I tried to cut as much as I could out. I only used 1TBS."

Make sure you add the garlic only after you add the lemon juice/wine. Otherwise if you saute it with the shrimp, it will burn and there is nothing worse than burned garlic. For the pasta, I have made it with angel hair, regular spaghetti, and linguine and prefer linguine over all the others. It stays separated and doesnt turn into a big pasta glob. I also add several thin slices of lemon and fresh grated parmesan for presentation. It is absolutely one of my favorite dishes to make and only takes a few minutes to cook. It is excellent! Note: dont skip the step of soaking your shrimp in the salt water. It cleans them really well resulting in very fresh tasting shrimp."
