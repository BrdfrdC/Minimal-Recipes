I didn't have aluminum foil so I put the fish on pans and covered those with other pans in the oven. I also made some measuring mistakes, and I wasn't sure if the measurements in the instructions were for each fish or if the measurements were supposed to be equally spread out among the fish. I went with the latter assumption and I think that was the right one. Even with the mistakes the fish still turned out pretty good! I will definitely be making this again."

This may make it into the weekly rotation! \n\nAlso: I served it as fish tacos. Corn tortillas with a little cabbage and salsa. Also served with black beans and rice.

Not only was it simple, but the clean-up was easy and the fish was tasty. I CAN prepare fish!!!!! I'm so excited to have made this break-through:) It was a winner with my husband, and also for my 4 kids too...who are not used to eating fish (shocking, I know!). I used tilapia fillets from the frozen section of the grocery. I think I'll visit that section again soon!"

And then steamed? Our taste buds like the flavor and mouth feel fat contributes! It gives the fish a nice golden color too. So anyway, it was a no brainer for me to do it my own way - drizzled with melted butter and baked. I did use halibut, but in the interest of simplicity I didn't use all the many seasonings called for. Some fresh dill, garlic powder, paprika (for color, basically), salt and pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice was just what this needed. Cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of the fish, but in my case 12 minutes at 400 degrees was just right for perfectly cooked, perfectly golden and flaky filets - and much improved from the three stars I've rated this as written."

I added little bits of butter and a splash of white wine to each foil packet as others suggested in their reviews. I forgot to add the lemon juice, but it tasted wonderful anyway. My kitchen smelled so good while it was baking. I served it with rice and cheesy vegetables. Thanks for this recipe! I will use it again and again."

"reviewBody": "We liked this dish - although I did change a few things. First of all, I used haddock instead of halibut, and I scaled the recipe to 2 servings. I didn't measure any of the ingredients I used, I just sort of sprinkled everything on top. The only thing I omitted was the onion powder because I was out. One thing to watch for....some lemon pepper seasonings have salt in them - as was the case with ours. The combination of the seasoned salt and the (salty) lemon pepper was a bit too salty for us...but still good. I will make this dish again - very quick and simple to throw together on a week night."

Made this with one huge steelhead trout fillet for 5 people...used all ingredients except parsley and just adjusted to our taste...used more lemon juice and baked at 400. Definitely tasty. Probably better this way because all the spice went on one fish and didn't have to be divided...plenty of tasty flavor. Will DEFINITELY use over and over."

I don't have onion powder, so I finely diced some onion, and I used the juice of half a lemon and sliced the other half and placed over the fish. I also put about 1 tsp of wine in each package. \r\nI don't think I used enough fish, it made enough for 3 real size servings, but I kept the spices roughly the same. I used frozen dill and parsley instead of dried. I can't wait to make it again!! Thanks a bunch!!!"

Also, I took the advice of another reviewer and popped a small ice cube instead of using white wine and it was very moist."

I baked the fish (blue hake fillets) in a glass casserole dish, covering the top with foil, drizzling olive oil over the fish before adding the spices and lemon juice.
