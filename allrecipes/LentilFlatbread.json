"reviewBody": "I made this with green lentils since that is what I had on hand, but I followed the instructions otherwise. The batter came out much thicker -- more like a paste. After letting it sit in the fridge overnight, I melted butter in a non-stick skillet and spread the lentil paste to cover the bottom. On top, I sprinkled Everything Seasoning then cooked both sides until browned. They came out more like pancakes than crepes like Chef John's, but they were delicious!"
