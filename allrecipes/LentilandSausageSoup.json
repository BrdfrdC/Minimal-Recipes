Having two pots of the soup might have made the water levels interesting because it came out very dry. Super, super dry. For left overs I have been putting a ton of water in the microwavable bowl before heating it and that seems to soften the food, but not really create a soup texture."

Used a can of whole tomatoes instead of diced. Used ground Italian Sausage (which I think made the broth even better). And went with about 10 cups of fluid, including chicken broth. And most importantly I only cooked it about an hour and a half. Just check the lentils and carrots every now and then until they're as you like them."

I only used about 1tsp of salt, but added some Tony Chachare's creole seasoning at the end."

I used 4 cups of chicken stock and only 2 cups of water, since I added the juices from the diced tomatoes. I used smaller chunks of sausage, removed them after browning, adding them after the lentils , etc. I cooked it on the stovetop for about 1 hr or so and its perfect consistency. Ill make it again."

"reviewBody": "This is a really good BASE. It's not spicy at all if that's what you're shooting for.\nI started experimenting with it and added a little smoked paprika. It works beautifully with this base and gives it a much needed boost of flavor without adding much in the way of spicy heat. If you want a spicy dish, this could use hot Italian sausage instead of sweet. \n I gave it 3 stars because it's really not complete. It's woefully underspiced, and needs a lot of work. But it is a really good base for a new soup if someone wants to try something new and creative."

I had to add a lot more liquid than the recipe called for. I just kept adding water as it boiled down. I'm very happy with this recipe!"

Added dash of cumin and 1/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper for extra spice. Lastly, instead of tube pasta, used 2/3 cup of elbow pasta and turned out fine."

"reviewBody": "As with most soups with sausage I think much of the flavor has to do with the flavor of the sausage you start with since it imparts so much to the broth. I ended up having to add a significant amount of Italian seasoning, rosemary, and red pepper flakes to get this soup up to par. I cut the water back by 2 cups, doubled the sausage, chopped the carrots instead of shredding as many suggested, and ended up adding a can of tomato sauce to bulk up the broth. The lentils cooked far more slowly than did the pasta so by the time the soup was ready the pasta had disintegrated. All of that being said, I did follow the basic recipe and my family loved it."

Made it almost as written, but sausage doubled only because I was lazy and didn't separate pkg to half lb. wouldn't have mattered. so yummy and total comfort food. did top off each bowl with a decent reggiano (only cuz I had on hand, rare), very nice touch but not necessary for the \"this is a winner\" category at home. I wasn't excited about shredding the carrot but did it with a hand grater (would have taken longer with finding parts of food processer thing that in my house requires cleaning both before and after). I liked the shredded carrot in it. this is going into not only soup/lunch mix, but dinner too, and to bring to family. (I did not add the pasta)"

Like others, I increased the amount of sausage, and used both hot and sweet Italian sausage. I'm perplexed by the reviewer that could only taste sausage... I think the herbs, spices and seasoning were fantastic and flavourful. I used an immersions blender to thicken it a bit, and also tried the addition of a tater tot (as recommended on the site) when I reheated a single portion today. So good. And pretty healthy in the big scheme of things: lots of fibre and protein. Will definitely make again."
