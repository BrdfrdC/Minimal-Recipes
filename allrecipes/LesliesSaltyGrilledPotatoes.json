It was an easy way to cook potatoes with other things on the grill though so I'd use this recipe again."

I did nuke my potatoes for 6 minutes before grilling to speed up the cooking process (and they still took quite a bit of time, even with most of the time directly in the hot coals). I skipped the black pepper per personal preference and chose not to use the optional Italian seasoning. THANKS for the recipe!"

I think I may have had too much heat under these... because the salt butter came out a little burnt... maybe these... would be better if I had no heat under them what so ever... then I might get the \"tangy\" skins as other reviewers did... another thing that might have caused the burnt salt was I poke holes through the tin foil next time I will try just poking the potato and see if that helps... also i will try cutting back on the seasonings"

I did omit the Italian seasoning as a personal preference, but kept everything else the same including the measurements. These turned out to be the best \"baked\" potato I ever had. They were creamy, buttery and salty which made them, IMO, perfect. These will definitely be made often in my house. Thanks for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "These were pretty good and a different way of making them for variance on a potato. (And definitely better than a plain old boring baked potato.) I put the stuff on the foil in a big + shape and then folded up those sides first and it got all over the potato evenly pretty well - then I just packed in the rest of the foil around that. I also did poke the potatoes first cause it just seemed the stuff would leak out if I didn't. I used the Italian seasoning and I chickened out on the salt. I'm a saltaholic and they are called \"salty\" so what would I expect? - but even I chickened out on it and used about half. I tried to \"trust\" the recipe but it just looked like SO much salt. I think after the requisite hour they were done but not really quite as done as I'd expect a baked one to be - but it worked nonetheless."

"reviewBody": "I am giving this recipe 5 stars because I used the idea and the measurements, but I made them in a different way. I found it easier to use my hands to rub olive oil all over the potatoes. Then I dipped my hands in the seasoning and rubbed them all over the potatoes too. This gave me a nice even coating of salt, pepper, and garlic all over the skins. I put them on a baking sheet without foil, for a crispier skin, for an hour at 350. They were so good!!! I think next time I might just mix the seasonings right into the oil and use my hands to coat the potatoes to save a step! That way, halfway through baking, I could turn them and use a bbq brush to coat them again...mmmmmm!"

"reviewBody": "Nice twist on the average baked potato on the grill! I wimped out on the amount of seasonings, particularly the amount of salt, and for our tastes I'm glad I did. I only used as much of the seasonings as I felt comfortable with, probably half of what was called for. Along with the salt (I used Kosher), garlic powder and pepper I used a Tuscan seasoning blend that I just love, and the flavor came through noticeably but subtley. I pierced the potatoes before wrapping in foil but because of the butter did not pierce the foil - didn't want any of that good, seasoned butter to seep out! Unfortunately, the long cooking time on the grill turned the seasonings very dark, so much of it had to be scraped off. In the future I'll precook the potatoes in the microwave for a minute or two, then finish them on the grill."

I used my grill, using indirect heat by placing the coals along the front and the potatoes and corn in the back. I started them together about 1 hour before I added more coals to begin cooking the steaks. Timing was great...everything came out perfect. For desert, I made grilled peaches marinated in rum, spices and brown sugar (recipe pending). Excellent meal...Served with a great Shiraz."

Then I poured the mix into and empty seasoning shaker. Now whenever I make the potatoes, I spread a layer of butter on the tin foil and sprinkle with a good amount of my modified seasoning, and it tastes just right."
