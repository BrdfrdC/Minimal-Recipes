Add egg and vanilla, and beat to combine. Alternate adding flour mixture and buttermilk in small batches, beginning and ending with flour mixture."

"@type": "HowToStep"
,"text": "To decorate your whoopie pies to look like footballs, cut two pieces of Reynolds KITCHENS® Plastic Wrap about 15 inches wide and criss-cross them over each other to form a large X. In the center of the X, scoop all of your remaining filling and then gather the sides to push the filling down into a ball. Very carefully poke a small hole into the bottom of this ball so that you can pipe the football laces onto your whoopie pies. The thickness of your laces will depend on how big of a hole you poke into the plastic wrap."
