My husband asked if he could use a tortilla shell which I provided for him so he took the taco in the lettuce leaf and put it inside of a tortilla shell and he loved it he said this was the best meal we’ve had all week. I ate mine in the lettuce and it worked fine, again just a little messy."

I added sour cream and was going to include green chilis but did not have any. You could add just about any ingredient you would want, maybe even corn. I have already eaten it twice this week. Just a warning though - It is very messy when eating it!"

I, then, added taco seasoning to taste and little bit of cumin.\nI washed the lettuce leaves and dried with paper towels ( the whole leaves were too big for my salad spinner ). We skipped the tomatoes but served with a dollop of homemade guacamole, Cheddar cheese and chopped cilantro."

I bought 1 pound of ground beef, had the romaine leaves home already, bought a taco seasoning mix packet, a can of seasoned chopped tomatoes (seasoned with oregano and other relevant seasonings), and shredded cheese. It came out great! Didn't miss the flour tortillas at all. Great recipe and idea."

The shape of the romaine leaf, along with its sturdiness makes a perfect substitute for the carb watchers that don't want a tortilla shell. I'm not sure why the peppers and onions are sauteed and served as a topping other than to please a picky eater. I'd much rather save a step and cook them in with the meat."

(Alot of the reviews mention this being an \"April 2015 Recipe Group Selection\" - what does that mean?)"

Hubs asked \"Where in the heck is the taco shell?\" He ate four on the lettuce shell, so I don't think he really missed the flour tortilla! This came together quickly and was super easy to make. I liked the less calories without the shell, but added them to the meal with the side dishes! It was served with 'Quick and Easy Guacamole', 'Refried Beans Without the Refry' from AR and fresh fruit."

It didn't specify if you should add the water that you usually add w/ the taco seasoning, but I did add a bit just to loosen everything up and get it combined well. The romaine lettuce at the store didn't look too good, so I subbed some beautiful butter lettuce instead, which worked out great! Served with 'Easy Refried Black Beans' and Copycat Chipotle(R) Cilantro-Lime Brown Rice', both from this site. I will def be making tacos like this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)"
