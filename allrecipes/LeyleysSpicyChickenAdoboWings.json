I went ahead and did it and I'm not exactly sure what goes on in that process but what I do know is that I will be doing it from now on when I make buffalo wings. The skin got SO crispy and delicious. These wings were really good and had excellent flavor. My only complaint is that they did get overdone. I think the cook time could be reduced and yet still get the full flavor of the recipe ."

I shredded the meat and added it to a tortilla with some Louisiana Jalapeno Pepper Hot sauce - perfect!! I cooked the chicken on high in the crockpot for the first couple of hours to get the chicken cooked then I turned it on low for the rest of the day. Thanks for the recipe!!!"
