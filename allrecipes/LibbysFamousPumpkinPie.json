My nephew was asking for pie, he's only 7, I figured we'd do what we could with what we have. Excellent recipe for this! Tastes good, a little heavy, but cuts great, looks great, easy enough a 7 Year Old can make it."

As there was extra filling, I used the second pie shell in a muffin tin. Had enough for 6 \"tarts\". The next time I made my own pie crust, and it was much better. Ok, I made a mistake on the recipe and used a can of Condensed Milk, so it added an equal amount of milk and baked until a fork came out clean. Took and additional 10 minutes baked on a lower rack. Loved the richer taste of the pumpkin filling."

Based on other comments and tips, I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup granulated sugar, doubled all spices, added: 1/4 tsp allspice, an extra egg yolk, 1 T molasses, and 1 T flour. It was perfectly spiced, creamy, and most importantly it did not crack. I know tweaking recipes is frowned upon, but this is such a long standing recipe, I felt an update was appropriate. The original will always be a classic, but if you want to mix things up a bit, i encourage making a recipe your own. Happy baking!"

Also, I added a little vanilla. More advice: put it on a cookie sheet before trying to put it in the oven. The next time I make it, I'll buy a deep dish pie crust. While the filling fit into the regular one, it was impossible to get it into the oven without spilling some over the edge. It still came out great and my family loved it!"

But you guys gotta try this! So follow the Libby's recipe but only use half of the evaporated milk it calls for, the other half you'll replace with egg nog, add 1 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, and only use half the ginger it calls for and that's it! Your family and friends will come back for seconds and thirds I PROMISE!! Yummy!! (sorry mom but I had to share!)"

"reviewBody": "I use this recipe as a general guideline because I keep forgetting to write mine down. I swap the spices for 1 tbsp pumpkin pie spice and the milk for sweetened condensed and get rid of the sugar. I also make my own puree. This year I couldn't find sweetened so I used evaporated and the sugar. I made the recipe for 4 pies, filled each with 4 cups and I have a whole pies worth left over. It makes a good bit extra filling. Luckily I'm making 12 pies this year as take home gifts for family so the extra will save me some money on ingredients"

I saw this recipe and it just looked so easy and I have all of the ingredients except the canned pumpkin. I can make two pies for half of one good frozen pie at the store price. I just did the frozen pie mainly because it was easy. I used to make such huge Thanksgiving dinners but now it's just my husband and me. So our dinners are a lot smaller and things cost so much now it just makes sense to make it homemade. The reviews are good so why not... Happy Thanksgiving everyone!"

It is so much easier than messing with a regular pie crust and tastes even better! Also if you find that you have too much filling as some have reported, only use 3/4 of the can of carnation milk. I've learned to fill the pie crust about 3/4 full, then add the rest AFTER I have the pie in the oven. Just carefully slide the oven rack back into place once you have added the extra filling so it doesn't slop over the side."

Everyone raves about my mother's pumpkin pie and she has always used the Libby's recipe plus a dash or so of allspice...and still a nope for me. I have wanted so much to like it over the years and would take a taste here and there hoping to like it but just did not. So, there was no reason for me to even learn to make it. \n\nI was recently gifted two sugar pie pumpkins and, besides making roasted pumpkin seeds, I didn't know what to do with them. I didn't want to waste them and since my husband loves pumpkin pie (we met later in life) I thought I'd give it a try. I remembered my mom using the Libby's recipe so I searched and ended up here (after researching how to cook the pumpkin to make the puree). \n\nI don't even know where to start about the goldmine of amazing tips so many reviewers were generous enough to share! The tips I chose incorporate on my first ever pumpkin pie made it so amazing that for the first time in my life I not only liked it but loved it! My husband was a tad disappointed he had to share :) \n\nThank you so much to all who shared their tweaks, tips, family secrets!

I wonder if adding 1 to 1 1/4 C of sugar and doubling the spices would make it better. The consistency is fantastic, but the first bite it's just blah. And this recipe made 2 pies, not 1...which may explain why it might need ingredients increased. So, be prepared for that."

Gives a deeper, richer flavor which I, and my family, really like. If you choose frozen crusts...Marie Callendars deep dish are an acceptable replacement if you don’t feel like making a homemade crust. It’s good. \nHappy baking!"

I use lots less sugar - scant 1/2 cup dark brown sugar, more spices than called for, and a tsp of vanilla extract. I also layer chocolate chips on top just before baking (they sink otherwise), but that of course is optional. Because the filling is often quite watery as others have noted, today for Thanksgiving, I first beat the egg/sugar mixture with an electric hand beater to thicken it up, then mixed in the pumpkin and everything else with a mixing spoon per usual. It turned out beautifully!"
