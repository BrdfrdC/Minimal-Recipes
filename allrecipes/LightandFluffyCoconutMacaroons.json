I added more extract and it was still too dry so I added whipping cream. When the dough was wet enough to stick together, I baked them. Easy recipe, maybe don't use drier coconut. My coconut felt dehydrated. I had just made lemon bread and had 2 egg whites to use, so score, time for macaroons!"

These turned out great. I made 3 batches assuming 1/4 cup of egg white =2 egg whites. I used a Tbsp measure to drop onto the pan, struggled a bit as they were falling apart and tried using wet hands (like I do with meatballs) and that worked really well. I have a convection oven so I dropped the temperature to 300 F. and 20 minutes was perfect! Parchment paper for 1 pan and a silicone baking liner made for easy clean up. Yes I'd make this again. I hope they will freeze well."

I ended up beating 2 extra egg whites and sprinkling a little water... maybe 1/4 c for the double batch... of the mixture until it was just starting to feel sticky. I also used parchment paper.

"reviewBody": "I had to weigh the coconut as I didn’t have a 7oz package. If my scale was correct, it calls for 2.5 c of coconut. I used unsweetened coconut, and maybe the longer thread and sweetened coconut would add some moisture. I had to use a gluten free flour as I was making them for a friend who hadn’t have gluten...used Cassava flour which is supposed to be very close to wheat flour. I used a cookie scoop to form them and had to pack the batter into it and carefully transfer it to the sheet. (Like others, I used parchment which worked well) after fighting to get the first three cookies onto the sheet in one piece, I added another egg white which helped somewhat but still had to be very careful. The baked cookie was very dry and not chewy. I don’t like giving a bad rating to a recipe as I know little changes can make a difference, but I am disappointed with this recipe."

They were nice and fluffy so I proceeded to add in the entire bag of coconut flakes. (7 OUNCES LIKE IT CALLS FOR!) Big mistake. I proceeded to add the remaining ingredients and attempted to place them on my sheet pan and when they were done cooking, as expected, didn’t stick together.\n\nDesperate to satisfy my sweet tooth, I still ate some and tossed most in the trash. Very disappointed and it is rare I get on these things and leave reviews but this recipe is so flawed I had to get on here and warn people, don’t make this ! There are much more better coconut macaroon recipes out there and I’m angry at myself for wasting ingredients on this one."

His feedback was that the flavor was good, but he wished they were a little bigger and had more uniform crispiness around the outside. They are moist and look pretty. He keeps eating them though, so something must be right!"

Also I used about 1/4 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon almond, and a little more coconut than what was called for!"
