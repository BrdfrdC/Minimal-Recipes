"reviewBody": "Thank you for this recipe! It was deliciously simple. I was able to make it with hardly any fuss. I sauteed mushrooms , onions and 2 cloves garlic yesterday in preparation and precooked my shell. I used less spinach , still layered unto shell. Added some sauteed mushroom mix on top layer after pouring egg, heavy cream &amp; light mayo mixture. My preference. I prefer it to be rich &amp; creamy. (Another recipe stated I should pre-cook shell) It still was fabulous! The crust was crunchy and perfect for . Covering with foil was smart so it didn‚Äôt burn. I uncovered it after 30 mins. I placed foil around crust so center could bake thoroughly. Next time I will try without precooking, maybe. I loved the crunch ! I do recommend add some pepper to taste. The cheese I used was some imported swiss and a creamy Hoffman‚Äôs sharp cheddar. It was so delicious. Please remember to follow your instincts while cooking for yourself &amp; family. Make life delicious, comforting &amp; special.üåª"

I saute fresh spinach and onions, double the recipe using 9 eggs. Perfect amount for two quiches. If I make only one, 4 large eggs seem too few however 5 are too many. My next attempt will be one with no crust for low carb eaters."

You could substitute regular potato slices for the crust if you like, either will absorb enough of the moisture from the cheeses that it will not be wet and runny on the bottom. I have always disliked a regular pie crust with Quiche until I figured out that the reason for its use was the absorb the moisture from the cheeses. It is much better with the potato crust and I suspect healthier as well. And since our household is vegetarian for the most part it fits our lifestyle."

It got mixed reviews from my family of 3. \n My daughter and I (fans of spice) found it a bit bland. My wife (not big on spice) raved. A dash of Tabasco helped. \n If I make it again, I'll try adding some peppers and maybe some extra mayo."

I also used fresh baby spinach I had on hand, reconstituted whole milk, a pinch of nutmeg (saw this in other spinach quiche recipes), and chopped cheddar cheese slices. I love spinach so it still wasn't too much spinach but it would've been perfect with two extra eggs! Very tasty indeed! I want to add bacon and other veggies next time."
