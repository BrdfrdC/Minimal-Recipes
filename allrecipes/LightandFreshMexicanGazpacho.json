My coworker gave me a bunch of homegrown tomatoes too which i had to usr soon.I had never tried making gazpacho so looked around and found this recipe. I agree that it's hard to review a recipe if you don't do it to spec but anyway I followed this recipe but omitted the clam sauce ( because I didnt have it) and added finely chopped zucchini. I think it turned out great and will definitely make again!"

"reviewBody": "So delicious and pretty!!! This gazpacho would be great for a summer party. 1/2 recipe was more than enough for my family of five, with plenty leftover, so I reduced the peppers to 1 each. Everything else I halved. Use barely ripe avocados, because you don't want them to be mushy. The gazpacho had just enough spicy heat to compliment the vegetable flavors. My husband raved about the taste, and he had to bring the leftovers to work almost every day after we had it!"

"reviewBody": "There is a bunch of chopping involved and this is pretty expensive to make (especially if you add shrimp as I did) but the freshness and flavor shine through and it is worth every bit of time, effort, and expense that goes in to it. There is a wonderful combination of flavor and texture. I especially enjoyed the crunch of the celery and cucumbers. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that for whatever reason the avocado's got lost in the dish and at $1.50 a piece, that was a shame. I served this more as a Mexican Cocktail with saltine crackers for dipping instead of in soup form. I will definitely make this again but will cut back on the bell pepper and add another avocado. Try this one out and you will not be disappointed!"
