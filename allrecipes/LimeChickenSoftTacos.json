Added cumin, chipotle chili powder, smoked paprika. 3 stars for the recipe as a starting point. 5 stars for me for my remix on this recipe."

While some recipes turn out strong, overpowering the meal this was a nice blend of compile flavors and more a hint of lime. Gave it four stars because we did add a dash of chipotle chili, which took it up a notch. All around keeper for taco night!"

I used 4 cloves of garlic because we LOVE garlic in our food. The lime and vinegar give the chicken a nice tangy, fresh taste. I added some avocado to my fixings bar as well. My family devoured this so I will definitely be making it again!"

I first boiled the small cubes of chicken then drained the water and saute the chicken with the remaining ingredients I increased the sauce with 2 limes and omitted oregano for cilantro. I didn't have red wine vinegar on hand so I used apple cider vinegar instead. I added a little extra garlic. I omitted the tomato and the salsa for dietary reasons. I used romaine lettuce finely sliced using mostly the greenest part of the lettuce. This was a delicious and nutritious meal. Thank you!"

I substituted cilantro for the oregano, using both dried and fresh, added cumin, finely chopped onion, both red &amp; jalapeno peppers as well as a generous \"splash\" of tequila to the marinade. After marinating the chicken, then sauteing and chopping it up (I sauteed it in thin slices first ) I added the marinade into the chicken and let it simmer together for about 10 minutes. I followed the suggestion from Cindi M for the Baja Cream (1/4 c. mayo, 1/4 c. sour cream, 1 Tbsp. fresh lime juice, + some finely grated lime peel &amp; chill to meld the flavors). It was a great addition, along with finely sliced cabbage, instead of lettuce, chopped tomatoes, grated cheese &amp; salsa. They were a HUGE hit at our house and will be a part of our regular rotation from here on out. Thank you Marissa Wright for the great recipe!"

I sliced the chicken thinly and sautéed it, then added the juice and spices. I served it as a deconstructed taco in a bowl, with basmati rice with lime zest and parsley, (not a cilantro fan), black beans, cheese, olives, tomatoes and green onions on top, with guacamole on the side. This was a great meal and I’m making it again tonight!"

I may also add a tiny amount of cumin as well."

"reviewBody": "I'm not one to leave reviews but couldn't pass on this one! Like LadyJayPee, I substituted Cilantro for the Oregano which was perfect. I tripled the sauce &amp; marinated chicken in 2/3 of it for a couple hours. In the skillet, the sauce thickens/caramelizes which makes the flavor REALLY come out! I removed the chicken, leaving the scrapings from the sauce in pan, added a little olive oil &amp; some remaining sauce with sliced sweet onion and red &amp; yellow peppers and sauteed until slightly browned. Added the chicken back to skillet with peppers and warmed it all together then served on warm flour tortillas with sour cream. Eating it all like this, it did not need salsa or really anything else! The red wine vinegar, sugar and cilantro give it the best flavor. Another reviewer thought it had some kick, but I didn't really think it did. The kick, if any, is from the vinegar so lighten up on that a little if you'd like. Definitely will make again, thanks for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "YUM! Great flavor! DISCLAIMER: I don't review recipes unless I follow them closely, with only minor alterations (using jarred garlic vs. fresh, for example). As an Allrecipes user, I get so frustrated with \"It was great! (or awful)... I changed XYZ to ABC\"-- you read the review and it's not even close to the same recipe. That being said: REVIEW: I made this for my daughter's volleyball team potluck of 35 people. It is refreshingly different from standard shredded chicken recipes (so tired of 'salsa chicken'). I made 7.5 lbs of chicken and used Allrecipes 'servings adjuster'. I used bottled lime juice instead of fresh, Mexican oregano instead of regular, jarred minced garlic instead of cloves. I cooked it in a Ninja cooking system on medium stovetop, then flipped it to low slow cooker until I had time to shred it. I didn't think there was going to be enough liquid, but after it was cooked &amp; shredded, the liquid was perfect--not dry or sloppy. A nice alternative to standard \"cumin/green chili/salsa\" chicken recipes. If you are looking for a strong, spicy, \"taco\" flavored recipe, this isn't for you. It's delicate and fresh with great blends of flavor, it's healthy and low sodium (no packages!), assuming you have it on a salad instead of a tortilla. We added toppings (hot sauce, cilantro, etc.) and served per our personal preference. This has been requested by my teens to have on hand for lunches and after school."

I made a marinade using the ingredients up to the garnishments by increasing the stated amounts by 4 and then placing the cubed chicken in the marinade for 1 hour. I then poured the entire contents in a sauce pan and sauteed until the chicken was thoroughly cooked. Instead of red salsa I made a mango avocado salsa to replace the red salsa and used mild cheddar cheese. The taste was unbelievable?"

(It is equally good and I rarely have green onions on hand, but I usually have regular onion.) \n\nI think the cooking times in the recipe are a little long. I just cook till the chicken and onions are almost done, add the sauce ingredients, then cook a little longer till the sauce starts to thicken."

Whisked all the ingredients in the ungreased (yes ungreased!) crockpot (oh I didn't have green onion so I used about 1/4 cup diced brown onion), added the cubed chicken, mixed to coat the meat, then cooked it on low (untouched) for about 3 1/2 hours. I was tempted to add more liquid since it looked dry but not necessary as the chicken juiced up nicely. And, I actually liked the oregano, but maybe it's because I used Mexican oregano? Served with flour tortillas, lettuce, tomato, jack cheese, sour cream and tomatillo salsa. It's a keeper, will make again. Thank you Marissa!"
