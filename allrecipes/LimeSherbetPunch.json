"reviewBody": "This is ABSOLUTELY THE VERY BEST PUNCH I have ever tasted!! Unlike so many of the cloyingly sweet punches, the lime sherbet gives this a little tartness, but it's still a sweet punch. It's perfect for a shower, any party or celebration, or to share with a friend or neighbor on a hot day. Everyone loves it, comes back for seconds (or more!), and several people ALWAYS ask for the recipe. It's quick and easy to make and tastes more complex than merely three ingredients. Do yourself (and your guests) a favor, and make this delightful punch for a real treat! It's a real winner!!!"

It was pretty sweet with 3/4 of the can. I also couldn't fit both Sprite bottles in my punch bowl- maybe that's why it seemed sweet with the amount of pineapple juice I used. Will be using this for more parties!"
