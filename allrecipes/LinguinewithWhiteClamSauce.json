"reviewBody": "First time to ever make a white sauce. We were having our friends over for dinner. In making the sauce I went a little heavier on the garlic, I believe I used 3 cloves, and next time I may use an additional 1. We have a local seafood store so rather than canned chopped clams, I used 1/2 lb chopped clams, and approximately 14 ozs of clam juice, along with the white wine that it calls for. I used Pino Grigio, as that is what I always have on hand. 1lb of fresh scallops and 1 lb of fresh cleaned and deveined tail on shrimp. I tossed all of the seafood in for a few minutes at the end that was all it took to cook them. Everyone loved it, and so so easy!!! I put it all over 12 ozs of Barilla vegetable spaghetti that we all love. I will definitely make this again"

Saute lots of garlic, olive oil, little butter for 2 min then chicken broth (when have a whole chicken we boil everything we don't eat including all vegetables that would go bad, spices and freeze in 2 cups portions) and white wine med heat for 3 or 4 minutes with cover on. We added fresh little neck clams with cover on. When partly opened take top off and add fresh homemade pasta that's pre-boiled 3/4 the way (not hard to make 1 egg per one cup of flower water to finish let dry ) fresh parsley on high heat till pasta is cooked. Then add locatelli cheese to top and serve. Butter Italian bread is an essential"

I cooked the pasta for 8 minutes and then scooped it into the skillet to finish cooking, this allows the pasta to absorb the flavour of the clams. After tasting I thought that it needed some acid so I added some freshly squeezed lemon juice. Overall a good recipe and one that I will make again."

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe for a visiting friend who makes a wonderful clam sauce linguini herself. She raved over it, and we both thought it was delicious. This was the first time I had ever tried a linguini with clam sauce recipe, and I followed the instructions exactly, except that I used 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1. Since there were only 2 of us, I used only half a package of linguini noodles, which was exactly the right amount. I also used Bar Harbor Sea Clams, which are larger and more tender than some other minced clam brands. **Tip from my friend: after you add the garlic to the heated oil, let it simmer for a minute or two, then turn the stovetop setting down to 1 and you can leave the garlic and oil for up to half an hour to have a pre-dinner glass of wine or tend to guests before adding in the clam juice and other ingredients.** Thank you Karena for sharing this wonderful recipe."

I also saved 1 C of the pasta water to add to the pasta/sauce mix, if needed. I made a full recipe of the sauce and used 8 oz. linguine noodles.

Cooked sauce about 12 minutes to reduce the extra liquid before adding clams. Next time I'll cut back on the salt because my wife and I both thought it a bit on the salty side."

The guests enjoyed the meal and I really liked the video that came along with the recipe!"

We just like a little more sauce on pasta. I also used 2 (6.5 oz) cans minced clams and 2 (6.5 oz) cans chopped clams because the grocery store only had two cans of minced left. I thought it was a nice mix. I can't wait to make this again!"

Just before draining the pasta (al dente, please!), reserve about 1 cup of pasta water. Just before serving,add the pasta water little by little in order to get the right consistency. This dish should not be dry. Sprinkle with parsley and a good grated cheese. Now you have a good dish!!"

I think next time, I'll grate a little lemon peel into the wine reduction to give it more of a standout lemony flavor. (I love lemon in seafood.) Served with garlic bread and the rest of the wine I bought for the recipe. It'd be a shame to let it go to waste. ;) Thank you for sharing!"

I used 1/2 stick butter and a drizzle of olive oil, threw in 6 cloves of minced garlic &amp; let it saute a few, added 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes and let that toast a minute (next time I will add even more), next the wine &amp; let that reduce a minute or two before adding the clam juice and then the juice of half a lemon. The other changes I made: I cooked the pasta a minute or two short and finished cooking it in the clam broth and didn't add the parsley (less than called for) til the last minute. I served it with french bread with butter and a delicious riesling. So good I'm gonna go have my second serving right now!"
