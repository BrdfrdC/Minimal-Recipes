It had leftover cooked chicken, broth and petite peas from the freezer, white wine from an open bottle and some mushrooms in the fridge, a pound of pasta, an onion, some garlic and Italian seasoning from the pantry, some cooked bacon, and some Italian parsley from a pot on the patio, and some grated Parmesan from a wedge in the fridge. I asked him how it was different from Carbonara, and he said mine was not as creamy. Well, I didn't have any cream, so I thickened the broth with a flour slurry.\""

Perfect! No grit or graininess and super creamy. Thumbs up from the whole family!"

I did double the sauce because I was serving 6, and I wanted to make sure I had enough sauce to coat the pasta well. I also cut the chicken in smaller pieces and cooked in the pan instead of cooking and cutting later. We left out the peas because we don't care for them, and made sure to add enough salt and pepper. It was delicious! Serve with a side salad to lighten it up and it was awesome!"

"reviewBody": "Pretty good, but I felt it was missing something as the recipe is written. I added mushrooms, as some other reviewers did. It needed more salt and pepper, and I sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top. Still felt like it needed a little something, but wasn't able to quite put my finger on it. Both adults at dinner liked it (including me), but my 9 YO did not. Will definitely make this again, as it was very good, but will experiment a bit with the recipe."

When the pasta was done, I used about 1/2 cup of the salted pasta water (still warm) to the sauce mixture to thin it out a bit more. Great flavor all around (I used a lot of black pepper because, well, I love it haha)!"
