A few things I did differently: I used about 75% peeled russet potatoes and 25% un-peeled baby red potatoes, 50% sour cream and 50% cream cheese, and cooked and crumbled the bacon the day before. They. Were. Delicious. Ended up with about 6 generous quarts that I kept warm in the crock pot."

If you do make it, I suggest adding the sour cream slowly to your liking. And maybe adding a bit of horse radish to give it an extra kick"

The second sub I made was baking it in the oven for about 10 or so minutes. I love the flavor! The sour cream is amazing its like having mashed chips lol the flavor still blended nicely with the minced garlic I added despite only having about half a container from taco night. I'll definitely be keeping this recipe around."
