So for Valentine's Day I thought I'd give him what he wants, and hopefully shut him up for a while. ;-) \nI can't really say anything negative about this recipe because it was so flippin' great! I am not much of a beef eater, and I always leave the steak cooking to my husband, but this gorgeous piece of meat came out so tender that it almost does not need to be chewed. Perfection. I would probably double the amount of lobster next time I make it, but that would be the only thing I'd change. Thank you for a great recipe. I am sure he will be asking me for it again in the near future."

Keep in mind that grilling the steaks takes a little longer than in the broiler directions included in this recipe. I half cooked my steaks and then started the lobster which was the perfect amount of time. I also used 1/4 tsp of garlic with my butter and doubled the amount of lobster. Delicious!"

My only change was to add a little white wine to the butter while I sauteed the lobster meat. I had the camera out to take a picture, but I couldn't wait to dig in, I completely forgot to take it :) ....OUTSTANDING recipe!!!"

"reviewBody": "Thank you. Thank you . Thank you. I am not a steak eater. My husband and kids are so deprived because we always eat chicken and fish and sometimes pork. This year I wanted to move away from the usual turkey or ham dinner for Christmas, so I thought I would try this. I was very afraid that I was going to spend all this money and end up screwing up the recipe. Steaks always come out tough for me. I was sure I could manage to make tenderloins tough too. But it was perfect! We now have a new tradition. Now I can't wait for next Christmas to do it all again."

To make it an all in one dish, I made spinach sautéed in garlic/mushrooms and fresh parmesan cheese to layer in between filet and lobster. Incredibly easy and rewarding!"

I used 1 slice of thick cut bacon per filet but next time I will use 2 since the cooked bacon unwrapped and wouldnt wrap around completely. Some adjustments I made to the recipe: I used Steak Seasoning for the filets and only a pinch Old Bay (after reading a few reviews). Also, I melted 1/2 cup of butter for the lobster and used the excess to top it off at the end."

If you're really aiming for medium rare, may want to start checking at 6 minutes depending on thickness and position in the oven."

I made this last year for Valentine's Day and it is definitely \"worthy\" of the occasion. I did (and will do again) about everything the other reviewers recommended...lighten up on the Old Bay, add a splash of white wine to the lobster, don't cook lobster \"til done\"...cook it \"till almost done\" as oven finishes it off. Truly a simple and remarkable meal....and I cannot believe I forgot to review it last year!"

The butter was just the right touch to keep it juicy and it was excellent to rub the lobster in the butter because it also had the flavors of the beef mixed in!
