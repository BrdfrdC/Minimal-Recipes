I used bay leaves not pickling spice because I didn’t have any and I have no clue where to find the cloth recommended. I doubled the liquid mixture because for 3 pounds of meat it did not seem like enough. I also added a tablespoon of brown sugar to the liquid mixture. I cooked for the recommended time and then let simmer at lower heat for additional time and it tasted amazing. I will make it again with chicken."

Served it over jasmine rice and sautéed onions and zucchini in a buttery cream sauce on the side."

Leftovers were great too! Will make again."

Into a tea ball (cheap easy and reusable) and it came out great. The crab boil is available in the spice isle and has about 1 cup of mixed spices in it, so there is plenty left for the next time I make this, which will be soon!!! The next time I will probably use a whole cut up chicken with bones and skin as I found that the chicken was slightly dry after 1 hour of cooking. Thank you or this recipe, I love it!!!!"
