"reviewBody": "This isn't your mother's shoe-leather London Broil done in a pan of water in the oven like my mother used to make when I was a kid! I used to despise eating any meat or roast she would make as it was always so dry and tough. I vowed to never put my family through that ordeal and learned how to cook. I was skeptical about this recipe since the marinade is/was so simple. I am used to adding tons of spices, wine, etc., and rarely stick with a recipe. BUT... this easy-peasy recipe caught my eye. My London Broil turned out phenomenal! I ended up marinating it for 24 hours as I just wasn't able to get back to making it within 5 hours. During that 24 hours of marinating though I did flip it and rubbed it down each time (about 4 times in all). I thought I'd try making it in a skillet on the stovetop. I used very high heat since I have an electric stove (blah). I did the recommended time of 5 minutes per side. It was perfecto! This was a really good deal for just $12 bucks (fed 4) and was a decent quality of meat from my local grocer which is known for the quality of their meats. I will be making this more often."

I will make this marinade again but omit the oregano."

The next time I made London broil I slightly modified the marinade by adding 1 tbs of red wine vinegar, substituting barbecue sauce for the catsup, and marinated the meat in a sealable freezer bag, adding about 1/2 cup of sliced raw onion. Cooked it the same way and O M G, what a difference! The meat was noticeably more tender and the flavor of the marinade was simply outstanding. Served it with seasoned roasted baby red potatoes and cole slaw and grilled corn on the cob...This is a new family favorite!"

"reviewBody": "LOVE this recipe. Our family's favorite meats used to be rib eyes, New York Strips, and lamb chops. This London Broil recipe has ALMOST become our favorite now above all of those! And, I find this cut so much easier to fix for guests. I just double-quadruple the recipe as needed.\n\nHere's the thing, though. SO many reviewers on here are recommending using flank steak. We have done both cuts (flank steak and top round) side by side several times, and our family MUCH prefers the TOP ROUND over the flank cut. \n\nI follow AmazingRibs.com reverse sear beef and lamb cooking instructions, so I NEVER hot grill/broil any type of beef. I slow roast this cut (and all my beef steaks, roasts, and even lamb) on a rack over a pan at 225 degrees until the inside temp of the meat is about 115 degrees (usually takes about 30-40 minutes). I then sear both sides on a very hot searing burner outside until the outside of the meat has the \"proper-looking\" sear - usually between 1-2 minutes per side. This makes an outstanding juicy, tender cut of medium-rare meat (be it a thick steak, roast, lamb, etc.). Cooking this recipe, using the labeled \"London Broil\" meat rather than flank steak, makes a really SCRUMPTIOUS meat!"

Allowed meat to marinate for 48 hours. I used a ziplock bag. \nBroiled my meat about 7 to 8 minute\nEs per side and then wrapped in aluminum foil and allowed to set for 10 minutes before slicing. I’ve tried London broil many times and was never happy with results. This was the best. Will make again."

Cut the four pounds into four one pound servings. Wife and I ate one serving. One serving's in the refrigerator. Two in the freezer. Thanks to all you great cooks. From a beginner."

London Broil is a very classic dish made with flank steak, as called for in this recipe. The \"London Broil\" you refer to, is an invented supermarket cut designed to get rid of hard to sell inferior cuts of beef."

I put one in each zip lock bag with half of the marinade (which is really one batch of the recipe). The only things I did differently is that I added lemon juice because I had read it in the reviews instead of meat tenderizer, and added fresh chopped garlic. FANTASTIC!"

Since it started raining here, I broiled the beef in the oven on a rack. 8 minutes per side and that was perfect timing. Well done on the ends and medium in the middle. Very flavorful! But was a little tough. I'll make this again."

"reviewBody": "Since London broil is a tougher cut of meat, I decided to add a little more acid to the recipe by putting 2 teaspoons of lemon juice and 1 teaspoon of worchestershire sauce in with the rest of the marinade ingredients. I also let it marinate for approximately 36 hours. My husband grilled it on high on our gas grill for about 8-9 minutes per side and we let it rest for about 20 minutes. While my son really liked the flavor, he still found it tough. My husband and I loved the flavor so much, the toughness wasn't a huge issue for us. This will probably be my go to recipe for this cut of meat from now on."

I will not make any changes the next time I make it. I also grilled some corn on the cob, placing them on the grill about 5 minutes before the meat, and the timing was perfect."

Was pink in middle and done perfectly at 140 when removed. Let it rest 5 min. We had it sliced - no steak sauce needed! And second night as French dip. 6 plates out of a $7 piece of meat - wow. Thought was a fluke so did again - lol - just as good! For 2nd night that time sliced thin and simmered for just a minute in saved juices. Oh my yum. Can't wait to fix again!"
