I marinated it for only 2 hours. Baked it for 20 minutes at 350 degrees, then broiled it for 5 minutes on each side. I turned out to be very tasty and surprisingly tender and best yet, it was so easy! My family loved it, and my kids even asked me to make it again for the next day. I didn't but loved that they loved it. Will make again soon."

Only difference in marinade was I substituted fresh garlic for garlic powder. After marinading, I brought it to room temp and then grilled it on my Webber grill ... 10 minutes direct, flipped it and then 10 minutes indirect. My London Broil was almost 3” thick. I have an instant read thermometer and I took the meat off at 127 degrees and let it continue cooking while it rested. We like our beef cuts more rare and this was PERFECT. See photo. This recipe is a definite keeper!!"

Still turned out very good.\n425 for 15 min and finished had 350 until temp was right.\nWill do this again hopefully with more time for the marinade to work.\nAlso the juices loaded up with lots of carmelized onion made a good sauce to use with it."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe. To add an acid to help tenderize this very lean cut of beef, I added 1 tablespoon each of: red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, and worcestershire sauce, also added 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme. Even the marinade smells great! Next time I'll add about 2 tablespoon of lemon juice. Marinaded in gallon ziplock bag overnight. Cooked over low-medium covered grill, and careful to not overcook. Reapplied marinade on first flip on grill. Goes great with rice or potatoes and broccoli, asparagus, or any grilled veggies. Simple, easy, savory, and delicious. Only 4 stars because as written the recipe lacks the acid which is really needed for this cut."

I cooked my 1.5 lb London Broil steak for 8 minutes per side in the oven broiler then let it rest for 5 minutes. It was a delicious medium rare when I cut it. Very flavorful. As an other reviewer suggested, I boiled the marinade and served it as a side sauce but it was too salty and I would not do that again. The meat, all by itself, was really flavorful. Good recipe."

"reviewBody": "I made no adjustments to the recipe, but I missed the part about piercing with a fork, and I ran short on time so I marinated for just 5 hours. The steak was very good, though just a little too salty, and it was tender enough, but probably would have been better if I had followed the directions and fork-tenderized. I will definitely use this recipe again, but I will either use less soy sauce or will use low-sodium soy sauce to cut down on the saltiness."

"reviewBody": "Awesome marinade for london broil. I had just a bit under 1/2 cup of soy sauce, so I used a bit of worcestershire sauce to fill in the rest. Also added 1 extra clove of garlic. Used my Foodsaver to marinate the meat to cut down on time (marinated for 2 hours in the fridge and it marinated beautifully). Grilled for 8 minutes per side over a medium heat, came out perfectly medium rare/medium. The amount of juice that the meat produced was amazing! Never had london broil that juicy before! Side note: london broil should be cut as thin as possible, against the grain, JUST SAYIN'! Thanks for the simple, but oh-so-awesome recipe, Char!"

"reviewBody": "I was excited about this recipe because of all the great reviews and I made it exactly as written with the exception of adding two tablespoons of lemon juice, but was WAY too salty. It does have great potential, however, but you MUST cut down on the soy sauce and maybe also use low sodium soy sauce. I will try this recipe again using 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce and 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce and I'm sure it will be excellent. The acid (lemon juice or vinegar) is absolutely necessary to tenderize this inexpensive cut of meat and it must be sliced very thin and across the grain. As some others have said, if you run a grilling fork all the way through the meat a good number of times you don't need to marinate it for as long as 24 hours. My finished steak had great (but too salty) flavor all the way through the meat with just 5 hours of marinating in a gallon size Ziplock bag. I grilled it on med/high heat for 6 minutes a side (grill top UP - you don't want to bake it) for a perfect medium rare, but all grills vary so your times may be different."

After reading the comments on this I thought I would give it a try for our 20th Anniversary dinner. Let me say, it was perfect. I followed the recipe to a T and was thrilled that I actually like medium rare london broil. The marinade was so good and I only had an hour to let it sit. Can't wait to use this and let it sit over night. It was cooked to perfection. Thanks for the great recipe and turning my husband back onto london broil."

The flavor was incredible. 2 days in a ziplock bag did the trick. We love spicy so I added two, ok three dashes of cayenne pepper for some kick. Will be making this with flank steak soon. I do think the meat was a little chewy, not tough so I may try vinegar nx time."

Midway through, I put the meat on the hot side for a good sear on both sides, them back onto the cool side in foil until it was done. Since the marinade was now \"cooked\", I used it as a sauce for the meat. Combined with the dripping from the foil it was very tasty."

"reviewBody": "Culinary experts have proven that marinades are ineffective in tenderizing meats; they really only infuse flavor. What *does* tenderize meat is salting or brining. Salt denatures proteins, making them unbind and form looser bonds. That's why this marinade works well - because of the soy sauce. The salt in soy sauce acts like a brine, helping the meat retain moisture during cooking and making it more tender. So you definitely don't want to reduce the amount of soy sauce in this recipe, as it is the tenderizing agent. But you also don't need to marinate for as long as eight hours; you will achieve very satisfactory results by marinating for one hour."

Also, I let it marinate about 36 hours, then removed from the fridge to come to room temperature before placing on the grill. I've learned room temperature beef will cook up more tender because the cold meat will \"shrink\" when the heat hits it. I like my beef pretty well done, and hubby likes it medium. So I grilled on high about 7 minutes per side on high heat, and the ends were perfect for me with the center being nice and pink for him. It was perfect. Thanks for this one!!!"

That's definitely a thicker, tougher cut of meat (it's not flank steak) and needs a longer marinating time, about 48 hours. I used this marinade for 1 &amp; 1/2 pounds of steak. I low sodium soy sauce, olive oil vs. veg., chili sauce vs. ketchup, and added a splash of white wine vinegar. I also cut the amount of pepper in half and added 1/4 tsp. of kosher salt. I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it go, turning it every so often and rubbing the marinade into the meat. After grilling I cut it against the grain and it was not only tender and juicy, but delicious!"
