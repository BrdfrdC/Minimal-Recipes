Unfortunately, neither of us thought it was better than our typical filet, which is just a very easy overnight marinate in a ziploc bag with Soyaki and a couple of other seasonings. It was still quite good and worth adding as a once a year variation from our typical filet. All of the effort involved took it away from 5 stars though."

There were only 2 of us so I started with only 1 1/2 cups wine and adjusted the rest from there. Simmer to reduce and finish with butter. Spectacular. Cooked the beef in a cast iron pan and finished in the oven. Served beef on top of parsnip purée (Tyler Florence’s recipe) drizzle with the sauce, and topped with baby arugula lightly dressed with olive oil and lemon juice, s&amp;p. Boyfriend licking"

I cannot express how insanely tender it makes the beef and perfectly balanced the flavorings are. I had some slight hesitation about the oyster/soy sauce, but it works very well. I've been making it for about 6 years now; my fiancee begs me to make this every Valentine's Day. \n\nI don't change a thing in the recipe, which is rare for me! Just be careful if you broil the steaks; the canola oil has a low smoke point and causes a LOT of smoke, especially if you like the steak well-done!"

The flavour of the marinade didn't really please us either, we couldn't really taste the wine. Perhaps using these ingredients in smaller quantities would be pleasing. The meat was obviously tender, but then again, if you are eating filet mignon, it should be."

I will also say that my husband and I are both beef \"simplistics\". We love the taste of beef all by itself. We generally grill with a bit of salt and pepper and call it good and it generally if FANTASTIC just like that.

One thing extra I did was to cook the marinate after I removed the steak from it and I thickened it with corn starch in a little bit of water. It makes an excellent gravy to drizzle over the steak when you plate the meal, or you can toss some on sauteed mushrooms and cook for a few minutes as a nice side to go with the steak. I even drizzled some of the sauce over the baked potatoes."

I followed the recipe almost exactly except we didn't have any charcoal so we put the tenderloins in the oven on broil (approx 500 degrees) for about 7 minutes on each side. I let them rest for another 10 minutes before dolloping the butter on and placing them in the 200 degree oven. They came out perfect -pink inside but not too pink. (The tenderloins I used were approximately an inch thick) My husband and daughter both loved this recipe. I served the steak with garlic mashed potatos and steamed asparagus. I will make this recipe again but next time I promise to take a picture. Thanks, Penelope Holmes for a fabulous recipe!"

The second time I wasn't able to get the Filet Mingnon and the butcher suggested New York Strip as a substitute cut of meat, we were let down. . . the flavor just wasn't there, even after three years we could tell it wasn't as good as the first time and I made it exactly as the recipe reads did not change a thing. I will definetly make this again but ONLY if I can get the Filet Mingnon steaks!!"

I reserved the marinade to make a quick pan sauce for the steaks to give diners a choice. I sauted 1 cup of sliced mixed mushrooms in butter, then removed the mushrooms, and added the marinade, reducing to 1/2 (you might need to add 1 tsp of cornstarch to aid it) and added back in the mushrooms. Many of my guest put both the mushroom sauce and the butter on top."

"reviewBody": "I was turned on to this recipe 4 years ago. It was AWSOME. I made it again a few years later and it was not so good. I pondered the difference in the two occasions and determined it was the freshness of the Filet. The first time I was working at a Steak House and brought some home, the second time, I went to my local grocery and picked up some mass produced pre packaged \"filets\". Don't skimp on the ingedients, you get what you pay for. Yes, play with the time marinated, but not the ingredient. Use real butter, use real Burgundy. A $10 to $12 bottle works fine. If you want something different, if you are looking for something different, then Keep Searching for something different. This is a very good meal, don't change it and then say it wasn't that good."

I was looking for a really special filet recipe for my boyfriend’s birthday, one that I wouldn’t use on a normal day. It was good and we enjoyed the filet, but it was not significantly better tasting than any other good simple marinade that I have tried. It mostly tasted like burgundy wine and soy sauce (a typical simple marinade). I don’t think any of the other ingredients made a difference."

"reviewBody": "LOW FAT ALERT: You can cut way back on the canola oil, and it still turns out GREAT! I eliminated the wine/butter sauce completely. Instead, I put additional wine in a saucepan and added fresh sliced mushrooms. After coming to a boil, a package of \"fat free\" brown gravy sauce was added (with a cup or so of water because the wine cooked down). Kroger sells a \"beef blend\" herb package (oregano, chives, and rosemary). I chopped up some of that and added it to the gravy mixture. I let the gravy come to a slow boil and then let it simmer while the steaks cooked on the George Foreman grill. I served the steaks (which I marinated for 45 min.) with baked potatoes and steemed broccoli. The mushroom/gravy mixture was TERRIFIC with the meat and potatoes. My husband ate with a look of rapture on his face... he said that this was one cow who \"definitely did not die in vain\"."

The ONLY thing I changed was that I didn't want to purchase a shallot for the final butter mixture, so I just used all green onion. I will also add that I made extra on the butter/wine/green onion and served it to be spread on French bread. This was positively sensational, and I disagree with it being a lot of extra work. It was a snap to prepare. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes, a green salad, the French bread, and of course... the left over Burgundy wine! Everyone raved, and I was pleased beyond words! It did make quite a bit of marinade sauce, but that will be fun trying it out on different cuts of meat and the George Foreman grill. Yummmmmmmmmmmmm!"

Being oil-conscious is probably a bit silly, given the fact that this is filet mignon, after all, and it's slathered with delectably decadent burgundy butter...but cutting out a cup of oil does make the marinade a bit stronger. A nice, long, overnight marinade works well to let the fantastic marriage of flavors develop. Like a good seduction, it's worth the wait. \r\n; )"

I like oyster sauce very much (used extensively in Chinese cooking) however it does contain MSG so be forewarned as many people must avoid MSG added to food. My husband really enjoys this. I would recommend scaling the recipe way down if only making 2 or 4 steaks as it yields a whole lot of liquid. I also think the added butter/wine topping for serving, while adding a very rich buttery sauce, can be easily ommitted. To cool the liquid down faster, I put it in the freezer for a short time, and I also don't marinade longer than an hour or two max as I find the flavor becomes too strong."

He (ever the meat-and-potatoes man) was in heaven.\n\nBabs--oyster sauce is a thick, brown sauce that would either be in the condiment or Asian food section of your grocery (I had to ask for help finding it in my mid-sized grocery, but they had it.) 'Dynasty' was the name of the brand I found. You can also get it online.\n\n(3/3/2006) I'm still making, and LOVING, this recipe, and I just wanted to add--the marinade freezes beautifully, so I make the full batch of marinade and freeze half of it (as I've never made it for 8 people). Also, my latest addition to the meal is putting sliced baby Portobellos in the marinade (just dip them and then take them out, the marinade soaks in QUICKLY) after I remove the steaks. Saute them with a little marinade until tender and serve on top or on the side of the filets. Heavenly!"

Is it thick, thin, red, clear? My supermarket had never heard of it and even when I called an oyster company, they couldn't tell me what it is. The best the gal could recommend to me was clam juice so I used that. Perhaps that had something to do with the flavor, but it certainly didn't ruin it. Will make again if I can find oyster sauce and will not marinate so long.\r\nTHANKS AMANDA!! I'LL TRY TO FIND IT AND GIVE THE RECIPE A TRY ONCE AGAIN!"
