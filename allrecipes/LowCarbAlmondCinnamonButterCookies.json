I did half of the sweetener that the recipe advised and could have gone lower due to the slightly sweeter taste from the almond flour. Also, not mentioned here is to chill the dough before rolling the cookies, it makes it easier to work and more likely that they will hold together after baking."

The flavour was very nice and I liked the pillowy texture for the most part, but it didn't hold its shape too well‚Äî had a tendency to break and fall apart if I picked it up by a corner instead of cupping it in my palm. That may be partly my fault for using a bit of brown \"sugar,\" but regardless I think I'll use a pinch of xanthan gum if I revisit this recipe."

"reviewBody": "This was easy to make and the cookies are filling and tasty. I made the recipe as-is although I did take another person's suggestion of adding almond extract, about one tsp. The only thing I thought was it could use maybe a tiny bit more swerve because the sweetness level wasn't quite where I would like it. However I think maybe next time I might roll the balls in a cinnamon/truvia mixture, either that or do a light drizzled glaze made with confectioner's swerve, water and almond extract. We shall see."

Next time I‚Äôll do a few slivered almonds because I think that would really balance the yummy flavor and add just a little more crunchy texture that I prefer on a cookie. This left them just a tad soft for me, but overall, yay a Keto cookie y‚Äôall!!"

"reviewBody": "I did like this recipe. Although as a cookie, I felt it was lacking a little. I do think I would prefer these as a thinner cookie, to get more of a crunchier texture. I made them a little thicker, since I wasn't for sure if they would spread or not, and they had the mealy almond texture on the inside that I do not prefer. They needed a little something extra, maybe a cream cheese frosting on the top or some nuts on the inside would be a good addition. As the recipe is written, these would make an excellent low carb crust to a cheesecake, lemon bars, or other dessert. I will be using this recipe as a crust next in my low carb desserts. Thank you for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Made last night, so simple. The sweetner I used was 1/3 Now brand Erythritol and 2/3 Betterleaf powdered Stevia, I dislike the cooling effect of Erythritol over slight bitterness of Stevia, first time I‚Äôve split like that, read other recipes that suggested and it worked. I had neither effects from either one. Would like tad sweeter next time, I was just under measure on both sweetener because I was afraid it'd be cool/bitter with my concoction. I even cooked them in my toaster oven as my big oven is under the weather, came out perfect, didn‚Äôt flatten as in pic, even though I flattened as stated, but didn‚Äôt press with fork for two reasons, I wanted some volume so don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôd flatten them to begin with and also I was raised with the crossed fork press was only for Peanut Butter cookies growing up, so I‚Äôma gonna keep it that way, seems everyone is fork pressing every flavor . My house smelt divine for hours after, I let them cool, kept one out and stored remaining in container in fridge, got more than 12, got 16. I used Costco almond flour, Kerrygold butter, Egglands Best Eggs from there as well, such a bargain. I could see where non-keto‚Äôers would enjoy and not know. Also I prefer room temp or slightly warmed to bring out that warn cinnamon vibe. Great for the holidays or not, get an awesome cookie and with the smell of Christmas in the house, win-win. Happy Holidays y‚Äôall."

If you like your cookies sweet, I suggest you use more than 1/2 cup. I don‚Äôt like things real sweet &amp; I thought these were perfect. I did cook these for the minimal time &amp; I made them slightly bigger than 1‚Äù because I like cookies really soft. Spray your fork with cooking spray before crisscrossing on cookies to avoid sticking. The only thing I might try next time would be to add a little almond extract. Overall, my husband &amp; I both liked them very much. Which says a lot since he never eats or drinks anything with artificial sweetener in it!!"

These are very good after a night in the fridge. Straight out of the oven or even cooled to room temperature doesn't seem to allow the flavors to come through. Also, the texture becomes more ' cookie-like' after refrigerating. I will make these again when following a keto diet. Husband, who is NOT on keto diet, seems to like them too... he ate almost all my cookies."

"reviewBody": "I made these cookies using Splenda granulated because that's what I had. The cookies are good, but the Splenda leaves an aftertaste. Strangely enough, after spending a few days in the fridge, the aftertaste was almost gone. I have since discovered, when comparing Swerve (Erythritol) to Splenda (Sucralose), that Splenda is about 30% sweeter. So next time I bake these cookies with Splenda, I will use about 30% less. That might help with the aftertaste. Because it wasn't specified, I used unsalted butter. Next time I'm going to try it with sated butter to see how that affects the flavor. Also, I thought that 12.7 grams of carbs per cookie listed in the nutrition info was very high, so I did the research and crunched the numbers. With Swerve there are 2.1 g of carbs per cookie. With Splenda granulated, there are 3.1 g of carbs. That makes more sense."
