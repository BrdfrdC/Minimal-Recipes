SO FILLING AND PACKED WITH VEGGIES - definitely a keeper! Thx for submitting!! ***edit: ive made this now several times - fam actually likes it better without shrimp (which is cheaper, so yay!) - fam also didnt prefer slimy ocra &amp; i just use diced toms and its great - but the rest of the recipe continues to be as above - so delicious - i now double it and freeze individual servings."

"reviewBody": "I usually follow All-Recipe recipes exactly. But I make a great traditional Jambalaya with rice using the recipe I got from a famed New Orleans chef, Austin Leslie. So I transposed his ingredient choices into this one and ended up with a very good low carb version.\n\nFirst, real New Orleans dishes usually start with what they call the Holy Trinity. That's onion, celery and garlic. So just add a cup of chopped celery to the onions when you sautee them.\n\nInstead of crushed tomatoes, Austin used canned whole plum tomatoes. But for extra spice, drain 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes with chiles. Works great and tastes better. Austin doesn't use bell peppers...I used one.\n\nFor people who can eat carbs, this is even better spooned over rice. I love having the option to eat it either way."

I was searching for something hearty and filling while doing keto as my husband gets discouraged when our dinners are a little lighter (makes you more prone to want to snack). This was very filling and excellent flavor. We had plenty of leftovers which was great for lunches. My children age 7 &amp; 10 don't like a lot of spice so I scooped them a bowl before I added the creole seasoning!"

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe for my wife and I and pretty much followed it to the tee with only a few small exceptions I can think of. The only things I changed, were the hot sauce, and chicken. I instead used 1 tablespoon of chipotle chili powder. It gave it an extra nice kick. I also used raw, unbreaded chicken tenders instead of chicken breast. But this recipe did turn out great and tastes great. Also, the directions are misleading. They do not tell you to cook the chicken and shrimp ahead of time, and instead just assume that you either have cooked the chicken and shrimp, or are using pre-cooked products. I cooked the chicken and shrimp in together on low heat using kosher salt, black pepper, and Cajun seasoning."

It’s great for all those low carb diets out there and people trying to get in a lot of protein. I added mushrooms to mine and made it with red and orange peppers instead of green. Mine made 12 cups total and a 3 cups serving only has around 400 calories and over 50 grams of protein ????"

I may add celery next time but it’s not needed, this is a very hearty and filling dish."

And although this recipe isn't nearly as complicated as the original family recipes , it's a great quick alternative!\nI'm a big low to no carb cooker and look for new recipes all the time and this was perfect!\nI didn't have a few of the ingredients and had to substitute the best I could.\nI used mushrooms and red and green bell pepper, instead of zucchinis. And turkey sausage, and frozen shrimp from trader joe's. I didn't have any chicken so just added more sausage and shrimp.\nI also didn't have cajun seasoning on hand so just added my own seasonings separately: salt, ground pepper, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, dried basil, and smoked paprika. \nIt was more soupy at first, but I simmered it for a while and was just the right amount to serve with brown rice, which absorbed the liquid and made it so flavorful!"

Also, I like to add red, orange and yellow bell peppers in addition to the green bell peppers, a skimpy 1/4 cup of rice and skimpy 1/4 cup of orzo. This dish is absolutely awesome on cold winter days. The spiciness warms you from the inside out. Love this recipe!!"

I also cooked some rice on the side for those in the family who were not doing low carb. It was a big hit by the whole family, what little leftovers there were were gone the next day.\n\nAlmost as good as Bubba's Jambalaya (my favorite but not low carb). Highly recommended."
