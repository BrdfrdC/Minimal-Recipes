I drained the pan well and added 1 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp smart balance for the gravy. I added a little sour cream, but wish I hadn't as the flavor was more like stroganoff (pretty good tho!) I froze some and that will make a simple future dinner. I love when people build on recipes in reviews because it gives me a lot of ideas."

"reviewBody": "Found this recipe in my email feed this morning. I have to say, I get a bit too excited when I have every ingredient listed on hand. So lunch was decided. Just before noon, I took the ground beef I had bought yesterday out of the fridge. Two and a half pounds of it. It was a lot and it’s just me. I opted to take advice from others, not by doubling the gravy, but by cutting the steak ingredients in half. I typically brown ground beef and freeze it into small portions for future recipes. I began this process while chopping the onion. The smell of frying meat led me to pour myself a glass of red wine. (Am I alone here?) I prepped the steak mixture and immediately realized I added two eggs. The horror! I have no more meat to add now! I can’t even blame it on the wine! I was already committed so I decided to make the best of it. I used my mom’s cast iron skillet (for the first time ever), thinking her cooking skills may save me. I carefully transferred the steaks to the pan. It looked like a mess. But it smelled like heaven. I managed to maintain the shape of one steak for the money shot. And then I tasted it. Holy smokes this stuff is amazing. The onions were perfectly done. Layers of flavor in every bite. Now there probably was some residue from the many bacon-greased batches of fried okra, or from the liver and onions that my older siblings were forced to eat before I came along, so don’t expect yours to be as yummy as mine. Odds are, yours is gonna look better."

I accidentally tripled the Worchestershire in the gravy, but otherwise kept the recipe the same. Had no issues with patties coming apart."

Due to health issues made a somewhat leaner version, using lean ground beef, light margarine instead of butter and 1% sour cream. It was amazing! \nUsed a bit of beef broth while cooking the meat to keep the pan from burning but otherwise followed recipe and came out perfect. I kept the meat in a 225F oven to keep it warm while I cooked the sauce. Will make it again"

I skipped the eggs as I figured that would make them too fragile to turn. I did not use any kind of carb at all though. I skipped the 7 tablespoons of butter and used 1/2 of the onion soup package instead. That way I dumped a bunch of calories and it was healthier for me and my heart. You will have to figure out how much of the onion soup to use. Very tasty."

This is now a new thing at our house. We did use Greek yogurt being careful to just add a little at a time to the not too hot pan) instead of sour cream and low fat burger. I have no doubt that the original ingredients make it even better (including the higher fat beef the footnote mentioned) and I will try that sometime. We are just losing some of the holiday weight we put on. Thank you Chef DJ!"

(Did not use the butter, just sauteed onions in drippings, then sprinkled the flour over, mixed in and let cook for couple mins, then added broth and brought to boil to thicken) Only used 1/4 c sour cream, which was plenty to give creaminess and a little extra flavor. Easy to prepare, and made a good weeknight meal."
