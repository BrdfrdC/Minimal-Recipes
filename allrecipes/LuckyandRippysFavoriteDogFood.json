The picky pup dances when I get it out to feed him now. I mix it with a little kibble and freeze it in smaller packages. This recipe lasts about 4 weeks for us."

So I switched it up a bit and have had no more problems with burnt rice ever since. First I add water to the pot and heat until boiling. Then I add the frozen veggies and stir. When it stars to boil again I add the cut up chicken. Finally, when that starts to boil I add the rice. Stir briefly and then put on the lid, lower the heat, and simmer for the 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Works great!"

"reviewBody": "This is a great meal. We put all fresh vegetables bought from the local road side stands of neighbors and the amish. We included zucchini, yellow squash, celery, carrots, and broccoli. Instead of 6-1/2 cups water, we used 4 cups bone broth we made from the chickens. Bone broth has a LOT of vitamins and minerals, including glucosamine and chondroitin. We also used only 3 cups Long Grain Brown Rice instead of white. AND we have always given garlic in small quantities to our Labs. This keeps away fleas. I read all the time where others say garlic is toxic to dogs. Well, it IS also toxic to people, yet we eat it. As long as you do not overdue it on the garlic, it is fine. An article I read said one clove for a large breed. Clove sizes vary greatly! We put in about a teaspoon for the entire amount. My one dog is diabetic. Since being on this food her insulin levels have been 150 points lower. She still gets insulin but less. They are now on day 2 of this dog food. I also entered the nutrients used in this recipe into a nutrient calculator online. It gives most of what they need per day. We mixed with a 1/4 amount of their grain free holistic dog food for added crunch. As a snack to keep teeth clean, we give raw carrots. We still will give them a supplement. Human grade for works just as well as pet grade per my vet.\n\nUpdate: 11/18/18 - We are nearly approaching month 3 of this dog food. Our dogs look FABULOUS!!! When we make this, as another gentleman said, rice wil"

"reviewBody": "Rating 4 stars only because I wish the recipe had specified a little more. It's a good basic recipe as a bland diet for when our fur babies’ tummy's are upset. I boiled 3 chicken breasts (boneless and skinless) for about 30 minutes--covered the breasts with more than enough water. Shred/Chop/Mince the chicken breasts in a chopper (I used a Ninja) and transfer to a large bowl—not the dog bowl…a bowl large enough to mix in the remaining cooked ingredients. Cooked white rice (jasmine) over low heat for 20 minutes in a separate pot using liquid from boiled chicken (rice to liquid measured according to recipe). NOTE: I would have used brown rice and cooked longer in more liquid, but I ran out of brown rice. Boiled frozen mixed vegetables (carrot, peas, green beans) in same pot, in remaining liquid/broth for about 10-12 minutes over medium-low heat. Mixed vegetables might contain corn, I removed the corn by hand. Used a slotted spoon to skim out the vegetables into my Ninja blender and pureed it. Transferred veggies to large bowl and mixed in the rice when finish. I put the servings for my dogs in a 2 separate bowls in the fridge to cool down faster. This recipe made a lot, which is great. I ended up mixing in about 1.5 cups cooked white rice."

"reviewBody": "This is a great starting point. My husband and I have cooked for our dogs for over a year we make about 20-25 pounds at a time and freeze in 1 week portions. We use chicken, squash, or yams some kind of veggie, brown rice, hard boiled eggs, pearl barley and we save all our egg shells and grind them up and add the powder. We also add an omega-3 oil made for dogs daily. I am going to try something new couscous, it's high in protein and fiber in place of the brown rice. We also give them kibble and plain yogurt with each meal. Our dogs are in excellent health. We just had our 1 year old lab spayed and 16 days after surgery you could barely see the scar! Good luck feeding your best friend the best food!"

"reviewBody": "After having my dog break out in a rash from corn allergy, but trying to save money on the food. Did my first run of it. Comes down to about a dollar a day to feed both my dogs. ( 70 pound and 15 pound) I read it was recommended to feed 1 cup per 35 pounds body weight, if that helps anyone. I plan on rotating chicken and fish. For the fish I used tilapia, can tuna, pack of salmon. I did about a little under half meat then the other half was white and brown rice, potato, eggs scrambled in olive oil, carrot, and brocolli. They absolutely loved it. And I feel so much better feeding them quality food instead of spending 15 dollars on a cheap bag of dog food that's practically all corn, what a rip off."

This recipe is a low cost and decent substitution. Also, mixing this with his regular food has made food last twice as long. My dog has severe skin allergies and he hasn't broke out with this food! Not recommended for a good regular diet as Kim stated, but if you need cheap and temporary food, good choice. :)"

"reviewBody": "Using a rice cooker makes this even easier! This is just what I was looking for, thanks for posting it. I have an easy suggestion...I made the rice in my rice cooker, browned the meat (I used lean organic ground beef) on the stove with just a teaspoon of granulated garlic (for fleas) and water to make a broth, then added the meat mix to the rice cooker when the rice was done. Add frozen veggies (I buy unsalted peas &amp; carrots, broccoli, and green beans separately bagged so I can control the amount of corn and broccoli :) and keep in rice cooker until everything warms together. Put in containers and when it's all cooled down, stir in a chopped hard boiled egg or two and some fresh chopped parsley. OH LA LA! I do, of course, mix this homemade goodness into their tried and true kibble. They need that too. AND, now don't laugh, my husband takes this for work with some Old Bay seasoning. How can ya lose?"

I add some of her dry dog food to this and she loves it, so does my other dog. I have noticed that her hypoglycemia is less intense than it was and I have only had them on this for 1 week. thank you."

However, I am afraid to give a supplement to my pets because of the numerous recalls. How do we know if they are made in America with American processed ingredients? Is there a human grade supplement to give them?"

I put it into freezer containers and freeze it, pulling it out as needed. The next time I make it, I am going to use low sodium chicken broth instead of the water for a little more flavor, although my dog LOVES it just as the recipes call for it to be made."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is so good, and very similar to what I cook for my dog every evening. You can add wheat germ to this recipe, and substitute the chicken with ground round (or other very lean cut of beef) or fish (either farm raised catfish or talapia). My dog loves this rice, meat, veggies meal. Try Wacky Mac noodles instead of rice (or tri-color rotini) for a change. If you are worried your doggy is not getting enough nutrients, buy some pet tabs and give along with meals. My dog eats a small amount of broccoli in the vegetable mix he gets, but he has never had detectable gas. I throw it all into an iron skillet, thinly coated with olive oil, and cook for about 12 or so minutes. Capi says 'Yum'!"

However I hope the submitter does not mean it for a steady diet because there are vitamins and minerals that dog's require and are not in the recipe. This fact has been stated on the news when they are talking about the Pet Food Recall. However, like I previously stated it is good for a change of pace/treat meal."

I have a 7-yr old border collie and a 14-yr old australian shepherd with Cushings disease and they love this. I often will use ground beef if I don't have ground chicken - but be sure your dog can handle the extra fat without any accidents in the house!"

"reviewBody": "Congratulations on thinking about our \"furry kids\". My two bichons love this diet. They've been on the exact same thing for 6 years.Sometimes I change it around with turkey or beef liver. At the suggestion of our Vet, I sprinkle in the garlic from one capsule I buy at the health food store. Its just enough to keep the fleas away but won't hurt the \"furry kids\". Also, to protect joints a bit of bonemeal after the cooking process. I steam the rice and boil the chicken separately. I use a frozen veggie mix with corn, green beans, carrots and peas. Broccoli, brussel sprouts and cauliflower should not be used because it can cause gas in dogs. Thanks for sharing this with everyone LuvsNow17"

I have my dog on an all natural diet. She 'basically\" eats healthy foods that we eat. Everyone that is in the know is aware not to feed certain foods to dogs. I recommend a book by Carol Boyle on natural food for dogs. I have used this way of feeding my dog for two weeks and I can already see a positive difference."
