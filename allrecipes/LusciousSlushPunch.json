I froze the mixture in 4 Tupperware containers. Set out the frozen slush to thaw a couple of hours before use. I used 1 liter of 7 up and 2 Tupperware containers for the first fill of the punch bowl. This is an excellent punch! Enjoy!"

"reviewBody": "I have made this recipe for years! \nFirst off, I follow the recipe by make these modifications. Instead of the lemon juice I add a can of frozen lemonade. I also add strawberries, blueberries, Sliced lemons and oranges (remove peel if you want), only use 1 1/2 c sugar. \nUse a large ladel to pour into gallon zip lock containers 2 is perfect I double line mine to prevent leaks! \nOther reviewers said it was completely frozen- it will be! You have to let thaw for around 3 hours before serving! If that still isn’t enough time put in microwave! You want it to be unthawed enough to take a fork/ knife and chop up in punch bowl to create a slush. Then pour your ginger ale, I got a flavored cranberry ginger ale and regular and plan on using both. The recipe is very flexible to your likes, so you can play around with flavors, ingredients, and fruit!"

The last time I made it, I decided at the last minute (a few hours before the event) to make some extra in case the first batch wasn't enough. The problem was that I didn't have strawberry Jello or lemon lime soda on hand. I did, however, have some pineapple Jello and ginger ale, so I used that instead, and it was also VERY yummy. So, my point is that this recipe is totally delicious as written, but experimenting with different flavors can also give you great results."

Decided to make it again, with a twist and used cherry jello instead of strawberry (I prefer cherry to strawberry flavorings) and the used squirt/grapefruit soda with it instead of lemon-lime. It was a game changer! I love both recipes, but I tend to make it with a twist more often. I use it for every birthday/shower I host. This week I’m hosting a gender reveal, so I’m going to try following the recipe with a blue jello and a blue colored juice instead of orange juice so I can have two slush punches to represent both genders."

Beats the regular \"cranberry punch\" that everyone uses as a fall back. I have made it 3-4 times (doubled) and used it at over half a dozen functions. Sometimes it is a slush as it was meant to be sometimes it in mostly melted with small punch chunks still frozen and sometimes i need to keep it cold with ice. It has been a hit no matter how I serve it. Make it you won't be disappointed. Only change I made was I use Splenda instead of sugar. My best advise is just follow the recipe don't short cut somehow the chemical reaction of cooking the jello is the \"it\" factor. Delicious."

I took it out 1 1/2 hrs. before serving and added 7-up right away. I had to work at it a bit as it thawed, but it turned out perfectly slushy. It was served outside on a 90 degree day and stayed slushy until it was gone. Everyone loved it."

Got it out of the freezer an hour and a half before serving time. Mixed it with soda, which was cold, probably should not have been. After sitting out for a good 45 minutes, still not thawed enough to make a smooth slush, was a very chunky slush. Ended up adding 2 bottles of soda to one block of slush to get enough."

"reviewBody": "This was very well received at our church function. I used 1 cup of sugar instead of 2.5 and it was the perfect amount of sweetness. I used 4 large Ziploc bags, filled them by lining a pitcher with a bag (it help to have 2 people do this part because the ziploc bag can slide down), and froze them on a cookie sheet overnight . Took them out 2 hours before serving. The first batch I did have to break into medium large sized pieces before putting in the punch bowl with the 7 up about 1 hour before service, and at service it just required taking a large spoon and breaking some of the pieces into smaller chunks and stirring. The second bowlful about 30-45 min later was perfect texture without doing anything. This will be my go to punch recipe. So easy because it is prepared ahead and everyone loved it!"

"reviewBody": "I just hosted an eclipse party, and this pretty, frothy, slushy punch was perfect for a hot summer afternoon. I found this recipe made exactly enough for two punch bowl sized batches. I cut way back on the sugar by using sugar free jello, only 1 cup sugar, and pouring over a two-liter of sugar free Squirt over each batch. It was perfect and definitely did not need to be sweeter. I made it days ahead and froze it in two gallon sized freezer bags which I stored flat in the freezer. On party day, I moved the frozen punch to the refrigerator for one hour and then thawed the first bag another hour on the counter. It was right at slush stage at that point and I added it to the punch bowl and poured over the Squirt. Since we had kids here, I served them the punch out of the bowl, but I added a shot of sparkling wine (you don't need to buy the expensive stuff since you're mixing) in the adult cups before pouring the slush punch over. Everybody LOVED the stuff. Not a drop left."

Added the cool OJ and lemon juice and poured it into two freezer bags. Into the freezer they went! The bags can be used in the microwave so the tiny bit of heat left in the punch was no problem. Can't wait to serve this \"slushcious\" punch for Halloween!! The video diluted the recipe by dividing it into three bags and using 3 (2 liter) bottles of soda. They also lost the luscious color!!"

And secondly, I used 1 cup of raw sugar rather than what the recipe calls for. For the lemon juice part, I hand-juiced about 3 large lemons to get the 2/3 cup. The frozen mixtures were pulled out of the freezer the morning of a baby shower and set on the counter to thaw for a few hours before going into a mason jar drink dispenser. I used Sprite lemon-lime soda. Really delicious! Everyone loved it."

I plan on making this over and over, whenever I have a large outdoor gathering, or in front of a fire during the winter. Thanks for this!"
