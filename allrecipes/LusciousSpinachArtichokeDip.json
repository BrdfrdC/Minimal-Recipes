Not quite as easy (unless you can get roasted garlic in the olive bar....oh, will they ever bring back those pandemic casualties? The salad bar too?) How much to add is all up to you and how much you love garlic! Enjoy all variations!"

Just need to make again with an attempt to make it creamer by increasing one of the more liquidy ingredients. Also I used only romano cheese adding a layer of cheese on the top but that turned into a firm layer that wasn't easy to scoop either so note to self to not use that cheese on top again. Maybe try mozzarella as others have suggested."

I also added 4oz of Monterey Jack cheese in the mix with another 4oz on top. Topped with fresh jalapenos and after cooking time, removed aluminum foil cover and cranked the oven on to low broil for 5 minutes to allow the cheese and jalapenos to brown slightly."

Had a bit of fresh steamed left over spinach. Added a bit more frozen I had in the freezer. Chopped the artichoke hearts and seasoned with olive oil, cider vinegar, salt and pepper. Seasoned the spinach a little w s/p. Has 1/3 cup left over freshly grated Gruyere cheese. It gave it a special touch. Added all other ingredients from recipe. Oven. Delicious!!!! Thank you!"

"reviewBody": "We ate it all, (on baguette) and it wasn't bad; my husband gives it 4 stars, but I would have liked it better with a layer of cheese melted on top, a longer baking time (I actually baked it a little longer than suggested), and removing the foil cover toward the end so it browns a little. Also, it tasted mostly of artichoke hearts and sour cream. I did add 1\\2 teaspoon of salt and sprinkled some pepper, which it needed. I want to find a similar recipe but with a cheese layer on top, more spices, and I'll use the smallest jar of artichoke hearts so maybe the flavor won't be quite so dominant."

Baked covered until the last five minutes, and it took a little longer to cook than the recipe indicated. Served with scooping style tortilla chips."
