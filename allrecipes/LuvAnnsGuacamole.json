"reviewBody": "Just looking over the measurements of ingredients alerts you instantly that there is something majorly wrong with this recipe which would have nothing to do with individual taste preferences. I don't believe anyone could tolerate, let alone like, guacamole prepared with this much salt! So strike one, right off the bat. Second, for my taste buds anyway, one whole onion, two jalapenos and one large tomato to two avocados is just simply off too! Could this possibly have been for maybe SIX avocados? The lime juice, as well, is probably twice the amount it should be for this many avocados. I did make guacamole with these ingredients, but I salted *to taste* and added the other ingredients more in proportion to the two avocados. I also added a small clove of minced garlic. With significant changes in measurements this could be a great, basic guacamole. If prepared as written, however, I don't know how anyone could eat it."

Be sure to use plum(roma) tomatoes because they have less juice. Also, if you plan on making this ahead of time (no more that 24 hours), I find it's best to add the tomatoes right before serving. I find the juice causes the guacamole to brown faster...even with the lime juice."

A tip from this site suggests to leave the avocado pit inside the bowl while you are chilling your guacamole. That way it doesn't turn brown and ugly. Will make again but maybe make it even hotter. I cut back on the jalapeno because I was serving it to small kids as well. Thanks !"
