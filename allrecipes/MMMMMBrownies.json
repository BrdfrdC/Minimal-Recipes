"reviewBody": "Mine turned out pretty good. I think my only problem was that the batter for the normal recipe was too thick for a normal sized pan. It was too high. So, I used a pan that was wider, and it flattened it out. Maybe that is why for people who have batter on the bottom had issues. Also, if you are having a brownie almost like a cake, that means you mixed the batter too much. If you think they are too bland, wait for them to cool off and add chocolate chips for flavor. I also added some nice, cold vanilla ice cream. Not to be mean, but people saying it tasted good means you made it properly. If the brownies are too dry at 25 minutes, well, something went wrong. Usually things that go wrong are not the recipe's fault."

It doesn’t have that crackly, chewy surface or edge that makes a good brownie nor is it fudgy enough. I didn’t think you could make this combination of ingredients taste bad, but they were borderline inedible and definitely the worst brownies I’ve ever had. If you like a proper brownie, DO NOT make these. There are better recipes out there but sadly I’m not allowed to mention them here or my review will not get published."

"reviewBody": "I did cassava flour (Otto's, 86 grams), applesauce + a few drops of stevia in place of sugar + water, and I used blended plantain in place of the egg (1/4 cup for each egg, so 1/2 cup), and then I totally screwed up and thought I didn't have enough chocolate because my minichips take up less space, but later realized weight wise it was perfectly fine. I ended up adding in a tablespoon of butter and 4 of applesauce to make up the difference in the chocolate chips, LOL, and somehow it still came out pretty darned good! It was a bit bouncy, but I think that's probably due to my miscalculation above. After trying two other chocolate chip based brownies recently that seeped butter out and were inedible unless frozen and the butter lakes avoided, I was really happy to have a reliable recipe to use. This was lightly and perfectly sweet for me. I prefer a fudgy browny, so next time I will not mess up the recipe &amp; cook it for 20 minutes, which I think will do the trick. I would probably add cinnamon if my daughter didn't hate it (sigh). I love having a recipe that works with the substitutions I need."

I added a tsp of instant espresso granules as I like how it pumps up the chocolate flavor. They are crumbly so messy to eat, and if you like thick, cake-like brownies you will be disappointed. Overall, I liked them for the ease and limited ingredients (and not as much sugar as usual), and they will satisfy your chocolate craving!"

I let the chocolate mix cool before adding the eggs and vanilla and then the dry part. Brownies came out all right but were cake-like and not fudge like enough in consistency. I think melting the chocolate slowly in a double boiler would be better and use a full stick of room temp butter, which should be creamed with the sugar before combining the rest of the ingredients. These short cuts don't work well."

I was concerned about adding the eggs to the hot ingredients, because that can sometimes result in bits of scrambled egg in baked goods, but no need to worry, as the results were perfect. If your wet mixture clumps up after stirring in the chocolate chips, just stir well after adding the eggs and vanilla. The brownies are just the way I like them—slightly crisp on the outside and deliciously gooey on the inside. So good!"

I made it last minute because I didn't have a brownie mix I thought I had bought, so I was in a bind. That being said, not sure I'd buy a mix again! This surpassed expectations!! Fudgy and chewy and yummy! Now - I would say, you could probably reduce the sugar if that's a thing for you and it would still be plenty sweet enough. I will try to reduce by 1/8 cup next time (every little bit helps!). I also think I will try Andes mints in there, because I think that would also be delicious!!"

I added 1/4 tsp baking powder as one reviewer suggested, and I ended up baking for the full 30 minutes (turned the heat down by 25 degrees after checking at 25 minutes). They turned out thick and perfectly dense - rose beautifully and did not sink."

I did EXACTLY what the recipe called for, I didn't change anything about it. At first, it was really smooth, but then when I tried to put it in the pan, it went crumply. I had no clue how it went from smooth to crumbly! Then, I said, \"oh well it will probably be fine after it cooks and maybe it will spread.\" It didn't, now, that really made me mad. I at least had hope that it would taste okay, but guess what, IT DIDN'T. It was bland and hard. When I tried to chew it was the hardest thing I have ever made. In fact, I only cooked it for 25 minutes. It said that you can cook it for 25-30 minutes. \n\nI just CANNOT BELIEVE how utterly gross this recipe was. I have made brownies better with the boxed stuff."

If baked any longer than that it burns or gets over baked on the edges. Let cool all the way and it has a similar taste to *two bite brownies*. I agree with others comments as to not over mix the batter, I add chopped up walnuts to the mix for an extra flavour. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe it’s great!"
