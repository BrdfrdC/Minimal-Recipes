I've made these twice and found that a bit (maybe 1/4 to 1/3 cup) of additional coconut helps keep the macaroons firm and lofty. For a bit of extra flavor add a half teaspoon of vanilla extract. Yummy! These make a great gluten free treat, too."

I guess they were too small and the first batch were in for 12mins, but this seems to be slightly too long- they are a tad too dark all over- they still taste ok, but don't look as appealing. I reduced heat to 170 for the next batch and reduced cooking time to 10mins and these came out more like the the pic- White with touches of golden brown. Perhaps they were supposed to be table spoon heaps, however I do prefer this smaller size. Anyway, even though they were difficult (for me at least) to get the temp and time right, I've ended up with more than expected and they taste pretty yum!"

Macaroons are a traditional dessert at Passover because they don't have any flour, which is prohibited during this Jewish holiday. These were fun and easy to make, and people were impressed that they were homemade. They were a bit too sweet for my own tastes, but apparently not for others since they were gobbled up. I added a bit of vanilla and baked them on a non-stick silicone mat. They unexpectedly turned an odd shade of pink in my oven, though--I'm not sure why. I will try them again next year and wouldn't be surprised if they become an annual favorite. Thanks jollygreen23!"

I made a double recipe because I had 4 egg whites leftover, and added 1 tsp of Vanilla extract. I also drizzled with melted dark chocolate to entice my husband to try them, he LOVED them! I took the rest to work (so I wouldn't eat them all myself! LOL) and they were gobbled up immediately! I'll definately be making these again."

This recipe makes a lot more than 12 cookies they puff up a lot, use a small spoon to put on greased cookie sheet. Don't bake for full time without checking, the cookies will look white on top but may be burned on the bottom if you aren't careful."

On the last batch I ran out of vanilla extract so I used marshmallow flavored vodka. Everyone went triple nuts over those.

However, I persevered anyways, and they came out great! I baked for them for 15 minutes (I made them large, and we like them chewy) then dipped them in melted semisweet chocolate chips once cool. Fantastic and even more moist after a night in Tupperware!"

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added 3 squares of melted baker's chocolate after adding the sugar and getting stiff peaks. It was the perfect complement to the coconut and a great way to satisfy a chocolate craving (and adds less than 20 extra calories)! Will be making these again - thanks!"

I found that if I only baked them for 10 minutes instead of 12, they kept their snow-ball white look with golden brown tips. Pretty and tasty! At 12 minutes, you get a browner, chewier macaroon. Still tasty, less snowbally."
