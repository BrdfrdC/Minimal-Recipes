Didn’t put caraway seeds( personal preference) and did have to mix a bit with my hands, the spoon wasn’t sufficient to work the dough. Cooked for about 50 minutes as the center wasn’t done at 40. But will definitely be making it again!"

We used a cast iron skillet in the oven since I didn't have spring form pans handy. The cast iron gave it a more crisper texture, which we liked. We may do it again, but will tweak it to our tastes."

I also had to add another 10 to 15 minutes to the baking time. The old batter was simply TOO DRY to stir. I really liked this recipe and it was my very first time making Irish Soda bread, too. This bread was great and I received plenty of compliments. Thanks Macomb!"

I should have taken a picture and posted it, because it looked like something you would buy from a bakery. It was also very easy to make, so it definitely deserves 5 stars!"
