I used two graham cracker pie shells and transferred to a baking dish drizzled a little extra butter over them and pressed down. I added two cans of the condensed milk and then layered dark, milk and white chocolate chips! I chose walnuts and slivered almonds to layer next with coconut topped off! It was a hit my family loved them said it was like homemade candy bars! These were very rich so small squares were better! I was thinking of trying a layer of peanut or almond butter on top of the graham crackers layer next time"

I melted the butter right on the cookie sheet, added the cracker crumbs, then the chips, nuts and the coconut and covered the last layer with the sweetened condensed milk. I preset the oven at 365 degrees as I didn't remember the original temperature. It baked in 25 minutes. However, I did need to use an additional 1/2 cup of cookie crumbs. They're cooling right now. I implemented this recipe when it was first introduced. It made a lasting impression with my baking skills."

I added English Toffee pieces as a layer in addition to the chocolate and butterscotch chips and made 1/2 pan with coconut and 1/2 with chopped pecans. I did pour the condensed milk over the top of the layers versus below and they turned out very well. I lined my pan with Reynolds® Release Aluminum foil and the bars came right out of the pan. I did chill after cutting, but it’s not necessary."

On one end, on top of the graham crust, I added a layer of Hazelnut Chocolate spread before adding the chocolate chips, coconut and condensed milk. One the other end I made a cheesecake layer, consisting of a softened 8oz. cream cheese, one egg, 1/3 of a cup of sugar and a tsp of vanilla. Then I added, the coconut, chocolate chips and condensed milk. We loved both flavors. I am always adding new stuff. Give it a try and create your own flavors."

This one has less graham crackers, less butter and way too much chocolate chips for proportion of the bar. Without the proper ‘base and graham crackers bottom’ it crumbled (even after the butter trick mentioned here many times in the comments.) All I taste is chocolate…and I even cut back due to the comments posted."

I use a large mixing bowl to which I add 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk &amp; I mix into that 1 TBLS of almond extract. Then I add 1 large bac of coconut flakes &amp; 11oz bag of milk chocolate chips. &amp; 11 ounce bag of white chocolate chips &amp; today I also added a cup of ground up butterfinger bits &amp; 1 cup of sea salt caramel chips &amp; 1 11oz bag of mini M&amp;Ms. I stir all that together then I take 2 10x13 cookie sheets to which I add 1 stick of butter to each pan. Melt that in the oven then sprinkle pre finally crushed 3 sleeves graham cracker crumbs. Then I spoon on the mixture I made with the coconut &amp; mixture of chips. Then bake in a 350* oven for about 20 minutes until the tops are golden brown. Let cool then enjoy! Last year I added chopped up cream De Menthe baking chips. It's fun to mix up different additions each year &amp; everyone loves them! The sky is the limit to how it can be changed each year."

The condensed milk needs to go on last; after the crust, chips, nuts, and coconut. Otherwise, you do not get that lovely caramel on top and the bars just fall apart rather than slicing into nice even squares. I doubt I will make these again in my lifetime; if I wait another 40 years, I will be well over 100 years old."

The Bakers name brand coconut is worth the extra 50¢ over store brand coconut, it's juicy and flavorful and never dry. I put in the whole bag of coconut, a whole bag of milk chocolate chips, a bag of dark chocolate chips, a bag of Heath bar chopped toffee bits, a can of sweetened condensed milk over the graham cracker crust and then another can sweetened condensed milk over the coconut/chocolate chip mixture. I sprinkled some kosher salt over the top because at the moment I don't have any pretzels or nuts. You can honestly add anything to the coconut mixture and it would be delicious!"

They came out really soft in the middle, and even after baking them for a bit longer when we cut into them when semi-cool the condensed milk had flooded the bottom and the Graham cracker crust was completely soft/soggy. Still taste great, but not a bar you can really bite into? I used a slightly smaller pan, does that make a difference?"

Do NOT pour on the sw cond milk - it goes last and is the glue that holds it all together. Sprinkle choc chips, pecans, then coconut then pour ribbons of sw cond milk over it and bake. Looks like this recipe was hurriedly submitted by someone who had never baked this and only halfway read the recipe."

Not as crisp, but just as delicious. I would NOT add 2 cups of chocolate chips. I am all about chocolate, but this was overwhelming. Try halving it with one cup.
