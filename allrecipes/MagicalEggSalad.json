"reviewBody": "It really was very magical, and by far the best recipe for egg salad on this site. I quest (for ten years now) for the perfect egg salad recipe and think this may be it with one caveat, be careful of the salt as it appears to be a staple of steak sauce. I added 1/4 teaspoon of salt, \"to taste\", tasted, and wow was it salty. Also, I always add chopped macademia nuts for crunch and it is possible that this did me in as they always come salted. Still, I feel like I am one step closer to the perfect egg salad, thanks for posting."

It was still fantastic! I added Worcestershire sauce as well. Everything was perfect...in the past I HATED egg salad...then I tried this one, and even I will munch on it!!"

Hint: Instead of chopping the eggs, just use a potato masher. I should have cooked the eggs for 1 or 2 minutes longer because part of the whites peeled off with the shell."

The dijon mustard and splash of steak sauce give it a little tang and a lot of taste (I omitted cayenne for my toddler, so no comment on that). The only thing I might add next time is a bit of diced onion. Thanks Emily!"
