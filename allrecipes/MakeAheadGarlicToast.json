It worked very well. Everyone seemed to like it (and some liked it A LOT -- coming back for seconds and thirds). My only complaint is that it was a bit salty. Next time I make this I will decrease the cheese to 1/4 cup, add a little more garlic, and use unsalted butter."

I had serious doubts but it was an incredible lifesaver for two reasons--I was able to salvage day old bread and make garlic bread ahead of time so that I could just throw it in the oven right as I needed it. I did up the garlic powder but other than that I kept the recipe the same. GREAT recipe."
