"reviewBody": "I used Yoplait Plain Yogurt rather than mixing my own. I tried it with frozen berries and made them ahead, but when I left the two together overnight, I got a little bit of a stomach ache when I ate it. I don't know why, but when I make and eat it right away I felt fine. \n\nIt's easy to make, and a perfect replacement for ice cream or other movie time snacks. Also perfect because you can't eat it super fast while the berries are frozen. Well, at least I couldn't. Thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I love parfaits and this was simple to get together and an easy snack or breakfast. I did reduce the sucralose by quit a bit. I started with 1/4 cup and that was plenty of sweetness for our taste. I suggest starting at 1/4 cup and continue to add until you reach your desired sweetness. I was great with the frozen fruit, but, did get quite a bit of liquid in the bottom as the fruit defrosted."
