"reviewBody": "Great. Don't overcook the potatoes, or it will be difficult to separate them from the water. Mine were a bit wet, so I baked the finished casserole in the oven without a lid, to dry then out a bit. I used a stand mixer to thoroughly mix the sour cream, cream cheese, and 1/2 cup butter. Then I manually mashed and stirred in the potatoes. Don't mix the potatoes with the mixer, as that produces too much gluten and will make the potatoes sticky/stretchy. I did not add milk, having used butter instead. I was in a rush and timed myself, starting from nonwashed whole potatoes to ready to serve dish, did take a full 1hr 20 min. I did not peel my red potatoes."

I use 6 pounds of potatoes since that fills my casserole dish better. I only alter the milk if they look dry. I typically use half russet potatoes because they're bigger and I dislike peeling the potatoes. I haven't noticed any great change in taste. \nIf you refrigerate overnight, definitely pull out of fridge early before cooking- I've had to microwave them because the rest of the meal was ready, but the potatoes were still cold."

For potlucks, I bring them in a slow cooker...just warm them up with a half stick of butter on top."

I could easily see how this could be made ahead then placed in small serving bowls and frozen for a quick dinner. Thanks for this great recipe."

Very creamy and delicious. I also had about a 1/2 cup of chicken broth that I was looking to get rid of and rather than pouring it down the sink, I added it to the potatoes. I made the morning of Thanksgiving and put into a crock pot and kept in the refrigerator until about 4 hours before we are planning to eat."

Took out in the morning and turned the crockpot on low for about an hour, gave a good stir and then up to high for an hour and then back to low and the potatoes were perfectly heated and fluffy for our 1:00 p.m. dinner. I will definitely make again this year. I highly recommend using Yukon Gold even though they are more expensive and leave the skin on. The only other change - I may have added a couple teaspoons garlic salt. And also you must use a potato masher and not your mixer. Save the mixer for dessert!!"

I used minced garlic in place of onion salt &amp; used an 8 oz brick of reduced fat cream cheese instead of 6 oz. I didn't measure anything &amp; it turned out great. I mixed it all in my Kitchen Aid stand mixer mixing potatoes &amp; milk on low. I scraped down the sides &amp; added remaining ingredients. Scrape down again then mix it on high for a smooth consistency. These are thick potatoes that reheat very well in microwave or crock pot."
