I am from New Orleans and am used to making a roux, so I used both butter and fat from the pan and added flour that I sauteed until all the raw flavor of the flour is gone, and it was the color I was looking for. I also added a drizzle of olive oil and pats of butter on top of wings and onions before baking, as well as salt and pepper. To stock-pot, I added celery as well as carrots and bay leaf for flavor. It tasted very good, but recipe needed tweaking."

I did put the juice in a gravy separator, put the stock in the pot and used the fat with the flour for the rue. I used low sodium broth but it turned out bland. I would suggest using regular chicken broth. I did add salt to it for flavor. All in all, this is a good way to do it. I plan on making gravy the day of Thanksgiving. This is just really for leftovers because we never have any left."

"reviewBody": "This will be my forever go-to recipe for making turkey gravy! The taste, aroma and viscosity are perfect - and best of all it’s ready to heat and serve on Thanksgiving. I used 4 large wings, one onion and a 1/2 dozen smashed cloves, all roasted for 1 1/2 hours to get the wings nice and golden brown. \n\nI made the rest of the recipe in my Instant Pot - cooking for 1 hour at high pressure and using natural pressure release (another 30 min). Since I’m serving two turkey breasts, they came with turkey gravy packets, which I added before whisking in the slurry of broth &amp; flour. The only other deviation was adding a couple teaspoons of Maggi seasoning and a bit more salt. \n\nI ended up with two quarts of delicious, beautiful gravy for Thanksgiving. I’m sure this could be increased by adding more broth (I used 1 1/2 quarts), but it is perfect for our family, with enough for leftovers."

It was too thick at first, so I put my wings back on to boil with some additional chicken broth and thinned the gravy. I added too much pepper, so thinned that with some lemon and sugar! VOILA! the gravy is delicious! My mother would be so proud! My small family gathering will love this gravy this year of covid 2020. Happy thanksgiving to all!"

"reviewBody": "I made this with a deconstructed turkey removing the breast meat (used for ground turkey sausage). I also use turkey stock instead of chicken stock. This was just what we needed since we smoke our turkey on the Green Egg and don't end up with usable drippings. This is the perfect addition to our Thanksgiving menu."

"reviewBody": "We make our gravy a few weeks in advance every year - but I do it slightly differently... At the point in this recipe where the hot broth (gravy base) is strained, I then pour it into a few mason jars, seal the lids on, and put them outside to cool. We store the mason jars in the fridge till Thanksgiving. All of the fat rises to the top and separates from the broth. On Thanksgiving day, a few hours before the turkey comes out, I skim off the fat and pick up the recipe at that point with the butter and flour. It works perfect and the gravy is fresh. Regardless of how you make this, its important to realize that the amount of gravy you can make is limited by the amount of fat you have. Therefore its important to use as much fatty turkey (legs, wings) as possible. You are boiling the fat off of them to become the foundation for your gravy. If you boiled a lean cut of turkey, you'd have no fat to mix with the flour. If you want to increase the amount of turkey fat that you have when you are making the gravy, you can blend in a little extra butter to the flour. All in all, this is spectacular gravy and guests rave about it. You will look like a pro chef with this recipe."

I make it the night before and heat it up and add the flour right before dinner. It is so flavorful and you can make it any time. I added fresh rosemary and substitute fresh thyme for dried. I also added poultry seasonings. The flour ratio should be to your liking - add more flour for thicker, and in my opinion less flavorful, or less for a looser gravy. Perfection!"

So if you have the time, I would recommend making it before hand. \n\nI couldn't find turkey wings, so I used two turkey thighs and three legs. I decided to do as some other reviewers had suggested and separate the fat and make a roux before adding the broth. I didn't feel like there was enough fat, so I added some bacon grease. I thought the final product was good but not great, although my guests really seemed to like it."

They're $4 per lb in our area and they were $10 for the wings alone. That is fine since it takes some stress out on the big day. The problem is the recipe turned out really thick. I could have cut the flour in half. And that's what I will do next year. It was tasty though. The house smelled like turkey the day before Thanksgiving after making the gravy."

"reviewBody": "I kind of mashed together this recipe with Chef John's and got a great result! Put celery, carrots and onion in the pan withe the wings. Used the chicken broth in this recipe, pureed some of the veg and added it to gravy, (after pressing) and made a roux. Turned out great, and will add pan drippings on T-day. One less thing to worry about!"

"reviewBody": "I’m giving it a 4 because I made a few changes. Like others said, it is a lengthy process, but the end result is very good. I couldn’t get turkey wings, but my local supermarket had necks and backs. They worked perfectly. I also took the recommendation of others who said they used a combination of chicken broth and water. I simmered it for two hours and ended up with a wonderful broth. While making the gravy, I added in a jar of turkey gravy base by William Sonoma. It gave me the volume I needed for a large group and a richer color for the gravy. I didn’t add cayenne pepper, but did add herbs to the gravy. It was delicious, and it was done early!"
