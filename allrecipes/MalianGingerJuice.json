"reviewBody": "Very tasty and refreshing! My one recommendation is that if you don't like a lot of ginger pulp, filter it with cheesecloth or something finer than your average mesh strainer. (We have never had this before, but my son made this as part of a class project on African foods.) The ginger adds a lot of \"warmth\", which is great, but some people refused to stir before serving themselves, and the sediment at the bottom made the last few glasses a little overpowering. I, for one, am glad that we found this recipe. When I make this again, I will follow my own suggestion, and am sure that it will merit five stars..."

I basically grate my ginger and add it to my fresh lemonade. I never saw it served w/the mint garnish... might try it though. Thanks for the memories! :)"
