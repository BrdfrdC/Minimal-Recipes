Also someone suggested boiling the baking soda and water and placing the pretzels in there before baking them. They instantly fell apart when you try to take them out. The water cooked it, and preventing some of them from raising completely. I should've stuck to the original recipe and used a non-stick pan."

I didn’t modify the recipe in anyway, although I did add the salt with the flour instead of with the yeast and brown sugar (since salt kills yeast.) I used my stand mixer to knead the dough for 8 min on the second setting. It was perfect! I had no issues rolling them out on my granite countertop. If your dough sticks you might not be greasing the bowl and dough enough. I can get 4 on a cookie sheet with parchment (was better at it the second time). So good!"

"reviewBody": "I made these pretzels, but I was an inexperienced bread baker at the time. Rolling them out was a challenge, however, they did turn out pretty good, albeit not so pretty. Then I got lazy and just decided to make bread rolls, and skip the water bath step. Wow! They tasted just like the bread rolls my husband and I would rave about when eating at a certain hotel restaurant. The crust was crispy and the crumb tasty and chewy. From that point, I got braver and modified the recipe by changing out half the flour to whole wheat or graham flour (yum). I switched out the water for milk and even coffee; put less liquid and added an egg. I added seeds, fruit, oatmeal. This recipe is VERY FORGIVING. \nIt sure gave me the confidence to experiment. The basic dough is a pleasure to knead. Just make sure you handle it gently or it will tend to stick and you'll be driven to keep adding flour. I like to tell others, \"knead as if the dough were hot to the touch\". Hope this helps. Best wishes to all ye bread bakers!"

Like many have said, boil them in water and baking soda. I baked mine on parchment with no spray and they turned out beautifully. The key to any \"bread\" is the proofing and kneading. if you haven't got the patience to do it right, then don't bother doing it. Apparently people need to he told to use a floured surface to knead dough. Anyways, I will definitely be making these over and over."

"reviewBody": "WOW real mall pretzels without having to go into the mall!! I had no issues with the dough but had no bread flour, so I used all purpose but added a rounded Tbsp of vital wheat gluten. I used the dough setting on my bread machine and it mixed it perfectly. The note about rolling to half the length and letting it rest, then rolling the rest of the way, was very helpful. I then followed one reviewer's instructions to boil the pretzels in 4 cups water with 4 tablespoons baking soda until they float. After taking it out I set them on Wire racks and let them rise. Then I used an egg wash and sprinkled salt on before baking. I baked them right on the racks so I didn't disturb them, and they only stuck a little after baking, not enough to tear or anything. They came out nice and dark and perfect! Yum!"

Four on each baking sheet lined with parchment paper, they baked for 15 minutes. These pretzels are absolutely identical to Bavarian Pretzel, if anyone here is familiar with that chain. Maybe next time I'll use bread flour and see if they are more similar to Auntie Annie's, which are softer and chewier. Right out of the oven I basted them in butter and sprinkled lightly with Kosher salt. I'm going to freeze them, whcih is awesome since there are only two of us here. I don't know if these pretzels will live long enough to experiment with different toppings."

"reviewBody": "OMG!! Best pretzels ever! My 5 n 7 yr old granddaughters both said Grandpa make these for breakfast tomorrow! Lol. Recipe was perfect, I made following tweaks to cooking process:\n1. Mix the brown sugar and 110° water.Do NOT Add salt at this point. Add 1 pack yeast gently, stir n let sit still for @ 20 mins (allows yeast to activate). 2. Add the salt and 4 cups of flour 1 at a time. (I used all AP flour.)3. I used my Kitchen Aide stand mixer with dough hook on 2 n let that run for 5 to 6 minutes.4.Lightly oil the mixing bowl and dough. Place a warm towel over the mixing bowl n let sit to rise for @ 1hr and 15 min. 5. Put dough out on lightly floured cutting board and cut into 12 equal slices. 6. Roll each peice as described in recipe, except my rope was only @ 18 inches or so.I then shaped 6 into pretzel shape n 6 into twists.Sit that aside to rise again for @20 to 25 mins.7. As that was rising I lightly oiled 2 cookie sheets and in a pot bring 4 cups of water and 4 tablespoons of baking soda to a high simmer.8. Put 2 pretzels at a time into water, flip after 30secs and simmer 30 more secs. Remove from pot, shake off excess water(prevents sticking), place on cookie sheets, and sprinkle kosher salt on pretzels. Repeat step for rest of pretzels.9. Bake pretzels for 4 min,remove, brush with melted butter, n bake for @4 more mins. Follow recipe n these steps for best pretzels ever!"

"reviewBody": "My kids always get a pretzel when we visit the mall, so I was in search of making this myself. After browsing a few recipes, i settled on this one because it was simple and I had everything on hand. I've made this 3 times in less than 2 weeks. As other reviewers have said, you MUST kneed the dough as long as it states (I use my KA mixer with the hook attachment). It makes the mixer jump around, so its best to hold it down or rest the machine on a towel. You MUST let the dough rest for at least the 1 hour. If you did both, then rolling, twisting and shaping should be rather easy. I don't blot the water solution off, since oven is hot enough to dry it off fairly quickly. But I do let the first pan rise while i finish twisting all the other pretzels. As soon as its out of the oven, I brush the tops with a warmed mixture of 4 TB melted butter, 2 TB light brown sugar, 1/2 tsp salt. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge, i toast it briefly and it still tastes great a few days later."
