I did not want to waste the fresh strawberries in the cooked sauce so I made that with frozen ones, so we had a few extra fresh strawberries to eat. Next time I think I will add a little more rhubarb but it is good either way."

I had about one and a half cups of rhubarb in the freezer, I just added it all with the strawberries and increased the sugar bu a couple of tablespoons to offset. This made two pies that I brought to Thanksgiving dinner at the in laws, and it was a big hit. I will make this again!"

I used a store bought graham cracker crust and added some extra strawberries and rhubarb because we had ALOT of both from our garden. I kept all other ingredients and directions as stated and the pie came out great (set perfectly). Will definitely make this again."

"reviewBody": "This is an easy to make and delicious recipe! The only change I made was adding 2 cups of rhubarb and cutting it down to 1/2 cup of sugar because in my opinion the pie was too sweet, and I enjoy the tartness of rhubarb. Also make sure that the filling is very thick because I don't think I cooked the filling long enough and it was very watery. You'll probably need to upgrade to a 10 inch pie crush to accomodate the extra rhubarb. Other than that, great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Yummy. My grandma used to make a fresh strawberry pie sort of like this, so I thought I'd add a few of her tricks. For one thing, I used a regular pie crust, poked it with a fork, and baked it before adding the filling. Graham crackers just seemed a little off. My favorite thing that she did was spread 4 ounces of cream cheese on the warm crust before placing in the halved fresh strawberries. To me this is a MUST! I also threw in some blueberries because I was a little short on strawberries. My husband and I loved this pie. It's a hard one to mess up-- just be patient and make sure that glaze is nice and thick, stirring it constantly!! I posted pictures to show the nice color added by the blueberries. This was a pretty pie."

Very easy and good but you need a lot of strawberries ( about 2 large boxes). I use whole strawberries standing on end in the shell and cover with the mashed strawberry syrup. Excellent and keeps in refrigerator if you have any leftovers."

I omitted the rhubarb because we don't really like it, and increased the strawberries in the sauce by 1/2 cup. If I made it again, I would bake the crust for 15 minutes to set it up better. It's tough to serve and leaves behind most of the crumbs. Still, we loved it and will make it again."

Added a whole cup and still could not tell there was rhubarb in it. The layer of strawberries on the bottom did very little to enhance the flavor or texture of the pie. Was very easy to make and it did set up beautifully."
