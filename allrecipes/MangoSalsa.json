I added an extra tablespoon to each of the fresh squeezed juices, 1/4 teaspoon of kosher salt, and a cut up fresh peach. Absolutely fabulous. I'm sure it will be wonderful on chicken and pork. Will be making more of this and sharing jars of it with my friends. I'm sure they'll be asking for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Good salsa alternative for those who don't eat tomatoes. Reasonably good consistency chunk-wise, but a little bland &amp; liquidy for my taste. Some things I would recommend: 1. use a very ripe mango, which is more like the tomato texture in a salsa, 2. I doubled the jalapeno and used yellow onion instead of green--I like things hot, 3. finish with salt to taste after it sits, 4. longer sitting is better for flavor and texture, 5. cut back on the lime and lemon juice to more like a little over 2 total tablespoons if your other ingredients are adding more that average moisture."

"reviewBody": "If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would. I absolutely love it and made it again today. The only change made was to use a couple tablespoons red onion instead of green onion (what I had on hand). The quantities are flexible - add more or less of what you like. Today, I put a few tablespoons on a piece of salmon, wrapped it in parchment paper, and baked it in the oven. When it was done, I added more of the raw salsa on top. I can't say enough good things about this recipe - it tastes great on salmon, other fish or chicken breast or with tortilla chips as a snack. It's quick and easy to make. It keeps extremely well in the fridge for a few days. It's addictive and healthy. Use fresh lime and lemon, if you can. Love - Love - Love - Love - Love this recipe."

Reminder - you really need to let this sit in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before tasting. I kept thinking it was missing something and the remembered it needed time for the flavors to marry. After sitting in the refrigerator overnight, it was AWESOME!!! Will definitely make again."

I followed the recipe for the most part except I don't measure - generally go by sight and personal preference. I left the mango in larger chunks but minced the red bell pepper and a bit of red onion along with the green onion and jalapeno. I added a small handful of chopped flat-leaf parsley and cilantro mixed from my herb garden. It marinated in the juice of 1 medium lime and about 1/3 of a large lemon. The presentation on the plate was quite appealing with the brightness of the salsa next to the swordfish and the brightness of the steamed broccoli and the rice. Will absolutely use this salsa many times in many different ways.\nBTW: some of add-ins suggested by previous reviewers sound quite yummy - black beans, tomatoes, peaches/nectarines, splash of balsamic - endless options!"

On the their advice, I added a 1/2 Cup pineapple and a little ginger for more of a sweet spice kick. It was excellent on fish, but it wasn't the original recipe."

Replaced green onion with red onions and added tomato, and added salt. \nTurned out great! I'm eating the leftover salsa with fresh baked tortilla chips now!"

My wife and I found a spicy mango brats one night and cooked it up with some peppers. We realized that the hint of sweetness of the brat and the peppers was just not enough. So we found this recipe for the next time we do brats. Unfortunately we never found the spicy mango when we last went shopping, but we improvised with a spicy chorizo. The flavors were perfect together! Super simple, tasty and inexpensive to make! I should mention, we got some perfect mango and my butter fingers dropped one of the perfects cuts I had onto the floor. A little disappointed, but still, great mix of flavors!"

"reviewBody": "This is a good simple classic mango salsa just the way it is. And easy to adjust to own taste. I added a little salt and replaced lemon juice with orange juice. But it really would have been OK to leave out the salt, since there is plenty of salt on the chips, and orange juice just happens to be more liked by the many kids I tend to feed. Left out the green onions because I didn't have them and they weren't really needed in this recipe, for color (cilantro does the job) or flavor (plenty of sweet and sour onion flavors already). If you don't want a chunky salsa, just put it in the food processor (will become like pico de gallo) or dice it smaller. If you don't like it raw, roast some of your vegetables first. If you like a softer onion flavor, switch with red onions. Many reactions to this recipe made me scratch my head a bit."

"reviewBody": "I made this to eat with lightly blackened flounder. One reviewer said this wasn't a sweet salsa and they were right. It also wasn't a savory salsa...it was a \"twangy\" salsa. I wish I tasted it before adding so much lime and lemon juice. Even though really ripe lemons and limes are a little sweeter, they are still tart. To remedy the tartness, I added some salt, which helped a little and then added some Splenda which I keep on hand just for times like this. It doesn't take much and dissolves quickly in a dish that's already prepared. I ended up making it sweeter because, because at that point, I thought it tasted better (and less tart) the sweeter it got. Next time I'll try using a lot less lime/lemon juice or maybe just go with orange or pineapple juice instead. I also used red onion because I didn't have any green onions and I used only a few sprigs of fresh cilantro instead of the amount called for. I've found it can be overpowering in large amounts and I don't like it as much as I once thought I did. I would make it again because I still ended up liking it, but I'll try just using less lime and lemon juice first next time."
