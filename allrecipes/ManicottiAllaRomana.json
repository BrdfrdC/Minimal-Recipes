I found the method of stuffing the shells with a plastic bag more difficult than just stuffing the shells by hand. I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta. The meal was rounded out with Zuppa Toscana, roasted asparagus and focaccia bread (all from this site). Italian wine was the finishing touch to this Valentine's Day meal."

I used the no-cook style but precooked them for just a few minutes to make them pliable because I wanted to roll them. I used 2 lasagna shells the short way, rolled each around a good butcher shop sausage and secured them with toothpicks. We used 4 sausages. It was messy to prepare them but they turned out great. I thought there would be too much sauce for the recipe but it was just right. The recipe was delicious! We are retired seniors so in an effort to eat less, we had enough for 4 meals; I froze 2 meals and will have the second meal this week!"

"reviewBody": "This.is.beautiful. It is so yummy, you‚Äôll think you‚Äôve gone to Italian heaven! I do add a Italian sausage when browning the ground beef. At this time I also add a tablespoon of oregano, 1/2 a tablespoon of Italian seasoning, and a sprinkle of garlic salt. I like my dishes cheesy so I add a cup of mozzarella and grated Parmesan to the mixture too. Piping it in the shells makes it easier. I ended up with two pans of manicotti- one to eat and one to share! Thank you for the besciamella recipe- this wonderful white sauce is so delicious! Italians add a sprinkle of nutmeg to it right before topping it on the shells. I did too, and yeah, it‚Äôs good!"

"reviewBody": "This is by far the best Italian dish I have ever made!! It is a bit of work, but so worth it!! If I could give it 10 stars I would. Secret for making a little easier. Cook manicotti in salted water just until the pasta becomes soft 2-3 minutes. Working quickly cut the pasta lengthwise and fill with meat mixture and place in pan cut side down. So much easier than trying to \"stuff\" and no one is the wiser. I also use Italian sausage (sweet or hot) whatever your preference is in place of some of the meat. About half and half."

I also use Italian sausage rather than ground beef, but that is just our preference. If you find that this recipe makes more filling than you have shells for, you can always put the sausage in the sauce that goes on top rather than in the filling mixture the next time you make it. I now buy two boxes of pasta shells so I have a few extra to use up all the filling. Great recipe with a couple small changes!"

I sort of halved the recipe as I had a box that was 12 oz. of manicotti (14 of them) and I only had 0.65 of a pound of meat. I went ahead and used 2 cups of whole milk ricotta since I was using no spinach. I will say the filling was a little runny. It all tasted good but would have been better if the filling was stiffer. Using half of everything listed (except the ricotta), it filled 11 of the manicotti shells."

I always read the reviews before I make something from this site. I consider myself a good cook but I always learn something from you guys and gals. This turned out fantastic and everyone loved it. It is a ton of work. Lots of steps. I used all Italian sausage, fresh spinach, fresh parmesan and a little mozzarella in the shell stuffing mix. I used one and a half cups Ricotta as I am not a big fan. I made the white sauce as recommend by so many reviewers with only one tablespoon bullion and added some fresh grated parmesan to it as well. I used a homemade tomato sauce that is a family favorite. There is enough stuffing to do another box of Manicotti shells. So it is in the freezer. It was delicious. Other than using the left overs for a second batch, I would only attempt this again for special occasions, just because of how much work it is."
