I did add a TBSP of minced garlic to the meat and followed another reviewers suggestion of adding half the cheese to the hot meat mixture before adding the sauce. This was sooo good and made A LOT. This fed myself and 2 grown men for 2 days, plus I gave the leftovers to another family of 3 who ate on it for 3 days!!! (The flavor only got better!) Next time I will half the recipe to an 8x8 pan...maybe :)"

I quartered Turkey pepperoni to the top and then added mozzarella just to cover. Lots of left overs, all want it again tomorrow. So saves me from cooking... a win, win for everyone!!"

And this was even with me trying to doctor it up with fresh veggies, simmering the beef in their juices, and adding seasoning because the italian sausage may be seasoned but the beef isn't and the premade sauce always tastes better with a pick me up. Was not worth the extra work I tried to put into it. The hunt for a fabulous italian casserole continues..."

If you make this recipe according to the directions, a 9x13 baking dish will not be large enough. I used a 5 Qt baking dish (10.3 x 14.5) and it was just big enough. \n\nI substituted zucchini for the mushroom, because I had some on hand I needed to use. I thinly sliced it and cooked on the stovetop for a few minutes before mixing with everything else. \n\nI will make this again. It wasn't bland, but it could use seasoning."

Tossed the cooked/drained pasta in some Italian blend shredded cheese before incorporating the sauce and more cheese in a very large bowl. Transferred this mixture to a baking dish sprayed with nonstick spray and topped with remaining cheese. Sliced up pepperoni to get small pieces in each bite. This ensured everything was well incorporated and cooked evenly instead of a massive amount of cheese just sitting on top of the casserole dish. Serve with garlic bread!"

I cut the portions in half and there was still PLENTY of left overs. I didnt use pepperonis this time (just because i didnt have any), but will try them wit h it next time. Solid dish with lots of flavor and very filling."

I also added fresh grated Romano cheese to my sauce, did not use the mushrooms, then mixed the pasta with the sauce prior to added to the baking dish. I layered half the pasta added a layer of mozzarella, added the remaining pasta and topped it off with the rest of the mozzarella cheese. The dish was hearty, flavorful and a perfect choice for a cool fall evening."

I made this for dinner for my 3 person family and we had leftovers to last days. However, I do think that those measurements would be good if you were going to make this casserole for a party. Otherwise, amazing casserole!"

"reviewBody": "Delicious, definitely making this again! This recipe, as written, is for a very large family and/or gathering, next time I will cut it in half and should still be plenty for myself, my 3 year old and my father with leftovers. I used fresh instead of canned mushrooms, turned out great! However, very fatty, if you are looking to cut some out (albeit not that much) I would maybe just use ground beef with an Italian seasoning and omit the Italian sausage or omit the pepperoni. The cheese, pepperoni and Italian sausage combo can be very heavy for some. Next time I might try a few veggie toppings instead of pepperoni , e.g: onions, green peppers, olives etc. like a pizza."
