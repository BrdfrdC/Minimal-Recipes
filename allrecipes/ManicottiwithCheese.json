Used pre-cooked lasagna sheets and rolled them, used Italian style tomatoes and paste rather than jarred sauce and the tomatoes added a nice texture and taste to the sauce. I also added one cup of spinach to the cheese mixture. Covered the top with both mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Will definitely make this again. Thanks!"

This time, I did use an Italian blend cheese in place of the mozzarella (which has mozzarella, provolone, parmesan ,fontina, romano and Asiago in it), One reviewer suggested adding garlic and Italian seasoning to the mixture, so I added that. I have made it without precooking the manicotti, and it works well either way. You just have to bake it longer if the manicotti is not precooked."

I added a bit of garlic salt and Italian seasoning (about 1/2 tsp each) and used 2 tsp dry parsley instead of fresh. I also only used one jar of Classico spaghetti sauce, and for our tastes, it was enough. I only seemed to have enough filling for 10 shells though, and had 4 leftover, from a 250g box. Would make again."

"reviewBody": "Good basic recipe but I changed it up little bit. First 3 1/2 jars of spaghetti sauce is TOO MUCH!! It would become soup. I only used one jar and there was plenty of sauce for it. I added Italian spices (about 2 Tbl.) to the cheese mixture. There was so much cheese mixture that I almost had enough for 2 of these dishes. Again TOO MUCH!!! I don't have anything to pipe the cheese mixture in so I actually cut the cooked noodle up the back spoon in the cheese mixture and roll it back up. I place it cut side down of course. Works great that way. I then poured the sauce on top and then added mozzarella to the top. It came out perfect. The spices I added really helped with the blandness of the original recipe."

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe, as written, for the actual manicotti filling. And it was AMAZING. The ONLY thing that I changed was that instead of using canned sauce, I made my own sauce. I really love red sauce, and always make my own. I did also add more cheese to the top of the dish during that last 15 minutes of cooking. But really, this dish is awesome; nothing needs to be added/omitted. The amount of cheeses and seasoning in the filling is perfect!!! The only feedback I ever get from my picky, hard to impress boyfriend is a simple and polite \"That was good, thank you.\" After making this dish, he felt the need to tell me how good it was like 5 times, using words like \"F****** Amazing\" Yummylicious\" and \"seriously, that was soooo good!\" LOL (And he was born in Italy, so I trust his judgment on this!!) I will definitely make this again!!! Thank you!!!!"

"reviewBody": "I followed this recipe exactly, except I added shredded mozzarella and Parmesan to the top when I put it back in the oven for the last 15 minutes. Great addition! \n\nAlso, I don't know if the package I used had too many noodles (although it said 8oz) or if I used too much filling for each one, but I was about three manicotti short on filling. This was my first time making it, so I think it was just my fault. \n\nNo need for the egg suggestion at all, just make sure everything is well-mixed and that you use a quality zip-loc bag with a corner snipped off or piping bag to fill after cooked. Also make sure not to over-cook the manicotti when you're boiling them or you'll have some with giant rips. I boiled mine for 9 minutes (package said 8-10) and had a lot that tore just from stirring them in the pot. Used Great Value brand from Walmart, so maybe that had something to do with it. Will try just boiling for 7 next time.\n\nOverall very yummy and will definitely make again!"

A easy trick to filling this pasta take a plastic storage freezer bag and put the filling inside, then snip the tip off and use like you would a pastry bag. You can toss it when your done and almost everyone has these on hand. Very simple recipe thank you for it!"

They were perfectly cooked by the end of baking. I didn't have enough mixture to stuff all of the pasta, though. I had 4 tubes left over. I didn't use whole milk ricotta or mozz... I used part skim to save a few calories. Finally, 3 and a half 32-ounce jars of pasta sauce is entirely too much! I used 2 26-ounce jars of pasta sauce and it was still too much... and I like my pasta saucey! All in all this was a nice change from lasagna or spaghetti. I added ground beef and zucchini to the sauce to make it a little more hearty. Thanks for posting!"

"reviewBody": "Wow, this manicotti is super! I did not boil the manicotti because it breaks too easily. Filling them while they are raw is fine...just make sure the manicotti \"rests\" in the sauce for at least a few hours before cooking so it absorbs some of the moisture from the sauce. I followed ingredients almost exactly, except I added a large can of crushed tomatoes in addition to the spaghetti sauce and I added a teaspoon of garlic salt and a dash of italian seasoning to the cheese mixture. Adding a can of crushed tomatoes gives it more of a homemade taste and more moisture because Prego / Ragu tends to tast a little processed. Adding the garlic salt and italian seasoning gave the cheese more flavor. Anyway, it came out great! Very creamy and flavorful. I also made sure to use good quality fresh grated Parmesan...none of that green can stuff! Definitely a keeper! P.S. I would NOT recommend adding an egg to the mixture...unless you want ricotta cheese that has scrambled egg consistancy! This mixture stays together fine without it, so don't add it!!!"

He assumed because I am part Italian I knew how to make it even though in the 13 years we've been together never once had I made it for him. Thank the lord for this recipe. It was easy to follow although stuffing the shells can be very tricky! LOL!! Everyone at my hubby's work raved about these and I have passed the recipe on! Thanx so much for saving me! LOL!!"

Also replace the parsley with double the amount of fresh spinish and place slices of Itialian sausage around the pasta than cover with sauce and bake as instructed."
