Used a pizza cutter to cut the dough as other reviewers have mentioned, which made it very quick and easy. I put it all together in the bundt pan the night before, covered and refrigerated overnight, in the morning I warmed the sauce and spooned it over while the oven preheated, then baked as directed so the bread was warm for Easter morning. Making another pan for dessert!"

This monkey bread STAYED gooey pull apart. Not stuck and hard like regular ones. The maple syrup and DARK brown sugar are the key. Bacon. I do it in microwave in between paper towels. No grease no cleanup crispy bacon. \n\nAbout the pan, yes a bundt ‘style ‘pan is needed. I don’t have. I improvised. Used heavy duty Reynolds aluminum foil. Lined my 2 piece angle food pan, massive lining. Again no clean up, no leaks. Did not stock to cake. I wanted a one person size serving. For me. I took a high sided sauce pan. Again. Massively lined with foil. I made a cone for middle. Firm like you would a foil ball, but mine was cone shaped. It looked hilarious. It worked incredibly good. So, no bundt pan. Get creative and use foil ! No need to spray and comes off if you let cool about 5 minute then flip and remove foil. Have fun making and eating. It’s essy and incredible !"

I used a one-gallon storage bag for the biscuit/sugar/cinnamon mixture and it coated them perfectly with no sugar mix leftover. The top does get a little crusty while baking, but softens up with the glaze when you dump it on a plate. This will be my new go-to holiday breakfast treat. Should be easy to prep most ingredients the night before and bake up quickly the next day. Deliciousness!"

The only change I made was to bake my bacon in the oven (425 deg F for 20 mins) so that it was all done at once. Came together faster because while the bacon was doing its thing, I could cut and coat the biscuits and make the caramel and then when the bacon was done, it was all ready to assemble. This is going to be a staple for Xmas breakfast in my house from now on!"

Monkey bread is a big deal in my house, and every new and interesting combination is a hit (you should try our Savory and not sweet - Jalepeno Popper monkey bread! :)) Anyhow, couple of things that work for me and my family that I do differently ... I'd use butter versus margarine. and in place of maple.. honey :) I also recommend thinking about how your family likes their bacon... really crisp, or a bit softer? If softer, I use frozen bacon and chop into smallish pieces before frying no need to crumble if they're small enough and not so crunchy, all about what the family likes right?\n:)"

I didn’t make any changes to the recipe (I think it's perfect as is), but to ensure that the top didn't get dry and hard like my dad's always did, I put a piece of foil on top in the last 10 minutes of baking. Perfect! I'm sure I'll be making it again!"

I did remove it from a nonstick bundt pan at 20 minutes, it was too hot to work with any earlier. I needed to bake it another 8 minutes to bake all the bread through. \nI used butter since I don't use margarine at all, added a teaspoon of madagascar bourbon vanilla &amp; chopped pecans along with the bacon crumbles. It took me longer than expected to prep. Next time I may forego adding the left over cinnamon sugar to the maple sauce, since it came out very sweet and already has an incredible amount of sugar in it."

The first was that I added an extra 1/4 cup of maple syrup to the brown sugar/margarine mixture to ensure there was enough to coat the top after it was assembled (didn't want \"dry tops\" like the first reviewer). \n\nThe other change is that I used thick cut bacon (8 slices) and \"candied\" it first by pressing dark brown sugar liberally onto both sides and sprinkling it with cayenne pepper (this is also referred to as Billionaire's Bacon). Lay it on a cookie sheet lined with foil and bake it in the over at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes. Allow it to cool on parchment and then chop it up into pieces. Overall, it was the perfect combination of smoky, salty and sweet (with just a TOUCH of heat). While all of it was good, the inside pieces were gooey and delicious. We will definitely make this again!"
