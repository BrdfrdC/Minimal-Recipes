"reviewBody": "I made half a batch of these, and I only got 8 rather small, dense cupcakes. I felt like they were more muffin-like than cake-like. They were pleasant tasting, but I didn't taste any maple flavor, mainly just the nutmeg. Some maple flavoring would have been nice. The recipe probably should have called for 2 eggs."
