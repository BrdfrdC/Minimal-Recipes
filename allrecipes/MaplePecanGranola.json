I replaced the canola oil with coconut oil, and the flavor works well here and added extra salt. I stirred after 20 min and again in 15 min, taking it out a few min earlier. You really need to watch it because it could be overdone easily. I mixed in some shredded coconut after it came out of the oven (not flaked; a shredded-type that was thinner and not too sweet). The kitchen smelled amazing when this was baking. You can really make it your own by adding raisins, etc. This really makes the store-bought stuff look pretty bad. Thanks for a great recipe!"

I like the ratio of the nuts to the oats and the cook time/temp is pretty perfect. I kept mine in for an extra 10min bc there wasn't any color change that I could see after 40min. Mine clumped pretty well, so I will follow the recipe again when I make it a second time!"

I also added a mixture of sweetened and unsweetened coconut - about 1/2 cup and an extra 1/4 cup maple syrup to balance the extra dry ingredients. Lastly, to add extra crunch, I added 10 minutes to the baking time at 300 degrees, then another 10 minutes at 400 degrees. Be sure to check often so it doesn’t burn. Enjoy!"

I used pure maple syrup as called for but did substitute coconut oil for the canola oil. Other than that I made as written, including maple flavoring and cinnamon, but since I didn't have pecans I subbed sliced almonds and added flaked coconut and raisins because I like both in my granola. I don't believe these things substantially changes the wonderful maple flavor of this granola. Now the big question - should I keep this to myself or share with DH. LOL"

I baked it on the bottom rack farthest away from the heat source. It makes quite a bit, but I know it will get eaten as cereal or on yogurt or ice cream. I assumed ground flax seed was flax meal and used that. It makes it a little messy if eating it by hand though. Only other downside, of the recipe, is maple syrup is so expensive and this takes 2/3 a cup of it. However, the maple flavor does come through and it smells very good while baking."
