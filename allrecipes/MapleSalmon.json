After 30 mins, I drained the fillets and padded dry with paper towels. I placed fish on foil in the air fryer, which was preheated to 400 degrees. I cooked for 10 mins, then, watched it closely, being careful not to overcook. In a saucepan, I brought pure maple syrup, freshly grated ginger, orange juice, a splash of balsamic vinegar, water, and tamari to a boil, then reduced it, to a thick glaze to pour over fillets. My husband raved about it!"

Versatile and easy, your mid-week supper when you don't want to spend too much time in the kitchen. Note, be sure you cook to a core temp of 145 F measured at the thickest portion of the fillets."

Just aim for that marinade, don't panic, don't even worry about measuring the proportions exactly, or the quantity of fish, or chopping it up, or how long to marinate. (*) I've made it twice, and not only have I not killed anyone, I've gotten compliments. (*) three parts maple syrup to one part soy sauce, and some garlic salt. Do not sweat the details: it's going to turn out fine. I have just done this to a $65 Copper River Salmon filet, and I didn't worry at all. It turned out great."

I let it marinate for about one and a half hours in the fridge, turning it from side to side, and it worked out well.

"reviewBody": "I have made this recipe over 20 times in the several years since I found it - it's one of the only salmon recipes I use anymore. Important tweaks: Instead of garlic salt, use garlic powder and increase the soy sauce for more salt. I also sprinkle in a bit of onion powder and a lot of fresh pepper, sometimes fresh herbs like rosemary if I have them, and triple the garlic. After marinading, SAVE THE SAUCE! Baking it in the oven with the fish destroys it. Simmer in a nonstick pan while the fish cooks until it's thick and syrupy. After the fish comes out, take the sauce off the heat and quickly stir in a good knob of cold butter. Serve sauce over the fish, rice, and a veggie like broccoli. One of my favorite easy meals. I've made this with small fillets and whole sides of salmon, increasing the marinade/sauce as needed. The cook time depends on the size of the fish, but following the recipe will usually give you overcooked fish."

Then added the Marinade 30-40 minutes before baking…. I cooked in a convection oven and use instant read thermometer to avoid over cooking…….OUTSTANDING!!!"

I like garlic so I would add a little extra. My side dish was steamed broccoli which tasted good to dip in the marinade. I wish I made a little extra, because I ran out for the last bit of broccoli to dip in."
