I made my own snow in the Ninja blender. I got the syrup to 114C temperature. I cup of syrup got me about 10 popsicle sticks of taffy. Definitely will make this again when the next snowfall we have."

When on the snow it seems crispy but we smushed it onto the sticks and it got perfectly smooth and sticky as it warmed back up. My kids loved it. We have a new tradition!"

"reviewBody": "This is to all the people who said this recipe did not work: You are probably not using the right kind of maple syrup. You need to get the \"real\" kind. The artificial version like \"Aunt jemima's maple syrup\", and lean more towards pure syrups and canned syrups. You also might be not be heating it up enough...Anyway i hope this helps, i'v never met someone who couldn't nail this recipie!"

Our grandmother would bring the pan and hot syrup out and pour it in the mould. That was the Northern Illinois tradition. Will do it again when we get some fresh snow."

I think I cooked the syrup just a little too long because it came out more like hard candy. I drizzled it on thew snow and they just picked up the pieces. Great success!"
