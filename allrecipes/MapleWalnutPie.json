"reviewBody": "My husband has been buying maple walnut pies for years at the shop where he buys his maple syrup in Vermont. When I saw this recipe, I knew I had to try it, so I made it for our Christmas Eve dessert last night. My very fussy husband said it's every bit as good as the pies he gets from the maple syrup shop and that's high praise from him. He ate half of it last night. I agree with the person who said that the maple extract is for flavor and will not add sweetness. I did not change any of the ingredients in this recipe. However, I have one suggestion: the eggs should be \"tempered\" to keep them from solidifying, which means that you don't want to dump very hot ingredients into your eggs. Instead, add a tiny bit of the hot ingredients at a time to the eggs and that will warm them gradually. There is an easy way to avoid the hot ingredients with this recipe. First, melt the butter in a bowl in the microwave. Next, stir in the brown sugar and flour. Then whisk in cold maple syrup, which has been chilled in the fridge. Now, your butter-syrup-sugar-flour mix is no longer hot and you can add it to the eggs and maple extract."

So good I won a blue ribbon at the Vermont State Fair on pie day ;) Several people have mentioned using vanilla extract instead of maple extract thinking it will cut the sweetness. Extract does not add sweetness only flavoring. Being from Vermont we are all about maple :) If you don't like pecan pie this will not be something you like&gt;remember this is the kind of pie you eat a very small slice of."

"reviewBody": "Very good but I wonder if it is really necessary to heat the syrup/butter mixture first? I almost ended up with with scrambled eggs untill I waited for the syrup mixture to cool. I think next time I will just melt the butter on its own and proceed as with pecan pie; no need to heat the sugar mix. Also, since I am fortunate to have access to real maple syrup, I didn't use the artificial flavoring, cut back brown sugar to 1/3 cup and still this was too sweet; I will eliminate the brown sugar altogether next time- but there will definately BE a next time- YUMMY!"

This is very good. I make the crust using a recipe from this site. The crust I like best is in the \"Danish Apple Pie Bars II\" recipe. Just make sure to refrigerate the dough before rolling it out."

It really tastes similar to pecan pie to me. (Similar in texture, too) All it needs on top is a dallop of whipped cream and it tastes like perfection!"
