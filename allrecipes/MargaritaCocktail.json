"reviewBody": "Pity the poor Margarita. The original concoction was a relative of the Sidecar: brandy, Cointreau &amp; lemon juice served in sugar rimmed glass. The Margarita substituted tequila, with lime and salt being the traditional accompaniments. Then the mongrelization began. When I came upon the Margarita in the 70’s, it had been reduced to cheap tequila, bar mix and a pound of ice to be processed in a blender: an adult Slurpee. Follow the above recipe as if your life depended on it. Use a quality tequila, Cointreau and fresh squeezed lime juice. Triple Sec has always been used by bars as a cheap substitute for Cointreau, but they don’t taste the same. As far as turnbot’s use of an eggwhite, you are on your own. A Margarita is a cocktail, not the breakfast of champions."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is not bad: my \"perfect margarita\" calls for only half an ounce of triple sec (as opposed to 1 once; that much will override the great tequila flavour). Speaking of tequila: your margarita will be as good as the tequila you buy! Avoid the \"well-brand\" tequilas: for an affordable yet tasty tequila, get Cazadores or El Jimedor reposado. I'm not a fan of \"straight up\" style margaritas, so I'll always have mine with lots of rocks (ice), or blended. If you want a really frothy, truly PERFECT margarita... Before shaking, throw in half an egg white into your shaker! You'll never go back - trust me!"
