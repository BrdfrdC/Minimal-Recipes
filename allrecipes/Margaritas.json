I found the frozen limeade mix at Kroger, the Kroger brand, and it was in 12oz. can's. I doubled the recipe with a good blanco tequila and cointreau instead of triple sec. I added about 3 1/2 cans of filtered water in the limeade container. I added a splash of orange juice to finish it. It is OUT OF THIS WORLD!! I would have never imagined! I am totally sharing this recipe with family and friends. SO glad to have found this recipe and tweaked it for my liking ??"

Also add a few ounces of fresh orange juice. After blending without ice, pour into a pitcher and keep in the refrigerator. Then when making a drink just add ice to the blender and whatever amount you want of the mix. Great for unexpected guests or just me enjoying the evening garden!"

We scooped them easily into Margarita glasses right out of the freezer. Ha! We ended up making more and everyone wanted the easy recipe for themselves. Very yummy, very simple and better than any bottled Margarita I've tried. A keeper and this summer's go to cool off drink."

Might try some agave nectar next time.\nAlso, a squeeze of fresh lime juice and maybe a splash of OJ really brightens it up and it's so much better than squeezing a million fresh limes for each drink! I've stocked up on a big quality bottle of the tequila I prefer, a big bottle of Cointreau and a few containers of brand name limeade concentrate, for the ease of it. I'm always on the front porch now that the weather's warm and it's always classy to be able to offer a cold drink. If you're not a margarita snob, definitely try this easy, yummy recipe!\nThis is my go-to margarita recipe if I'm feeling lazy. :)"
