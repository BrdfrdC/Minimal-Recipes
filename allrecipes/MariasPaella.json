I didn’t use chicken, only used a ton of large shrimp and some scallops, traded the rice for jasmine rice, and instead of water used chicken stock. Topped it with a little creole seasoning and sriracha and WOW! Might be one of the best things I’ve ever ate."

I used chicken breasts so I also added chicken bouillion for flavoring. \nThanks for a great recipe in 4 steps!!!!"

"reviewBody": "Wow!! I used 2 1/2 lb skinless boneless chicken thighs cut into quarters...I used 1 3/4 C. rice, 2 frozen chopped tomatoes and a splash of vegetable juice, 2 tsp. turmeric, 1 T. smoked paprika, 1 onion, 1 red bell pepper and 1 orange bell pepper, 1 lb. bay scallops, 1 lb. jumbo shrimp- I shelled them and made shrimp stock from them for the liquid in this recipe. I used 1 1/2 lbs cooked mussels in the shell, 1 C. peas, salt, pepper, 2 cloves chopped/smashed garlic....I sauteed the chicken in olive oil and fresh cracked black pepper, then removed, put onions and garlic in pan for a minute and sautéed, then added peppers for another 2 minutes. Then added rice, 1 lb. sliced fresh mushrooms, seasonings and shrimp stock, red pepper flakes, and chicken pieces back in. Brought to a simmer on med-high- stirred a LOT...then when 15 minutes was up, dumped in peas, shrimp, calamari, scallops, and mussels. Put lid on, turned to low and simmered for 10 min. This made a LOT! Too much for my Dutch oven- (I don't have a wok or a paella pan). I scooped out a bowl full. This took me 2 hours from getting ingredients out of the freezer and fridge, chopping, washing up as I went and cooking. The cooking only took about 30-35 minutes. The biggest amount of time was prepping beforehand. I will make this for company when I want to impress someone:) This is DELICIOUS!! The only thing I forgot was to garnish w/ lemon wedges."

I did 4 cups instead of 6 from the comments stating it was too mushy or more like risotto. I also subbed the calamari rings for beef smoked sausage and used Rotel instead of plain tomatoes. If I had chicken broth I would have used that instead of water. Also the next time I make this dish I will be using more meat then the recipe calls for. Overall we really enjoyed this and I cant wait to try again!!"

I added 3 tbs chopped green olives, 1c peas, 1c smoked sausage, 2 tbs smoked paprika, 2 tsp salt, 1 tbs black pepper, and one minced Jalepeno for a little heat.

Instead of water, I used 6 cups chicken broth plus 2/3 cup of white wine, and also let it cook an extra 10 minutes. Like many other reviewers, I added thawed, frozen peas when I added the meat. \nFIRST TIME PAELLA MAKERS, READ AS MANY REVIEWS AS YOU CAN BEFORE MAKING! All these reviews will greatly help you achieve a perfect entree! :D This is a WONDERFUL, fool-proof dish to make for company! Serve with some fresh fruit and maybe some cornbread for a perfect meal!"

Next time we'll reduce the rice to 2 cups, which will still be plenty. I know paella isn't supposed to be spicy, but we enjoy a bit of fire. We added hot pepper sauce to ours and it was much more to our liking."

The only change I made was to use chicken broth instead of water. An excellent dish with room for variation. Thanks for this excellent recipe- will be making for company soon!"

Instead of using water I used chicken broth and reduced the amount from 6 cups to 4 cups. I saw in a another recipe to add a bay leaf and i did. Definitely brought together the flavors. Last but not least i added large cooked shrimp and fully cooked mussels. AMazing we usually pay $45 at a local restaurant for this and now we can just make it ourselves. Overall great recipe.

We also like a little heat with a bit of cayenne or hot sauce added. I've made this many times and the chicken often remains as a left over, so now I use smoked sausage to round out the meal. I too use a mix of turmeric and paprika as an inexpensive substitute for saffron."

I used half chicken broth and half water instead of all water. I also use Mexican Saffron, which is much cheaper, but you need to double or triple the amount to get the right flavor. Finally, I added sausage both times and it really adds another dimension. I used mild Italian sausage the first time and kielbasa the second. Both were really good. I did use chicken thighs both times, but boneless breast would honestly be easier."

I used a mixture of vegetable broth and fish stock (I made the fish stock with the shrimp and lobster shells). Maybe 1/2 cup white wine? As suggested by another reviewer I used a 14 oz. can of Rotel Tomatoes, I would change that to 28 oz. I added 2 tsp. of HOT paprika, too. Could use more heat, even with that added. I would also suggest not stirring so much, makes the rice mushy. Don't get me wrong, we LOVED this recipe and would recommend this easy recipe to anyone! Plenty of food leftover."

I also had a bag of frozen paella seafood mix from Sam's Club - so I just guesstimated the amount needed. Use chicken breast chunks instead of thighs. I also followed the suggestion to substitue a can of Rotel (used Habenero Rote) for part of the diced tomatoes and that added GREAT flavor. This makes more than enough for 6 people though - we have a ton of leftovers, although that's ok as I don't mind leftovers! Thanks for an awesome recipe!"

I would maybe use a mixture of fish and chicken broth next time for a little more flavor but this was overall a really yummy dish. Such an easy recipe once you have everything assembled. The combination of seafood was absolutely delish!"

"reviewBody": "Lots of great ingredients and I was excited to try. A little disappointed. The rice was not quite cooked and I had to overcook the seafood to accomlish this. Maybe it wasn't enough liquid. I would use a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of the 14 oz. The overall flavor was quite bland. Needed more spices....at a bare minimum some black pepper...and some red pepper or hot sauce if you like it spicy. I think I will also use some chicken broth to replace the 6 cups of water. Open to trying it again with these changes."
