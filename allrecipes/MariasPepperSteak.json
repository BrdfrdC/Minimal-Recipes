It is a quick way to velvet the meat and make it super tender. Most velveting calls for egg white too but it is not necessary. Meat does not dry out and is tender. I used bell pepper strips and sweet onion strips. Basmati rice. YUM!"

The only thing I did differently was I seasoned the onions and peppers with black pepper (a lot of black pepper) and I also seasoned the flank steak with onion powder, garlic/parsley seasoning, and Zatarains creole seasoning and of course, a lot of black pepper. It comes out perfect every time! THANK YOU for this wonderful recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This has got to be the EASIEST Peppered steak recipe I have tried. LOVE the sauce. Cooking with red meat has never been my cup of tea, it usually comes out \"Chewey\", you know when you have to chew a piece of meat longer than normal and eventually spit it out in a paper towel or just swallow it with a gulp of water. With this recipe I've tried it a few times with the Flank steak (great) but this last time I tried it with Ribeye (WARNING: little pricey..but worth it). I sliced it in thin strips, cooked the strips while still pink in the middle, then added it to the sauce for the last 10 min. OMG, SO TENDER, you almost didn't have to chew the meat... family absolutely loves it, (PICKEY EATERS meticulous husband and two boys 14 &amp; 10). This one is DEFINITELY staying in my \"do over\" meal box. Thanks for allowing me to cook a red meat dish with no paper towel in hand or a gulp of water!"

Served over white rice. This is \nreally a delicious sauce, this one is going in the rotation.\n\nIngredient modifications, only because I was out of things: used sugar instead of honey. Used unseasoned rice vinegar and a good size splash of red wine to make up for being out of wine vinegar. Added 2 tablespoons of Sriacha for some kick too."

I had to dump it and make my own sauce to not ruin dinner. Can anyone tell me why that happened?? How much cornstarch to water do you use? Did I add too much? My sauce was not thickening."

Lastly before I started cooking I added a little soy sodium sauce and a dash of sesame oil with the raw meat. I probably should just post this as another recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Recipe as is listed on the website is a 3 star recipe. If you want it to be a 5 star recipe, follow my advice and do this:\n\nOnce you have cooked the meat in the juices, and the meat has tenderized, mix up some corn starch (about 1 TB) and flour (1/4 cup) in about 2 cups of cold water, and then pour it into the pan with the meat. This will form into a delicious gravy that you can then use to pour over the rice. I didn't measure the Corn Starch or Flour when I was cooking, so the above amounts are only guestimates, however, you can easily adjust things according to how thick you want your gravy to be.\n\nI personally added a few Jalapeno's in with the rest of the peppers to spice things up a bit,"

Only things we decided to tweak was to put in less honey - it was a little too sweet with 1/3 cup, so we did about half that the second time and it was perfect, and to add flour to the sauce to make it a little thicker, after everything was done cooking. We found it stuck to the rice a little better."

I'll make this again."

I made a few tweaks as suggested in other posts. I added some ground ginger, red pepper flakes and cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I used stir fry meat already cut found in the meat fridge at the market. Also, because I used more beef I doubled the recipe. Despite the different flavor, it was delicious and quick to be eaten."
