Wine is a good move,skip expensive burgundy ,this is not a Bourguinion, most dry dense wine will do (Hungary). do NOT SKIP searing and go way browner than the video shows, and wait 2 hours to start vegies .No I did nor try as said I can tell the bland result and mushy vegies."

Scraped up all the goodness on the bottom amd poured it over the roast in the slow cooker. Then I made a gravy with the liquid after the slow cooker had done it's thing. Fantastic recipe. One I will do over and over."

"reviewBody": "I have made this pot roast 4 times now. It is a really good meal! However, here are my thoughts/tips: Do NOT put your vegetables in the crockpot immediately. After 7-8 hours, they will turn to mush. Trust me on this. I keep my crockpot on the low setting for the entire cooking time, and I usually wait until I only have about 2-3 hours left of cooking time before adding the vegetables. Also, if you coat your pot roast with a little flour BEFORE searing it in the pan, you will have a much better flavored \"crust\" on the edges of the roast. (I found that tip about the flour coating on another website, and it really helps immensely with the flavor)."

But I did use the dry onion mix and I had celery seasoning and seeds. I also added about a tablespoon of A1 sauce. I even added a packet of the brown gravy mix. I also added a little parsley along with the thyme. Came out so tender and juicy. I put everything into the crock pot around 11pm and by 6:30am, my whole house was smelling heavenly! Now this picture is of packing some for lunch straight out the pot."

I seasoned with Montreal Steak seasoning, browned the meat for 3-4 minutes each side on high on the stove, and cooked it about 7 hours. Four hours into it, I added the carrots, potatoes, and onions. The veggies were perfect and not too mushy! I also added some Rosemary sprigs. This was gourmet!"

Use beef broth instead of water\n3. Add 3 cloves of chopper garlic. \n\nI cooked on high heat for 5 hours. It was good the 2nd time around. I also used starch to thicken then broth after it finished cooking because its very watery."

I changed it up by browning meat in garlic and lotsa salt n peppa and other seasonings. I also added an extra potato, and 4 cut up parsnips with the carrots! AMAZING. Also threw some corn starch in the gravy to thicken. I will use this recipe as a base, because its fantastic."

A lot of times I find a recipe that’s almost what I’m looking for and looking through the comments gives me ideas for how to turn it into something my family will love! I ended up adding the onions with the browned beef and the veggies halfway through. (My fam likes veggies cut small and I didn’t want to lose them in the sauce!). Yummy and easy"

Also, instead of regular salt, I used Garlic Salt to season with pepper before pan searing. The first time I had a smaller roast, followed the directions exactly, and had mushy onions. I’ll post in 8 hrs when this is done."

Pork Loin Roast fell apart like butter &amp; was tender, juicy, and flavorful. A+++++, 5 Stars, Kudos to Marie. Less is truly More. Can't wait to try a beef roast next time, to review again. If I was a betting man I would say it's gonna be another 5 Star rating...."

"reviewBody": "This is now my go-to post roast recipe. Simple and delicious. Prepared according to the recipe, although I didn't have any carrots. Cooked for 10 hours and the roast was fall-apart tender and flavorful. Potatoes were perfect. I set aside some of the juices for later, and whisked flour into the remaining juices for a gravy to die for. (Be careful not to add too much flour!) Since leftover gravy (if you have any) thickens when refrigerated, I will use the set aside juices to thin it out when reheating. Great recipe. Highly recommend."
