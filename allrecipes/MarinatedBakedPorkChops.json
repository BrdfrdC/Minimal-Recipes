Even though I drained the liquid at the half way point as other suggested, and I cooked the marinade on the stove to thicken it, the sauce still was runny - tasty, but runny. Broiling for the last 5 min is key. Hubby liked it more than I did. Good flavour, just not really a thick sauce."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is wonderful! I am a household of one, so I had two inch thick bone in chops and everything else except lemons so I had to substitute Kikkoman citrus ponzu for the lemon juice. I made the full recipe of the sauce and put my chops in a freezer bag and added all the sauce to the bag and tossed it in the fridge to marinate overnight. The next afternoon I took one chop out of the bag and drained out all the sauce, then froze the other chop in the bag for another day with a fresh batch of sauce. After bringing the chop to room temperature I slice up an onion on a sprayed baking sheet, put the chop on top of the onion, added a partially cooked sweet potato, and finished the recipe as directed except that I only cooked the chop for a total of about 35 minutes, until my instant read thermometer said it was at 140. I turned off the oven, covered the pan with foil and let it rest for 15 minutes. While it rested I steamed some green peas and dinner was wonderful! When I cook the other one I will post a picture, too impatient to do that this time!"

I also needed to find a recipe that the kids would mostly agree on. Someone always complains about something. \nThey ALL loved this recipe and even went back for seconds!! Didn't even have leftovers to put away after dinner!\n\nThe only thing I did differently was to add 1/4 tsp of black pepper and I used avocado oil instead of vegetable oil, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. This is a definite keeper! Thank you for saving me with this awesome recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Made this for dinner last night. I did add chopped garlic to the sauce. I didn't make double sauce as I only had 3 chops, but instead I did a separate batch of the sauce to use at the half way point when cooking. I had my thick boneless chops in the marinade for a day and a half. Put oven at 375, sliced a small onion thin and placed on bottom of dish, then poured the chops and sauce out on top. Covered with foil and cooked for 20 min. I didn't pour out any excess sauce at this point as there really wasn't much. Flipped over chops, poured over my extra batch of sauce, left them uncovered this time, for about 15 min, then did 5 min under broiler. They were AMAZING, even my very picky 4 yr old said \"THANKS for dinner mom, it was Yummy!\" We will make this again and will keep this in our regular rotation for sure. Looking forward to the fried rice that we will make with it tonight, as we had half a chop left over and some extra sauce from the pan."

I thought they were a little dry (although my husband and daughter did not complain) so I think I will cover next time as others suggested, and also consider marinating the chops ahead of time."

"reviewBody": "It was great. The only thing different I did was that I used garlic infused olive oil in the sauce that I used to marinate the pork chops. I tripled the sauce so that I could have sauce to cook the pork chops and sauce to pork over the chops. I marinated the pork chops for about 6 hours. with the sauce. It took about 30 minutes to cook. I also broiled them a bit. I served them with corn on the cob and garlic mashed potatoes. There wasn't a drop of food left on the plate. Definitely a keeper."

They retained the flavor of the seasoning which I modified with white sugar and orange juice since it was what I had on hand. Great recipe! Thank you."

I'm not going to lie when he seen me taking out all the ingredients to make the sauce he was like what are you doing? I said mind ya business lol and when he tasted the food he was like this is great! lol.........the only things i did different was double the sauce because I am a VERY saucy cooker and added a 1 tablespoon of lemon juice instead of 1 teaspoon because I absolutely LOVE lemon juice lol.......this recipe was great and I will definitely be using again!!!!"
