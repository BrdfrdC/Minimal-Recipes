I used about 1/8 cup raw agave nectar instead of sugar as it mixes better. And I added about 1 tablespoon dried basil, some minced fresh garlic, along with pink himalayan salt and fresh pepper.

I just use enough to coat the veggies, and after putting the container in the fridge, I flip it over once or twice before serving. I usually make this a day before serving, so the flavors can mix, and the dressing infuses into the veggies a bit. Delish!"

"reviewBody": "Wow, Been making this as well as my mom and grandma for well over 60 + years. It is refreshingly good... And a perfect summer salad. My summer garden is full of zucchinis so try it with zucchini instead of cukes or even both. Add a little Italian seasoning, olive oil if you wish for a change, and parmesan. So simple and yummy. Great just as the posted recipe alone."

The basic recipe is as good a basic recipe as any out there, better than others. We use less sugar. Our tweak is cut razor thin sliced and then chopped but not minced garlic (just because) We use cherry tomatoes sliced length wise, roma in wedges, red and white onions in rings, as splash of each: white wine, white balsamic and apple cider vinegars. We add safflower oil and a wee bit of lime and orange zest with a few thin julienne strips. It is part of our antipasti dishes."

Sprinkle liberally with salt and let sit for 2 hours. Press down with a paper towel to get out all the water and discard liquid. Now you can proceed with the rest of the recipe."

I used shallots instead of onions, mostly because I had them and I wanted to use them up. I'll use onion next time, but honestly, the shallot was pretty great. The sugar and vinegar make a really satisfying sweet and sour combination that goes great with crisp, fresh vegetables. Mom told me to make sure I saved the recipe, so this was quite the hit. I don't know if mom's old \"famous\" summer salad will ever make a comeback."
