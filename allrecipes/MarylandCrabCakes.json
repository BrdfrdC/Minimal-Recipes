For that, I placed some diced sharp cheese in a sauce pan, along with a half cup of cream, and small amounts of garlic and parsley paste.. Once the sauce is heated to consistency, it can be poured over the crab cakes."

However, I thought the saltiness came because I was at the bottom of my old bay can and thought perhaps all the celery salt had settled to the bottom. Thanks to her post I now know where I messed up. I learned to also fill a bowl with cold water then empty the can of crab into the bowl gently swish the crab around then pour into a strainer . This keeps the crab from breaking up. Lay out on paper towel a few minutes to absorb the water. Don't press."

"reviewBody": "I think this is a great basic recipe. I read many of the reviews, and took several of the suggestions when making it. \n\nI used canned claw crab meat. I didn't wash it, but did put it out on paper towels to draw the excess moisture out. I think this is a must do to prevent it from being soggy. \n\nI used 2 eggs. Many suggested this, and its a good one. \n\nNo way 2 pieces of bread would work. I used two complete hamburger buns, top and bottoms. Worked ok, but next time I'll use 3.\n\nI minced some green onions and added them to it. Next time I'll use red or yellow onion, finely minced. I used about 1/4 cup. \n\nAdded some finely diced celery too, about 1/4 cup. Gave it some crunch and texture. It didn't hide the great crab meat taste. \n\nI did use the tablespoon of Old Bay. I started with a teaspoon as someone suggested, but, after adding just 1 tsp, I decided to go the whole tablespoon. Didn't regret it, and it didn't overpower the taste of the crab to us.\n\nAlso added some black pepper, about a teaspoon, and some granulated garlic, a teaspoon. This was good, and it still didn't overpower the crab. \n\nPut the 2 tablespoons of butter in a cast iron skillet, but it wasn't enough. Added a bottom coat of canola oil to the butter, and it did perfectly. Fried the first couple of cakes about 4 minutes a side. This was too long. Next two I cooked for 3 1/2 minutes, just right for my stove and pan. Perfect crust. \n\nI noticed when forming the cakes, either in a ball or patty, they did tend to b"

THANK YOU! Flattening is optional...I flattened it so I could get the crispy brown sides. I have broiled crabcakes and they turn out very dry. Also...never use canned crab meat. It doesn't taste anything like fresh crab. If you live near the shore, buy a bushel of fresh or pre steamed crabs and pick any crabs that are leftover from your crab feast...If you don't live near the shore, buy a tub of fresh crabmeat in the meat section of a grocery store. I have made crab cakes that fall apart....but never when I lived in Baltimore so they should hold together...that's want the egg is for."

"reviewBody": "An excellent recipe (although I pan fried them, then finished them in the oven, which is the \"Maryland Way;\" I'm a chef and native of MD's Eastern Shore). I see the criticisms, and you're right: they can be crumbly...the trick is getting them just right. \"Authentic\" Maryland crab cake recipes can vary quite a bit; a Maryland crab cake is really less of an ingredients list than a philosophy: plenty of Jumbo Lump crabmeat, with just enough filler to bind it together. Thus, the \"perfect\" Maryland crab cake is the one that, if you were to add any less filler, would fall apart. Personally, instead of the bread, I prefer cracker meal, but you will find a different blend of filler in virtually every chef's kitchen...The crabs are the important part, and although I'll always be partial to Maryland blue crab, I must say that the blue crabs they harvest on the Albemarle Sound in North Carolina are (almost) just as good...but don't tell my folks!"

"reviewBody": "This is a truly authentic MARYLAND-style crab cake. In Maryland, you don't want a crab cake that is all tiny bits of crab, and you try to use as little bread/bread crumbs as possible. The goal is to have a huge lump of crab meat that tastes like you have just picked a crab or two and have saved all the meat to eat at once! \n\nOne thing that I have found over the years that helps to preserve the crab meat so that it doesn't shred or break down is to mix everything but the crab before hand, and then gently toss the crab in at the end. I did cut back a bit on the Old Bay, and I prefer broiling my crab cakes to frying them. Since the meat is already completely cooked when you purchase it, there is no need to cook them for long--the goal is simply to have them heated through. And if you are using crab meat from a can, at least be sure to purchase the jumbo lump meat, not the \"fancy\" shredded up kind."

I also read where you should rinse your canned crab meat (which is what I used) and squeeze out any excess water. It worked out perfectly. My family all loved this recipe!"

I would have given it a 5 star, but there's a restaurant in Baltimore that makes the ABSOLUTE best crabcakes around (G&amp;M) and I think there may be a secret ingredient that they use that I still haven't quite figured out what it is. Nonetheless, this was a very nice recipe. Thank You John L."

"reviewBody": "Growing up on Maryland and a crab cake lover this is very close to how I was taught. Some hints for those not from Maryland; Best to use fresh Maryland Blue Crab if possible. If you have to use canned then use Lump meat and drain it with a strainer or towels for 30 min. mix liquid ingred together first and fold in the meat; the idea is to keep the meat in large \"Lumps\". A good cake does not need alot of additional ingred (onion, celery..etc) and Broiled is the best both for taste (in my opinion) and to keep it together. Bread with the ends removed and ripped into little pieces makes the best cake...good luck and hope you enjoy."

This recipe is so simple and the ingrediants are very small only to complement the crab. Very delicious and exactly the way Maryland crab cakes are supposed to be. I only made one small tweek and that was to hit the pan with a small shot of lemon juice to give a subtle hint of citrus. Wonderful job!"

I also shaped into balls as another reviewer suggested and fried in EVOO. I rated as 4 stars since mine were very mushy inside. They didn't hold together at all when I used less bread. Also, same problem when I used imitation crabmeat another time. Looking at the photo, I do notice that the picture shows them much flatter than I made. I do wonder if the white bread turned to mush once it hit was mixed in?? My husband and I liked them, but I probably won't make for company."

Didn't quite taste like it had enough salt but will probably make it the same the next time because it grew on me as I ate it. Husband loved it!! I did add parsley to mine. I did have to cook mine a little longer to get a nice crust but it was still nice and moist inside. Keep those lumps! That's what makes crab cakes taste so good. Thanks John L., this recipe is a keeper for my family!"

"reviewBody": "I just looked into this site and I see that these recipe comments were made quite some time ago. In answer to METAPEDE the one who said don’t add an extra egg because they felt it would stop it from falling apart. That is wrong! The eggs are a binder and breading and cracker crumbs are an extenders, which help make more but take away from the true flavor and cheapen the value. Remember the more inert ingredients you put in the less crab flavor will be there. However, if you want to accent it with your personal touch like a little( I mean little)wine, chives onion, or celery go a head but keep in mind that the more you put in the further you get away from that good old Chesapeake Maryland flavor crab cakes. The think this recipe stands well all by itself! Sincerely, the Flying Cook"

This is a great recipe base, but I have to say...a little too much old bay. I would cut to 1-2 tsp/to taste....and yes, you can taste the raw mixture. I also prefer a spice called J&amp;O because it contains old bay and adds rock salt and some other essential ingredients! I agree with others who say you should broil to preserve the crab flavor and NEVER shred or beat the crab meat. It should be FOLDED in very last! Gave it 5 starts cuz if you sub the bread for cracker crumbs it is my grandma's recipe!"

I used lump claw meat (on sale) which resulted in great flavor. I used 1 tsp old bay for a milder seasoning. I mounded them up like another reviewer suggested and broiled 10 min instead of fried. They will be quite wet when you form them and place them in the oven so don't overdo it on the breadcrumbs because they will dry out. Great recipe."
