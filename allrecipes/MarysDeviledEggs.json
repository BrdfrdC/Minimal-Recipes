So then I tried again with just 4 eggs for my daughter. The measurements for the mustard and Mayo (I hate Miracle Whip) were way too little. I helped it for four eggs and wound up quadrupling what I started with, so double for the full recipe. My daughter ate them so they couldn’t be too bad."

"reviewBody": "The ingredients for these deviled eggs is exactly the way I grew up eating them, except my mom's were always creamy. If you use the amount of Miracle Whip called for in this recipe, you will have very thick, clumpy filling that doesn't make enough for all the eggs. I had to add about 4 times the amount of Miracle Whip. Everything else was just right. Simple and tasty way to make these."

Tip for boiling eggs do your self a favor and get an instapot we used 5-5-5 and the shells practically fall off the egg with no scaring of the egg and the yokes are creamy but cooked."

The only addition is that I add sweet pickle relish and mayo instead of Miracle whip so it is not doubly sweet although I choose Miracle whip over mayo nine times out of ten."
