"reviewBody": "This is a really refreshing take on a favorite squash: butternut! The addition of the toasted pecans, bleu cheese and thyme gave it a true uplift! I would have liked more salt to offset some of the sweet, but that is a personal choice. I also would like to try it substituting honey for the maple syrup. It took NO TIME to bring together; making it an easy fix for a side dish. It does take a trip to the store, most items are not in my pantry. But, while there, I just bought more ingredients to use in a couple of other dishes. I truly loved this and highly recommend as a holiday favorite, or just as a favorite!"
