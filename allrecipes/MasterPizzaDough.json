I switched one cup of all purpose flour for whole wheat and it was still delicious. I will try some other things later to add more flavor like herbs in the dough but for the first time making it I’m impressed. I may also brush the crust with some oil or butter and season before baking next time as well. I baked mine on two Lodge cast iron skillets and they turned out perfect."

Came back to a doubled dough; spread out by hand on parchment baking sheet (didn’t feel like heating the pizza stone in the Texas summer); topped with marinara, fresh mozzarella, ricotta, spinach, mushroom, onion, bell pepper and zucchini! Probably the best pizza I’ve ever made! Used the Italian seasoned variation and it was fantastic!! Definitely looking forward to making this again!! Thank you for sharing the recipe."

"reviewBody": "I would have given this more stars because it ultimately turned out ok, but this recipe calls for waaaay too much water. If I ever make this again, I will start with 1/2 the water and add more as needed, instead of adding more flour as needed. I would try it with bread flour. I made the mistake of preparing a double batch. Because of the water content in this recipe, prep wasted at least an extra hour of my time. I probably added an additional 2 cups (about 1-2 tablespoons at a time), plus probably another 2 tablespoons of olive oil to make it more pliable. I couldn’t get the right consistency with my dough hook, so I ended up dividing the sticky dough balls into 3 portions and working on them separately by hand to get the correct texture and flour content. I added garlic and a little Italian seasoning. After all my efforts, thankfully the flavor and consistency was good, if a bit stiff. I recommend rolling the crust out pretty thin because it rises quite a bit. I did one pizza crust by baking it on a perforated pizza pan without toppings for 4 minutes (that one rose a lot). The other I rolled out thinly on a mat, transferred to a large preheated pizza stone and baked with all the toppings. That one turned out better. I saved the 3rd dough ball in the freezer."

I also used a KitchenAid for the kneading which was perfect. Next time I will add some yummies to the dough as it was kind of bland. This was far better than the prepared pizza dough I have purchased in the past from restaurants.? I may try to precook the dough for a few minutes prior to dressing it."

For the dessert pizza we brushed the dough with melted butter and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar before baking. Then drizzled with Nutella and/or vanilla glaze and sprinkled with crushed M&amp;Ms. The mini pizzas baked for about 12-15 min."

For two weeks,? it will store nicely in an airtight container or a Ziploc bag with air removed. I recommend you pre-bake for eight minutes before topping. Also use oil, butter or an egg wash on the outer crust. I also added extra salt to flavor the crust."

Next time I’ll add a little seasoning to it. I need to go heavy on the sauce because the crust really soaked it up.. this was my first time making crust, as well as using yeast. I’ll be making this regularly. Thank you Made again with instant yeast. I love the crust both ways but maybe lean a little towards the quick ruse. Only because it was a little flatter. Not quite as bread like. Won’t hesitate to make either way !"

It's easy to make this to your liking - thick, thin, one pizza or stretch it to 2. I now add about 1 tsp garlic powder and 2 tsp basil to the dough mix which really makes this tasty. This dough is hardy enough to use any sauce or toppings you desire. I love this homemade pizza! Delivery doesn't compare to what you can do at home with this dough base. We haven't ordered delivery since I started using this recipe. Try it. It's easier than you think. And by far, fresher tasting than you'll ever get from a chain pizza place."

"reviewBody": "I've made this several times, I've made this exactly like the recipe says to. It's a great recipe.\nMy first few times I messed up because I didn't understand about kneading the dough. I kept kneading and adding more flour until it was easy to knead, but what I was really doing was creating a hard crust by using way too much flour. The trick is that you really don't need much more than the 2 1/2 cups the recipe calls for. Knead and knead, understanding that your fingers will be sticky with dough during the process. As you get closer to the 6 minute mark in kneading, the dough just doesn't stick as bad to your hands. You still have a slightly sticky mess, but you shape that into a ball and cover it for 10 minutes and you suddenly have pizza dough that you can roll. I had to look at videos on how to knead pizza dough, lol! This recipe is so good!"
