One thing that did confuse me - directions call for one gallon of water with ice chunks, and then another cup of water.. (?) Any way... Still a very tasty turkey thanks to this brine recipe."

Flavor was excellent, not overpowering just a great flavor. Bird was juicy and tender and skin was beautiful brown. I will continue to use this one for Thanksgiving!!"
