You may want to research more what makes matzah kosher for Passover but in most traditions, it's flour and water only, with a couple of exceptions in Sephardic communities or for pekuah nefesh. \n\n(One of the reviewers suggested adding oil to the dough, which would probably make it a much nicer cracker, but it wouldn't be kosher for Pesach.)"

Following the directions exactly as written produced a kettle cooked potato chip like consistency instead of the familiar crisp-flaky matzo. After checking several Kosher recipes online, I'll be making these with the oil mixed into the flour in the future."

Doing so results in four soft, pliable loaves suitible for folding or rolling up. The bread is soft and chewy, and, of course, delicious!"

I started making these on my pizelle maker but because I had to make 80 servings for a Seder (passover) meal, I also used our oven to quicken the process. There were less bubbles formed in the matzah made in the pizelle than the oven baked versions. Would like to try adding other seasonings on these next time for variety."
