One thing though, if you want palm sized big fluffy biscuits then this recipe makes the classic 6 biscuits in a skillet. You will need to double the recipe for the 12. Try thyme for added yummy-ness. About a tablespoon of dried a little less of fresh. I do not believe there is a better herb to pair with any bread."

I didn’t have any self rising flour so I added baking powder and a bit of salt to my flour, mixed it with a whisk, then whisked the mayonnaise in before adding the milk. The flour mixture was crumbly much like when you use lard or butter, but a bit softer. I was careful not to over mix when I added the flour. The biscuits were as light and fluffy as any biscuits I’ve made. I’ll definitely use this recipe again. For anyone that’s too intimidated to try making homemade biscuits, this is definitely a recipe to try.???"

"reviewBody": "There are many biscuit recipes, and I've tried several that I like. So far, for taste, this one's the best. I did add about 1/3 cup finely shredded cheddar cheese, and curdled my milk with a couple teaspoons of vinegar. Used my hands, per one reviewer's suggestion, to lightly blend. Also brushed tops with melted butter and very light sprinkling of sesame seeds before baking. Baking time about right, turned out fluffy and delicious. Made 6 large biscuits. Thanks for posting."

"reviewBody": "Following the recipe exactly the batter was almost as wet as pancake batter. Still, I tried. I dropped a spoonful onto my parchment-lined baking sheet whereupon it immediately spread out into a flat disk. I had to add 4 more heaping TBS of flour into the bowl to get a nice wet drop biscuit consistency. Then they were perfect. Rose up high and fluffy, with a creamy, tender crumb. Biscuit perfection, although I felt they'd benefit from a little sugar and salt to round out the flavor. I used White Lilly Self-Rising flour, it really DOES make the best biscuits. If it wasn't so easy (and obvious) that the simple addition of extra flour will fix them, I'd give 1 star. But with more flour and my additions, I'd give 5 stars, so I'm settling on 4."

"reviewBody": "I had previously saved this in my recipe box and tonight I needed a little something extra to go with dinner and thought about the mayonnaise biscuits recipe. So I whipped these up while everything else was cooking. \n\nI didn't have any self-rising flour, but I knew the recipe for making two cups of self rising flour, since I've done that many times before; simply combine 2 cups less 4 tsp. sifted flour, 3 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. salt. (Because I'm watching my salt intake, I only used 1/2 tsp. of salt.)\n\nSince they're done in only 12 minutes, they were ready at the same time as everything else and they were delicious! Yes, I will definitely make this again!!\n\nWith just three ingredients and ready in only 12 minutes, these great tasting biscuits are great on their own and anytime. Tonight we ate them with just a pat of butter. Unfortunately we didn't have any leftovers. Think I'll make some for breakfast Sunday; they will be great with jam! (6/2/15)\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWell, I've made these a few more time. I consider these my \"emergency biscuis\" because they are quick and easy in a pinch or as a last minute add on to meal. \n\nI have also shared it with three or four people that say they \"can't cook\" or \"don't know how make biscuits\" and were surprised how easy the biscuits were to make and one lady's family couldn't believe she made homemade biscuits either. ??

The mayo creates a biscuit chemically similar to buttermilk biscuits - it provides the shortening and the vinegar in the mayo reacts with the milk."

Possibly, but I've often found that when he doesn't know about the mayo, he likes things better :)! (He caught me, that time!) I really liked them, and they were easy. I made them a bit too small, I think; they didn't spread out much from the size of the mouth of the glass I usually use to cut biscuits. I'll make them bigger next time. One trick I use for biscuits that worked well with these is to roll out two layers, each half the depth specified, and place them one on top of the other before cutting the dough. The finished biscuits break apart easily to fill them. That worked well with this recipe."
