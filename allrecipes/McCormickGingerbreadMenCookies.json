"reviewBody": "This was my first time making gingerbread so I'm not sure how this recipe compares to others, but overall I thought the cookies turned out pretty good! I followed the recipe as is except for not using McCormick brand for all the spices and adding a little extra ginger. I chilled the dough in the fridge overnight and it was very difficult to work with. It was super sticky and I had to constantly add flour to my board and the dough, I was worried with all the extra flour I was adding they wouldn't turn out right! I baked them for 10 minutes and they came out really well, nice and soft but not too soft. They taste great, could be just a little sweeter though so I may add a bit more cinnamon and brown sugar next time."

The recipe said roll out on a “lightly floured” surface, but my dough stuck badly and I had to scrape it up and try again, twice. Maybe my dough was extra sticky, but I had to use a lot of flour before I could get them up without ruining them."

I didn't have time to let the dough chill in the fridge so I put it in the freezer for a short time and that seemed to work out great-the dough wasn't too hard to work with. I found 8 minutes were more than enough for the cook time and would recommend taking them out promptly. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because in my opinion the cookies were really lacking flavor- and that's after I put in an extra tsp each of ginger, cinnamon and vanilla! I highly recommend using 4 tsp ginger and at least 2-3 tsp cinnamon if you love flavorful cookies. However I would definitely use this recipe again with the added spices."

The only way that I was able to salvage the dough and get it firm enough to cut out shapes was to knead another half cup or so of flour into it. I am giving 2 stars only because the flavor was ok (but just ok). Needs more spices for sure."

It helped to make sure that the dough wasn't too hard before rolling it out but once I learned that and once I floured my surface sufficiently, they came out just perfect! I used a smaller cookie cutter for a second batch and should have taken them out at 8 minutes but 10 minutes (in a gas stove) was perfect for a bit larger cookie. They do expand a bit in the oven so make sure not to overcrowd."

So I took a bite and realized the flavour had intensified over that time. In the end, the recipes stands as is. Will definitely be adding this cookie to my Christmas cookie list."

Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. Refrigerated overnight. It is not a normal cut-out cookie dough - it gets soft very quickly, so it is difficult to work with. I followed another reviewers suggestion of rolling and cutting directly onto the parchment and just sliding the parchment onto a chilled tray. I got 23 5” gingerbread boys, rolled to about 1/8” thick. Baked for 11 minutes gets a perfect cookie with not a lot of crunch, but still gives a good break! Even though you are re-working the dough several times, they cookies still turn out just the same - The orange zest makes this an out of this world flavor!"

I refrigerated my dough overnight (what a mistake) as it made it tough to roll out the next day. Bake times I found are depending on if you like a softer cookie (take out sooner) or crisp which leave it in longer. Not overpowering on the spices, just enough that you do notice it."

With the additions, this is a very tasty cookie! When I made them before, I found the flavor to be a bit bland (as others had stated). We also prefer a crispy cookie, so we baked for 10 minutes (rolled out to 1/4\"). My 8-year old took over the rolling, cutting, and baking, so it is not a complex dough to work with."

I scraped it off of the plastic wrap and my hands... I must have added at least another half cup of flour before giving up and making them into drop cookies. The taste was good but they're gingerbread men without the men."

Position your cookie cutter so you leave 1\" space between each cookie. Lift off the excess dough around the cut-outs and place the cookies on the parchment paper on the tray and directly in the oven. Cookies wont be bent or out of shape using this method. After cooking if the shapes touch just use the edge of your spatula or knife to push through the area and separate gently."

I replaced 1/2 flour with almond flour and the other half with Bob’s Mill gluten-free all purpose flour. Wasn’t certain if the almond flour would ‘interfere’ with the ginger-ness of the cookie, so put 1/4 t more. They came out superbly. A tad of a crunch around the edge and nice and soft within.! Time to make another double batch!"

It just falls apart. I made so much extra so I will definitely have to make changes. I 100% will NEVER make this recipe again. The taste is bland. It's ok but it really lacks flavour. Needs sugar or something. Something is missing in the cookies. I'm disappointed. But hey I tried and time to find a new recipe.\nI doubt anybody giving 5 stars actually made this or followed the directions."

I checked out a few different recipes before finding this one, which had less ingredients than a few others I found. I found this recipe simple to do, and they turned out great. They tasted pretty amazing too. I managed to yeild 2 large, 8 medium,12 small gingerbread men ( I had a 3 size pk of gingerbread men cookie cutters) I baked them a little longer get than suggested, so the little ones came out crispier than I would have liked. the bigger ones were great tho. Going to make them again to decorate with my neices\\nefew, think I will stick to the 8-10 minutes the recipes says. Overall great. Thanks for the recipe"

By the time I got close to finished, the dough was super soft. I rolled mine out on parchment paper and used a little gingerbread cookie cutter and got 50 cookies. My first back with the one large ball as per the instructions, were thicker so I ended up with less. I think if I had rolled these out to 1/4”, I would have ended up with even more. Unless you want extra crispy cookies, 9 minutes was best for a crunchy bottom and soft rest."

The recipe does say it makes only 24 servings, but i ended up with 52 five-inch cookies! (I'm not complaining)\nFor the frosting I made a buttercream. To make it I used:\n-one stick of butter(room temp.)\n-1 and 1/2 cups powdered sugar\n-half tsp. vanilla extract\nI than whipped them together on medium speed for 3 minutes.\n\nOver all these cookies were amazing and I will definitely make them again."
