I also added raisins to the meat for a nice touch. I added brown gravy mix to the water which made it moist and delectable. I also added about two tbsp of cabernet sauvignon. I added a layer of shredded sharp cheddar on top of the meat and then added a one inch layer of garlic mashed potatoes. The entire family loved it."

I caught the pepper part and added before baking, but missed the sage. Ended up adding it at the end by cooking the sage (cut into slivers) in butter till lightly browned then drizzled over the top after taking the pie out of the oven. Also sprinkled my slice with some shredded parmesan. It was exactly what I wanted. While it was baking j thought the cloves smelled too strong, but it wasn't overwhelming in taste, it was perfect."

I covered the meat and onion and all the spices with water, boiled until the meat was cooked. Drained the liquid, let it cool overnight, removed the fat on top. I thickened the liquid with cornstarch, then added it to the pie once I put the meat in the pie shell (gravy). Not too dry and not too wet. Baked at 425 for 15 min. then 35 min or until golden brown at 350 deg. I have been making meat pies for over 40 yrs. and still like the way my mother made it. (as above)"

I had leftover garlic pork steak, a largish piece of grilled beef steak and a cooked chicken breast (threw that in cause cassoulet another French dish sometimes uses chicken). Had cooked whole potatoes so I diced them and mixed with all the diced meats then followed the recipe*. It was wonderful. *Note: I have been cooking for a long time, so one more thing I did was add a tsp of cornstarch to the water to ensure the pie filling held together. My family loved it thank you for helping me use my leftovers!! Oh yeah and this was even better the next day :)"

"reviewBody": "This meat pie was excellent. I followed the recipe, but used Tony Chacheres instead of salt. I'm cajun and use Tony's in place of salt for pretty much everything. I also made homemade pie crusts which certainly brought the pie to the next level. The filling is savory, moist, and filling. I particularly liked the herbs and the clove. It was a real authentic french bistro taste! Yum!"

Also added a few jiggers Worcestershire sauce for flavor. I was a little dry but held together nicely. Maybe I'll add a little sour cream to the potatoes next time."

Have had no complaints as of yet. Happy holidays"

It tastes good with left over beef, pork (or chicken!), left over corn, peas, potatoes, etc. and I've seasoned it plain or spicy and it always comes out good. I do add a teaspoon of flour to help make a little gravy and sometimes a bouillion cube. Sometimes I serve mashed potatoes or rice as a side dish ... it's always a hit!"

"reviewBody": "This was pretty good. I am not a fan of meat pies, but I decided to try something different. The two guys I fed (my husband and his best friend) absolutely gobbled it down. There was one spice I wasn't a fan of (I think it was sage), and would leave it out the next time. It wasn't too dry, but gravy would definitely help because the pie is starchy and feels dry in the mouth (probably due to thick consistency). Overall, not bad, but I'll play around with it next time."

After baking, I let it set for 10 minutes before cutting."

I also used roasted garlic instant mashed potatoes (entire pouch) instead of a regular potato. I plan on using just a bit less cloves next time. This whole dinner was pretty easy and quick to make. It was also by far the best I've ever tasted."
