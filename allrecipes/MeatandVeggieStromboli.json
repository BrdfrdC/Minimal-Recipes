I used frozen peppers and onions because I didn’t have fresh. And I omitted the mushrooms. I think any combination of deli meat, cheese and veggies would be delicious. Make sure you add the herb, egg, oil &amp; Parmesan spread. It makes this so good. And the egg white wash with Parmesan on top makes it so crunchy! I omitted the Italian seasoning on top. We dipped it in Ragu spaghetti sauce. I’ll definitely be making this again and again."

The Parmesan, egg yolk sauce made a rich and yummy addition to the flavors. I used bread dough like the recipe said.

To clarify, I used 1/2 lb thinly sliced ham, 8 slices salami instead of pepperoni, 1/2 cup green peppers, and the roll out type ready to bake pizza crust. I omitted the mushrooms and onions, because hubby doesn't like them. Rolled it up jelly roll style, finished product was about 15 x 4, and baked for 30 minutes. Looked beautiful on the top with the egg glaze, cheese and seasoning."

I wasn’t sure how thin to roll this out, so I just kept rolling until I thought it looked about right. I used all the ingredients listed with the exception of the mushrooms (we’re not fans). My pepperoni was the small size, so I just put in what I thought looked like a nice amount. I did not have any problems rolling this up and it baked up perfectly in 35 minutes. I did let it rest, with a piece of foil laid loosely on top for about 5-7 minutes before I cut it to give the cheese a little time to set up. I served this with ‘Quick Italian Pasta’ and ‘Brookville Hotel Sweet and Sour Coleslaw’ both AR recipes. Family thought I was a “superstar” with this meal. Thanks cris for sharing your recipe! :o)"

"reviewBody": "I made this for recipe group on 3/04/13. If you've never made (or eaten) a stromboli, this is lacking in instruction. It doesn't give any clues as to how big the rectangle should be, how thick/thin the dough should be, or how to roll it up. I have never eaten or made a stromboli so perhaps others take it for granted. Regardless, I got help and got it made. I used homemade pizza dough and pizza size pepperoni instead of sandwich size (about 18 slices). I rolled it up jellyroll style, sealed the end seams like I do a loaf of bread and it ended up being 15\" by about 4\". The only change I made was to eliminate the eggs due to allergy. I coated the inside with olive oil and sprinkled on the seasoning and parmesan. I also sprayed the top with olive oil and that worked to keep on the toppings. It baked in about 25 min in a convection oven. We liked these so I'm not knocking the recipe rating but I would have passed this by due to lack of instructions if it hadn't been a recipe group pick."

The Parmesan sauce shines through in every bite of this Stromboli, a nice change from the regular tomato sauce. I did also top the deli meat and provolone cheese with some shredded mozzarella cheese since we love cheese. Mine was perfectly golden brown in 25 minutes. I enjoyed it just as it, but the son and husband enjoyed dipping theirs in pizza sauce. Very versatile on what deli meats and cheese you use, but don't omit the great Parmesan sauce because it takes this Stromboli over the top. Thanks cris for a great recipe. A keeper in this household."
