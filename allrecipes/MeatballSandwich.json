I used a can of tomato puree and a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the processed sauce. I spiced up my sauce. If you use your imagination, you can make this recipe your own. Very easy to make. One other tip. I used disposable gloves when I mixed the hamburger and other ingredients. Easy peesy."

His are (mostly) just as easy, and is a notably more flavorful meatball, works really well with the rest of this recipe. The most critical components in a meatball sub is in order: *the meatball*, the bread (should be crusty/chewy on the outside and soft on the inside), then the sauce, then cheese."

If you put the sandwiches under the broiler to melt the cheese, be mindful that it takes less than a minute to burn the buns. Don't ask me how I know this. ;-)"

"reviewBody": "I added one pound pork sausage in addition to the ground beef and then doubled the other ingredients to make 24 meatballs. The pork really added another layer of flavor. I also baked them on a rack (sprayed with olive oil nonstick cooking spray) over a cookie sheet, which drained the grease, and then I blotted them on paper towels when done. I researched several other recipes and found this to be the simplest, and in the end, absolutely fantastic!"

"reviewBody": "The best meatball sandwich we have ever eaten. Instead of bread crumbs I use pieces of Italian bread soaked in milk. I have tried several sauces and find we like Paul Newman's Marinara best. When the meatballs are done I simmer them in the sauce for about 30 minutes then store over night in the fridge just because I think most dishes taste better then next day. Makes for an easy make ahead meal Thanks for sharing this keeper recipe."

Instead of topping with the other half of the bread I browned them, assembled with three meat balls per half and top with the Provolone cheese. Then back into the oven to melt . Couldn't just stop with one half and downed both. Excellent."

I also used 45 oz sauce and browned them quickly with no oil then let them simmer covered on very low heat setting in the sauce for about an hour instead of baking. I used hoagie rolls and didnt do the extra steps for them. These were wonderful. Thank you for sharing your recipe"

The only changes I made was that I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried and I don't buy Parmesan in a can so it was freshly grated. I also used mozzarella cheese. To make it easier for the kids with keeping it on the bun, I baked in a cupcake pan and smushed it somewhat flat. Was a very delicious recipe. Of course, the sauce you use will determine how this would taste as well. I was very happy and would make again."
