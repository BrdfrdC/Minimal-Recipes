"reviewBody": "Great recipe - always mix ingredients the night before ( put in refrigerator) and allow to come up to room temperature before baking - if in a hurry, place bowel in a deep pan of warm water and stir frequently. It looks best with a lattice crust. Be sure to use an egg wash (I use one egg with a couple tablespoons of water) - it makes it brown nicely and it glues the parts together."

"reviewBody": "I have a deep dish Emile Henry pie pan which makes a BIG pie. I used 2 packages of NoneSuch condensed mincemeat. Reconstituted it in 1/2 cup of brandy and 1 cup of water. Brought it to a boil and then added 2 tbsp lemon juice. Tasted it and decided Marbalet was right about the brown sugar. Added 1/4 cup Splenda's brown sugar blend. Tasted it again and ended up with the 1/2 cup she recommended. Brandy isn't as sweet as Rum! Set it aside to cool. Diced 3 green granny smith apples. Tossed the apples in 3 tbsp flour mixed with 2 tbsp melted butter. Used 1 cup of fresh pecans instead of walnuts since I don't like the bitterness of walnuts (even though they are healthier for you). Pureed the pecans in my Nutrabullet. I meant to chop them but the gadget is so powerful it practically pureed them and that turned out to be a delicious mistake. Mixed the apples and nuts together and put them in a Pillsbury prepared pie shell. Then poured the mincemeat over it. Topped with another Pillsbury pie crust and crimped the edges. Poked a few holes in the top. Brushed 2 egg yolks mixed with 1 tbsp of water over the crust. Served it warm with vanilla ice cream and lemon sauce (Juice from 2 lemons, 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 1 cup water whisked over medium heat for a few minutes). it was a big hit! OOhs and Ahhs from people who said they didn't like Mince Meat pie! Next time I'll refrigerate the mincemeat overnight &amp; try Rum as suggested. The brandy was good though!"

"reviewBody": "This is my first mince pie. I used Nonesuch mincemeat (which isn't meatless!) and cut the sugar in half (and could have omitted it). I figured I'd use my deep dish pie pan so I used 4 small apples and the whole 27 ounce jar of mincemeat. After I'd let it chill overnight I discovered that even with the extra filling it was too little for the deeper pan. I used a regular pie pan and it was fine. I'm not sure how it would have worked with only 18 ounces of mince and 2 apples, though! I also added about 1/4 cup of flour, as the filling had a lot of liquid. It went over surprisingly well. A very tasty pie!"

I used ready-made pie crust, and followed recipe using rum but also mixing in 1/2 cup each golden raisins &amp; sweetened dried cranberries. For the top pie crust, I used a Linzer cookie cutter to make 1 decorative cutout, brushed with milk, &amp; baked. After 30 minutes, we brushed the top crust with beaten egg &amp; dusted with sanding sugar. Pie was lovely &amp; hubby loved it! Obviously, a good recipe with winning results on my first try. Thanks!"
