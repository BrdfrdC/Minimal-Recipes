Instead of the soup and tomato paste, I used about ½ of a 24oz jar of jarred Spaghetti sauce. It came out perfect!"

I’ve also used more rice as necessary. Hubby likes for me to put his in a green pepper, so I stick a couple in the corner of the pan and fill."

"reviewBody": "The family loved this! I only changed a few things to meet our liking. I added one fresh jalapeno, chopped, and grated zucchini. I omitted the two cans of tomato soup and can of tomato paste due to the amount of water the zucchini created. It turned out perfect! No \"soupiness\" to it at all and still left with a satisfying amount of tomato flavor. Thanks for sharing your recipe."

I hate it when people change the recipe and then rate their new version, but I'm going to do it anyway, because I don't think I really changed the integrity of the recipe - but you decide. I wanted a richer tomato flavor for the topping so I used tomato sauce instead. And I used 3 cups of cooked rice. That was it - just a matter of preference. This one's a keeper, however you make it."

This was still very yummy. \nAlso, I would highly suggest cutting in half or at least down by a third. I served this to 4 girls ages 10 to 16 and myself and still had leftovers, and I cut the recipe down to half. \nOne change: I would suggest using more rice."

"reviewBody": "This was a big hit at my house with both my husband and my 1 year-old. They both cleaned their plates and had seconds. My son actually ate three bowls of this the first time I served it. Winner!\r\nI liked it, too, although it's definitely more of a mild-tasting crowd pleaser than a unique and unusual taste. It's simpler than stuffing peppers, though, and fulfills the same craving.\r\nAlthough I haven't tried it, I suspect it would freeze well, which is another plus in my book."
