I did put in a cup of onion instead of 1/2 c., and also added a jar of marinated artichoke hearts along with the can of diced tomatoes (the kind in Italian seasonings). I also added 1 T. Italian seasoning with the other herbs. Also used closer to 1 c. of the wine. I had problems with the chicken (boneless, \nskinless thighs) getting browned, what with the wine being in the pan with the oil, so I heated up another fry pan with some olive oil and browned it up in that. While that was browning I worked on the sauce. When the chicken was done in that pan, I fried up some zucchini, onions and mushrooms with some more Italian seasoning in what was left from browning the chicken. It all came out great. I served the chicken over basmati rice, and sprinkled with feta. Awesome!"

Also used and shaved home grown garlic and herbs.\nDelish. This is a versatile sauce and cans can be made for various proteins!\nThanks"

It's a little bland if you season it at the end. I've also tried it with green olives and they are just as tasty. It tastes like a gourmet meal without the effort. Great recipe. Thank you!"

We were extremely pleased with the dish. The balance of flavors was excellent, no flavor overtook the dish and they all brought something to it. We did use the fresh tomatoes and herbs. When we make again we will precut the breasts into serving size (4oz each) and we will also salt and pepper the breasts and the tomatoes as we add them instead of at the end. Also, we will make sure to serve with a nice crusty bread!"

The next time, I will substitute oregano for the thyme and increase the basil. It's such an easy dish to prepare that I think it's just a matter of tweaking it a bit for my taste. It's well worth the effort for this good 1-pan chicken dish."
