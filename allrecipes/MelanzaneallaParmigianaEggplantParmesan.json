"reviewBody": "YUM! A perfect late-summer meal! I'd been craving eggplant Parmesan, and this was a great recipe. I used two large eggplants, rather than 6 lil' farmers' market ones. I also had a 25 oz bottle of passata, so I used the whole thing because I like plenty of sauce. I made this with half scamorza, half mozzarella, and it was delicious! Oh, and I was also running low on olive oil, so I used barely any oil and a hot cast iron skillet for the initial cooking step. I think I used 1/2 teaspoon salt in the sauce, and that - combined with coarse kosher salt sprinkled on the eggplant, plus the salty cheeses, was perfect for me. Great dish."
