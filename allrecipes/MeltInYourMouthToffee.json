"reviewBody": "I have used this in the past. It is the basic toffee recipe. Although I normally put the chocolate chips on the top so that when they melt you can spread it. I also find that after you add the nuts and chocolate if you put it in the freezer to cool you will end up with a more tender toffee. One thing I hate about these recipe posts is that I cannot print the recipes. When I click on the print button it takes me into the Allrecipes app which does not have any way for me to print. It is very frustrating. I save many recipes as but if I want to make it I like a hard copy. For me it's very difficult to read a recipe while I'm cooking that is showing up on my phone or my laptop. Especially since the phone will time out after a few minutes."

"reviewBody": "I’ve made it twice now. Both times I had about 1/2 C of pure yellow butter pour out after the brown sugary mixture pours out. \nIf you put the nuts and then choc chips in pan first, many of the nuts will not imbed into the mix and the chips will be soft, but still whole. \nUse a bigger pan than 9x13 because it’s too thick. Two 8x8 pans would be perfect so a knife can cut through the whole length at once. Pour the mix into an untreated pan, then add nuts and use spatula to push them down in. Then add choc chips and smooth the top of them after they melt with a silicone spatula. I used sliced almonds and chopped walnuts. Both are good. \nI heated on low flame to 300 degrees, and did not stir at all once butter melted, so why did some of the butter separate? After it cools in the pan, it can easily be flipped over onto a cutting board. It pops out of a movable pan easily, so no need for parchment paper."

( I used almost 2 c. of nuts. I foil lined a cookie sheet and sprayed it with cooking spray. After the butter/sugar was done, I added 1/2 of the nuts to the hot mixture along with a teaspoon of vanilla and poured it into the pan to cool. I used milk chocolate chips and melted them in the microwave. Pour and spread chocolate over the butter mixture and sprinkle with remaining nuts. Chill and break into pieces. What a luscious, homemade gift to give in individual celofane bags tied with festive ribbon. Excellent!!"

And I suspect the other suggestions about adding corn syrup and water would make a positive difference in the texture of the mixture. This toffee was much too thick, stuck to our teeth, and the chocolate chips didn't fully melt, no doubt because of the small pan which crowded the chips and nuts. I was so eager to make it and then so disappointed once I did."

"reviewBody": "I have been making toffee for many many years. Some years it would turn out but other years it would separate. Reading the reviews here, I learned to lower the heat and stir occasionally to re-integrate butter into the sugar. I used to use 2 cups of white sugar, but since I like brown sugar &amp; I saw this recipe, I added brown sugar. The only thing I changed was that I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract as well. Having the temperature listed instead of trying to go by the color (my old recipe said to match the color of a brown paper bag) makes it much easier too. I used a big bar of 72% cocao dark chocolate for mine—it provides a great contrast and is more like a Skor bar than a Heath bar. We have nut allergies so I don’t use nuts, but this is a hit every year!"

This has definatly made the cut. .I made it just like it said too. And the whole family loves it. I think the only thing i will do differently is let it sit at 300 F for about 2-3 minutes then turn the heat off. This way it is truly at hard crack! Other than that..

And this is runny with butter. I don't know what happened, seeing how this is the 2nd batch I've made that this has happened to My first batch was made following recipe as is. Made it for my mom, and she said sitting out on the counter, this started to separate. This was made on a cold Dec day."

Also, it took us longer than 20 minutes to reach 300 Fahrenheit on the candy thermometer. But in all honesty, I did turn the flame down to medium low after it had reached a boil. The toffee came out perfect. And now that I know these tricks, I will make again. It is so much less expensive than Crate and Barrel's English Toffee and tastes just as good."

The butter separated at 260 degrees according to my thermometer, that was NEW last year and it wasn't a cheap one. So make sure your thermometer works. My husband came along with his digital heat sensor and it was at least 40 degrees off. I will try again, knowing now that I gotta find that temp that is perfect. I still poured it in the pan, it wasn't burnt. See what i get. I've been baking for about 30 yrs, and candy making I don't do alot of. I have successfully made Caramels though, so there is hope!"

"reviewBody": "Tip: use a bigger pot than you may think you need. The toffee grows as it cooks. I melted the butter and mixed in sugars on temp 4 on my stovetop with constant stirring. I added 3 tsp of corn syrup to reduce the grain in the sugar. Kept on 4 and was patient until it started to boil which was awhile. Be patient and don't get paranoid. Once it started boiling I stopped stirring and stuck my candy thermometer in the mix. Was patient again until it reached 300f. Have already prepared your chocolate and nuts in your pan, and dump hot toffee on your chocolate and nuts. Be sure to melt the chocolate ahead of time as the toffee will not melt the chocolate. Let cool. Break. Enjoy."

I made it on a nice dry Colorado day humidity aprox. 15%, it didn't come out. I brought it to temperature nice and slow over 45 minutes, it didn't come out. I tried adding water to recombine the ingredients and it didn't come out. I spoke with my daughter who has never had a problem with it and I will try one more time her way.... basically quick and dirty, bring to a boil and turn it off. Good luck to everyone who tries this recipe."

I tried putting candy cane sprinkles on one half, but they just didn't go with the toffee as well as the nuts. I thought the toffee was still too think and difficult to eat. It got stuck in my teeth and I really wasn't a fan. Most folks that had some didn't seem to like it much either, but my mother couldn't stop eating it, so I'll be keeping the recipe."

I have an electric coil burners and set the dial at just below 5. I was surprised at how long it took to get to the hard crack stage range on the thermometer once the boiling started, so hang in there! I used a 10x15 jelly roll pan lined with foil (I lightly buttered the foil) for a thinner toffee. And after it had cooled a bit, I sprinkled the chocolate chips in top, waited a few minutes, and then spread it. I sprinkled pecans on half and left the other half plain. Very pretty, very rich!"

It smelled burnt before it even reached 250 degrees. By the time it hit 300 degrees it was just a dark pitiful blob and my kitchen was smokey. I didn't even bother with the chocolate/nut part of the recipe because it was just a disgusting mess. It looked like tar. Going to try a different recipe. As a follow-up, I found another recipe for toffee on a website called \"Cooking for Engineers\" which is VERY specific on each step and the batch following their instructions worked perfectly. The only difference is it doesn't use brown sugar and it tells you to stir constantly. I think the stiring is what was needed in my case."

This is my favorite and \"go-to\" toffee recipe! Thanks Ruth for sharing your recipe."

I turned up the heat, and it eventually reached 300 degrees, but the candy burned. Can anyone tell me what I did wrong and why the temperature dropped? I did not lower the heat or stir it once it started boiling. Thanks! UPDATE: I have since discovered that the expensive, new candy thermometer I purchased for the holiday season candy making was off by 200 degrees! No wonder the recipe wasn't working out! If I had tried this using the old-fashioned water testing process, I'm sure it would have come out perfectly. I think I'll stick to that method, and will try this again next time I want toffee.

"reviewBody": "This is the best toffee I've ever had! I don't like walnuts, so I used cashews. I also dipped each piece in melted chocolate and then crushed cashews after I broke it up! Everyone was right.... DO NOT STIR while it's boiling, and it takes a long time to get up to 300 degrees (about 30-40 minutes), but WELL worth the wait!"
