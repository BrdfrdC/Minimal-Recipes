I was a bit adventurous and decided to use my cookie press and it was just fine despite the few hiccups I had. I had never made cookie press cookies, so to be the first time they came out really pretty and tasty. They are airy. My only modification would be to next time use a bit less salt, but that is just my preference. Will make it again to get a hang of the cookie press and practice. They make the perfect holiday gift. They reminded me or the Royal Dansk cookies, but these taste a lot better so buttery."

The family LOVED these. \nAs others stated the cookies crumble easily when first out of the oven. In order to prevent them from breaking I cooked them on parchment paper and slid the whole paper to the cooling racks. Once they cool they are still somewhat delicate, you must pack in a box if transporting anywhere. They are likely to crumble in ziploc bags."

Personally, I didn't love them, and the massive amount of butter per cookie gave me heartburn, to be honest."

I even sprinkled some icing sugar on top to attempt to “save” the cookies as they had zero flavour while they were still warm. Nothing. To add to this review my GF and myself utilize Allrecipes constantly as our “Go To” place as virtually no fail. Obviously in this case , in our opinion these shortbread fall way , way SHORT!!"

Definitely know your stove and I suggest standing by them while they bake to keep a eye on them. \nBut honestly amazing. After I made the first batch I made 2 more! 1 more for my family and another for a friend. Perfect for holidays ."

I used homemade vanilla sugar that I ground in the food processor for the icing sugar and added 1/4 tsp salt as I use unsalted butter. This recipe yielded 32 cookies using my #2070 scoop, I baked at 350 for 14 minutes, turning pans halfway through, I used 4 of each red and green glace cherries quartered to decorate the tops. Thanks!"

"reviewBody": "These are absolutely wonderful texture wise! They just melt in your mouth. I make these a few times a year and always receive compliments. The reason for my 4 stars rather than 5 is because when made as written I find that they are mostly tasteless with a hint of a butter taste, but mostly all I can taste is flour. The best shortbread have a more pronounced flavour that these are lacking. I now add vanilla extract and that gives these what they need to be 5 stars in my books. It all comes down to preference, I suppose. Thanks for the recipe!"

We finshed the rest of the batch but I don't think this will be a repeat for me."
