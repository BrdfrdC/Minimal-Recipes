I put the shredded jalapeÃ±os jack cheese on top and broiled for 7 mins. I put sliced avocado on top with lime juice and some sour cream. It was soooo delicious!"

I made the tots in two 9\" cake pans, then we built our own. His had more tots, a lot of pulled pork, lots of jalapeno slices, hot bbq sauce, and the pepperjack cheese. (He likes a lot of heat!) Mine had less tots, a moderate amount of pork, no jalapeno slices, mild bbq sauce, and cheddar cheese. (Yeah, I'm a wimp.) We were both extremely happy with our efforts. Just the way we wanted! Will definitely make it again!!!"

I used tiny tater tots so they'd be sure to be extra crispy like the recipe called for. Ore Ida potato crowns would work also for the extra crispy tots. Will make again."

Bought coleslaw from the deli, and used two bowls of Curly's BBQ pulled pork instead of making my own. 30 minutes in a 425 convection oven was long enough for the tots to be nice and crisp. While I'm sure homemade coleslaw, pulled pork and BBQ sauce would be even better, I've got to say this short cut way was super delicious! I'd serve this to company any day!"

We had to go buy the ingredients to make this so he could try it. He used his pulled pork, home made bbq sauce that our daughter makes , bread and butter jalapenos and he added some ghost pepper salsa, and I made a lime cilantro cole slaw, other than that he followed the recipe exactly and it was awesome. We are serving this today for our super bowl party. He would give this more than 5 stars if it was possible."
