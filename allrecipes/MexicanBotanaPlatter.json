Excellent recipe, excellent outcome! Added a beautiful Mexican flan for dessert. \nFor those concerned about the leftover guacamole getting yucky, considered adding guacamole seasoning that can be found in packets at supermarkets; it keeps my guacamole edible for several days."

The peppers and onions were surprisingly good, but I sprinkled with extra FRESH peppers and onions like our local restaurant was extra YUM!! I also used homemade refried beans and restaurant-purchased fresh chips."

My family has been making Botana for many years and many have tried this. It doesn't taste anywhere near as good nor as authentically Mexican, with bagged chips."

"reviewBody": "I made this last night and it was phenomenal! My boyfriend is from Texas, and we currently live on the Jersey Shore. He works very hard, 6 days a week at an Italian restaurant. Since he works late every night, he usually misses dinner with the family, so every Saturday night I make him a big meal to come home to, and this week he wanted something in the line of fajitas. This recipe looked so good, and it did not fail to WOW him. I made it mostly verbatim, with the exception of the guacamole - I didn't have any lemon pepper on hand so I used regular pepper, and added a splash of lemon juice and lime juice to the guac, and it was SO good, he ate three servings and was so full he couldn't move for awhile, lol. He's bringing some in to work today to show it off to his coworker, who is from Mexico, and I'm pretty interested to see what he thinks since his wife is an amazing cook when it comes to authentic Mexican food. I was very very pleased with this recipe and it is now a regular in my recipe keeper, thanks Rhonda35 for posting!"

"reviewBody": "This was excellent! Served with warm tortillas, the spanish rice from this site, and mmm mmm good traditional margaritas, everyone loved it. I made only minor changes - used probably double the amount of fajita seasoning and used refried black beans instead of regular. In a pinch I would use storebought chips, but the homemade were fabulous, really made it impressive, and were well worth the effort, which really wasn't that big of a deal (made the day before and put in airtight container). The only thing I would do differently next time is serve the avacado/guac on the side because if you have leftovers (and you likely will!) it turns brown and looks and tastes ugly, even having added lime juice as a retardant. Definitely give this one a try for your next Mexican feast. It's a keeper!"

"reviewBody": "This is an excellent dish for any party. It takes a lot of work and time, but you can make it simple and easy. For example, you can make the chips and meat a day or so ahead of time and then all you have to do is assemble and bake when you are ready to serve. I also agree with others about buying chips. With so many brands to chose from, you can easily find a comparable chip and save yourself a lot of time. Finally, this recipe makes a ton! I only made 1/4 of the recipe. I highly recommend that unless you are making this as a main dish item for an extremely large family with big appetites, you might want to consider cutting it in half."

Used exact quantities and had enough to make (2) casserole dishes. The overall taste was good, but not sure it was worth all the work. Next time I would buy the chips which would cut down the time a lot (and save on fat I'm sure). Also, use of fresh ingredients in the guac like real lemon and garlic (lemon pepper?) plus a little sour cream yields better results."

While the meat was cooking, I added a packet of Sazon and some minced garlic. I left the avocado, sour cream, tomatoes and jalapenos on the side, and let everyone put their own toppings on each serving. We all liked this very much and I will make it again. Thanks for the recipe!"
