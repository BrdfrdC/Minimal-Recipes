I couldn't find just 6 ounces of Chorizio sausage, I had to buy a whole pack of it which was 19 ounces. We made the whole pack of it and we used 7 eggs (I always buy extra large eggs so we only added 1 egg). I added some chopped green pepper and onion to the sausage when I was frying it. My husband doesn't like the corn tortillas so we used flour tortillas. Just the two of us, so we have some left over for quick breakfasts during this week!....Thanks much for the recipe!"

But first let me say this I've probably eaten my own weight in Huevos con Chorizo over the last 40 years and it's a great simple Mexican breakfast taco so I encourage you to enjoy the recipes of Eggs with Chorizo. I wish that recipes would offer advice on 'chorizo' depending on your latin sausage chorizo can mean at least 10 different types of sausage and MOST or not that proper for scrambling with eggs. buy a fresh pork or beef chorizo that you can find in the refrigerated sections of Mexican friendly supermarkets. It come sin plastic tubes and is quite runny with chiles. Other types of 'chorizo' will not be as good."

I added diced avocado, diced tomatoes, chopped green onions, salsa, mexican shredded cheese and it came out perfect. You can also use ground beef instead of sausage and season the beef with a homemade taco seasoning recipe"

"reviewBody": "This is very traditional. Our Mexican family makes them this way but we seldom use cheese. It is a taco (corn tortilla) and if you want a burrito, use flour tortillas. Rice or potatoes are a good addition for burritos. Splash a little vinegar (during cooking) or lime juice when served (op.) to brighten the flavors. Egg whites are not necessarily healthier. The egg yolk has all the vitamins and some of the protein. Cholesterol is hereditary according to my doctor. Mine is good and I eat whole eggs every day. I like my food a little hot, hubby doesn't so I use Tobasco or Louisiana hot sauce. We make our own salsa, we call it pico de gallo. Onions, tomatoes, fresh cilantro (no salt). Salt extracts the moisture from the veg."

"reviewBody": "first, Chorizo can be purchased as Pork or Beef, Perhaps it is also made from other fatty meats as well I have heard of Goat Chorizo, it is made from the Salivary glands, lymph nodes &amp; jowels of the pig mixed with spices and packed in the casing which are the intestines. I was taught how to prepare chorizo by a mexican, you brown the chorizo add eggs and scramble together I prefer to add sharp cheddar cheese to melt in the mixture, I serve with sour creme and top with more cheese, Jack or Cheddar and avocado when available. I find this served with Corn tortillas better than flour. Someone asked about how to prepare black beans, 1st go to market, buy a package of black beans, follow cooking directions printed on the package, like any beans, you simply boil them slowly in water, can add onion garlic meat or whatever else you want, cook until soft easily mashed between your fingers."

That's the only change I would make to this tasty recipe--making the tortilla closer to bite size and included in the mixture."

I usually make breakfast burritos for my husband and anyone that knows that burritos are usually made with flour tortillas and TACOS with corn tortillas can appreciate this recipe. I didn't change a THING! I will suggest using a cast iron skillet for heating the tortillas, that is what my mom always used, and Tapatio hot sauce. We owned a Mexican restaurant when I was little and my aunt was the prominent cook/chef and she made something similar to this for us in the morning with shredded cotija cheese. ANYONE that would give this recipe a mediocre or bad rating obviously does not know how to prepare these correctly so they should just stick to Jimmy Dean or McDonalds and quit trying to cook!

In here,when we have huevos con chorizo (eggs and chorizo) we just fry the chorizo and add the eggs ans salt, that is all, some people eat it with bread others like it with corn or wheat tortillas, but the tortillas are served aside, some take a tortilla and make a taco, others just take a bite of the eggs and then a bite of the tortilla, same with the salsa, homemade or from a can (not the liquid kind like tabasco or habanero, just green or red blended salsa), some like it some don't, I personally think the chorizo flavor is strong enough, pouring salsa over it is too much for me; and you can serve the dish with re-fried beans or fresh avocado slices. I just don't know where to get the Monterey Jack and I'll change the tortillas for tostadas, they will be easier to eat"
