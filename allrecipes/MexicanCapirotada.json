"reviewBody": "The recipe is close to what I make but I do it a little different I don’t add the butter and I use a different mixtures of nuts depending on my mood. I also use a mixture of different dehydrated fruits as well as the raisins. I like to use is raisin bread or Cinnabon bread. Other than cinnamon I like adding nutmeg allspice and hold cloves. I’ll then take the clove and cinnamon sticks out After sun boiling then add the fruit and nuts to plump it up. Then add the bread and cheese into the pot for well make it thick And you think so that all you have to do is put it in the baking tray and bake it for a little bit and it comes out great."

"reviewBody": "This is the best and most authentic capirotada recipe EVER, but I did alter it a bit to suit my family’s preferences. I added: \n\n2 large peeled, sliced apples, golden delicious \n2 cups of pitted prunes (whole) \n2 cups water\n\nI also substituted coarsely chopped pecans for the peanuts. \n\nAccording to your family tradition, some people add bananas, coconut, pineapple, etc. My family prefers my rendition, but you can make it to suit your family’s likes/dislikes."
