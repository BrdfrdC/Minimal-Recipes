"reviewBody": "I have made many ‚Äútortilla-layered casseroles‚Äù from this site over the years and this one is one of the best I‚Äôve tried! I tried my best to adhere to the recipe but I don‚Äôt buy ground chicken; for no reason other than I never think of adding it to my grocery list! So, I used 4 chicken breasts that I cubed very small. Yes - a little more prep time but wanted to get as close to ground as possible. I also added a bit more cheese - some per layer. Other than that, no changes! Let sit 10 minutes after baking as recipe says and you have perfectly cut squares! Served with lettuce, black olives, salsa, sour cream and sliced avocados. Yummy!! My husband loved as it reminded him of his favorite, never deviates from dish at his go-to Mexican restaurant. We both overate a little tonight with minimal regret! Thank you for posting this awesome recipe! Will absolutely make again!!"

I made some changes due to what I had on hand, I had diced tomatoes, without chiles, and 8 oz of tomato sauce, so I added 8 oz of mild chunky salsa and I used Monterey Jack and cheddar cheeses. You know people love it when they go back for thirds!"

I used a low fat Mexican cheese blend and white breast ground chicken to reduce the fat a little as well. The spice level is perfect, it baked beautifully (in the exact specified time), and it was a hit!"

"reviewBody": "I liked this a lot and will make it again, but I will change a couple of things. I didn't have tomato sauce so used an XL can of rotel. It needs the sauce to make it thicker. What I will change about the recipe is the cheese. I will mix at least half of it in the sauce instead of putting it all on top. The way the recipe is written the bottom just falls apart and there is a solid sheet of cheese on the tortilla on top so it's just hard to eat."
