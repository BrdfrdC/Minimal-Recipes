I made a double recipe for a summer cook-out and 2/3 of it went (not bad for only 20 people and a lot of other food available). I may add a pinch of cayenne next time. My husband loved it too. I have to say though that it's a bit tricky spreading those layers of guacamole and sour cream over the tomatoes. I'll make it again. And, again probably."

"reviewBody": "I added taco meat to this (use 1lb ground beef, sauté it according to taco mix directions and add taco seasoning packet. Put it in the fridge about 5-10 minutes before layering in your serving dish). While the meat is in the fridge cooling down a little bit, I added 1/2 tablespoon taco seasoning to the refries beans after warming it up and about 1tbs to the sour cream (I used 16 oz of LIGHT sour cream). First layer of my 9x13 dish is —refried beans, followed by later of taco meat, followed by layer of the sour cream and cream cheese mixed, layer of green onions, tomatoes, cheese and black olives. I didn’t use the guacamole because we don’t like it. So make sure you get 2 packets of taco seasoning (1 for meat, and about ½ of the second one for the refried beans and sour cream). I definitely recommend using 16oz of sour cream instead of 8oz. I used fat-free refried beans and low fat sour cream--NO ONE could even tell! Overall Great recipe!"

I stirred the taco seasoning into the sour cream instead of sprinkling it over the beans. I also doubled the cheese. Really really good. We've been snacking on it for the last hour and it's almost gone."

It was very good for the school potluck but I think next time I make it I'll make it a bit spicy."

I have been doing this recipe for over 16 years. Fast and easy for any level cook"

Allow to set in the fridge over night or at least a few hours so the flavors have a chance to come together. This was a great recipe to involve my toddler in the kitchen. She helped mix half the taco seasoning in the refried beans and the other half in the sour cream. She was also great at sprinkling on the cheese, tomatoes and olives."

Remember to leave out the hamburger if your event is on a Friday night during lent because no one would eat it the first time since it had meat in it! The second time, it was also perfect. It takes a lot longer than the recipe says. Between browning the hamburger and letting it cool and layering everything just right, it took 45 min. to an hour."

"reviewBody": "This is really good. I made the slightest of changes in that I mixed just a bit of the taco seasoning into the refried beans &amp; then the rest into the sour cream. Also, instead of topping it all with the guacamole, I went in this order:\nbeans,\nguacamole,\nsour cream,\nshredded cheese,\ndiced tomatoes,\njalapenos.\nThe reason for this is that the avocado browns when exposed to air. You can squirt lime juice over it to help slow it down, but it's just easier to put the guac between the beans and the sour cream. No browning. :-) Also, I think you can use softened cream cheese in place of the sour cream if you prefer."

Then instead of a chopped tomato, I add a layer of chunky salsa over the sour cream then on top of the cheese in addition to the olives and onions I add chopped pickled jalapenos. The dish is always empty when leaving a party."

I have never personally tried this (can not stand taco seasoning or black olives) but my fiance' requests this for any function, gathering...weekend. Everyone always raves about this, I am constantly asked for the recipe and there is never any left."
