Perhaps 5 min on each side works if you‚Äôre cooking a bunch, but for just one baked potato, I suspect it wouldn‚Äôt take more than 2 min per side. Or perhaps you‚Äôre using an old microwave with less power than the newer. Regardless, my potato was inedible On another note, to read the lower reviews, it seems I would have to scroll to the end of the nearly 300 reviews. I saw no way to sort them so I could see what others had to say."

"reviewBody": "Someone give this person the Nobel Prize of Lunches! I have a 5-pound bag of russet potatoes that I have to use. They're too small for dinner-baked potatoes, and they're too small to justify warming up the oven an HOUR early for traditional baked potatoes. This works so incredibly well and I get a lovely hot lunch in under 15 minutes.\n\nIf you still want that crispy outside skin, you'll need to \"finish\" the potatoes in the oven for 5-10 minutes. Otherwise let them rest for a minute or two before pulling from the microwave and have at it! I love them. \n\nI'd caveat that this likely depends on your individual microwave, and most of us are doing this in home-style microwaves. If you're using an industrial microwave you might need less time as usually they go at MUCH higher wattage. (Warning because my office has industrial microwaves and even though I work from home now, there have been exploding-potato incidents in the past.)"

My innocent potato‚Äôs 10 minutes in the microwave has added 100 years of age to it - it is impossibly wrinkly and dried out. I pushed a fork at it and it simply sunk into itself. The reviews are more helpful than the recipe. I‚Äôll be sure to use a moist paper towel and give my potato some mercy from the heat next time. Please don‚Äôt submit your potato to the horrors of old age."

That being said, I just microwaved three (3) medium size russet potatoes in an uncovered bowl with 1/4 cup water for 4 1/2 minutes, then flipped the potatoes and microwaved them for an additional 4 1/2 minutes. I wanted them softer, so I microwaved them for and additional 1 1/2 minutes. They came out perfectly. Thank you for posting this. I wanted cooked potatoes, but I didn‚Äôt have time time to bake them (which I normally do)."

I tried putting water on the plate the next time, partway through the cooking process to cool the plate. The potato didn't cook all the way I wanted it to, but the plate didn't die. Most recently, I tried putting the potato in a clean rag and trying that. The rag burned, but the potato was amazing again. How can I get it to cook all the way and not burn the wrap or plate?"
