I rinse of the shucked corn and leave it damp, roll it in a piece of wax paper and cook for 2 minutes. That works perfectly for me and the microwave I have. I put just enough butter on it to make the salt stick (so very little). It is great."

I place the cob on the waxed paper and then drizzle olive oil and sprinkle salt on the clean cob and then wrap it up in the waxed paper sheet. That produces a plate-ready, seasoned and cooked cob with no pesky paper sticking to the corn."

Then fold in the rest of the wrap. Microwave for 2 minutes per cob. Serve in the wrap so that it stays hot until ready to eat! This even improves the taste of grocery store corn! Tastes like it came right from the garden!"

"reviewBody": "I agree with wseling. Don’t worry about the wet paper. Fresh sweet corn has enough water inside to steam in husk. I have a 1000w microwave &amp; 3m 30s is long enough to cook a whole ear. Bonus is the silk comes off really easily once cooked &amp; you can use the husk as a holder. Maybe the paper trick would be useful if you have dehusked &amp; frozen the corn previously. Great if this is the only thing you were cooking (as I often do for lunch)"

My microwave takes 4 minutes for a single ear to cook, and it comes out al dente."

As long as I've been cooking, I've always boiled them, but the kitchen is so hot this time of year I decided to try it this way. Like others, I left the husk on. I am converted! Unless I'm making corn for a lot of people I'm never boiling again!"

"reviewBody": "As instructed, my first ear was grossly overlooked. The concept is fine but 5 minutes is way too long unless you are cooking what we call horse corn (typically late season, very large and tough kernels and big ears). We prefer younger, sweeter corn. 3 minutes per ear is ample. You can leave it unshucked until after cooking or you can do the paper towel approach. We use either, depending upon the condition of the corn."

I run water over mine and put them straight into the microwave and roughly halfway thru I flip them over. Like microwaved potatoes, after they come out of the microwave it's best to let them rest in the husk for 10ish minutes before shucking and eating."

As I am just cooking for myself, it is much quicker than bringing a pot of water to boil, plus when corn is in season the weather is hot, who wants to heat up the kitchen boiling water? I break my cleaned ear of corn in half and place in a pyrex dish with a little bit of water, cover with the glass lid and cook on high about 2-3 minutes."
