The cutting an inch off the bottom of the cob a squeezing from the top (Point) worked as described husk silk everything came right off clean as a whistle. Will cook my corn this way from now on, it worked that well"

I just make sure to pull the husk back a bit and let some water run down into it before cooking. I don't even wrap in paper towel and it is just great."

To male removing the husk ans silk easier, try cutting off thr bottom just at the bottom row of kernels before cooking. After it's cooked, squeeze gently on the top end of the corn so that it slides out the bottom. The corn is clean, and the husk is intact with the silk inside! No-mess way to dispose of husks."

"reviewBody": "I've enjoyed corn cooked in the mikywave for many years. It helps to loosen the husk where the silk emerges and get just a bit of water down inside, especially if the corn is a bit 'aged'. After two or three minutes of cooking, try to lightly pull a bit of silk from one of the ears. If it slides out easily, its done. If the silk does not come out easily, try again after cooking another minute. To complete the cook, wrap the ear before removing the husk in a towel for two or three minutes to allow the heat to even out through out the ear. Then peel and enjoy.\n\nMT C"

I've never wet the corn before microwaving though, fresh corn has moisture in the husks already so there's no real need to. I microwave for 3.5 minutes and they turn out great."

"reviewBody": "This recipe works well and is extremely easy. Variations to try is to open the husk and add butter to the ear of corn, reclose the husk and\nmicrowave as directed. I think that cooking the corn in the husk adds even more flavor to the corn. Also, if you are using already husked corn on the cob, all you have to do is to wrap the ears of corn individually with dampened paper towels and microwave as directed. With my microwave, 1 large ear of corn only needs to cook 3 minutes. When first starting to cook the corn this way, start with a shortened cooking time and then cook longer if need be. You can always cook it a little longer if needed but I haven't figured yet how to UNCOOK anything."

Holding the husk this way removes 99.9% of the silk. I found 3 mins on an 1100 microwave is enough as any longer seems to pucker the kernels."

If I do more than a few ears I do in small batches for even cooking."
