"reviewBody": "I grew up making Divinity with my grandmother for ever holiday that came along plus. It was definitely a labor of love. As someone helped themselves to my KitchenAid Mixer and double boiler when I was moving, I thought this might be an easier way to bring a bit of old home into the holiday.\n\nIt took 8 1/2 minutes in the microwave, checking temp and stirring every three minutes, not just 3 as stated. \n\nWhile it doesn't compare to the tried and true full recipe, it is good. \n\nA nice variation is to take maraschino cherries. dry them so no excess moisture remains. Chop them up and add in after the vanilla,it is all mixed. It turns the divinity a pale pink and makes for a nice change."
