To me - no, it's not as great as home made bread I make in the oven, but then again, if I had time for that, I wouldn't be looking for microwave recipes. It does resemble steamed bread or dumplings as someone else wrote, so it could be used instead of those - way easier to make than steaming!\nAlso, here is what I did with 1400 Watt microwave: \nTo rise: 1 min on 20%, let sit for 10 min, repeat 2 more times\nTo bake: 6 min on 50%"

Mine came out looking just like the picture and I followed the recipe exact; but when I went to cut myself a slice the edges were very tough and it did not taste anything like an English Muffin. I still had almond butter with it and it filled me up, but don't think it can be qualified as an English Muffin."

I settled on 1 minute at 30% for the rise and 2 minutes at 70% followed by 3 minutes at 60%. This gave me the cooked top and nice moist bread, but I do think I will add 30-45 seconds to the 60% time. Nice job Larry, thanks for sharing."

I did 3 cycles, one on 50%, one on 40%, last on 50% in a 1000 watt overn. I did let it rest 10 minutes between those nukes. Then I let it bake for 6 minutes at 100% and it came out so nice. Slices very nicely and toasted up perfect. Thank you for this great recipe, I had no idea you could bake bread in the microwave. Can't wait to try this in the summer when you don't want to heat up the oven but would like a good loaf of homemade bread. Thanks again!"

"reviewBody": "The flavor of this loaf is pretty insipid, even when toasted. The dough was also quite sticky and needed about an extra half cup of flour to be able to be handled easily, while still remaining relatively soft. Generally, the proportion of liquid to 3 cups of flour in a bread recipe is 1 cup, not 1-1/4 cups. The taste is definitely dominated by whole wheat, and as such, it didn't taste to us remotely like English muffins. Flavor-wise, it lacks salt, but adding more might inhibit the dough's ability to rise, so do so judiciously. The grain is too close and fine to resemble English muffins. None of the requisite \"nooks and crannies\" associated with them. The rising technique was definitely cool, however. I'll remember it when I need to get my yeast breads to rise in a hurry. Since my microwave is pretty powerful, I used 40% power for the rise stage, and even so, only had to give it the 1 minute/10 minute wait twice before it rose to 2\" above the pan. Interesting premise, but flavor is decidedly lackluster."
