Of course it's MUCH quicker than my baked flan, so if you're short on time, it's a goodalternative, but definitely not high on the \"wow\" dessert list, more like \"I want something sweet and eggy, fast\" type."

I wont try this again"

"reviewBody": "I think they mixed up the 100 percent with the fifty percent.\n\nYou can go with high for the very beginning, but you need to back way off as the eggs start to cook. AND you have to watch it, no matter what your microwave is set for, with eggs they are just too delicate to trust to a recipe, you need to look at them often, and sooner than you expect.\n\nOr you get weird chunks of hard custard with runny watery syrup between the chunks.\n\nI hope no one else wastes their time with this. And I hope someone writes a GOOD recipe for microwave flan, because it's definitely possible, just not using these instructions.\n\n(flan should NEVER boil, ever)"

My flan was not smooth... it was sort of cottage cheese-like. I guess there are some things that you shouldn't try to shortcut. Or maybe it would work better with condensed milk? Evaporated milk? I'm not sure."
