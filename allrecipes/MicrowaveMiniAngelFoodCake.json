"reviewBody": "It could be user error or the box mix I used, but I did not like the way these microwave angel food cakes turned out. I followed the directions exactly and after letting them cool enough to eat the texture was chewy like a macaron and I could really taste the citric acid tang. The box cake mix has dried egg whites as a main ingredient and citric acid so that makes sense, but when I think of angel food cake I expect it to have a light and fluffy texture. I'm not sure if it's the amount, my mug, or how I stirred, but I tried 3 separate cakes and all 3 came out chewy. I will say these were easy to customize (I did one with rainbow sprinkles and almond extract instead of vanilla, and then one with chocolate chips). I think I'll save the rest of the mix to make in a larger pan in the oven to see if I can get the fluffier results I prefer. This was a fun experiment and if I do want a chewy sweet and tangy treat this is a really quick and easy fix!"
