"reviewBody": "Ok, so honestly, I didn't follow recipe but used almost the ingredients listed. I just added nutella, and honey and half and half and vanilla extract. I just tasted as I went. I feel like I added more half and half than the ratio listed to get a smooth and thinner sauce. I used it for beignet dipping and it was AMAZING. Lots of love from the hubby and all my friends that tried it. Heated in microwave and reheated well. YUM! A keeper."
