I made four quarter pound patties instead of five, and they browned beautifully and came out firm like you might expect steak to be. The gravy was delicious and I wouldn't change that, but next time I'll increase the seasonings for the patties. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and winter squash it was sooo good. Note that the patties can be assembled earlier in the day and refrigerated until ready to be cooked. Makes dinner time a little less hectic."

I didn’t have sweet onion, so I used yellow onion. I did not use mushrooms because I don’t like them. When it says put the patties in the pan, I added 2 tbsp of butter first and then I added the patties. I used seasoned Panko bread crumbs. This was an amazing dish, even with all of my substitutes!"

My husband said it was the best gravy and asked if I could make just the gravy for french fries. Yesterday we went grocery shopping and he asked me to make the Salisbury steak again. It's so rare that he asks for something in particular, so I knew he really liked it. Oh, and this time with the mushrooms. This one is definitely a keeper!"

I also used kitchen bouquet Browning and seasoning sauce to make the gravy Brown. Added garlic to the meat. \nQuick easy and great for quarantine meals. I could have made the Patty smaller but I got about a week's worth of food."

MSG) so I used onion powder only. I only used beef broth as well, I omitted the water. I also didn't have Worcestershire but was able to find how to make a substitute (soy sauce, lemon juice, sugar, &amp; hot sauce). Next time, I'll have mushrooms but not change anything else. So, so good! You won't regret making it. My family is already asked when we are having it again!"

I also used leftover diced onions rather than slicing one. We really enjoyed the flavor of the gray. I served the steaks with cheesy mashed potatoes and a blue cheese and tomato salad. With just the two of us, we each eat one and half patties and are looking forward to eating the remaining ones as open face sandwiches or on buns for a lunch soon."

We had to run to a sports event, so I didn't simmer the patties in the pan for 30 minutes. Instead, I used the slow cooker to finish it off while we were at the game. I made the patties and the gravy according to the recipe, placed the patties in the slow cooker, poured the gravy over it, and set the cooker on Low for an hour and a half. It turned out great."

My boys love meat, so I used 2# burger and made 6 thick patties on either egg noodles or mashed potatoes (picky eaters). Probably could have not straight doubled the soup mix and kept some for the sauce (I forgot about the mix going in the sauce). I edited the sauce due to family preferences and available ingredients. Sauteed diced onion and green pepper with garlic, then added cream of mush and 2 cans beef broth. As a normal cooking person can tell already, that didnt thicken well. Could have used flour, or just extra cool time; by the time I was putting away leftovers it was nice and thick. Flavor was fantastic, pretty well perfect. Everyone is full and I'm glad we have leftovers"

I also used the same pan to make the gravy as browning beef to save cleaning and because why not use that flavor? Aside from that everything was the same. This recipe is pretty good as written. I only give four stars because I found the onion flavor too prominent. Next time I will probably only use half an onion instead of a whole one but there will definitely be a next time. This makes a good dinner with not too much effort!"
