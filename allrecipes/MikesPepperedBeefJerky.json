Marinated in bag overnight. Patted with paper towel to remove excess marinade and popped in dehydrator at 150 for 6 hours. Easy and delish!"

I used a4.5 lb London broil cut at 1/8 inch. Only changed out of necessity, used smoked paprika instead of liquid smoke b/c I was out, and no coriander.\n\nIt only took 4 hours in my dehydrator. Spice was perfect. Hubby and boys were amazed. I need to experiment some more but I will come back to this recipe for sure! Thanks Mike."

The leaner the beef the shorter the dehydrator time and the safer the finished product. We used round steak, but found it still too fatty. We will use top round or some other type of leaner beef next time. However, the flavor was perfect..and no nitrites like store-bought jerky. Much cheaper too! We did not change anything in this recipe. Thanks Mike."
