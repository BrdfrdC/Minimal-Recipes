The only changes I made was adding a full bottle of beer and adding a pinch of clove.. This chili stands alone in my opinion by just adding some corn chips , cilantro, shredded cheddar, diced avocado and dollop of sour cream to finish it off.. absolutely amazing chili!!"

And while it had good flavor, and the pork was incredible!- the skins from the tomatillos and tomatoes (maybe the peppers too?) were all curled up and created a texture issue that threw us off. I didn’t see other complaints of this so either this is just the way it is or we missed a step? Didn’t know something that everyone else knows? Glad we tried but I think I will keep looking. Thank you!"

Instead of using pork shoulder, I used preseasoned carnitas, I also used a frozen pre-roasted green chile.

"reviewBody": "So I made this with pork sausage because unlike some people I don't live next to a butcher's shop. That worked out better imo because it's less fussy than shoulder. Other changes I'd propose would be that you drop the tomatoes entirely and just use eight tomatillos since they're closely related. As for the peppers, I only had two jalapenos, some of those baby bell peppers and a poblano and they worked really well despite not being nearly as many as called for. (although I plan on using more peppers next time). Other than that this is a great and easy to make meal that pairs best with the Spanish flan recipe also on here since flan is a cinch to make."

I used pork I made for an adobo pork recipe earlier that I froze so my flavor may have enhanced the recipe. Regardless, I'm making again and will double it to have extras or to serve more than 4. Also, I did not remove any veins or seeds and the hot factor was pretty high. I enjoyed it but have a high-heat tolerance. Lastly, I intended to use hatch green chiles but I forgot! I'll make again this week and see the comparisons!\n\nI recommend making this. Also, I used a Colorado Native lager beer my boyfriend selected since I'm not a beer drinker and used the whole bottle."

The traditional green chili is very simple: Roasted Hatch chiles, jalapenos depending on personal taste, roasted and shredded pork shoulder, chicken broth, onions, cumin,tomatoes, and flour to thicken. Use it as a chili to smother things or just dip your tortilla in it! So good! (P.S. I did make this recipe and couldn't eat it.)"

Also, based on another reviewer, I cooked the meat in the pressure Cooker and then cooked everything except the sour cream under pressure for 25 minutes. We are this over rice with tortillas.

It just wasn't very flavorful. \n\nA few changes...used chicken because that's what I had. I would prefer pork though. Added a poblano because the early summer peppers that I used weren't very meaty. Overall, it's just missing something. The cream cheese added somewhat to the texture but not to the overall taste. We served it over rice.

"reviewBody": "I've been in CO for about 20 years now, and I've eaten and made green chili of all kinds. This is very unique and amazingly yummy. Unlike so many reviewers, I used the cream cheese and I gotta say I like,no,LOVE, the creamy hit at the end. I'd not really used tomatillas in my chili before, but roasting them does it for me. Also, I buy green chiles in the fall and have them roasted, then I bag and freeze them, leaving the skins on. I defrost and peel them just before I use them. The flavor is much better when they're frozen in the skin. I guess I used about 10 Anaheims and 5 Big Jim's in all. Absolutely will make this many more times!"

"reviewBody": "I had never heard of \"Green Chili\" until stumbling on this recipe looking for a way to use up some of a 7# pork shoulder I cooked in the crockpot. Well, my deepest thanks to the author! I make tons of soup since it's such a great and enjoyable way to eat your vegis. My hubs and I both think this recipe for the soup I made was the best soup I ever made. We were stunned at how good it was. \n\nI probably will annoy some people admitting that I modified the recipe and then am reviewing it, but it came out so awesome that I thought I should share. Here are my changes: I cooked, defatted, &amp; shredded a large roast in the crockpot. I used about 1/3 of the meat from this in my soup. I strained the broth and defatted this and added it to this soup, I used pretty much all the vegis &amp; peppers listed but used only 1 jalepeno and substituted a Pasilla (sp?) pepper for the other two since I was concerned it might be too hot for us. I added an extra green pepper and 2 more tomatillos. (They were small) I added a large can of green enchilada sauce and a can of water. (There was a lot of meat and I wanted to make it more soupy.) I had 2 leftover baked potatoes that I diced and added in the last 30 mins. I cooked this on high in the crockpot for 4-5 hours. I didn't add the cream cheese at the end. It was so delicious as is, we didn't want to change it. We did sprinkle a little shredded cheese on top. Loved, loved, loved it. Thank you so much for a huge hit at our house!"

Best darn tamales I have ever made. I know not the intent of the recipe, but it is a darn great chili with many possibilities. This is now my 'go to' mexican meat!"

"reviewBody": "Pretty darn yummy. I was cooking for kids with no tolerance for heat, so I subbed a can of green chiles for the fresh peppers. Worked great. One question, though. The directions say to peel the tomatillos. When I did that, it basically left a blob of insides, and that didn't seem right. Is that a typo? Or maybe something AR added to the original recipe? Or maybe I peeled them wrong? Anyway, I peeled one and left the rest unpeeled, and there didn't seem to be any weird skins in the chili, so I guess it's OK to leave them unpeeled."

No Anaheims here this time of year, so sub'd a couple of previously roasted and peeled chile poblanos. Great blend of flavors and tastes even better the second day!"

I added a little more beer, cilantro, small can of tomato paste and one can of tomato sauce. I then threw in two more beef bouillons,water, frozen corn and four diced potatoes. I put the crock pot on high for several hours and tested the potatoes. I served with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese instead of adding the cream cheese. I received extremely high praise over the soup. I did serve with warm tortillas. We were so full, we could hardly walk so skip on the second helping no matter how delicious it is!

For stock, boil the stems and ends of various vegetables that you've saved up over the week."

The veggies were too mushy, and the entire thing was too hot. I love hot, but this wasn't a good hot. Maybe I didn't roast the veggie properly, but this wasn't for us. I've tried one green chili recipe that I liked, I'm determined to fine the very best."
