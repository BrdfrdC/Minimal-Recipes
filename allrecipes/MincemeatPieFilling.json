"reviewBody": "Made it with ground version, used a can of pineapple with juice, dried cranberries and raisins, molasses instead of sorghum ( which we don't have in the north) and instead of beef broth, a good measure of whiskey. This is close to my Grandmothers recipe, and it turned out great. If too watery, just cook a bit more. I also 3 Xed the recipe and had enough to put in the freezer. Wonderful, basic recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I haven't made this for YEARS, but I love, love, love this recipe. It smells and tastes so amazing when I'm cooking it that I can't help but steal bites. My dad loves mincemeat pie, and I used to make it with this filling because I hate the jarred mincemeat that's just made of apples and raisins with no actual meat in it because it's just not very flavorful. This has a diverse blend of flavors that combine to make THE BEST mincemeat ever. I'm going to make some this year and make my husband try it. He hates trying new things, but hopefully he'll like it. I want to try making mini pies."

"reviewBody": "This recipe has great flavor, but my meat wasn't very tender, so I should have ground it up instead of trying to dice it. Otherwise, I didn't change anything. I did make it as a deep dish pie, using a deep ceramic pie plate. I used the whole recipe to make the pie and it boiled over, so I had to clean the oven before baking the rest of my pies. Next time I'll put a cookie sheet under the pie to catch the drips."

"reviewBody": "Two nights ago I cooked all the ingredients as is except I substitued molasses for the sorghum (&amp; I only had 1/4 cup) until thick &amp; refrigerated. I then divided up into two pie shells last night, used a crumb topping &amp; baked (I only had deep dish shells, all the filling could have fit in one shell)following another recipe: 15 mins at 425 degrees and then 20 mins at 350. \nAs I was making this for a co-worker, I felt I needed to try it. So hubby &amp; I cut into one of the pies(we had never had mincemeat pie before) - it was o.k. but we weren't sure :(! My co-worker said the meat was a little chewy but otherwise it tasted like \"grandma's\". (Course he may just being nice?!)"

"reviewBody": "I made this pie for my father-in-law. I guess I did something wrong, but I followed the directions exactly...the recipe never states to cook the filling or reduce the liquid before baking. My pie had so much liquid in it we were forced to drain it. I drained almost 2 cups of liquid. The flavor I am told is great, but I would suggest reducing the mixture to a thicker consistancy on the stove , then baking."
