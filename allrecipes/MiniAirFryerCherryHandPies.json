"reviewBody": "The recipe is very easy to make. I made my own pastry because I don't care for all the chemicals in the store bought type. I found out quickly that you cannot put but a small amount of cherry filling into each pie because it does spread out when you fold it over, so I decided to just put one of the cut outs on top of the other one and make it a round little pie. It worked out great and I was able to get extra filling in it. It needs a little glaze to go over the top to make it a little sweeter, but they turned out great. This would be a wonderful little snack for a tea or for kids who have a sleep over. I just wish I could have cooked more than 3 at a time. Good recipe!"
