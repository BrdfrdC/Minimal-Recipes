Split the mixture in half and \"doctored up\" one bowl with alot more spices. They held together very well. Baked for 20 minutes; added chesse; baked for 3 more minutes. I bought mini rolls at the bread outlet. If they are too thick, cut in half and cut out the extra thickness. Save the cut-out part to use as bread crumbs or make croutons. These were great with the \"Special Hamburger Sauce\" from the AR website. Thanks for sharing the recipe."

It was bland but my biggest complaint is the fact that it was SOGGY. I even put 1/3 cup of quick-1 minute oatmeal like one reviewer suggested too! No bueno. Not going to make this one again."

I followed the recipe exactly but while forming the meat into balls, I noted that it was very 'wet' (from the egg). I put some dried bread crumbs in to make them easier to form. This may have been a mistake as I noted while eating the 'dryness' that the crumbs brought to the burgers. Next time, I won't add dry crumbs, (maybe torn up bread). I used dinner buns which were the perfect size for these min cheeseburgers."

I have to say though, I had so many left over that I put them in the refrigerator over night. I just re-heated them and Bam! it was a nice snack. I put a slice of pickle, some chopped onions (which were sauteed in butter) and a drop of mustard. Not bad the day after, but not a big with the kids. However, I will probably make them again with less ketchup."
