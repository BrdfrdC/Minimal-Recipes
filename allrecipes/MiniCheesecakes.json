I made them for a shower as well and they were wiped out! Super easy and little mess. I find having a Kitchen Aid or stand mixer is perfect for the filling. Be sure to cream your cheese and sugar well before adding the egg and vanilla. Use a food processor or blender to grind your cookies. Enjoy!"

"reviewBody": "Great basic recipe! I used it to make my own Apple Pie Crumble Cheesecakes instead of using the recommended cherry pie filling. I made my own thick, cinnamon-y apple pie filling with very finely chopped apples, put that on top of the raw cheesecake batter, and then topped it with a cinnamon streusel topping. Got rave reviews at both parties these went to. Also have used this recipe to make Oreo cheesecakes, substituting the thin Oreo cookies as the base instead of the Nilla Wafers, and then topping with a mini Oreo cookie before baking. So many flavor options with this recipe. A keeper. The only thing is that they took *significantly* longer to bake for a regular-size cupcake liner. Not sure if it's my oven."

They are in the oven now and the problems I have run into so far is there isn’t enough cheesecake batter and the graham crackers don’t stick together. The cheesecake batter filled all 12 cheesecakes but you could still see the graham crackers since there was very little batter. I don’t know if it is like this since I fourthed it or if the recipe just runs short. Besides these two issues, the cheesecakes looked good."

I used barely any of the package of smashed wafers. But there wasn’t quite enough cheesecake batter left for another batch. Idk. Maybe a specific size pan should be listed? These were also not really worth all the effort. They look cute and I could see bringing them to s party or something. But I just made them to eat at home. My family finished them off in an hour. Probably better to just make a real- cheesecake next time."

Especially if you are topping with more sugary things. I used only 1/2 C sugar.\nAfter cream cheese was sitting out to room temp, then it blended quite nicely with all the ingredients in my Bosch stand mixer.\n15 minutes was right on for the bake time, and I did mini's."

I use the muffin liners that fit the cookie perfectly. They can be hard to find though! So for this version, I crushed the cookies very well and used a full size liner. I had to bake them a few minutes more than 15 though. These are always a favorite in my family and my kids want them every Christmas!"

"reviewBody": "Great recipe. Made the first time exactly as written except using graham cracker crust (roughly 12-16 full sz grahams run through food processor to make into crumbs; 7-8 tbsp butter melted combine and instead of pressing into muffin papers made into small balls and rolled and flattened then set into muffin wrapper...MUCH easier to get out of wrapper than the few I pressed) instead of nilla wafers just due to personal preference. \n2nd time around I tweaked a little :-) added a little lemon juice a little less sugar and 1/2 additional tsp vanilla and each time baked for approximately 17 minutes (do NOT wait until batter is cracking!) and then just turned off the oven and left for about 45 minutes to an hour. Cheesecakes turned out AMAZING! \nCouple tips-\n-absolutely NEED cream cheese room temp!!!\n-before adding anything else beat till as smooth as possible!\n-add sugar beat again and again nice and smooth batter needed I can't emphasize that enough from years of making cheesecakes with mom and grandma\n-add in eggs and beat until just mixed and then pour/scoop into cups :-)\nSO many other possibilities/additions to make chocolate cheesecake or really whatever flavor you want! Will definitely keep making!!!! Thanks!"

It’s very flexible and can be modified with more or less sugar, different cookie crusts (pick a hard cookie) and any (or no) topping you feel like. Do make sure you use the metal baking cups, because they’ll be easier when it comes time to eat."

When I watched the video, it said to use a whole teaspoon. I believe it is a whole teaspoon.. Also I would add to this recipe (that I read) that it makes about 48 cheesecakes.. I had no idea how many rappers to get ready and how many it would make. When I watched the video, it told me 48. Also I would like to add if you put the vanilla wafers in each cup crushed, they fall apart when you open them to eat them and crumbs get everywhere. I suggest you put the vanilla wafer in there whole or I added half a box of vanilla wafers and a package of graham crackers and crush them up and added about a cup of melted butter. They turned out really good and didn't fall apart when you opened them to eat them.??"

They are very easy to make and definitely worth a chance. If nothing else, its a great, easy base to start with."

Most of my family like them plain without the cherry topping. When we make the very mini cheesecakes, we don't need anywhere near the recommended amount of vanilla wafers. (I made a half batch of 24 minature \"minis\" and did not use anywhere near 6 oz for the 1/2 batch. I only use the recommended 1/2 teaspoon per miniature muffin cup. Next time I'll try 2 or 3 ounces of Vanilla wafers crushed for a half batch.) We really enjoy the \"mini\" mini cheesecakes. One bite desserts! Of course, everyone usually picks up one, walks away, then comes back for another. Very easy to make and everyone enjoys them!"

This was very easy and very tasty. \n\nI only made 3 changes to the original recipe. 1) I used a standard muffin/cupcake pan and cupcake liners. 2) I halved the recipe so that I wouldn't be alone with all that goodness. I was making this for only 2 people. Really, one because I'm on a diet. This yielded about 9 cupcakes. 3) I baked them for 15 minutes but they looked too loose, so I baked them for an additional 8 minutes. \n\nI let them cool and placed them in the fridge for about 2 hours. And then I topped them with the cherry pie filling/topping."

"reviewBody": "I love these. There were a few false starts because I knew absolutely nothing about making cheesecake. I missed the miniature muffin tin part and had a hard time figuring out why my batch never made as many as the recipe said it should. I also had to cook mine a little longer since they were bigger which led to me over baking a few times which makes the mixture a little eggy. They were still good, but you didn't get that rich creamy cheesecake texture or taste. You want there to still be a little jiggle in the middle. Once I got it down though, these were great. I bring them (as well as Paula Deen's sausage balls) to work potlucks and there are never any left over."

Rich, but not too sweet, these really are delicious! I'm excited to try them again but with other mix-ins."

Instead of grinding them, I put them whole into the bottom of the tins, this helped to prevent crumbling. I then put them in the oven and they came out amazing! I served most of these with either whip cream and strawberries, Oreos and whip cream, and Reese's peanut butter cups and whip cream. If I had to criticize one thing about them it would be the density of them, but they were still delicious!"
