As the crust and the cream cheese mixture didn't stick together. I had to bake it the second time for 12 minutes. The first 25 minutes didn't worked. I must have done something wrong. I did follow the Instructions all the way."

I only use the lemon juice, not the zest and find the taste is perfect for us."

I doubled the crust because I like crust. I lined the cupcake pan with paper cupcake liners. I baked for 25 minutes, then turned off oven and left them in the oven with door propped open for another 30 minutes. I also placed a bowl of water on the bottom shelf because I heard that is how you keep them from cracking. Mine are perfect, so maybe that is the trick?"

The only change I make is that I leave out the lemon zest, I am afraid they will taste too much like lemon otherwise. I've never tried them with the zest, but I like it fine without so I just don't bother. When I bake them I also place the cupcake pan in a cookie sheet and add water (about 1-2 inches) - it helps prevent cracking. Just be careful with the hot water when taking out the pan (you can also just use a deeper pan). I also usually chop up some strawberries, sprinkle a bit of sugar on them, stir to coat, let them sit for about 10-15 minutes, and use the strawberries to top of the cupcakes. Delish!"

"reviewBody": "This was an unmitigated disaster. \n\nThe filling was yummy (I changed the flavoring), but...I had to make a second batch of crust mixture to cover the bottom of each cup even very thinly, and every last smidgen of the filling filled only 1/4 of each cup. When I checked the cook at 15 minutes, the cheesecakes were already burnt and starting to smoke.\n\nIs it possible that the author meant for us to fill only 6 cups of a regular-size, 12-cup tin? I have tins for mini, maxi, and regular-size muffins; the only 6-cup tin is the maxi size, so that's what I used...\n\nRegardless, I won't be making this again. My regular cake-size cheesecakes are loved by all, so that's what I'll stick to from now on."

"reviewBody": "These are delicious. I added a TBSP of strawberry jam to the center of each and swirled the jam into the cheesecake. They turned out great. Only thing is, they were not cooked at 25 minutes and I left them in for another 10 minutes and still not done and then for an additional 10 minutes and they were golden on top. I think the extra cook time was due to the jam and I think if I hadn't opened the oven 2 times to check them it wouldn't have taken as long either. I am going to try for 35 minutes next time I make them without opening the oven at 25 minutes to see if that works."

I baked the crust for 5 min like the recipe calls for and the cheesecakes for 20 min instead of 25. I wanted to make a 2-bite sized cheesecake and it worked out very well. Only problem is, I have to be careful not to eat 5 or 6 of them at a time. Yummy;)"

Since I was looking for a Fall flavor, I opted to use a drizzle of maple syrup rather then the lemon and I topped them with a salted caramel apple compote I whipped up... yummy.\n\nI baked them for 15mins in a regular oven (not convection) with a water bath (I saw others use it from other recipes) They turned out perfect! No cracking, they set well- I will make them again."

This came out spectacular and I am so surprised!! Bottom line leave out the lemon zest and make sure you cool down your cupcake. Put it in the refrigerator after it's done. Add a little almonds or graham cracker or fruit good nosh you will be one happy camper"

If you love lemon, you will love this cheesecake as you can really taste it, otherwise, just omit the lemon zest and juice. This is a very good base recipe, I think next time I'll try it with crushed oreos instead. :)"
