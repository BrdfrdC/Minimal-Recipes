"reviewBody": "I've always fried crab cakes before, but I won't do it again! This recipe reduces the fat in the classic crab cakes by substituting yogurt for mayonnaise and eliminating the oil the crab cakes absorb in the frying process. Yet the panko keeps them crispy. The lemon zest added to the flavor. Putting the crab cakes on parchment paper makes cleanup easy and keeps them from sticking to the pan. I turned them halfway through baking so they would brown on both sides, without any breaking apart as they often do in frying. I added minced celery and minced onion instead of the green onion and bell pepper. I did not make the sauce, but I think the crab cakes would have been better with a sauce. I will use this recipe for crab cakes from now on."

"reviewBody": "This was really easy and tasty. Used fresh crab. The panko was a bit too chunky and visually not so appealling. Would recommend crushing them before coating the cakes. Also, we ended up broiling for about 8 min to give them a golden color. Lastly, the dip is great, but watch the lemon, it could be overpowering. These are a great tasting alternative to mayo and fried cakes."
