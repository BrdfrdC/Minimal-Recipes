My proportions: 1.25 lbs 93% ground beef, 2 cups finely shredded colby jack, 1 packet minus 1.5 tsp of lipton onion soup mix, and two packages of EXTRA LARGE crescent rolls (these are the 12 oz packages, not the 8 oz ones). Served with a salad, this served 4 hungry people with a few left over."

"reviewBody": "Listened to other reviews and doubled the ground beef. Even using a full pound the onion was still strong. Used shredded Gouda cheese (it’s what we had on hand). Also added sliced dill pickles and seasoned meat with our favorite, Mis Rubin’s Black Magic. Hubs liked it but we agreed that a half package of onion soup mix would be more than enough to add flavor but not overpower it. We used two packages of crescent rolls, packed each with more than a tablespoon of filling and almost used all the mix. With some minor adjustments we will keep this one on file. Super easy."

I used 2 cans of crescent rolls. I thought it sounded too simple and easy to be that good...I was wrong! Always looking for something different to do with ground beef, this one is a winner!"

We've made them for years with 1-1.5 lbs ground chuck, 1 packet of soup mix, 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese &amp; PICKLES! I can't believe they don't have pickles in the recipe. One dill pickle slice per sandwich. You'll need 3-4 packages of rolls, depending on how much you stuff them. They're always a big hit at tailgate or any other party."
