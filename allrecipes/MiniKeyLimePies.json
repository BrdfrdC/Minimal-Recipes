Made it better the second time using 2 cups 16oz volume which is about 1 and 3/4 cans."

"reviewBody": "The key lime pies came out great! But the measurements on the website got all messed up. It went from saying 3 cups of sweetened condensed milk for 12 serving size to 3/4 of a cup when you DOUBLED the recipe... then when I went back to a regular serving (serves 12) it changed to 1/3 and 2 tps of sweetened condensed milk. When I would refresh the page it went back to 3 cups of it again... over all that was very confusing and I ended up doubling the recipe to make 24 mini pies and used 4, 14oz cans of sweetened condensed milk which tasted great! The only other thing was it didn‚Äôt make 24 mini pies.... the ‚Äúdoubling the recipe‚Äù to make 24 mini pies ended up really making 24 mini pies, and TWO ENTIRE pies. Long story short, the measurements are way off. It makes way too much... but it tastes great! \nAlso I couldn‚Äôt find any pre made graham cracker shells so I made my own graham cracker crust and it came out great. 1 cup graham cracker crumbs, 6 TBSP butter, &amp; 1/3 cup of sugar. I did use paper cupcake liners and it worked perfect... I saw in another comment to use foil ones if you make your own crust cause the butter soaked the paper but I didn‚Äôt experience that at all. \nI was actually happy that I made my own crust and used the paper cupcake liners because it came out amazing. \nDefinitely will use this recipe again but will be careful with the measurements so I don‚Äôt make enough to feed an army and all the neighbors lol. \nSuper delicious though! Definitely recommend making"

I used the Keebler mini-crusts from the grocery store and they turned out FANTASTIC! Even partygoers that do not typically eat dessert had one and ate every bite. My only wish is that I had a larger tree, since this took up almost all of my ripe fruit. Couldn't recommend this recipe more!"

It is very rich and creamy. I used small key limes I wouldn't recommend that because it took forever to squeeze the juice and it was hard to grate the rind. Which is a must to get the great flavor. Next time I will buy larger key limes. My husband even enjoyed this one and he doesn't like key lime pie. This one is a keeper!"

Topped with some raspberries and blueberries and served with mini cream puffs from another recipe on this site and chocolate covered strawberries. Made a very pretty plate with a nice assortment. Was devoured. Thanks for the recipe!"

I don't like an overpowering lime flavor in my key lime pie, or I feel like it starts to taste fake. This flavor was refreshing and perfect. They don't expand in the oven so go ahead and fill them all the way to the top like it says. I baked them for 6 minutes, cooled slightly, then chilled them. They were ready within an hour of being put into the fridge, but I left them overnight anyway. To fancy them up, I added some lime zest to the top along with a couple lemon balm leaves from my garden. Cute!"
