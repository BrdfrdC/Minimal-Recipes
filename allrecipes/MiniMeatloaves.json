I did add dry onion soup mix and used Sweet Billy Ray's BBQ sauce on top instead of the ketchup/brown sugar/mustard. I put the BBQ before baking just like the recipe said for the other topping. That would probably be good too. 5 stars for sure! I have never put either oats or shredded Cheddar in meatloaf and those two ingredients worked well."

The mixture was still a bit liquidy after let the oats soak up some of the juices and mixing everything, so I added some additional oats to be able to form the loaf."

Unfortunately, the ingredients doubled turns into a soppy mess (I knew 1 1/3 cup of milk looked like a alot of milk!) - i only used half of the wet mixture (cheese, milk, oatmeal, etc.) and even added bread crumbs to thicken up the meat and milk/oatmeal mess; It was terrible and I thought I ruined it completely! I cooked in one large loaf (big mistake!) - this recipe with this topping is meant to be cooked in individual/serving size portions!! Trust me! The taste is amazing with this sugary/BBQ like taste - the kids weren't too thrilled with this trial, but now that I know what NOT to do next time, this will definitely be a staple!\nSUGGESTION _ DO NOT DOUBLE!!! Make the recipe in 2 seperate bowls if you have more then 1 pound of meat :)"

Doubled the recipe, reduced the milk a bit and added some breadcrumbs. The final result was absolutely delicious. The oats and cheese make it so moist. It did not taste oaty or cheesy And making it on the griddle created a nice crispy outside. I did not double the sauce by the recipe but rather used those 3 ingredients to taste and added it after they were fully cooked."

I made very minor changes. I used some beef bouillon in the milk mixture instead of salt. I also only used 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and supplemented that with some stevia. I used regular oatmeal and let it soak in the milk mixture about 20 minutes before adding the ground beef. Not sure the soaking is needed. Will try making this without that step."

I cook it at 365 for 50min to 1 hour (1 pound of meat per loaf), one loaf at a time. I use mozzarella or whatever cheese I have in the fridge. I serve it with white rice and butternut squash or just squash. It’s the perfect pair."

I made the meat a few days before I cooked them. it was for a potluck at work so I actually made them smaller than the recipe says. I also used Italian breadcrumbs instead of the oats. I may try the oats another day, still not sure as I feel the Italian breadcrumbs gave it more flavor. It was a hit at work and will definitely be making these again!"

I will definitely make this again. Oh, by the way, the only cheddar cheese I had was a taco mix, and it added extra flavor!!!"

I stirred the cooled peppers &amp; onions into the cheese and oat mixture and then added the ground beef. I formed my beef mixture into four loaves, added the glaze, and baked all four in a glass baking dish for 60 minutes. This recipe was very very good, moist and flavorful. Also very easy to put together with on hand ingredients. My husband loved this meat loaf, &amp; leftovers were great!"

Other reviewers mentioned that their kids or their husband absolutely loved them.....yup, here too. I did let the oatmeal soak in the wet ingredients for a bit, so there was no oatmeal-cookie-syndrome as someone reported, and I will never use another recipe for meatloaf again. Did I mention it was easy to prep? Yes it was, and the results were wonderful. Try it, don't change it. It is perfectly fine the way the recipe was submitted!"

"reviewBody": "This was ok, but I made a few adjustments and will make even more next time if I make them again.\nI found the meat mix was too wet, so I added bread crumbs a few tablespoons at a time until it would form with my hands. I added onion salt, (however next time I will use a cooking onion). I added about 1/2 tsp of black pepper. For the cheese, I used a 3 cheese blend. For the topping, I added about 1/2 tsp of garlic to the sauce. \nWell, the finished product was 8 mini meatloaves that kept their form. They were missing something and in my opinion, it is onion. Growing up, my Mom would melt cheese on top (not inside of the meatloaf.) I didn't mind that these had sauce on top, but oh my! Far too sweet! I am not a fan of catsup, so, in the future, I will use tomatoe paste or leave them plain. I would not recommend them as the recipe is written... with some changes it is worth trying."
