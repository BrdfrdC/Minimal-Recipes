It was little hard to divide pie shell into enough pieces that were big enough to make nice cup in the muffin pan so I ended up using 3 shells for 48 mini pies. Had filling left over but no more shells so baked it like a custard. Very tasty!"

My family wanted to go to Ft.Myers last year to visit an aunt.. so when i tried the recipe a few weeks before as a \"rough draft\" they were immediately a hit!!!! I have now been placed in charge of the desserts for many years to come.. i ended up having to bake just over 100 of these bad boys in order for them to survive the trip to Ft. Myers AND still have enough for the family up there.. when i was questioned this year about it.. all my family said was \"YOU BETTER MAKE THOSE MINI PIES, THEY'RE DELICIOUS\". Hands down the best recipe i have ever found.. made them for my work as well and i'm now getting special orders (i refuse to give this recipe out) it's my best kept secret!!! :) absolutely love the recipe, fast easy and delicious!!! If i could give it more stars i would!!!!\n\nUPDATE: 10/19/2014 Thanksgiving is right around the corner, i'm still in charge of desserts (which totally freaking rocks) still making these pies but now instead of making them \"mini\" i've been using the same recipe and just making it a whole pie :) still a huge hit with everyone, and a lot less work!!! :D absolutely love it!"

I made a few with pecans, a few with marshmallows on top, and of course plain ones, and we couldn't decide which we liked best. They even re-heated nicely in the microwave (the few that were leftover). I made them in regular size muffin pans in foil cups (it took almost two pie crusts), 10 mins covered plus ten mins uncovered. Marvelous! These are a new regular at our Thanksgiving dinner."

"reviewBody": "these were very good. I could eat like 50 of them by my self! One thing I will do differently next time - since i'm using premade, already flat rolled out dough - is to just tear off pieces of pie crust and loosly drop them into the cups, rather than roll it into a ball, then try and smooch and fit the ball into the cup. It over works the dough to ball it up first and then reform it to the cups, not to mention time consuming and frustrating. So just tear off a piece that looks about right and fit it in, and then touch up around the edges with extra dough if you need to."
