Great recipe tho!"

However, with miso soup, (and I have made pho as well this way) I make them larger portions and freeze it when I can. I love noodles in My Soup so I did put some rice noodles in this... Quick and easy. The only other thing I added was large slices of ginger because I love the flavor of it, but I fished it out of the broth before I eat it... I want to just a hint of the ginger flavor. I also used the firmer tofu from reading the reviews here. I have only made it the one time, but absolutely love it and definitely will make it again and possibly tweak it in some other way. At any rate, you will hear about it in these reviews. LOL. Enjoy!"

I put a little more miso in it (used white) and added a shredded carrot and some diced mushrooms. It is EXCELLENT. \"Expert\" Japanese chef suggested removing the soup from the heat before adding the miso. It's supposed to maintain the flavor better and keep it from separating. All I know is that I made a little batch of heaven today!"

People were saying it was too bland or needed more miso but that was not what I found. To me, it was actually a tad bit too much miso and will add less or more water next time. (Also, I got a multi-cooker for xmas this year so I made it in there which made it even faster and easier! Thanks!\n\nUpdate - Sorry. I had never used dashi and miso before and had the flavors mixed up. It was too much dashi and not enough miso. I made it a second time using 1 heaping teaspoon of dashi granules and an extra heaping tablespoon of miso. That was pretty darn close and delicious. :)"
