I admittedly messed up on the order of the ingredients (added miso paste and soy sauce before chicken broth boiled) and then added the shiitake mushrooms and it didn’t come out nearly as creamy or cloudy looking as the pictures. It took on a more brown hue that wasn’t quite as appetizing looking. I might try white Cremini mushrooms next time and follow the recipe more closely"

"reviewBody": "So good and so quick! I've made it twice so far. The first time, I accidentally put way too much soya sauce so it was good but a little too salty. I also didn't have Miso paste. The second time though, I had Miso paste and I didn't overdo the soya sauce. It was DELICIOUS! I made several additions to the recipe though. I don't like tofu so I replaced it with thin pieces of beef. I also added udon and every vegetable I could find in my fridge/freezer. What a hearty, healthy and tasty soup it made! Definitely a meal on it's own if you make it the way I did. Even with all that, it didn't take me more than about 25-30 min to make (including boiling/simmering time). I highly recommend this for people with little time on their hands. I doubled the recipe and froze half for days where there's just no time to cook."

The soup was salty, which is normal for miso, but I think next time I'll at least use low-sodium soy sauce and less BTB veggie base for the same amount of water (I just used as recommended on the jar)."

I used bokchoy, watercress, potato, 3 types of mushrooms (I love it in my soup) enoki,portabello and white and I used udon noodles! Season to your liking, if it needs more salt, then do so! Topped it with green onions then served piping hot!"

Otherwise, I was happy to see a miso recipe without the dashi granuals, because I couldn't find those, and I've been wanting to make miso soup. I'll try it again."

Maybe the main reason for it is that we didn`t like the taste of the miso paste so much. I think the soup was lacking something, but I don`t know what I want to see here at this point. I added more shiitake mushrooms than the recipe calls for."
