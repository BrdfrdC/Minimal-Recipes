I was born and raised in Mississippi, taught to cook by 3 Southern women, and not one of us would ruin a meal by putting a pepperoncini in it! Pepperoncini is something on the side of pizza that you throw away! Cut the salt!"

"reviewBody": "I'd give 3.5 stars if I could. It's almost there and just needs to be tweaked. After reading all the reviews about how salty it was I did the following which helped: 1) rinse the pepperoncinis under cold water in a mesh strainer, and 2) use 1/4 cup of reserved pepperoncini liquid and 1/4 cup of water, instead of 1/2 cup reserved liquid. The above modifications definitely reduces the sodium content. The finished product was not overly salty at all and I used the Hidden Valley Ranch dry ranch dressing mix as per the recipe. The issue I ran into was how dry the chicken became. I followed the cook's note and prepared this dish in the slow cooker on LOW for 6 hours. At the end the meat registered 205F on the instant thermometer and there was very little liquid left at the bottom of the slow cooker. The flavors are all there, a nice tang from the pepperoncinis but the chicken is too dry for my taste. To salvage what I made I plan to mix in some BBQ sauce to introduce some moisture. If you were to do this in the slow cooker I would try adding more liquid and maybe checking the temp of the meat at the 5 hour mark."
