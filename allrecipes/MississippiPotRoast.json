I recommend unsalted butter, at least."

"reviewBody": "My family really likes this pot roast recipe a lot, but it is rather salty. I use only half of each packet and only half a stick of butter to cut down greasiness. (The flavor is still there even with these changes.) My recipe calls for 6 pepperoncini and doesn’t call for the juice, so I’ve never added it. We always want more gravy, for serving with mashed potatoes, so after reading reviews here, next time I make it, I’ll remove the roast after cooking and make a cornstarch/flour slurry and add beef broth to make additional gravy. Super easy prep (I do not sear first) and nice to come home to the house smelling wonderful and dinner almost ready!"

Other than that, I followed the instructions exactly. I did end up adding sour cream which toned down the saltiness and it was very good. We ate it in a low carb flour tortilla with grated cheese and the sour cream. If I make it again, I will probably use the 1/2 jar of pepperocini that is still in the jar and then add bone broth and toss the juice down the drain."

I also used 1 C. of low sodium chicken broth and 6 oz. of the pepperoncini juice and approx. 10 pepperoncini peppers. I cooked in my slow cooker on high for 10 hrs. I removed the roast to a plate and lightly covered for 15 min. while I mixed a rouge of flour and juice from roast added back to the slow cooker to slightly thicken. It was SO darn tender and juicy with the most AWESOME flavor! Next time (and there will definitely be a next time) I will double the gravy ingredients. My brother compared the gravy to liquid gold!"

Not sure that it needed it though."

"reviewBody": "Well, here goes. Incidentally, I hate people who do this. I am not a veggies guy (shameful, I know, but it is what it is). That's what I don't like about most pot roasts; they are loaded with veggies. However, I love Italian Beef and IB sandwiches! I made this recipe the first time as directed. Quite good, and the peppers and juice added a kind of mild Italian flavor, which I liked. Intrigued by some of the other reviews, I bought another USDA Choice chuck roast (4 lbs), seared it, put it in the crock pot on top of whole carrots and quartered onions, added the peppers, juice, butter and my own au jus and ranch recipes (found here on AR), and cooked on low for 7 hours. I removed the meat, strained out all of the veggies, added 1/2 tsp each of Maggie Seasoning (red top) and aged balsamic vinegar to the remaining jus and prepared a flour gravy from the combination. I sliced part of the beef and served it with the gravy, mashed potatoes, a side of spinach (I do like spinach) with butter and sherry vinegar, and a vinegarette side salad. It was a great Sunday dinner! I shredded the rest of the beef for hot beef sandwiches and French dip sandwiches. It lasted less than one week! I give the original recipe 4 stars, but it provably should be 5."

Instead of cutting the pepperoncinis, I buy the Deli-style so they're already thinly sliced. I also add a package of Lipton Onion Soup Mix and one thinly sliced white onion, and a half a cup of beef broth. You MUST put a whole stick of real butter (not margarine) on top of everything before putting the lid on. When it's done cooking, I take the chuck roast out and add cornstarch and water to make a nice thick gravy--it's absolutely mouth-watering, melt in your mouth, delicious. Serve it with buttery mashed potatoes, rice, or creamy polenta! I've made it at least 10-12 times, and my guests go crazy over it!"

I tried to subdue it by serving it over a bed of extra wide noodles, but it still bit back. \nMy husband did not finish his meal because he could already feel the heartburn building. One thing I will say about the recipe is: I held back on adding any salt and pepper to the dish, and I was glad I did. The ranch dressing and au jus packets had more than enough salt (almost too much) and, thanks to the pepperoncini, the dish did not require any additional pepper. I will not be making this dish again."

I make it pretty much according to directions but it came out SALTY. The sauce was inedible. I think it was all due to the pepperoncini. I added a very small bit of salt in the beginning, on the roast itself and only on one side. Definitely not enough to cause this level of saltiness. I am nibbling on the leftovers right now and the salt is definitely coming from the peppers. The meat by itself is fine. I'll make this again because it is so convenient but I don't think i'll add the peppers anymore."

"reviewBody": "I was hesitant bc I usually steer clear of packets, but this was divine! I planned on using the crockpot but had to adapt it to the Instant Pot in a pinch. It came out perfect! I used one full stick of unsalted Kerrygold butter as others suggested, Knorr brand Au Jus packet—you’ll need two in order to get 1oz (I used a food scale), Hidden Valley Brand for the buttermilk ranch, 4lbs of roast (after trimming) cut into large chunks, and 1/2 cup of beef bone broth (what I had). I had to add the broth bc I needed 1 full cup of liquid for pressure cooking. The pepperocini liquid was only 1/2 cup. I think the salt ratio was perfect with the 4lbs of meat. Highly recommend with the Steakhouse Potatoes Romanoff recipe on here!"

This is not your typical Sunday pot roast. Some have said that they added potatoes and carrots. Would not recommend it as the flavour is off and not enough liquid for those starchy vegetables. I did add about 4 oz of sliced white mushrooms. Also, could not find any Au Jui mix so I used some French onion soup mix instead. Worked great. Had family turn on the slow cooker about 9:30 and when I got home around 5:30 roast was done. All I had to do was prepare vegetables. Turned out perfect.

I used stew beef, dredged the cubes in flour, seared on two sides, placed in crock pot, combined the rest of the ingredients in the pan and brought it to simmer before adding it to the crock pot.
