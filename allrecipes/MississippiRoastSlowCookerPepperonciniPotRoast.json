I am trying it today with 1/2 pk. of brown gravy mix, all the pk. ranch, peppers and butter. So we will see… My second try came out great, I even added onion, celery and potatoes! It was delicious."

Depending on the size of roast, 1/4 to 1/2 cup of butter, I buy a low sodium brown gravy mix &amp; leave the peppers whole, no one eats them after they are cooked, but I pour some of the juice in the pot &amp; cook it on high....house smells amazing &amp; it gets eaten. I don't make gravy, it's tender and doesn't need it, so I freeze the liquid to use in the next roast....saves on butter"

Best part, it's affordable."

Taking a que from another poster I sprayed the crockpot with olive oil non stick spray and lightly coated the top of the meat with garlic powder. I also used a 12 oz jar of chopped peppers which eliminated the need to remove the stems and seeds."

I did add two spoons of the pepperoncini juice since I figured I had missed out on several hours of it cooking as is. Next time, I'll add just 3 of the peppers and adjust it from there. I was really shocked at how good the ranch and aus jus dry packets together were! Thank you for a great recipe!"

Being that I’m trying to do Keto, I didn’t add potatoes or carrots which I normally always do to a roast ( I know the recipe doesn’t call for them) but I wanted “something”. Well, what I did was add wedged cabbage the last hour along with some halved mushrooms and at serving time spooned the juice on top.... to die for!!! I also subbed onion soup mix for the ranch as that was what I had, and only used maybe a third of a package of it as well as the au jus.... it was perfect!"

Also added a splash of the vinegar from my jar of peppers, because I was worried there wouldn’t be enough water, but everything came out great! I served this with mashed potatoes, rice pilaf, and a side of asparagus, with King’s Hawaiian rolls. The meat is really a great base, the leftovers can be made into tacos, burritos, to a pasta, definitely a new family staple."
