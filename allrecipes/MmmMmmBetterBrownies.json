I like to make recipes exactly as is the first time, but in this case I had no choice but to omit the vanilla, counting on the chocolate to hide the lack. This recipe couldn't be simpler, and the brownies were very good. While replacing the butter with oil didn't transform this into a health food, it is still an improvement, and every little bit helps. Won't be going back to using butter."

"reviewBody": "These are terrific! This recipe is a keeper. I was looking for a recipe with healthier ingredients, and also had some amazing Rapunzel organic cocoa powder on hand and walnuts to use up, along with fresh eggs from a farmer's market. We prefer our brownies cake-like, and these work perfectly for us. To the reader(s) who complain about the fishy- oily taste, you need to make sure that your canola oil is new and smells fresh. Our brownies made tonight were perfectly fine with new oil. That gives it a moist texture. These will keep longer than those brownies made with butter, and also have less saturated fat and cholesterol. Definitely add walnuts if you have some on hand and are able to eat nuts. I put mine in a plastic bag ahead of time, and rolled out with a rolling pin to have ready to fold into the finished batter.\n\n We made a few tweaks in this recipe: 1) I greased the 10 x 6 1/2 inch pyrex pan with butter and dusted with flour. That makes it perfectly easy to get out after cooling (so no need for parchment paper). 2) We upped the cocoa amount to 1/2 cup. I used a wire whisk to mix the dry ingredients ahead of time in a separate bowl. 3) After creaming the sugar and oil with a wire whisk, I then added the vanilla and mixed that in and after that, whisked in the egg. 4) Just whisk the eggs into the oil/sugar/vanilla mixture for 40 strokes or so with a wire whisk (per instructions I'd read online from a Ghiradelli mix). The word \"Beat\" in this recipe here implies usi"

Then I put in the oven and 10 minutes later, the texture was rocky and not what I wanted, but I would say it is ok. I prefer using butter then vegetable oil to avoid air bubbles."

"reviewBody": "These were honestly the best tasting brownies I‚Äôve ever had and I‚Äôve tried many recipes. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars is because I agree with other reviewers that something was a little off with either the pan size or the baking time. I baked them in the recommended 9x9 pan size for the recommended 20 to 25 minutes. They were very thin and they were not done. Had to cook for at least an additional 10-15 minutes. I know all ovens are different, but that‚Äôs a very big difference. I would make these again, but would definitely double or even triple the recipe, as I‚Äôve seen in a few other reviews, and bake for longer time."

There wasn't much volume to this recipe. But they doubled in size when baking. She made a second batch and used a smaller pan but it still didn't fill the square 5X5. I would double next time we make these. Flavor was on point, perfect chocolate amount. Not too sweet- Just right"
