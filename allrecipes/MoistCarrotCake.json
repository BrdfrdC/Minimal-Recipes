He is also sensitive to gluten and very allergic to dairy, so I decided on a whim to give this cake a try using gluten-free flour. I had low expectations, but we both loved it even without the cream cheese frosting. So moist and flavorful. The silver lining of a covid winter with time to try recipes you're not sure will work out."

The pineapple sauce has not enough acid to react with baking soda. Leaving a metal taste. Don’t use soda and use more baking powder if need. Acid from fruits are too uncertain to completely neutralise baking soda perfectly."

I want reviews of this recipe, and I can’t find one. Because you all made some other recipe, you didn’t make this recipe."

I followed the recipe as written except that I substituted about 1/3 of the grated carrots with grated zucchini (fresh from the garden), and used pecans instead of walnuts. I also strained as much of the liquid from the crushed pineapple as possible because I was concerned that my zucchini substitution added extra moisture. I used freshly opened baking soda and powder. I used another Allrecipes recipe for Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting, as my frosting. The final product was EXCELLENT! Rave reviews from everyone."

I really loved the texture provided from all the carrots, walnuts &amp; coconut flakes- but alas-it truly was a bit overly sweet &amp; moist! All that moisture affected my pan release despite a non-stick Bundt pan &amp; release spraying (top of it stuck badly). I will try the changes in heat and oil suggested by other reviewers. I won’t food process the pineapple chunks next time either! I really liked the brown sugar suggestions too. That was going to be among my next set of tweaks when I do this again -and I will be making this quick &amp; easy carrot cake again!!"

I omitted the nuts and pineapple, I don't like pineapple in my carrot cake. But I added ground allspice, ginger and cloves, I love the extra zing of warm spices! Instead of a 13\"x9\" rectangular pan I used two 9\" round pans to make a layered cake. Baked for 35 minutes and it came out beautiful!"

I also subbed about half of the sugar with puréed fruit (pear and pineapple), and added some allspice and vanilla extract to give it more flavour (first time making it I did not change the flavourings and the cake tasted okay but lacking something). The result was a tasty carrot cake! My third attempt will be to reduce the oil again, try 1/2 cup oil and 1 cup apple sauce? This cake recipe tends to be on the oily moist side, but it’s worth playing around with the ingredient proportions; everyone enjoyed the cakes, with or without the cream cheese frosting !"

I added a 1/3 cup of raisins, and also reduced the oil by a 1/4 cup. I still get outstanding results, with a lot rave reviews from all."

I don’t like raisins but I used then anyway. I used the white raisins as they are easier for me to eat. The cake was devoured. Will definitely make this again. I made the cake exactly as listed. The one thing I may have used 3 cups of carrots because it was hard to tell if I had 2 3/4 or 3 so I erred on the more side."

"reviewBody": "I made a couple minor changes to the recipe that cut significant fat and calories from the cake and I do not think it had any negative consequences. I used a food processor and finely chopped the carrots... saved a ton of time and the results were near perfect. Instead of oil I substituted unsweetened applesauce. I believe it added a slight change to the overall flavor profile and I KNOW it reduced the fat and calorie count substantially. I also added 2 tsp of vanilla extract, because vanilla extract goes well in almost any cake recipe, right?! Rave reviews from everyone who tasted it. I also added 10 minutes of cook time, which I “think” may have been due to the applesauce instead of oil."

It lacked structural integrity and so didn't slice very cleanly. I think this is clear from other people's pictures as well. I served it with cream cheese icing and it was just too rich and sweet for the cake. \n\nPineapple sounded like a great addition but I could barely taste it or find it in the cake and so I think more pineapple might have helped to make the cake a bit more interesting.\n\nI might have enjoyed it more if I followed the recipe to a T but nonetheless, would not make again or recommend."

I used Cashew nuts instead and it gave a great taste. With cinnamon I mix half a teaspoon of cardamom powder, which gives nice flavor and aroma. I used freshly scarped coconuts as it is readily available in Sri Lanka and it gave a awesome taste and texture. Everyone loved the cake and I feel very happy every time I make it."

"reviewBody": "This is the best carrot cake I've ever had. I've actually tried the recipe three ways now, and in my opinion, the original printed recipe with 1 1/2 cups vegetable oil (I used canola/olive/grapeseed blend) is the best way to make it. My grandma said it's the best she's ever had! Even better than one of our favorite restaurants that is known for their scratch carrot cake. I tried the 3/4 cup applesauce, 3/4 cup oil version, and it wasn't bad, but the texture was too wet, not \"moist\" in the right way. And the applesauce flavor came through a bit making the cake taste kind of fruity. If you do the half applesauce version, I would recommend cutting the sugar down a little. The all oil version is also SO moist but also tender and rich. I also tried half melted coconut oil and half vegetable oil, but it actually wasn't as moist as all vegetable oil. Just stick with the printed recipe! Unless you plan on sitting down and eating half the cake to yourself, it really doesn't make THAT much of a caloric difference per piece. I mean, c'mon, it's carrot cake, I don't expect it to be diet food! :) I've baked in 2 9inch round pans and also a 9x13 - both good just increase the baking time."

I used the whole thing.\nFor the carrots, I didn't measure; I just shredded 3 large carrots and it looked \"about right\" and I tossed it in.\nI also added 1/2 cup raisins\nIt was so moist, it doesn't need icing.

Very moist and wonderful flavor and texture. I didn't find it to be \"too moist\", as others had said. My only complaint is it took much longer to bake in my oven for some reason. After the recommended baking time my center was still very much uncooked. I baked it another 20-25 minutes. Best thing about the cake is it gets more delicious the longer it sits."

I didn't read any of the earlier reviews about decreasing the oil either, so I used the full amount but I don't think it's as oily as others have said. Next time I will half the oil quantity anyway just to cut back on some of the calories, but otherwise it's THE perfect carrot cake!
