Keep an eye on them in the last few minutes, all ovens are different so Iâ€™d say those with dry muffins may have unintentionally over baked their muffins while following the recipe (my oven took longer though) I watched them closely, pulled them out the moment they were JUST done and let them sit for the 10 minutes before removing from the tin."

The end result of the batter looked nothing like the videos, it was more like the consistency of a cake batter. I figured cupcakes arenâ€™t the worst when your aiming for muffins, but after baking the top sunk in. I still didnâ€™t want to judge them to harshly, so I waited for them to cool and tried them, and they tasted pretty good! I have to admit that I am a novice baker, so this could have all been because of something I did. I will try again, but not with this recipe."

Unfortunately the temp was way too high, I wish I would have made \nthe decision to turn it down when I thought of it. My muffins were burnt on the bottom and the chocolate chips were hard and burnt throughout. Now Iâ€™m an avid baker. If I made these again I would maybe cook them at 350-375. Wayyyy to hot. Fortunately I was able to pick out some that werenâ€™t so bad for my sons after school snack"

I'm embarrassed to say, that I did forget to put in the 3/4 cup of chocolate chips! (I only put in the 1/4 cup of chips that was meant to be added to the top before cooking.) They still turned out great! After muffins cooled a bit I added a little sprinkle of powdered sugar. Will I make these again? You bet! But next time I will remember to add all of the chips!"

Changed the recipe like this bc of comments, added a tablespoon of milk and sugar more &amp; 1/4 cup more chocolate chips (I doubled the recipe, so 1/2 more). Changed plain yogurt to strawberry yogurt (bc thats all I had) and it was so good. Chocolate muffins with a slight hint of strawberry! Also baked at 350 for 20min, my muffins were between mini muffins and store bought muffins, like at walmart."

I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder in case there wasn't enough acid to make the muffins rise. They came out great. They are actually a cupcake but whatever the name they are good! Next time I'll add some toasted nuts."
