"reviewBody": "I made this for my family and they liked it. I would add more garlic next time, and grate the carrots finer to mix better with the other ingredients. I used 1 and 1/4 cup Panko breadcrumbs as that's what I had on hand. I would have rated 5 stars but it took much longer to get up to the proper internal temperature, an extra 15 minutes at least at 400. I would try cooking at 425 for the first half next time. Yes, my oven is usually quite hot. I also added a bit of salt-free chicken seasoning to the onions and peppers when I was sauteing them in the first step. I didn't use oil to fry veggies either, as it's already got enough fat from the meat. Leave yourself at least 1.5 hours just in case you need more cooking time. Great recipe for added veggies though, as it's still a solid meatloaf. Serves 4 hungry men."

I soaked homemade breadcrumbs in 3% milk, and added an extra egg since I used just a little more than 1 lb of lean meat. Instead of lean beef, combined half ground pork with half ground chicken breast. We all love garlic in this house so next time I'll be doubling the amount of garlic. Adding this to my favourite comfort food recipes from now on."

And 1/4 less bread crumbs. I used worcestershire sauce, thyme, oregano, a lil chicken broth, and tomato sauce instead of ketchup. And I used 90% lean beef. I think that's about all I changed. It came out very well. The carrot was identifiable but not too strong. Couldn't even taste the zucchini."

I used 3 mini loaf pans to cook faster but it still took 35-40 minutes. Good recipe and easy to sneak in lots of veggies."

It was nice to have a break from fish and salads and enjoy a \"comfort\" food. I didn't have the right size loaf pan, so I made it in an 8x8 glass dish at 380 degrees since another commenter mentioned it being too dry. I cooked it for 35 minutes and then added the ketchup for another 5 minutes and it was moist and fantastic. Definitely recommended."

The other thing is that our extended family never uses catsup on meatloaf. It is always spaghetti sauce and we pour that on top right before going into the oven. Then we add additional 10 minutes before removing from the oven. My suggestion is to allow it to test 10 minutes covered before serving to keep it even more moist. We also have hot spaghetti sauce available at the table for those who want to top their slice with more of that Italian goodness."

"reviewBody": "I'm not a novice cook, but this was transformational. I've been making meatloaf wrong for a few decades. I had a pound of ground chuck and sauteed all the veggies together (adding garlic in the last five mins.) I froze half the veggies and put the rest in the meat; added my homemade whole grain toasted bread; stirred and stirred and baked. It was perfect. My husband who claims not to like cooked carrots, bell pepper at all (I used an orange bell pepper), and zucchini only with cheese on it, loved it. I will make this again using ground sirloin with all the veggies or a combo of ground chuck and ground turkey with all the veggies. Well done, NOLAMom!"

It's just my husband and I but we wanted leftovers for sandwiches. It slices very nice, doesn't fall apart, so it will work well ! It's a good recipe for tweaking to your personal tastes. My tweaks were: I used my own homemade dry bread crumbs, added teaspoon or so of poultry seasoning, baked it 350 for 1 hour 20 min. (to 160 degrees). I made a topping out of ketchup, barbecue sauce and a little nutmeg and put it on the last half hour."

It came out amazing, super moist and you can't really taste any of the veggies, and for my anti veggie tongue that was super important. What you can taste is the bell pepper but it's one the only veggies I do like but if you have super picky kids I'd chop them super fine"
