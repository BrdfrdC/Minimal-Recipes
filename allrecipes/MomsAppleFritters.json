Next time I'll try adding a bit of almond extract."

I didn’t have 3 cups of apples, so used the two I had. Added vanilla and cinnamon and more sugar to the batter. I think they would be bland otherwise. I grated the apple and I think chunks would be better as I really couldn’t tell these were apple fritters."

I kept the oil at 350 degrees and they each took around 6 minutes to fry. The dble recipe made almost 50 of them for a 2 bite-size. My husband turned a few into mini funnel cakes with ice cream, whipped cream and strawberries and they held beautifully."

I wanted a quick dessert on a crisp fall day, the deep fryer was already out, and so everything just came together :-) I lowered the temp as per some reviews and they didn't take 5 minutes, maybe 4. I added extra cinnamon and nutmeg because we like it and used butter instead of oil (because BUTTER). I should have followed your directions and cut the apples roughly, I followed another review who found the pieces too big so I cut them small...but I missed the chunks of tart Granny Smith apple, and I've made a note of it for next time. I rarely deep fry anything, I drag that thing out of limbo maybe twice a year - but your Mom's apple fritters, along with MY Mom's corn fritters, will be on the semi-annual fry fest menu now ;-) Cheers!"

We did half with the cinnamon sugar mix and then half with the apple cider glaze from the Apple Cider Glazed Doughnuts recipe. The fritters with the glaze were by far the favorite. I used a small scoop for most and then tried just dropping some in the oil to make bigger fritters. The bigger ones were more crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. We will definitely be trying this one again."

At 375 degrees oil, the outside of fritter turned brown quickly, but the inside was still gooey. They are tasty in cinnamon sugar, but not a hit out of the park. I need to compare to other fritter recipes."

I cooked them until the majority were sort of translucent. \nI would use less milk next time. The mixture was too runny. Perhaps I will try 1/2 cup instead of 2/3."
