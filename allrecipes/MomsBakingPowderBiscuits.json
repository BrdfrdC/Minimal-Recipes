The only way would be if your biscuits have the diameter of a quarter. I followed the recipe but made half a batch. I found the biscuits very dry, and they did not have enough salt. Plus, they had very little flavor. I will not make these again."

May have to double it if you want to squeeze out a dozen."

We followed this recipe together and the only variation he made was to add more shortening since the flour seemed too dry. As usual with this kind of cooking, I couldn't tell you how much we added - probably about 2 more tablespoons. We just added it until it looked right.\n\nThe biscuits turned out just like Dad's. Wonderful for biscuits and gravy, bacon and eggs, or with jam."

The changes I made are 2 cup flour = 1 1/3 c of gluten free flour mixture (I use King Arthur Gluten Free Flour or Bob's Redmill 1 to 1 gluten free flour) and 2/3 cup starch (I usual combine 1/3 c corn starch and 1/3 c tapioca starch). The baking powder needs to be gluten free as well (Rumford, Clabber Girl or Bakewell or other). Let dough sit for 20 minutes. When rolling out keep in mind these will not rise much so I leave dough thicker. Bake as usual and enjoy."

I rolled my dough about 1/2\" thick and they just about doubled in height, so they weren't terribly tall, but they tasted very good. I will definitely make them again!"

The recipe taste fine but depending on your oven you may want to lower the temperature when baking because at 450 in my oven the biscuits barely rose and almost burned on the bottom. Otherwise it was easy to make and tasted good."

I halved it and could barely get six 2 1/2 inch biscuits rolled to 1/4 inch thickness which baked to the thickness and crispness of big cookies. Next time, I'll use the entire recipe to make 8-10 thicker, fluffier ones. As for flavor - they're biscuits! How much flavor can flour, shortening and milk (or even buttermilk) have?"

This recipe is amazing and it's very flexible."
