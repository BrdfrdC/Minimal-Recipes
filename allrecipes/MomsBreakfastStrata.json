I cooked the bacon first, also gave the onion Bell Pepper and Mushrooms a quick saute' just to get a little flavor from them and soften them. I made it as stated with eggs and milk and bread and let it all sit over night, cooked it in the morning and took it to work 40 minutes away, it was still warm when I got to work and the potluck was still an hour away. No problem, this dish was gone way faster than I expected, the only change I would make next time is cutting the milk down 1/4 to 1/2 cup, it wound up a little runny but awesome recipe and I'll be making it again for sure, thank you for sharing!!!!"

To me, it didn't make a difference and they had no idea the ham was supposed to be diced. I loved seeing their faces when I told them it was made with almond milk! . I'll definitely make this again - and again, and again, and again..."

For me that means with a splash of vanilla a pinch of nutmeg and a pinch of cinnamon. \nInstead of just ham, I use ham, bacon and breakfast sausage. I don't skimp on the meat.\nWhile the casserole is in the oven I brown hash browns, you can use frozen, but if you go with fresh, be sure to wring the raw potatoes in a dish towel to get most of the water out. Make enough potatoes to cover the entire dish 1/4 inch thick and season the hash browns with salt and pepper. 5 minutes before the casserole is done, spread the potatoes over the dish and sprinkle some more cheddar cheese. Return to oven for 5 minutes.\n\nNo one will go away hungry!!!"

I don't agree. Salt and (freshly coarse ground pepper) in the right amounts should do the trick. Also, for those who like spicy... I always have a bottle of (La Victoria's Salsa Brava) Hot Sauce, on the table, for those who like it spicy...and that's most of us. This is an excellent recipe!"

I made the recipe as written and agree with other reviewers that it needs additional bake time as well as possibly higher oven temperature. Next time I would sauté the onion and pepper before adding to the strata. I would also pour half the egg/milk mixture at the middle of layering and add remainder at the end. It needs some spice. I think some thyme leaves or maybe some cayenne pepper to boost the flavor."

I didn't make this ahead of time but I did have to bake longer. Not sure if that had something to do with the bake time. If you have extra croissants. Use them for this. They added amazing flavor! Next time Id like to use spicy sausage and make the night before as the recipe instructs. Still turned out well, though."

"reviewBody": "I wanted something easy for Sunday brunch and decided to try this recipe even though I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I didn't have mushrooms and thought I had a pepper but didn't so I ended up substituting brocolli. Some suggested the onions need to be pre-sauteed but I think they cooked up fine in the mixture. My only issue was the texture of the bread in the center of the pan. It was a little too moist for my tastes. I think I am going to try reducing the milk and/or using less fresh bread or maybe some french bread that has been cubed and left to dry for a little while before assembling the ingredients. I did add salt, pepper and a couple cloves of smashed roasted garlic to the egg mixture. When I took the foil off at the 30 minute mark the cheese hadn't melted and everything still looked quite wet so I turned the heat up to 375 and left it in the oven for 25 minutes instead of the stated 15. It looked and smelled so nice when it came out of the oven. The flavor was great! I'm glad the recipe called for milk as I think cream (some reviewers switched to cream) would have made it too rich for us. The recipe sounds delicious as written and it was great with the changes I made. It's a great base for you to add the things that you like and so easy to switch things up for variety. Now that I've said all this I truly do agree with Nicki and Gus, it's not fair to change everything about the recipe and then complain and give a low rating when it doesn't turn out"

She never tore the bread, just buttered slices, then cut it into squares to serve. I will say that in my experience the cooking time is too short. I take it out of the refrigerator first thing in the morning and sit it on the counter till almost room temperature. That cuts down on the cooking time. And don't rush to serve it. It stays VERY hot if you make it with cheese."

I prefer to use shaved black forest ham torn into pieces, and I season the egg/milk mixture with salt, pepper and tobasco/hot sauce.

I was hesitant about a \"soggy bread\" dish, but WOW! Added a little extra ham &amp; cheese and cooked for about 5 minutes longer and increased temp to 375 for the uncovered baking."

I only used 3 pieces of bread, 7 eggs, and 1 1/4 cup of milk. I only used about 2/3 cups of shredded cheese. I also added in some fresh chopped spinach, 1/4 cup, for color. I used 1 tsp hot sauce and and one tbsp prepared mustard and no mushrooms or green pepper or onion. Yummy!"

"reviewBody": "I used this recipe as a base and it worked perfectly. I made 4 key changes: 1. I used challah instead of white bread (amazingly fluffy). 2. I used spinach instead of ham. 3. I mixed the onions and mushrooms together. 4. I added gruyere to the cheddar (also I used Cheddar from Borough Market/Neal's Dairy Yard) and it was DELICIOUS. This was an amazing recipe. I studied many others that called for half and half and in all seriousness didn't feel like I missed a thing without it. I served this with Whole Foods 365 Maple Sausage Links and Smoked Salmon Nova and everyone seemed pleased. Rather than put the meat in the strata."

I did my own version which turned out much better. Instead of using bread I used 1 1/2 boxes of garlic and herb croutons. I also used swiss cheese instead of cheddar and 1/2 heavy cream, 1/2 milk. This made it much richer. It is a good recipe just needed some spicing up! :)"

On Christmas morning) we get up (really early!) and I put it in the oven @ 350 for 70 minutes. By the time presents are opened and the mess is cleaned up it's time to eat!\n\nMy recipe uses toasted bread and we like lots of blotted, crumbled bacon I add previously-cooked hashbrowns (nice and golden brown!)in the morning before it goes in the oven.\n\nMy grandkids now look forward to Christmas morning just like their Mom or Dad did a generation ago!\n\nIt's a great family tradition!"

I have made other variations of it before and have found that letting the bread sit out for a day (so it won't be too soft or mushy) before tearing the pieces up in preparation. I added a little garlic powder and onion powder to the recipe and also added (canned) mild green chili slices in between the first cheese layer and under the cheese in the last layer. Turned out nice and souffle' like. Yum."

It was so easy to prepare and very delicious. I did however. only use 8 oz. of cheese instead of 16 oz. and that was plenty of cheese. Everyone loved it, even the kids. I would definately make this again. For a little kick you might want to use Pepper Jack cheese."

I cut the recipe in half and baked in a round cassarole dish. I think my dish was a tad too deep because it did come out a little sloppy. Next time I'll bake it in a larger dish and not make each layer as deep."
