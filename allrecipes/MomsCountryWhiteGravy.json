"reviewBody": "Measuring gravy ingredients never happens in my kitchen. I normally make sausage gravy, and use the rendered fat for the gravy. I sprinkle the fat with flour while whisking, until the fat is all absorbed, and makes a roux/mayonnaise consistency. If more is needed, I usually add olive oil or bacon grease. I cook until it changes color over medium-high heat. Salt to taste, a good sprinkle. Then I add a bunch of milk, and more if needed, over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to simmer, until desired consistency. Add fresh-ground pepper last, to taste, plus a shot or two of real Tabasco, or to taste. Proper consistency is when it pours fairy easily, not ‚Äúgloppy‚Äù. Crumble a couple of sausage patties into the finished product for sausage gravy."

I looked up this recipe because there are very few ingredients in it. It's great if you want to tweak a recipe if you have those extra things but I absolutely loved this recipe as is. It got me out of a conundrum of what I was going to eat until payday, tomorrow. Thank you for the recipe!"

It adds a nice touch but that much pepper is a little overwhelming. I would probably try a teaspoon of pepper rather than a tablespoon. Other than that, this is a recipe worth trying. Just have some sort of container ready as this recipe makes quite a bit and you will have leftovers unless you're feeding a lot of people."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was my first step into making my own gravy. If you follow the directions exactly you will get a very nice light brown colored gravy with tons of flavor. Here are some tips that help me out each time I make it.\n\n- Don't get the pan too hot - \nIf you heat the oil up too hot the roux will start to stick and burn quickly. You will smell a burning aroma and the roux will be difficult to mix smoothly.\n\n- Make sure to season the roux generously-\nDon't be shy on the salt and pepper for the roux. You should start to smell a sweet smell as you mix in more seasoning and continue stirring. For me this is largely what conceals the flour flavor and really makes the gravy taste great in the end. The roux IMO is the most important part of any gravy recipe. If you think you've over seasoned it - you probably haven't. Just remember that you are diluting it with several cups of milk which greatly alters the concentration of the seasoning.\n\n-Don' t cook the rue too long OR too short -\nSounds strange, but if you cook it too long you will get a very strong flavor that may be overkill. On the other side of things if you don't cook it long enough it will taste like flour which isn't any better. I find that cooking it until it starts to change color and smell is the best indicator. When the rue starts to brown slightly and starts to smell sweet then you've cooked all of the flour. Anything further than this will results in a stronger \"steak gravy\" taste. \n\nJust another tip - If you're usi"

My dishwasher helps...\nBut have found that a quantity in the fridge for biscuits or toast, may be helpful, but that begs the question, 'Is it Fridge or Freezer friendly?'

Have patience, stick with it, keep stirring and don't go lollygaggin' somewhere else. (2). It's even better if cooked in an iron skillet! (3). You can add meat to it but then it isn't milk gravy, it's sausage/meat gravy. (4). There is nothing better than milk gravy poured over a homemade biscuit! (5). Enjoy it while you're young because once you get past 50 all the health people just harp and harp at you about calories, cholesterol, and high blood pressure! (6). Don't grow up.....it's a trap!"

Butter has so much more flavor than vegetable oil could ever hope for. I also reduced the flour to slightly less than 2/3 cups. I did cook the flour and butter roux for 4-5 minutes, but for me, I did not want my flour to turn brown. I like my country white gravy to be just that...white. I also used chicken, 'Better than Bouillon' base. I used about 2 teaspoons of the base. After stirring in, then I tasted to see if I needed to add any salt as the recipe calls for. I salted to my liking. My gravy had really great flavor, so smooth and velvety, that went deliciously with the Chicken Fried Steak that I made for dinner. My family really enjoyed it.."
