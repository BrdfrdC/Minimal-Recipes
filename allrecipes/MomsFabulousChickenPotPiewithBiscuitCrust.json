I would increase the liquid because as the dish cools, that biscuits suck up the liquid and I'd like more gravy over the biscuits. I would increase both the half and half (1 C?) and the chicken stock slightly (2.5C?)."

However, the product UNDER the refrigerated biscuit dough is excellent! Next time, I will probably use puff pastry on top. Also, be advised that, if using raw veggies, the prep is very tedious. I might just use frozen next time."

Added more salt and pepper. Used only 1/1/2 cups of chicken broth and added 1 tsp of Better than Bullion. Used 12 oz. frozen mixed corn, peas, green beans and carrots. 1 tsp. diced garlic in onion. The Grands biscuits were too much biscuits for the filling for my taste When I make the recipe again I'll change that."

The addition of the half-n-half really added to the dish. It gave it a nice, creamy flavor. Spices are spot on. I had just one issue in that the biscuits were still quite raw on the bottom so I ended up flipping them over and baking an additional 10 minutes. I think that helped. May just use Bisquik drop biscuits next time. I will most definitely make this again and again!"

He picks peas out of everything and hates cooked carrots... Guys, he had SECONDS! Ate every bite. \nI did not have dried thyme, so I did a pinch of dry rosemary and put a bay leaf in while cooking the veggies to compensate. (Take out bay before adding chicken.) But I did everything else exactly as called for. Delicious, creamy pot pie with a flavorful, aromatic gravy."

"reviewBody": "I made this for my family and everyone loved it. I used canned peas and carrots, which worked fine, but fresh veggies are likely much better (as the recipe suggests). I did not have thyme or parsley so I substituted a dash of oregano which made it interesting. I used the refrigerated biscuits suggested and I had a difficult time cooking them through without over-browning the tops. I wonder if dropping the temp and extending the time would help this. I realize ovens cook differently (mine is a much older model that cooks hotter on the left side than the right), so this variable could be adjusted accordingly. I’m also curious how substituting frozen biscuits might affect this recipe. Overall, regardless of my lack of ingredients, this was a great dish that was both easy and quick to prepare."

I didn't have half and half, so I improvised and used half heavy whipping cream and half 2% Milk. I did add some diced potatoes... because why not? You can easily add or swap out any veggies based on what you have and it will still taste great. I almost threw in a Green Giant veggie steam bag, but ended up finding the peas in the freezer. One thing I might change next time is baking the biscuits separately, atleast a little bit, to avoid the bottom layer from getting too soggy."
