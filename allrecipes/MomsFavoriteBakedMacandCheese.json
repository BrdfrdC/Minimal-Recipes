"reviewBody": "It is a good basic recipe but I cannot understand why it has so many 5 star ratings. It was Ok; maybe people are used to the box kind of mac and cheese? Try using your favorite cheese that melts (and does not string) and try using some(not all) heavy cream or 1/2 &amp; 1/2 . If you add the cracker/melted butter topping at the end(last 10 minutes) it will be a crowd pleaser. My husband likes me to put a layer of mac and cheese at the bottom of the dish, then add a thin layer of crumbled blue cheese and chopped up bacon and a light sprinkle of cayenne/red pepper. Add a top layer of mac and cheese and bake 15-20 minutes. Next layer on the cracker butter topping and cook around 10 more minutes. He loves it (I do not)."

Our client had requested Mac and cheese that had fried bacon and onion in it, so with a few minor prep changes, we came up with the creamiest, most delicious Mac and cheese I have had in a very long time! I chopped and fried the bacon, then sautéed the onions with it, drained them well, discarded the bacon grease, and continued with the recipe using butter to make the roux. Delicious! We will definitely be using this again both in catering, and at home!!"

"reviewBody": "This is a no-holds-barred style of mac and cheese. Delicious, creamy and very filling. Not a dish for health-conscience people. I increased the recipe by 50 percent, which was not necessary given how filling this dish is. When cooking, be careful that you have a large enough saucepan to hold all the ingredients. This recipe holds its own as a main dish but would work just as well as a side.\n\nPros: creamy, cheesy, filling, fairly easy to make\n\nCons: salty, may be too heavy for some. I had one serving (I'm a big guy) and that was plenty. I would like to find a way to cut the salt down. Then I think it would rate five stars."

I've tried other Mac and cheese recipes, didn't really care for them, especially my Husband who happens to be a picky eater. \nI did some tweaking, instead of using the type of cheese that called for 2 cups, I used instead 1 cup of Finely Shredded Italian Cheese. For the other kind of cheese, I used 1 cup of Shredded Sharp Cheese. I also used a few shakes of Grated parmesan cheese. Put in a couple of shakes of Worcestershire. \nUsed a Red onion instead, green seems to us too strong. \nTo top it off, after putting the finished product in a casserole dish, I had poured enough extra milk on top and a few more shakes of parmesan cheese. We like our Mac and cheese, well at least my Husband does, a little bit more moist,. I put it the oven for One hour and 10 to 15 minutes longer. I found out if in oven for 15 minutes longer, for us it comes out perfect. It may look dry, but it's not. Also by using less cheese, it's not over powering."
