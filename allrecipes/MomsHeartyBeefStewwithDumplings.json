I was also worried it would be overly salty with the gravy packets but it wasn't. I did add a 1/2 cup of red wine to boost the flavor. This was so good and the dumplings were tender and perfectly cooked. This will be our new beef stew recipes."

The only thing I’ll change next time is marinade the meat overnight and I can not wait for next time."

"reviewBody": "Good recipe, my mom's is a little different: For tender beef, sear the chunks for less time, just 2 or 3 minutes, in butter instead of oil, and remove them to a bowl to be returned later once the broth is in. Also, coat them in flour and pepper first; the flour cooks off and helps thicken the stew later so you don't need gravy powder. Cook some mushrooms in more butter until they brown, with bay leaf thyme pepper and whole cloves, add onions and root veggies (parsnips are awesome), fresh green beans, then a bunch of red wine to deglaze the brown bits off, then the stock. Simmer for 2 to infinity hours. I love beef stew!!"

I used a can of beef broth, then added water up to the level required to mix my gravy mixes with. I have found you can put the raw veggies in a slow cooker, top with the cooked beef and onions and then add in the prepared gravy over the top. It was ready after 4 hours on high. I'm sure you could add in your dumplings at that point and cook for another hour, as I have another recipe where I do just that."

"reviewBody": "I definitely \"took liberties\" with this recipe - but it is forgiving, and a fantastic base to tweak to your personal preferences. I used less water and gravy packets (because my hubby doesn't like soups / stews very much so I keep them as thick as possible), used 3 large russet potatoes, omitted the turnip and used a packet of mushroom gravy and chicken gravy since I was out of \"brown\". I added a little seasoning to the dumpling mixture as well - some garlic salt, parsley and basil. I only had 2 hours as well since I started dinner later then intended. Came out SO GOOD. The meat was still tender, thick with gravy and yummy potatoes and veggies, and the dumplings were fantastic. I will definitely make this one again."

"reviewBody": "This was simple and easy. I could not find a turnip though. The meat fell apart in this and shredded by the time this was finished. I couldn't fix the dumplings as there was no room in my pot for them on top. This made a huge pot full of stew. This is a good standard recipe and a great starting point for adding your own variations and making this your own. I used hamburger seasoning and some Texas Roadhouse seasoning instead of Montreal. The gravy was a bit thin so I mixed another gravy pouch with 1/4 c. water and then added it in to thicken it a little. We left the celery in and used whole baby carrots. I did use a mix of chicken broth and beef broth instead of water since I had them open and wanted to use them up. This really needed a little something and neither hubby nor I could figure out what we were missing. I only added a little black pepper and nothing else to this. I will be using this again only trying it in the crockpot the next time. I really want to use a larger pot so there is room for the dumplings. I simply made drop biscuits and baked them in the oven. Thanks for the nice EASY meal. It did take all day to fix though so do plan ahead and start this one early."

The taste was good and the beef nice and tender!\nMy changes:\n I substituted beef broth for the water and added a packet of Swanson's flavor boost as well. I reduced the potatoes to 5 (plenty), left the celery in (I'd chopped it up a bit more), added mushrooms and used flour/water for gravy portion since I'd already put the beef broth and flavor boost in, it worked out just fine. If I did it again, I'd increase the carrots, add green beans in there, mushrooms again and probably add more celery. I agree with the other reviewers--great recipe, can use more veggies."

"reviewBody": "amazing! i just made this. made a couple changes to suit me and my boyfriends preferences. 1) used beef broth instead of the water and only added 1 package of the gravy mix (just to thicken) 2) used only 4 potatoes and added 1 large sweet potato 3) added fresh herbs to the dumplings other than that i followed the recipe to a \"T\" everybody loved it, i will deffinetly be making this again! thanks"

"reviewBody": "Was very good! I left out the turnip since I couldn't find one at the store. The sauce/gravy was a bit runnier than I've had in other stews, but yet not thin enough to call it more of a \"soup\". We enjoyed this - thanks!"

"reviewBody": "Very tasty stew. However, I used Swanson's beef broth in a carton instead of water simply because I prefer a richer flavor to the gravy. I also added about half a cu of Merlot wine. I used all the other ingredients as given and it was excellent. My problem is with the dumplings, but maybe I jut don't understand dumplings. The recipe doesn't say how big the spoonfulls should be. Mine turned out gummy and tasted of flour. I tossed them out and served mashed potatos on the side. We enjoyed the stew just as well."
