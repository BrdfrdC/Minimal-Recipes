That helped but there was still dry flour that would would not join the ball, so I added some sour cream - 2 tablespoons! Now I could make a ball. Baked it at 350 for 1 hour, but it wasn’t fully cooked, so gave it another 10 minutes. When I cut into it, it was still a little raw. (Probably because of the extra liquid)"

Soda bread is always dry, but this one is particularly dry. However it does have a wonderful taste. We ordered soda breads from two different bakeries we have used in the past, and this one tasted better than either of them. I too, ended up with a heavy bottom crust.before it was completely baked. Next time I won't worry about a soggy middle. I did use raisins since we both like them."

This year I decided to try making it myself and I'm glad I did. Both my son and I loved this crusty version of the bread, and my husband ate his fair share as well. I had to substitute cranberries for the raisins since I didn't have any of the latter but I prefer cranberries anyway. The taste is slightly sweet and the texture is a little dry but not overly so. I'd describe it as a large biscuit more than a bread. I'll definitely make it again but not too often because I'd eat way too much of it!"

I made it gluten-free yesterday and had to add an additional cup of buttermilk. I thought maybe it was the unusual flour, so I made it again tonight with regular bleached white flour. It was STILL TOO DRY to make a ball. So I added the extra 1cup of buttermilk and it was perfect! 3. I like caraway seeds in mine, so I added one teaspoon of caraway seeds to the buttermilk/raisin mixture."
