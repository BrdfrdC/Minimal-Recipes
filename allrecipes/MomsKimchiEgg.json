I love kimchi but usually can’t eat much because the carbonation combined with spiciness hurts my tongue. Cooking it first makes it more mild yet it was still every bit as delicious!"

I recommend chopping up the kimchi to a more manageable size. I also added fresh spinach, 1 T. sour cream whisked into the eggs before I added to the pan. This is a terrific recipe , very simple and tasty as is but it lends it's self to personal variations. ( Used Mother In Laws Kimchi. )"

The only substitution I made was to switch out the vegetable oil (high in omega-6 fatty acids and some trans fat) for avocado oil (full of healthy monounsaturated fat). Super fast, easy, delicious, and nutritious! Thanks!"
