Also liberally dusted with cinnamon sugar before baking. Very tender and easy to slice before second baking. Next time I may use cinnamon in the mix since I feel that flavor is lacking in the above recipe."

"reviewBody": "This went together quickly for me. I used slivered almonds, didn't chop them any further, chocolate chips and a little less than a half cup of shredded coconut that was looking for a home. From past experience with biscotti, I wet my hands before shaping and shaped them on a parchment-covered baking sheet. Use a serrated knife to slice, but don't saw. You can also use the flat side of the blade of the knife to help flip the slices on their sides. I sprinkled on a little vanilla sugar before the second baking. Very tasty!"

"reviewBody": "Loved this Mandelbrot. Will absolutely make it again. I followed recipe exactly, but I did change a few of the directions. I often make Biscotti for my family, so I used some of those methods and applied them to this recipe. 1. I mix the chocolate chips and slivered almonds in with the flour. This assures an even distribution in the finished cookie. 2. After mixing all the ingredients, I refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes. This makes it not so \"sticky\", and easier to work with. 3. I dump the dough onto a floured bread board and then form it into two logs. Be sure to flour the bread board. I then transfer the logs to a baking sheet, lined with parchment paper. I always use parchment paper. Use a pastry brush to brush off any excess flour from the top of your logs. 4. I bake my logs in a preheated 350 degree oven for 30 minutes, to get some color on the logs. 5. I remove the logs from the oven and let them rest for 15 minutes so they are easy to handle. Leave your oven on at 350 degrees while the logs are cooling. 6. Slice the logs at an angle, so you get longer slices. Return the slices to the baking sheet, standing them on their bottoms, not laying on their sides. 7. Return the sliced logs to the oven for 15 more minutes. Cool. Enjoy."

Sometimes I use walnuts instead and leave the chocolate chips out. When I bake them for the second time, I sprinkle a cinnamon-sugar mix over them. I also dip them in melted chocolate sometimes either on one side or just one end. They are a favorite at our house for sure."

It was missing cinnamon! The dough is very sticky so you kind of have to slap it on the pan and can't really shape it. Don't worry, once it's baked, you can't tell it looked like that at one point!"

The almonds get chopped in a Bullet so I get a mix of almond dust, and chunks that help reduce the stickiness. This has become a family favorite."
