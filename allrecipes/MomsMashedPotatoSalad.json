"reviewBody": "I make this several times a year. Yields about 2 quarts. This style of mashed potato salad is exactly what I was looking for. I grew up on this style and I can't find it this way in stores. I used about 800 grams of just normal, pealed russet potatoes (weight measurements are a good thing, folks -- 6 potatoes can vary bunches. I end up using about 7). Used a sprig of rosemary from the garden (everyone needs a rosemary bush in their garden/flowerbed/hedge/whatever). Added a little more mustard, celery and pickles -- 'cause I likes them. The potatoes do not need to be mashed. They fall apart on their own as the ingredients are mixed in. My Mom used sweet pickles, but my wife and I prefer dill. We even add a tablespoon of Lighthouse Dill. Better the next day. It firms up a little more and the flavors blend together after sitting in the refrigerator over night. Make this on the weekend and have cheap, tasty, and vegetarian lunch all week for work with some homemade chili beans, soup or PB&amp;J sandwich. Better than anything you can buy at the local grocer. And did I say cheap? You can eat well on few dollars. Just takes a little research and planning and discipline."

I have friend who's Mom always makes Mashed Potato Salad- hers is a little more basic than this but I just LOVE it. She cooks the peeled/cubed potatoes - drains them throws the minced onions on while hot, covers the pan for 5 minutes so the heat from the potatoes can soften the harsh bite of the raw onion. She mashes this and Then adds the Miracle Whip to the hot potatoes. I believe this step to be important as it keeps the salad light and not gluey."

To be honest I don't think anyone in five adult generations of my family measures anything. We all grew up with it and just throw it together and and it always comes out right. It's good to see someone that does measure post this great recipe. We usually add some paprika on top when finished along with a few slices of boiled eggs for presentation. Try this recipe. My guess is you will get rave reviews from your family and friends."

I also used extra pickles (I used dill instead of sweet, personal preference). It is very good though! I'd watch the onion though, it tastes a little strong, even with my 4 lbs of potatoes. Great base recipe though! I also suggest mixing the mayo/pickle juice/mustard combo while mashing to make sure it is nice and smooth. It helped me get the flavor of the potatoes right before adding everything else."

When I would call it \"Mashed potato salad\" people would say \"Yuck\" but they never tried it! Once they tried it, they loved it! You CANNOT get creamier potato salad, and it is addicting! Lol! Thank you for this recipe!"

Sadly, all we can buy at our grocer is the small new red potatoes. So we've switched to the russets...going to try the Yucon Gold and see how that works. We also use chopped sour or dill pickles, substituting apple cider vinegar when we don't have any pickle juice. Pickle juice is preferred."

People kept coming up to me asking for the recipe, delicious! I used yellow potatoes and didn't peel them. Everything else was exactly like the recipe."

Takes quite a bit of salt and pepper. ;-) After eating a bite with crumbled bacon and olive slices that I added for garnish when taking a picture, I will DEFINITELY be adding both of those to the whole batch next time I make this!"

I slightly mashed the potatoes to have a little more texture to the salad. Simple and delicious--my husband said it reminded him of his mother's potato salad. For those of you who have not tried mashed potato salad, you've got to try it."
