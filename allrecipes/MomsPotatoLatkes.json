I grated the small onion and also used some dry onion powder, garlic powder along with the salt and pepper. Pressed them down so they were nice and flat and fried away. Had exactly 10 perfect latkes with great flavor."

I did the recipe exactly as described and it turned out great (and golden delicious). I'm a latke newbie, so staying organized was a bit of a challenge, but it all worked out. I used Canola oil because I always do when vegetable oil is called for. I upped the servings quantity to 6, so I used my food processor to do the shredding which was a life-saver. Loved the recipe - thanks!"

"reviewBody": "This is a great recipe! I followed it almost exactly except I used panko breadcrumbs instead of crushed saltine crackers. After soaking the shredded potatoes and getting rid of excess moisture in a salad spinner, I combined all the ingredients in a bowl and put it in the fridge for about an hour until I was ready to make the latkes. I noticed that even after adding more panko there was quite a bit of liquid in the bottom of the bowl, so next time I'll also squeeze excess liquid through a clean tea towel after the salad spinner step. Anyway, I formed the patties by hand and squeezed the excess moisture out prior to putting the patties in the hot canola oil and they turned out great. Both my wife and 11 year old son really enjoyed them and I did too, so we'll be making these often. Thanks very much for sharing your recipe Lindsay!"

I overcooked the first two but learned from them. I strongly suggest using a food processor (mini) for the onion, but a hand grater isn't too bad for the potatoes. This will be an occasional alternative to Swedish potato pancakes."

I did cut the recipe in half since it was just for me. They stuck together just fine and fried up easily. I wasn't sure how much salt etc to add since I cut the recipe in half so they were a bit bland my fault not the recipe. I don't like onion but next time I will add some for flavor."

"reviewBody": "Amazing! I used a food processor to shred the potatoes and onions. I rinsed and patted dry the potatoes, making sure to have as little water as possible in the mixture. Our 4-H group served these to about 150 people (talk about budget-friendly food!) and got lots of great feedback. I think I may try adding a little garlic powder next time. Oh, and putting a touch of sour cream on them takes them to the next level. This recipe is a keeper!!"

"reviewBody": "This is the third time I've made this recipe but the first time I've rinsed and rerinsed the potatoes and it made a world of difference. I soaked the potatoes after peeling them and then several times after shredding them in the food processor. I rerinsed again and again and again until the water ran clear, ran them through the salad spinner, and then used cheesecloth and then paper towels to remove all the water. Thanks to everyone for the suggestions about how to remove the water. One more thing ~ it really helped that I had my teenage son to help because wringing out the water is cumbersome ??"

"reviewBody": "This recipe was perfect for traditional Hanukkah latkes. I did use matzo meal instead of the saltines to make them more authentic and easier since its already ground but I doubt that makes much of a difference. I might have used a bit more than the recipe called for since I didn't measure anything. The potatoes were surprisingly easy to hand grate. The moisture from the potatoes makes this a bit messy to make but no big deal. Just had to squeeze it out with my hands when forming the pancakes. I will never make the boxed latkes again."

"reviewBody": "Excellent recipe! Other recipes I've used have involved too many steps so I only made latkes in December for the holiday however, this recipe is super simple and I can definitely see making these more frequently which my husband will enjoy. There were only 2 steps I did differently first, after shredding the potatoes and onions, I placed them in a towel and sprinkled with salt and allowed the water to drain for about 20-30 minutes then squeezed the remainder of the water out and threw all of the ingredients in the bowl. And the final step I did differently was baking in a 375 degree (convection oven) on a foil lined cookie sheet sprayed with Pam for about 20 minutes instead of frying in oil which cuts down on the fat and calories. Wonderful recipe!"

Followed the recipe exactly except for making sure I rinsed the starch off the shredded spuds by letting them soak in cold water for about 10 minutes and squeezing them in a towel to make sure they were very dry, as a few other reviewers suggested. I did not have saltines, so used oyster crackers, which are essentially the same thing only littler . Crispy outside, moist inside .... I am glad this was an 8 latke batch for the two of us... we will be having them with eggs for breakfast ! Just great ! It's now shared on my FB page ... thanks for sharing your Mom's recipe !"

Do squeeze the excess liquid from the potatoes and then again when mixed with the onion, eggs, crackers, salt and pepper. I only used 1/2 teaspoon of salt since I always try to reduce my salt intake. Although the latkes still came out great (according to my family's rave reviews) I will use at least 3/4 teaspoon of salt since I felt like I didn't use enough. The latkes are absolutely delicious and not hard to make at all!"

The latkes were too salty for my taste but my boyfriend didn't think so. I put grape jelly on mine to cut the saltiness which tasted great. 5 stars with half the salt! // Updating to 5 stars since my croutons were surely to blame for the saltiness"

The directions here don't mention you should soak the potatoes in water to get rid of excess starch, then squeeze the water out of the potatoes by stuffing it into a clean dish towel, then applying as much pressure as you can. I did the same with the onion. I think this made a tremendous difference in the final texture, which was crispy and held together, rather than watery and falling apart (as has happened to me in the past).\n\nThe video also suggested serving with lox over the sour cream, also a hit.\n\nOverall: fantastic!
