I made sure to drain off most of the juice (can be used for Jelly/Syrup) to keep it from becoming too soggy.\n\nOtherwise, this is a keeper. Thanks!"

Just right without covering up the fruit. Other reviewers have not used the optional allspice and have substituted other spices which I'm sure is also good but if you have it on hand, use it! It seriously enhances the rhubarb and the crisp. The only changes I made are cutting the white sugar in half (I like the tartness of the rhubarb) and I add the cinnamon &amp; allspice to the crumble mixture as I prefer the spice in with the oatmeal. I've made it as written and once it's in your mouth, you can't really tell which portion was spiced and which was not. Just a mental thing for me."

I only made two change I added a little lemon zest because I think it adds a little zip to rhubarb plus I added a little nutmeg instead of allspice. Will be making this again soon."

"reviewBody": "I found some rhubarb at the local garden center and suddenly had a craving for MY mom’s rhubarb crisp. Got home and couldn’t find her recipe anywhere so did a quick allrecipes search and found this. Dad was coming over for dinner and I was under a time crunch, so I chopped up the rhubarb and tossed it in the pan, poured the flour and sugar blend over the top and popped that in the oven while mixing up the oatmeal mixture - just like I remember Mom doing. Then I spread all of the oatmeal mixture over the top of the warmed rhubarb and back into the oven for 45 minutes. Perfection! Dad thought it tasted great, we all loved it - tart but sweet, slightly crunchy topping. So good - just like Mom use to make! Thank you! Buy the way, when I came back to write the review, I actually read through the directions and found out half of the crumb mixture was suppose to go on the bottom! :-) I might have to try it that way next time- even though it is not the way my mom made rhubarb crisp ;-)"
