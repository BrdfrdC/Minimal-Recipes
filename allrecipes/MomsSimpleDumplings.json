Drop these into your perfectly seasoned broth by the tablespoon. Any larger and they may not cook evenly. If you don't cut the butter properly, like some have said, the dumplings aren't very good. If you prefer herbed flavor, try adding thyme or rosemary into the dry ingredients. A pinch goes a long ways!"

"reviewBody": "I have not made this specific recipe yet. I plan to as lost mine. If your dumplings break up, try having your soup/stew simmering and not at a rolling boil. Cook the same, I do lid on for 10, then lid off for 10. * Before scooping up the dumpling dough, dip the spoon, I use a serving spoon, into the soup/stew and then scoop a spoonful of batter and gently place into soup/stew by putting spoon into soup. Then dip spoon again, and repeat. This prevents the dough from sticking to the spoon."

Which I neither had on hand, or wanted to use based on the various reviews. Found this recipe this morning while it was cooking. So happy with it! Forgot to read the number of servings so I have more dough then needed, but it's a simple recipe with cheap ingredients so I'm not too upset. I did substitute margarine for shortening simply because that's what I had on hand. Which from what I've seen is a pretty common substitution. Atleast in my home ;)"

Don't forget always eat your dumplings with a fork, if you cut into them with a spoon it flattens them and they lose that \"aireness\"."

They worked with that recipe, and would work well in pretty much any stew recipe you might want dumplings for."

Thickened with cornstarch added salt and pepper to taste and then made these dumplings. They were great. They did not turn out as pictured but maybe my broth was more bubbly. Still they were chewy on the outside and bread like in the middle which is exactly how I want my dumplings. I did use butter instead of shortening. Thank you for the great recipe I will use over and over."
