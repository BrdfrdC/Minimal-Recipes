Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I wonder if the people who find this recipe to sweet are omitting the seaweed? The seaweed is naturally salty and balances with the sugar. This recipe made a nice big batch. I had sushi for dinner and there was still enough rice leftover to make sushi for days. This ones a keeper. Thanks for the great recipe!"

It SEEMS too sweet when it's first made (especially when it's still warm), but after it cools and is used with other ingredients, I find that its flavor is perfect. I like to add a few squirts of fresh lemon juice to mine. Just keep in mind that flavors are always more intense in warm food; the salt/sweet flavors NEED to be more intense in the warm rice so that, when it cools, it will have proper flavor."

I reduced the sugar because I had seasoned rice vinegar. Made sushi with it and it was great! *UPDATE* Second time around, I used distilled white vinegar in a pinch and it worked fine!"

There have been times where we haven't had time to let the rice sit for 30 minutes before cooking it and it's still turned out great! I still haven't had a chance to add kelp to it like the recipe calls for but I hope to eventually!! I'm sure that would be great. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us all!!!"

"reviewBody": "I thought the 3 cups was only for rinsing the rice, because it just barely covers the rice in the saucepan. It doesn't say in the written instructions how much water to add to the rice, and because I knew it would be 5 cups yield, I filled my regular saucepan up to the top with water. Well, I wasted nearly half a bag of rice. It's is so gluggy and disgusting. Too much water. It would be great if the recipe could be altered to say, \"then place into a saucepan along with the konbu and 3 CUPS of water\" if this is the case and you only need 3 cups. As someone who has never made sushi rice before, I have absolutely no idea if this is what you do so any help would be very much appreciated."

I didn't have sushi rice, so I made it with another short grain starchy rice and it turned out perfectly. I also didn't make it with the konbu, but it turned out just like the sticky rice I've had in so many hawaiian restaurants. Thanks for the great recipe!"

Before you add the sugar called for in this recipe read the ingredient label to see if it has sugar. If it does you need to reduce or omit the sugar or your rice will be too sweet."

Personally, I found it to be slightly too sweet and vinegary for use in sushi rolls (although perfect if you're just craving the rice alone), and have reduced both the rice vinegar and sugar by 1.5 tablespoons, with excellent results."

The vinegar/sugar/salt ratio was just perfect though; flavoured the rice without overwhelming it, and gave it the ideal texture for sushi. To facilitate the sugar dissolving I just microwaved my mixture for 20 seconds at a time, stirring, until it was uniformly incorporated."

I was amazed at how good this tasted, by itself or in a sushi roll. Delicious. I add toasted sesame seeds and have never used kelp and it's perfect. My sushi fanatic friends loved it as well and were really surprised at how well it turned out. I use imitation crab, nori, cucumber, sriracha sauce, and avocado to make the PERFECT sushi the serve it with soy sauce and wasabi. So good!"

I was able to get the sugar and salt to dissolve in the vinegar without heating it - but I did whisk it really well for a few minutes - it may have been easier to heat it up :) It was a great consistency for the sushi. It was really sticky (make sure you wet your hands when using it) and tasted like sushi from a restaurant. I found the flavors to be just perfect - not too sweet or vinegary. I did let it cool completely before using it. This will definitely be our go-to sushi rice recipe."

The liquid mixture tasted really strong and I was worried it would be over-powering, but it wasn't. The rice tasted a tad bit vinegary, sugary, and salty. I think it would be perfect for sushi in consistency. My only regret was making the full 8 servings for 2 of us, as cutting it back to 4 would have been very easy. It was nice to have a plain white rice, but with a little added flavor."
