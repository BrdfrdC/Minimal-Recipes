"reviewBody": "My wife made this for her mom, who was born and raised in Houston. My wife joined the army straight out of high school, and hasn’t lived in the south for the last 25 years. This was my wife’s first time making sweet potato pie, and she was nervous about her mom liking it. Her mom told her, “You put your southern footprint on that one!” That’s high praise from a southern mama."

I'm not a baker, but my family loved it! I slightly altered the recipe because I forgot to buy vanilla &amp; lemon extract so I used honey. Great substitute!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe has been in my family for at least 60 years. My late grandmother (born 1918) prepared it for as long as my mom can remember. She passed the recipe on to my mom who has been making them since before I was born, always around Thanksgiving time. My husband jokes that this was one of the reasons he fell in love with me - he looked forward to going to my parent's for Thanksgiving each year and being able to bring a pie home! Nowadays I make them myself for him and my sons and everyone loves them. The lemon and allspice helps it stand out from the other sweet potato pies I've had. Hope you enjoy it as much as we do!"
