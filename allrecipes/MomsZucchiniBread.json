"reviewBody": "I love this recipe! I've made it as is, and it was great. I've also tried it with a few modifications: I was trying to cut down on fats so I replaced the eggs with nonfat Greek yogurt and instead of oil, I used applesauce (the no added sugar kind). I've also used pumpkin puree instead of oil in this recipe and both worked well. ***A HUGE TIP: Whenever I make a bread like this, whether it's zucchini, pumpkin, or banana, I always let it cool for a few minutes and flip it upside down on a plate (while still in the hot pan) and let it cool that way (with the pan still on it). It traps in steam and gets crazy moist (we all hate that word, but I don't know what other way to describe it.) Someone told me that's how Bob Evans makes their banana bread, and it's probably not true, but it does make a huge difference."

It would be difficult to personalize if there wasnâ€™t a solid recipe-to work from I used a little more zucchini ( about. 1/4 c) and put in extra walnuts ( a little over 1/4 c). I also added 1 1/2 c of currants. I like having a bit more texture in zucchini bread."

But I had a craving for it, so dug out the recipe along with the modifications I always used. I put in 1 c white sugar, 1 c light brown sugar, 1/2 cup Walnut oil and 1 small 'snack pack type' cup of applesauce. Also ground up some walnuts so had the flavor of the nuts but not the 'chunks' of nuts. Used 2 aluminum foil 4 x 8 pans and bake time approx. 80 minutes at 325 degree oven. Absolutely perfect."

It is important to add the liquid from the shredded zucchini or the mix will be much too thick. I pack the 2 cups of zucchini into the measuring cup firmly and that makes it come out just right. Hands down the best zucchini bread I've ever had. Admittedly there is a lot of sugar in it but it's SO good."

"reviewBody": "I've been making this recipe for years, and my friends and family quite literally fight over it at gatherings. For me, I have made two slight tweaks (I hate when people do that) that have proved extremely helpful and maintain the recipes integrity. 1) I use half white sugar and half brown and it takes a slight edge off the sweetness. 2] 325 doesn't seem to do the job quite right so I do 340 for 15 minutes and then reduce to 325 for the rest of the time. It often takes longer than 40 minutes though so definitely check the center with a wooden toothpick. And to the other comments, 10000% do NOT drain the zucchini!"

The reason why some say this bread seems dry is because you cannot drain the zucchini juice. After grating, pour the juice into the wet mixture. There have been times I added about an 1/8 - I never measure, but Iâ€™ve used pineapple juice along with the zucchini juice when I happen to be making something with pineapple at the same time. I also have used half and half seasonings meaning Cinnamon and Allspice, or adding a little this and that of Nutmeg, Pumpkin spice, Cinnamon. Itâ€™s all so yummy!"

Also we used our Salad Shooter Pro to shred the zucchini as well as finely chop half of the chopped walnuts. If you donâ€™t have a Salad Shooter, I urge you to scout the thrift stores. Itâ€™s such an easy tool to use and clean up. Since we couldnâ€™t find the bread pans, we made 24 muffins. Calculated at 175 calories per muffin."

Although, it had more oil &amp; sugar than I normally use - I wanted something more old-fashioned. This was it! Melt-in-your-mouth perfection. It's so smooth - with a touch of crunch on the crust. I planned to make 1/2 a recipe because I only had one large zucchini. I suggest grating your zucchini first to know how much you can make. I made 2 loaves. It was like putting thick soup in the oven - but it came out beautifully."

I didnâ€™t realize I wasnâ€™t supposed to peel the zucchini before grating itâ€”it made for a much lighter-colored bread. I used butter instead of oil, half raw sugar/half light brown sugar, a tablespoon each of cinnamon and nutmeg, and subbed semisweet chocolate chips for the walnuts. I had to cook it at least 15 more minutes, but it was so good it disappeared overnight. I only had one loaf pan so I put half the batter in the refrigerator overnight and made it the next day after the first batch disappeared. Just as good!"

I'm really hoping this mistake doesn't cost us all our ingredients and our garden home grown zucchini. USE TWO PANS or just a bigger square brownie pan. The ONLY place besides the video that says to use TWO bread pans is right at the beginning of the recipe. Please make more clear for others!"

"reviewBody": "I'm willing to give a good review and share my experience, even if the recipe would not have worked out as written. I would say this wouldn't be a good recipe for someone without baking experience. When I was finished adding all the ingredients, the batter was way too cookie dough texture. I added 1/3 more eggs and oil and pureed some extra zucchini to add moisture. It was still not nearly as wet as the video. Also, it did take about 70-75 minutes (I did 6 loaves and some were ready after 70 minutes, the rest at 75). The final result is very tasty with a great texture. A neighbor gave me some zucchini, and now I have some loaves to give away. Thanks for the recipe. Also, at a teacher's breakfast yesterday, they served zucchini bread french toast! It was really good and I'm excited to try that. I wish my kids were as excited about it as I am. : )"

I use ONE cup of brown sugar, one TEASPOON of cinnamon powder, and just a dash of vanilla essence.

We followed the recipe to a T (and we are very experienced bakers), and we had to throw this out. Even my kids wouldn't eat it. We couldn't even get the sugar to dissolve completely. It is WAY too sweet and very greasy. It also doesn't have any flavor, other than sweet."

Still not doneâ€¦ so added 5 more minutes. Baked for 75 minutes in total. Maybe the bake temperature should be 350, not the 325 as listed.

I used my chicken's eggs - from bantam (mini chickens) so I doubled the amt of eggs since their eggs are smaller. And a fresh zucchini from my friend's garden. I did not drain the zucchini and packed it firmly in the cup, I hand mixed with a whisk. It turned out wonderful - moist and great flavor."

I used 4 cups (packed) shredded zucchini instead of 2 cups. Put half of the batter into one of the 8x4 loaf pans. Mixed a huge handful of chocolate chips (about 1/2 C?) and a handful of raisins (1/3 C?) into the remaining batter. (Hubby cannot digest nuts or would have done the walnuts...I love walnuts.) With the additional zucchini, it needed to be baked for about 1 hour 10 minutes. I test for temp. 200F to 205F for quick breads and cakes (seems to work better for me than testing for crumb.)"
