I use powder ginger instead of fresh, did not have any green onions in the bin so used a half large sweet yellow onion. I also added a few more shredded veggies, carrots, celery and home grown green beans. Everything was great as far as the amounts of ingredients. I will make it again when I have the green onions and fresh ginger. Oh, I forgot that I tossed in 5 dried home grown peppers, for heat. Husband loved it."

All those were workable choices. I use a slightly different method of browning the meat off in the wok before building the sauce, which works for me better, but the recipe method makes sense, too. I've made broccoli with it every time so far - roasted with garlic once, steamed once, and blanched with romaine and served with garlic sauce once. Very satisfying meal, every time."

"reviewBody": "This was fantastic! A great flavor slightly sweet and sticky. Just a couple of hints. The first is use a small top round London broil and save yourself a about $3 a pound or more. The second is slice the meat slightly defrosted. Yes, freeze the meat and slice once the knife can cut through the center safely. This will allow thinner more uniform thicknesses of the slices. The third hint is to double the sauce Everyone will want to add the sauce to the rice liberally since it is so good. The only issue was the mess it made frying the meat on my stove but it was well worth it. Enjoy"

"reviewBody": "Tastes great. Even my kids (who love to ridicule my cooking) liked it. Some refinements I suggest: (1) use less brown sugar and maybe even offset the sweetness by adding a little more garlic; (2) cut the green onions into 1 to 1 1/4 inch pieces; (3) add 1 can of bamboo shoots , sautéed with the beef before adding the sauce; (4) add 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of orange zest to the beef and fry with the beef before adding the sauce. For vegetarians: Substitute firm cubed tofu for beef and you will need to add vegetables, such as broccolini or asparagus."

"reviewBody": "Very yummy! Like others, I have also varied the ingredients, using what I had on hand. I used extra virgin olive oil to make the sauce, instead of vegetable or canola oil. I also used 1/4 cup of the brown sugar. I used half low sodium and half regular soy sauce, to cut the salt. I also used unsalted beef stock instead of water, to boost the beefy flavor. I added a small squeeze of Korean gochujang paste to add a touch of heat, and some unseasoned rice vinegar to cut the sweetness in the sauce. The beef I used was already cooked, so I coated it with cornstarch and added it to the sauce, cooking it until the meat was heated through and the sauce was thick. I did not add the spring onions, as the beef I used already had onions in it."

"reviewBody": "Really sweet, needs heat like a couple of dried red peppers for balance. Also you need to add cornstarch to the sauce because the sauce did not thicken. There is no reason to deep fry the meat you can cook it in a pan with a little bit of oil. It doesn’t call for seasoning of the meat but I found that it does need some salt and pepper.While eating it, it was missing a crunch so maybe add an unsalted peanut or carrot or something to give it texture. Add vegetables like red peppers mushrooms etc. for a more balanced meal.If cooked as is, you have runny sweet sauce with tasteless meat."
