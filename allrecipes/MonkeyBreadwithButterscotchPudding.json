Only difference with mine is that I melt the butter, roll each bread piece in butter then coat with the pudding/brown sugar mixture before placing into the pan. Then I pour the remaining dry mixture over the top and finish with the remaining melted butter. Let rise, bake and ENJOY!!!"

"reviewBody": "I’ve made this recipe for years - so much better than the ones using refrigerated biscuits. I’ve discovered the best technique is to spay the Bundt pan with cooking spray, cut the semi thawed roll dough in thirds and put half of them in the bottom of the pan. Then sprinkle 2/3 of the sugar, cook and serve pudding mix, pecans and some cinnamon over that. Then layer the rest of the dough balls on top of that and then the rest of the dry mixture. Then pour a melted stick of butter over all of that. Comes out perfectly every time."

Used 16 Rhodes frozen dinner rolls\n3. Sliced a stick of butter into 16, half tablespoon pads of butter.\n4. Placed 8 butter pads evenly around the first layer of frozen rolls. And again evenly spaced around and between the second layer of rolls.\n5. After mixing the sugars and BAKE N SERVE pudding. I did an additional sifting to ensure a good even mixture everything. \n6. Poured pecans evenly over the frozen rolls and butter pads.\n7. Poured sugars and Pudding mix over everything. \nThen I placed it in the oven over night to thaw. 8-9 hours later removed them then preheated the oven to 350. 35 minutes later a plateful of sticky deliciousness"

It was very good, next time I will put a little less of the sugar mixture in the bottom and include some of the melted butter. The half that i put pecans on, didn’t rise as much and the sugary mixture didn’t melt as good...great flavour though."

All the comments that rate it low for not melting is because they used instant pudding and not the cook and serve. i have made this for more then 30 years since i was a teenager and when i messed it up and grabbed instant pudding is only time it has not melted the glaze, just fyi only buy cook and serve pudding!"

After it cooked, I flipped it onto a platter only to find a big, far from gooey, mess. All you could taste was big lumps of sugar. Use another recipe where you roll each piece of bread in butter, sugar and pudding. Very disappointing"

"reviewBody": "I'm giving this recipe 3 stars because the flavor was yummy but the way the recipe is written, they came out an ugly mess. I had to piece together some of the better parts just to take the photo. When I first took them out of the oven, I thought that it would have to go straight in the trash...but then I took a bite and wow! Such a good flavor. I served them up for the kids and they were gone in seconds. There needs to be a better way to prepare the pudding mix, sugar and butter so that it creates a glaze, rather than a clump of powder. I will tweak and make again in the future."
