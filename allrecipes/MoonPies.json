The cookie was ok a basic chocolate cookie, The frosting was good as well but runny. I'd use a different frosting."

For me, I found it difficult to follow the directions, particularly after doubling the recipe, but the text of the recipe didn't likewise adjust. The frosting never did come out right, even after 45 minutes of fidgiting with it. I'd be interested in finding out how others have fared with this."
