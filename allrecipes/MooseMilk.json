It must be terribly strong made the original way, because it is strong like this. We love it, and are celebrating 25 years! Happy Valentine's Day!"

It's definitely a Canadian Armed Forces (Army, Navy, Air and Legion) tradition - I've even given the recipe to Americans who were here for service. I've also replaced the vodka with butterscotch liquor as I didn't have vodka the one time - super yummy!"

We made this version at home and it is good version. We will make it again, but follow the Canadians version and substitute the vodka for light or white rum. We also used our immersion blender to really whip it up. We served it with a scoop of ice cream and garnished with a dash of nutmeg."
