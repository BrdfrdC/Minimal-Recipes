My husband requests this dish and he never does that! I'll make it for a simple lunch and we will eat off of it for 4-5 days. I usually double the dressing be sue I make a HUGE bowl and add things like raisins, grapes etc. I never forget the pears. Great addition to a classic."

It's kind of old fashioned/cliche, but in a nice way. I don't know why the lemon juice would be optional ... it not only gives a nice zing, but how otherwise would the fruit not brown (?) I also added flaked coconut , about 1/4 cup, because it didn't taste sweet enough for me. This recipe reminded me about this type of salad and now I will make it again."
