"reviewBody": "Delicious. I made it according to the (vegetarian) recipe EXCEPT I added double the flour/water slurry. After I added the recipe's amount of flour/water, it didn't seem to thicken up so I added another lot. After I added the angel hair pasta, *then* it seemed to thicken, maybe a little too much. Definitely too much. Next time, I'll stick with what the recipe says. After I added the cayenne and lemon juice, I tasted it. It seemed to be too hot and the lemon was quite noticeable so I thought I had ruined it, but 10 minutes later the lemon mellowed, an no-one complained about it being too hot. Suggestion: serve with toasted sliced turkish bread. All-in-all, a great success. I love recipes that make me look competent. No pics. We ate it all."
