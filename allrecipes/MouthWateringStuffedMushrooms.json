"reviewBody": "Made this tonight and thought it would be good. I often make a grilled portobello w/ balsamic and usually a grueyre (sp) and a gorgonzola. This is good though. Would be excellent with crab, lobster or seasoned shrimp. It's a bit bland and too cheesy, kind of like what you may have found on a mid level diner's menu in the 1960s. Good news is that it's a blank slate. You can spice up, down, or outside the recipe however you please (Hmm how bout w a devilled egg type filling 😊) The only things I did differently was to add some grated Tillamook Brand colby jack (because I'm short on cheeses, I usually have 4 or 5) and drizzled melted butter on the filled caps, then sprinkled with breadcrumbs. I also used a mix of olive oil and homemade ghee (I almost always have it on hand. If you're not familiar with this great, healthful, supremely tasteful cooking fat, you need to be. Took me 40 years of cooking to 'discover' it. (thx India) I feel the filling could be spiced up a bit as I found it a bit bland. But a good squirt of Shiracha could pick that up a bit."

I've made 2x's now, second time used about 6 oz. of CC - used about 2 TBSP of finely chopped onion before adding shrooms then garlic.... also I used Baby Bella so my stems were a tad smaller and I don't mind adding extra, can't have too many shrooms, right?! I cooked in a small toaster / air fryer type oven and they are ready in under 10 minutes every time.... I would suggest watching them the first time you make, as it depends on the oven / cooking appliance you use... Thanks for sharing - I LOVE ALLRECIPES.COM!"

I place on parchment paper, and dust the tops with more parmesan and a little paprika. Use the ziploc bag method for the filling, as it makes the whole process much cleaner and easier. If I have very large mushrooms, I bake them unfilled for about 20 minutes, dump out the water that collects, then fill and bake as directed."

"reviewBody": "The stuffing for the mushrooms seemed more like something you'd put on a cracker for an appetizer. They are hard to handle, and kept falling over while in the oven. There was way, way too much cream cheese, and not enough seasonings. I just wasn't very pleased with the results, though I followed the recipe exactly. If I ever make these again, I'll cut the cream cheese to less than half, and add diced onions and stuffing or lots of bread crumbs. I would also oil the outside of the mushrooms, to keep them from shrinking and wrinkling like 120-yo old men. I would leave out the Cayenne pepper and add Thyme, or something more flavorful. Just my opinion."
