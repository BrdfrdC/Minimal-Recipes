Brown filets on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer filets to an oiled baking pan and roast in the middle of the preheated oven until they start to firm, and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Top each filet with the crabmeat and butter mixture."

I also mixed in a little garlic powder into the melted butter. The quality of the protein makes this meal quite expensive, but well worth it for special occasions."

"reviewBody": "Hubs made this for us tonite and it was simple and excellent. One pound of crabmeat certainly isn't necessary for two people, however, and almost seemed like a misprint, so use only as much as what appeals to you. He used very small filets, about 4 oz. each, wrapped them in bacon and seasoned them with Worcerstershire sauce and Montreal Steak Seasoning. He used the meat from Alaskan King Crab legs, tossing them with plenty of hot, clarified butter. If you like your steak cooked medium to medium-well as I do, you'll want to cook them a few minutes longer than the recipe directs. After Hubs was done with these?...five star good."

"reviewBody": "The crabmeat was a total miss for me. It was way too much crab for the amount of steak and too little butter to flavor the crab. I made a sauce for the asparagus I served with it from this site's recipe Lemon Butter Seasoned Vegetables, and the sauce drizzled over the crabmeat did add some flavor. Maybe I'll take some of this extra crabmeat and make a salad."
