I thought this was a problem; however, my family was very happy because one pan was a bit toasted and crispy and the other, chewy and a tiny bit gooey. Win-win. (Next time, I'll bake them separately, on the middle oven rack.)"

I read a lot of people saying the taste of these cookies seem “muted,” and I definitely think the missing piece is a little more salt…whether that means increasing the salt in the recipe or using salted butter instead of unsalted. Still, these are pretty tasty and hold their shape well!"

I didn't change the recipe, but i noticed that the coating on my cookies were a bit darker - probably because i double coated them in the cinnamon sugar mixture to make sure it really tasted of cinnamon. I used a small ice cream scoop to make evenly sized smaller cookies. Good solid recipe, will make again."

I also recommend refrigerating the dough. It was easier to handle. If you are getting flat cookies...it's all about bake time. I saw someone said eight minutes, my magic number was 11 minutes. Unfortunately not all ovens cook the same, so play with your baking time. When I took them out at 8, they deflated. They taste amazing!"

"reviewBody": "These are flavorful cookies and snickerdoodles are always a holiday favorite. I doubled the recipe, and for the cinnamon-sugar coating I used 3/4 cup sugar + 1/4 cup cinnamon (multiplying each listed amount above by 6) so I had enough sugar-cinnamon mixture to easily use in a plastic bag and roll the cookie dough in. I agree with Chef Joy that you can't overcoat the cookie dough balls. I used a #30 scoop (1.25 oz) which is the size of a walnut and was surprised it yielded 48 cookies. Either the suggested yield listed above should be changed to 24 cookies, or the size of each cookie should be 1/2 a walnut. I added vanilla bean powder and a touch of nutmeg (something I often do during the holidays to add punch to the flavor without altering the consistency of the dough). Thank you, Beth Sigworth, for sharing this great recipe."

"reviewBody": "I hate it when people rate a recipe which they have made with numerous changes. So my rating is for this being a great starting point for my first time making snickerdoodles. I used a ~1-5/8\" dia. Farberware Cookie scoop that I use for all my Tollhouse cookies and the yield was 38 cookies that are about 2-1/4\" dia. (This was ~16 less cookies for the same time spent vs. making Tollhouse cookies.) I love cinnamon so I threw an extra 1/2t in with the dry ingredients. I also added 1T of wheat gluten to see if it would make these chewy. I'm not sure either of these additions had any impact. I don't stock \"regular\" shortening (Crisco?) so I used coconut oil which I also stopped using several years ago but my wife bought a jar for some reason so I thought I'd use it before it expires. Due to the size, I had to increase the baking time to 12-13 minutes, it is difficult to tell when these are done. I over softened (i.e. I melted the butter) so after blending with the coconut oil, I put it in the fridge while I gathered and mixed the dry ingredients. I also refrigerated the dough for a few minutes while the oven pre heated and I cut parchment paper for my cookie sheets. The resultant cookies stayed lofty, not flat with a chewy center and crunchy edge as some recipes state. My wife's opinion is that they are perfect."

I was halfway I to the recipe tonight however and discovered I had no cream of tartar. I discovered another snicker doodle recipe in my online search for a suitable replacement. The recipe had the same amount of baking soda to tartar and noted that In a pinch just use 2 tsp baking powder and drop both the soda and the tartar. I did know baking powder contained both but wasn't sure of how much to use. The two teaspoons full worked beautifully, as you can see! I used the medium Pampered Chef cookie scoop and got 33 cookies out of it..well, maybe 34..hubs was sitting nearby and I did turn my back a time or two! Lol"

"reviewBody": "The very best snickerdoodle recipe I've ever tried! For those having trouble, some things to try: 1. Make sure you are using real ingredients (e.g., no margarine substitutes for butter) that are relatively fresh (yes, flour loses effectiveness before it goes bad, and spices don't last that long). 2. Butter flavored shortening enhances the taste a little. 3. Follow standard cookie protocol: cream the butter, shortening, sugars, and eggs for at least 5 minutes before adding the dry ingredients. 4. Add fresh grated nutmeg (about 1/8 to 1/4 tsp) to the cinnamon sugar mixture. 5. Use extra fine sugar in the cinnamon sugar mixture. It pretty much melts into the cookie that way! 6. Make SURE you remove it from the pan almost immediately. Snickerdoodles rely on a delicate balance between lightly crisp exterior and a tender interior, hence the high cooking temp. But if you leave it on the hot pan, it will continue to cook and be tougher. Hope this helps!"

Everyone who has ever tried them has raved about them. The only thing I change is I use almond extract instead of vanilla which I think gives them a nice flavor, however, they are still phenomenal using vanilla."

Will definitely make again soon My only thing is that I changed the sugar/cinnamon ratio next time to have more sugar than cinnamon because I like my snickerdoodles to have that sugary feeling around them"

On step 3, I used 2 tablespoons of sugar and 2 tablespoons of cinnamon because I did not know better. Without scrolling back up to the ingredients it makes it sound like I am adding 2 Tbsp’s of sugar and 2 Tbsp’s of cinnamon. The instructions should say “Mix cinnamon and 2 tablespoons of sugar together.”"

Believe it or not, I’ve never had a snickerdoodle but they are a favorite of my husband’s growing up. I decided to make them for a neighbor whose kids don’t care for chocolate. Found this easy recipe. So glad I did!! Made them as written but only had vanilla bean paste. Don’t know if that changed the recipe but they’re SO GOOD!!! Crisp on the outside and soft, chewy on the inside. Vanilla-y and perfect for fall. Will be making again and again!! Thanks for the recipe"

They did not flatten too much. Could have baked 7 minutes. My oven may run a little hot at 400 degrees. Flavor - a little bland, maybe use a little more salt. I understand what some have said about the after taste from cream of tarter. Crisp on outside and soft in the middle. Overall fairly good cookie."
