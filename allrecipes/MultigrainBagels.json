"reviewBody": "Made these this morning! Great flavor and texture! The dough was very wet so needed more flour but that is common in my house and location. I left it pretty wet so didnâ€™t hold ball shape in its own but dough felt sticky and firm enough. It rose beautifully and felt way more airy than anything whole wheat or bagel I have made. I added seeds and nuts as toppings. Really a great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "The bagels came out good, a bit sweet. I needed to add a little bit of extra flour when kneading the dough to get it less sticky. I divided the dough into 2 bowls and added 1Tbs. Rosemary at the kneading step and the other half I added dried blueberries and some cinnamon. Then after boiling on the rosemary bagels I sprinkled with everything bagel season and sea salt and the blueberry ones got a bit of cinnamon &amp; sugar on top. Everything else I followed the recipe exactly. Couldn't put a picture because I'm better with cooking than computers."
