I used one carton of chicken broth and one carton of vegetable broth. And I used a fair amount of ginger. I was so excited to eat some I forgot to put the cilantro on top. Next meal. I thought it might be bland because there is no seasoning really, but the ginger and lime juice and the broth give it enough flavor I didn’t feel it needed anything. If you like mushrooms, this is definitely a winner!"

I do make mine with chicken which requires a bit more work as I like to braise the chicken with garlic and salt, I then debone and shred the chicken thighs and start adding veggies. The trick for me is ensuring that the bok choy doesn't get overcooked and end up grey...which is no good at all."

I added a little kale and used bouillon and better than bouillon to the base, added red pepper flakes, ground ginger instead of the real thing, and regular onions in the soup instead of green. I know people don't like it when you change the recipe and make a review but the recipe deserves credit for giving me the idea of trying it. It is really good."

I cut the mushrooms medium sized how I like them. Instead of chicken broth, I used vegetable stock since I am vegetarian. I used granulated garlic, ground ginger; ground onion, parsley, and Italian seasoning in the soup. I did not use cilantro. I also added cayenne pepper because I like spice. I added a little pink salt and black pepper as well. As for the lime, I only added a few drops and taste it as it cooked. That way too much wouldn’t be put it and over power the soup because like isn’t a favorite of mine. This way it was adjusted to my tastes and very good."

Almost tossed in some red pepper flakes before tasting. Glad I didn't. The ginger root was just right. Made homemade chicken broth and added 1 chicken thigh, chopped, to make it a main dish. Had a couple of little packets of soy sauce from take out. Put those in. Will make again. I try to incorporate different veggies every week. This recipe fit the bill. Thanks for a good recipe."

I really liked it, but my husband didn't finish his bowl and said \"I'm glad you like it- you have lots of leftovers to eat.\" He said he didn't like the stalks of the bok choy (I left them chopped in large pieces), and said he didn't like the lime taste in it. I however, really liked it- I will chop the stalks smaller like celery next time, and maybe add a cooked chopped chicken breast, and maybe some red pepper flakes. I also will just sprinkle the chopped green onions on top before serving along with the cilantro, as the freshness of the green onion disappeared after it was cooked. I also added fresh cracked black pepper over the top. I will make this again for myself- only not doubling it next time :). 2nd review- This time I chopped the bok coy stems smaller, added 1 chopped yellow onion, 1 red pepper and 1 green pepper, 1 seeded jalapeno, 4 inner stalks of celery and leaves, chopped, sauteed in olive oil, and added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, 1 tsp. turmeric powder, skipped the cilantro and put chopped parsley on top. Did not add any lime juice. Delicious!"
