"reviewBody": "I'm rating this a 5-star based on modifications I made to the recipe which were based on other reviews/mods I read. I used 2 large boneless breasts, sliced long ways in 6 total pieces and flattened with a meat tenderizer. I had to increase the flour to 3/4 cup and the salt and paprika proportionately. I added olive oil to the butter, probably about 1/8-1/4 cup. Fried the chicken as instructed and then pulled the breasts out of pan and added the 'rooms and onions to pan along with 2 heaping tablespoons of minced garlic. Then placed the breasts back on top of the veggies. Covered and let it cook for 10 minutes. I didn't have any white wine and used 2 Cups of chicken broth to compensate. I also increased the lemon juice to 5-6 tablespoons and added about 4 tablespoons of rinsed capers and 4 tablespoons of chopped cilantro. Covered again and let cook for 15 minutes - removed cover for remainder of 5-10 minutes to thicken. Served over Sabzi Polo (PERSIAN rice with greens). EXCELLENT"

I wanted a strong lemon flavor so I added zest to the sauce mixture. I cooked the chicken and moved to the oven to keep warm. Did the same with the mushrooms/onions and I added garlic, then made/reduced the sauce. Assembled on the plate...linguine, chicken, vegetables and sauce. I didn't want the breading on the chicken to get soggy and I wanted to control the amount of sauce. Very good!"

I added a lot to the flour because I don't think salt and paprika would add enough flavor. I included Italian spices, pepper, garlic, and parsley and I think it is a great addition. When I tasted the sauce alone, it seems too lemony. But when eaten with the chicken, mushrooms and onions the flavors are great."

It can easily be changed to Chicken Marsala by substituting Marsala wine for the white wine and 1-2 tablespoons of tomato paste for the capers. Will definitely make this again."

I also like the milk and egg before the flour better than just flour. The only thing I added which was not in this recipe were capers. I have never seen Piccata without them. I sauteed 2TBS of them along with the onions, mushrooms and extra garlic removed from pan then fried the chicken. Delish!!! This is my new go to piccata. Will try it with veal sometime."

"reviewBody": "I made this dish with both boneless, skinless chicken thighs and thin-sliced chicken breasts, cooked separately in unsalted butter and kept warm in a 350° oven while I made the sauce. I only had Sauvignon blanc, so I used that, and it gave the dish amazing flavor. I reduced the sauce for about 15 minutes before putting only the chicken thighs back in the pan, because they required more cooking time. I simmered it for another 10-12 minutes before spooning the sauce over the chicken from the oven and served it all over pasta that was seasoned with butter, pink salt and pepper. My husband had three helpings, and had nothing but good things to say about this recipe. I think it's fantastic and it will be a regular dinner option in our house from now on. I'll be experimenting with serving it over rice pilaf, on a bed of cooked spinach, etc. Lots of possibilities with this fabulous dish!"

Added sauce and simmered 20 minutes, then added chicken back into the pan for the last 3-4 minutes. It was tender and tasty. Next time, I will increase the sauce. Thanks for the recipe."

I also increased the sauce ingredients so there would be more sauce in the end, and I cooked the mushrooms and onions separately before spooning them over the cooked chicken and then baking it at 350 for about twenty minutes. Delicious! Served this over homemade risotto, which was perfect for soaking up the sauce. Fresh green beans rounded out our meal."

The H&amp;H is really not needed however. This is an outstanding dish and my husband doesn't even like capers but eats them in this dish. You will love it and this recipe is the BEST!"

I don’t usually change the recipes here but in this case I had some heavy / double cream that was just lying around so I used it as a mix with the broth. Turned out quite nice. We omitted the wine since I was worried about the taste for the kids - turns out this was the first time they’ve asked me for seconds in a while. I had to make a second batch of sauce."

"reviewBody": "I had baked chicken thighs to use somehow and choose this recipe. I sauteed a one slice of diced onions in butter, added 1 teaspoon of minced garlic and a sprinkle of paprika. I sliced the chicken off the bone, used five and added to skillet. I poured enough chardonnay in to cover the bottom of the skillet and allowed time to heat through. I sliced mushrooms and decided to add artichoke hearts to the recipe. How many you use depends on how much meat you use. This recipe is easy to adjust to the number of people eating. I added more wine for making enough gravy to coat all. When the mushrooms were tender, I thickened the sauce with a tablespoon of flour mixed into cold water, added another sprinkle of paprika and salt. When the sauce was thickened, I stirred to coat all with the gravy and sprinkled 1/3 cup fresh parsley over all. Any dish made in a wine sauce makes for a very special meal at my house."

I cut the salt in half as that is what I always do but for this recipe I would keep at 1 tsp especially since all the breading does not get used. I used 4 half breasts and cut each in half so had 8 pieces (about 2.25 lbs of chicken). Agreed, a little bland - needs something to perk up."

I always substitute Cream of chicken for chicken broth in anything I make. I think it adds flavor. I did take the chicken out of the pan while I put the sauce and mushrooms together like others stated. We will be having this again!"
