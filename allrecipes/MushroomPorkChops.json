I thought the gravy might be too thick so I added 3/4 of a can of whole milk mixed with a bit of Heavy Whipping Cream . I also added just a few drops of Kitchen Bouquet Browning Sauce for color mostly. Served it with Wild Rice and a Stoufer Spinach Souffle. I will make it again."

I find the cayenne and black pepper take the whiteness away from the soup. Then serve the works over nice egg noodles to sop up the gravy."

I would cook it in a crockpot or in the oven until fall apart tender. Serve over rice and have broccoli or any veggies you like with pork. You could even add some dry onion soup to the mushroom soup or change the soup to celery or asparagus. The concept is great!"

I saut√©ed the onion, then added mushrooms and sauteed for about 5 mins, then tossed in 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic and sauteed for a couple minutes more. I then added 2 cans of regular cream of mushoom soup and 1/2 cup of half &amp; half along with a few sprigs of fresh Rosemary and Thyme, stirred well and then poured over the chops. I covered the pan with heavy duty aluminum foil and cooked on the stovetop on med/low for 30 minutes. The meat was so tender and flavorful! Will definately make this again! We loved it! Thanks everyone for the wonderful tweak ideas!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe is not like it shows in the video. The recipe is missing 2 ingredients. To brown the chops and saut√© the vegetables you need oil which is not listed in the ingredients. The Onions are listed as chop not sliced like the video shows. The soup of mushroom is very thick and without some liquid it would not create the sauce as you see in the video unless you use the amount of oil and grease that seems to have been use in the video. I used small amount of olive oil to brown the chops, removed them after browning both sides, added a few pumps of OO to saut√© the mushrooms and chopped onions. put the chops back in after a few minutes and added the can of the condensed mushroom soup with half can of water (can use broth instead but I was not prepared to make these changes so I use water.) Those changes created a creamy sauce to pour over the chops and the mashed potatoes. I gave a rate of 3 although the flavors were good, but the poorly written recipe made it a 3."

I certainly try not to overcook them. This is always a difficult thing with a lean meat like pork. I would definitely try making it again but with a much fatty or pork he would pay super close attention to make sure that I don‚Äôt want to cook it. So the recipe itself would be a five star but keeping the pork moist brings it down to a four star."

I also skipped the pepper and used low sodium cream of mushroom because I am not the biggest fan of a lot of salt."

"reviewBody": "These were very good! I've made them with boneless and bone-on chops. I've also used both fresh mushrooms and that frozen mushroom variety mix from Trader Joe's, both turned out great. My partner actually preferred the recipe with the frozen mushrooms, so if you're looking to make this even easier, it's worth a shot! There was enough gravy that we could smother our mashed potatoes too. Simple to reheat on the stove as leftovers. We just covered the pan and put the heat on low. Give them a try!"

Then plopped them into a cast iron baking dish, smothered them in the mushroom soup, undiluted, and added back the onions and garlic that remained in the skillet. Baked for 45 minutes, covered with foil. Made brown rice for the side in the IP and voil√°! Hubby loved it and is still talking about it this morning. The chops were perfectly cooked and super tender and juicy without being pink at all. We saved the leftover \"gravy\" for mashed potatoes today. Delish!"

I sauteed the onion, mushrooms, and garlic first... I removed them and then the chops, did the wine, then did the sauce and added the chops to cook them on the stove (due to time). I paired it with rice pilaf and asparagus and it was great even the next day. Will definitely make this again and I'm not a pork person, normally, but it was definite good."
