"reviewBody": "The art of risotto is to let it simmer and reduce for a long time. I followed this recipe exactly, with the exception of subbing 1% milk for whole and chicken stock for veggie stock. By no means was the rice ready by the given - and short - cooking time. I let it slow simmer for a couple of hours, adding the broth over time. Taste testing at given cook time, the rice was chewy and the flavor was bland. Taste testing after two hours, the rice was soft and creamy and the flavor was rich and robust. Risotto takes time. This recipe works if you give it time."

"reviewBody": "Great rice side dish! I made a number of changes based on what I had in the house. I used chicken stock and canned mushrooms. Next time I'll probably use at least partly rehydrated porcini mushrooms, but I was in a time crunch today. I didn't have any celery, and only dried parsley, but I don't think that made a big difference. I used the recommended cream, but with lactose free milk. I like this because it came out really creamy without needing the arborio rice that \"real\" risotto requires. It only took 4 cups of stock, and for the last cup I covered the pan to be sure that the rice finished cooking instead of just boiling off the liquid. All in all a successful recipe that is easy to modify for what you might have in the house."

"reviewBody": "Didn't have vegetable broth so I used chicken broth. Wonderful flavor! It looks as if the celery was used as an herb, so I used the center leafy part, minced. I also added a bit of fresh rosemary because I had it. One note: it took a bit longer to cook the rice through than I expected. It's not very risotto-like to cover it and allow it to steam, but that's what I would recommend to ensure you don't end up with half-cooked rice. I also added some fresh baby spinach leaves near the end (just to fake myself out into thinking I was eating veggies)."

For the rice to absorb all that fluid took almost an hour. It was worth it though. Creamy, mushroom-y and delicious."

I don't do that. \n\nMy modifications are:\n- Don't remove the garlic\n- 1.5 cups of rice\n- Double the mushrooms\n- 3 cups of stock. I prefer chicken stock\n- NO celery... it dominates too much\n- After the rice has cooked down to about 90% of desired amount I top with parmesan and stick in the oven at 350 for 10 minutes."

The milk and cream weren't readily absorbed by the rice, which made this dish pretty soupy. The recipe also calls for a lot more broth than I needed, but that's kind of subjective so better safe than sorry. \n\nAll in all, I'm probably always going to like a dish that has mushrooms in, but this could have been stronger."

I also added the parsley at the end with the butter so it kept it's colour and used about 1/4 cup of parsley rather than a teaspoon. With these modifications, it was SUPER tasty!"

So after I sautéd the veggie part (which I will use more parsley next time to season), I added the rice and after I \"crisped\" that for a moment, I added the HOT broth. As many others I did not use any milk to the recipe, but added a tablespoon of heavy cream, although it was quiet creamy already. I also suggest adding a bit of white wine for flavor if available."

I added the half &amp; half towards the end. Served it with fontina cheese and a few roasted red pepper slices on top."

"reviewBody": "I love this recipe! So flavorful and delicious. That being said, am I the only one who thinks 3 onions, even small ones, sounds like A LOT of onion for a recipe that is supposed to only serve 4 people? I like onions as much as the next person, but that seems really excessive. When I make this recipe I switch the onion and garlic quantities; so 3 cloves garlic and one onion. I also replace both the milk and the cream with fat free half and half. The recipe doesn't state what type of rice to use, so I generally use brown. I have used the generic take-forever-to-cook brown rice and it works fine, but I have found 2 pouches of Trader Joe's frozen brown rice works great and cooks so much faster. Which is great because, well, sometimes a girl is just too hungry to wait!\nP.S. It's a good idea to wait until all the vegetable stock is in before you add the salt!"

"reviewBody": "I have made this twice, first time \"to the letter,\" second time with some alterations. Though as-is it is very good, the second go-round I halved the onions, eliminated the heavy cream and used chicken broth - only because I didn't know I was out of veggie when the process began. Though not a monumental difference,the 2nd effort was better. It was a little bit lighter (though no less creamy), the chicken broth added more flavor, and the onions were more on par with my preference. I hate when onion overpowers the dish. All in all a great recipe and one I shall return to to tweak yet again!"

Also I used broth and no milk, only a little bit of cream at the end. Very good risotto but I would recommand to be light on the Parmesan cheese who can be overpowering."

Turned out perfect! My boyfriend loved it. Keeping this in my arsenal as a sure ire showstopper when I entertain. Try it, you will not regret it. I used some oyster mushrooms along with plain white sliced ones I had in the fridge. I now understand that with risotto, you really have to \" keep your eye on it and keep stirring\", for the duration of cooking. \r\nCoupled it with halibut steaks and sautéed kale and grilled peppers. Thank you for this delicious recipe."

Next time, I want to experiment with different varieties of mushrooms and some other spices as well."

I've made this recipe several times - a couple of times exactly as the recipe says and several times with variations, and it's always a hit with my family and company. That's why I like this particular recipe so much, it's easy to play around with if you don't have all the ingredients the recipe calls for - I've made it without the mushrooms, several times by using chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, one time with evaporated milk (yes, don't gasp foodies!), with 2% milk and no cream, many times using only a quarter cup of the Parmesan, and sometimes with no Parmesan cheese at all...and all varieties were very good and received compliments. My husband did say he preferred this dish with less than half of the Parmesan or none at all. I had to agree - using the full cup made it a bit overpowering to our taste. \nI do think works best to prepare it in a heavy-bottomed, good quality skillet, as I noticed that when I used a lightweight skillet it took quite a bit longer for the risotto to cook."
