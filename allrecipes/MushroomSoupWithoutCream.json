And I did not cook the carrot and celery before adding them in cuz, why? All their beautiful nutritional value cooked right into the broth. All that said, this IS the best mushroom soup I've ever eaten. Definitely make it! You are going to LOVE it."

I only had mixed dried mushrooms, so I reconstituted those, strained the broth it made and used some of it as well. I used light olive oil to cook the veggies/mushrooms in instead of butter. A dash of hot sauce in each bowl when served and this became the bowl of soup to help with getting over a cold. Thanks for the recipe!"

I used fennel instead of celery, added some roasted veggie leftovers (summer squash and eggplant, about 1/4 cup each, chopped), some potato flakes ( 1tbs) to thicken it, and pureed it so there were small pieces of mushroom. For added umami, I added a teaspoon of fish sauce, and 1 tbs of Better than Boullion. It's delicious. I rarely do a recipe as written but definitely appreciate knowing the basic ingredients."

I made the following changes to accommodate our taste: increased by 1/2 the leeks, carrots, onions and celery; sauteed in olive oil instead of butter; added 8 cups of chicken broth or bone marrow; seasoned with lots of Thyme and Italian seasoning; and served over Orzo pasta instead of rice. Very healthy and vegetarian - delicious!"

Diced a 1.5 lb package of mushrooms, rubbed between my hands a large pinch of home dried thyme. Sauteed it all in olive oil for about 10 minutes. Sprinkled 1/2 cup of flour over it all and stirred it around for a couple of minutes till the flour began to stick to the pan, added 4 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of water. Brought to a boil, then simmered for about 30 min. Salted it at the table. Delicious!"

The one part about throwing in the mushrooms and cooking for about 5 minutes until they were soft didn't happen that way. It took more like 20 minutes - maybe the instructions intended to say to increase the heat? Don't know but other than that, the recipe worked very well."

I thickened it just slightly with some cornstarch dissolved in water, then pureed some of it - added more salt and a few sprinkles of red pepper, and finally added about half a can of low fat evaporated milk. With all those changes, it was pretty good, but I'm not sure this will be my go-to mushroom soup."

I wouldn't change a thing, This soup is hearty and flavorful without the cream. The rich and buttery mushroom essence comes through loud and clear. I served it over pasta for the carbs. YUM."

But, I omitted the leeks and green onion.\n\nI also used 4 cups of chicken bone broth, another 4 cups of low sodium chicken stock, and 2 cups of water because I added so much vegetables.\n\nI toasted until lightly brown 1/2 cup of quinoa with butter, garlic, and onions, then added 1 cup of water and boiled until water was evaporated and added the quinoa as well.\n\nMy mom loves it too, she asked for the recipe :)"

I used oyster mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, and brown beech mushrooms. I also didn't have any celery on hand so I had to leave that out. It turned out to be a great soup. Very tasty, low-fat, and great texture with the Asian mushrooms."

As you can tell I like garlic. I also put multigrain quinoa for some starch, I thought it added a nice touch. For herbs, I add basil, oregano. I am not a big salt person, so I thought the chicken stock was salty enough so I did not add anymore salt. I hope this review helps someone, enjoy!!!"

I didn't have leeks on hand but did add 1 cup of chopped cabbage. I also added about 1/4 cup of red wine and some garlic powder. I love the rich, earthy flavor of this. It would also work well with beef broth, dried mushrooms, worcestershire sauce and a little barley. I tried some yesterday when I made it, but today it definitely has a better flavor. I also added some chopped rotisserie chicken, and that works very well here. Thanks KitKat. This is a keeper of a recipe!"

I would add more garlic next time and some wild rice or barley to give it more substance. Also I would use fresh thyme instead of dried thyme - I just didn't have any. The dried thyme is not really ideal for soup."

I wasn't super exact in the measurements, but pretty close. I did follow the cooking instructions. I did not add salt and pepper, and no one else eating it did either. It was perfect as written."

Just a few things I did different which I don't think really changed the recipe all that much. I halved the recipe since it was just for me. I used one pound of the baby belles and used one dry shiitake soaked in about 1/2 cup of water. I used the soaking water when I added the broth ( which I used homemade chicken stock). The only other change is that I used dry thyme instead of fresh. Next time I think I will use two shiitakes. I will for sure make this again and again as it makes for a great light healthy lunch."

"reviewBody": "I had really high hopes for this recipe based on the reviews and it smelled great when it was cooking, but the final product, as written (including option leeks) is bland. After being somewhat unhappy with the end product I made some modifications. Added more thyme, some garlic, 1/4 cup red wine and probably 1 tsp salt and at least 1/2 tsp of pepper. Salt and pepper \"to taste\" always leaves room for interpretation. Considering the chicken broth already in the recipe (used \"Not So Chicken\" broth cubes) there's a lot of salt in this particular pot of soup. I wish I would have loved it like most others, but it wasn't meant to be. I'll be sticking with pub-style chili, great northern bean soup and creamy vegan corn chowder recipes from this site as my go-to soups for the moment."

"reviewBody": "This soup recipe has good bones, but for my tastes it required quite a bit of tinkering to make it work for me. What foremost impressed me about this soup is that I could feel good eating it - it is nothing but fresh, lovely ingredients. But it was a bit on the weak side in terms of substance and flavor. Given the submitter gives her permission to modify this to our tastes, I did, in several ways. I don't like carrots, so that was already out. I was a little short on the amount of mushrooms and had no leeks so I filled in with zucchini and fresh baby spinach, (added at the end until just wilted). Finely chopped red bell pepper added both color interest and flavor. I saut√©ed the vegetables in olive oil and added fresh minced garlic, tho' I would have had no problem using garlic powder if fresh was not available. A good glug of white wine (Pinot Grigio) and a combination of both chicken and beef stock also lent a deeper color and flavor. At this point I was happier, but still something was missing for me. While this soup certainly wasn't a deal breaker without it, adding a little pastina (small soup pasta) completed this for me, making it rich and satisfying."
