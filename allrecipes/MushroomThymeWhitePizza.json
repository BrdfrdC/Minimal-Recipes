"reviewBody": "I was pleasantly surprised by absolute deliciousness of this pizza. I made a homemade pizza crust that was infused with freshly dried herbs. Next was the process of saut√©ing the gourmet mushrooms and spinach. It felt like it was bit much at first but this step definitely added to the overall flavor of the pizza. I must add, the excess water from the cooked mushrooms and spinach should be drained thoroughly before adding to the pizza because I found I needed to squeeze out the extra water by hand. There was no extra seasoning needed for the ricotta and pecorino romano spread, this simple white sauce brought a nice flavor to my rustic crust and the toppings. This was truly a pizza my entire family enjoyed. Definitely adding this one to our family favorites."
