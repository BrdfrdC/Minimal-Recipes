I didn't have orzo, so substituted stelline, star shaped pasta instead. It hit the spot. Yet...I might add some fresh herbs or other seasonings next time I make it."

The huge down-side of only having chicken broth instead of beef broth was a killer.... but I did find that old bottle of sherry (the cork disintegrated when I opened it). \n\nSo I made the dish. Tasted it. Too bland for me. \n\nTHEN a miracle happened. I remembered my garlic powder and added a dash. A little sprinkle of garlic powder put this recipe in seventh heaven. THANK YOU for giving the me the kick-start to deliciousness."

After reading other reviews, I used herb-ox chicken bouillon instead of beef bouillon for the broth, and used white wine instead of sherry. Since I doubled my recipe, I also added additional mushrooms and leeks, to make it a bit more hardy. I used mixed mushrooms instead of just one kind. The last time I made it, I added ground pork cooked in olive oil after I added the chicken broth. I also did what other reviewers did and added spinach at the end. So healthy and yummy! This past time that I made it, with the pork, my hubby said it was the best soup he's ever had. Awesome!"

For what type of soup it was I'd still give it a 4, but I did add a couple of small things. I wish I would have had more but I only had 1/4 cup sherry, I think that made a difference. I also added about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and a dash of salt. I also only used 3 cups of water, just to make it not so watered down, to give more flavor, this worked.*********Had to add this, even better the next day!"

It was more of a moist pasta dish than a soup, but it was sooooo delicious!!!! Next time, I will use more mushrooms, and many less orzo, so I have more broth."

I was so glad I loved it without the heavy cream that other leek recipes call for.\nI did make several changes: chicken instead of beef broth, no water (but the orzo was already cooked - leftovers), added garlic, oyster mushrooms, extra leeks, thinly sliced potatoes (only 2 red pots, they were gonna get old soon), grated parm on top. It turned out like a chicken noodle soup but way more delicate and fine with the mushrooms and leeks. We're definitely having this again."

"reviewBody": "This is quite good but a little bland for this family. I added garlic and parsley and a tad bit of basil. It makes for a different, but tasty soup. I omitted the margarine and just used the olive oil.\nI substituted orzo for short egg noodles this time, and that was fine. \nI doubled the recipe since we do enjoy it for the following day. I also love the fact that it is light and with no potatoes and cream. That's where the four star comes in.\nI would have given it a five star, but with the changes I decided to make, I gave it a four star.\nThanks for sharing this recipe. Will make it again."

I added a bag of chopped baby spinach, 2 tsp of pre-chopped garlic &amp; the orzo! YUM! I had my family over for dinner last night &amp; they loved it."

Also used vegetable broth so vegan daughter could eat and I will definetly be making again!!"

I bought the chicken stock at a Vietnamese Soup restaurant as they make fabulous stock. I used a combo of baby bella mushrooms and white buttons and I tripled the amount as 4 ounces is waaaay too few. I used garlic as well and like another reviewer I did not have sherry on hand so I used Marsala wine and used a full cup... it had a great taste. This is a keeper. A light delicate soup designed to please."

"reviewBody": "In looking over the reviews, I found the majority were based on how the reviewer changed the recipe, not on the recipe itself. As written, this is an average soup in my opinion, worthy of three stars - it lacks flavor in a big way. Having said that, I added garlic to the mushrooms and leeks, and threw in a handful of fresh parsley, chives and thyme. Rather than the condensed beef broth and water I used equal amounts of beef and chicken broth. Hubby liked this better than I did which surprised me since he typically likes heartier soups, which this is not. He suggested this might be even better with some chopped green onion to serve and I agree. The embellishments of garlic and fresh herbs upped this 3-star recipe to four stars but was still rather nondescript. We enjoyed it, but I'm not sure I'll make it again."

I also substitued the 3 3/4 cups of water for 2 cups of chicken stock. The beef/chicken stock flavor was nice. I added about a 1/2 tablespoon of chopped garlic to the leeks and mushrooms while they were cooking. I also added salt to taste and the red pepper to taste. I also used 2 whole leeks and more pasta. I will make this again. Thank you for this simple and elegant soup."

I adore leeks and mushrooms and this is one of the best.\n\n\nI did read several other reviews saying the original recipe as written was more of a consomme type soup, and I needed something hearty to hold me through a long workday. So I made it thicker: I used 4 whole leeks including greens, and about 12oz of mushrooms (with an extra couple T olive oil to sautee them with.) I added 2 cloves of garlic, and instead of adding any water at all I simply used about 8 cups of broth (3 beef and 5 chicken.) I used a full cup of orzo, and at the very end on a whim I threw in a can of black eyed peas I had in the cupboard. The result was the same delightful flavor but a VERY hearty, luscious soup that easiy serves as a main dish. I have been taking it to work for lunch and it holds me all day while I'm on my feet running! Absolutely love it."
