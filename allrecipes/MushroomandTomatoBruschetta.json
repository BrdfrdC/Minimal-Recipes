The second batch, I spread garlic butter on the baguette before roasting it, added a pinch of crushed red pepper to the tomatoes, and then mixed the mushrooms &amp; tomatoes together. Both very delicious methods. It won’t taste like “pizza” as someone said unless you cook the toppings WAY too long. :)"

"reviewBody": "This strays pretty far from a traditional bruschetta. Add the tomatoes to step 3 and you will essentially have a pizza sauce - bruschetta toppings are not cooked and the garlic is rubbed onto the toasted bread and not a \"topping\" per se. It really seems to be pizza except toasted bread is used for the crust. If you ask your taste buds, I think you will find them saying \"pizza.\""
