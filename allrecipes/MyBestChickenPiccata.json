I start this dish first with sauteing the onion and garlic in a light drizzle of olive oil, remove from pan and then add the butter to the pan for the chicken and then proceed with the recipe. Great with mashed potatoes and a tossed salad. Easy and delicious."

Cooking time was a bit longer than described, just to make sure the chicken was cooked all the way through (didn't cut the chicken smaller). Served it with a Knorr mix of garlic/mushroom rice, and green beans. Husband and 2 young adult children loved it as well! This is a keeper!!"

"reviewBody": "This was FANTASTIC.\n\nMy alterations:\nOther reviewers are correct that you don't need more than about 1/2 c of flour. I'm not a wine drinker and didn't want to buy a bottle to get a mere 3/4c to cook with, so I used chicken stock instead. I used a generous Tbsp of the capers, and chicken thighs instead of breasts because that's what I had on hand. I probably used a little too much lemon juice, because the lemons the store had were a little underjuiced, so I used two of them (a little more than 1/3 c of juice instead of 1/4). Instead of heating the whole 1/2 c of butter to fry the chicken in, I only used about half of that and put the rest in the freezer until the sauce had reduced, and then I stirred in the remaining cold butter to help thicken the sauce a little more. It made PLENTY of sauce -- keep in mind this is a VERY strongly-flavored sauce; a little goes a long way!\n\n\nServed it over angelhair pasta, and I'm going to be gleefully eating the leftover pasta and sauce for the rest of the week!\n\nThings I'd change in the future: Cut the chicken up into smaller pieces and pound them flat so they cook faster. That's it, really; the dish was GREAT. I might consider tossing the dish with some steamed veggies - broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, and carrot would all go great with this."

First I used about half the butter and added EVOO. Second, I used some chicken stock in the sauce when I found I needed a bit more liquid. This was probably because I sautéed the chicken and combined the two liquids ahead of time. A couple hours later I did the reducing and reheated the chicken. Worked just fine."

Maybe the caper flavor wasn't strong enough because I was overwhelmed by butter! I could imagine my arteries clogging as I was making it, and I only used half of wat was called for. The recipe also calls for way more flour than is needed."

"reviewBody": "Butter and lemon is the flavor of the dish. Be careful not to burn the butter while browning the chicken. As you are browning the chicken in 1/2 cup butter. I used 1/2 a lemon juiced and thinly sliced 1/4 of the remaining lemon and cooked with the sauce as a suggestion by another review. No problem cooking the sauce down, which I doubled, as others indicted not enough sauce. Chicken tastes like butter (without the sauce), and the sauce had too much lemon flavor per our taste. Love the capers which I rinsed before adding to the sauce. I served the sauce on the side."

"reviewBody": "I made a lot of modifications to this - not out of disrespect for the original poster, but due to who I am as a person.\n\nI used chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts because that's what was in the freezer.\n\nI was going to drop the white wine down to 1/4 cup and use 1 cup of low sodium chicken broth, but there was a little less than 1/4 cup of wine in the bottle, so I used it up and topped off the missing amount with broth. I left off the parsley because I don't like leafy garnishes.\n\nI always like to see what people pair their meat with because my default is bell peppers. I tried the 'Easy Lemon and Garlic Broccoli.' It's mostly black because I apparently do not understand how to steam broccoli. I added another squirt of lemon juice and my husband was wise enough to pretend he didn't notice.\n\nI also paired it with a glass of Merlot out of annoyance with how the broccoli turned out. Also, I happen to like Merlot and the bottle was already open.\n\nOverall, the chicken was 216 calories per serving and delicious. I would make it again."

But after a while, you taste the salt and you can't help but grimace. In other words, this is too salty for me. Next time, I will probably just add a pinch of salt (literally a pinch)."

I really wonder if anyone actually made this recipe??!!"

I doubled the amount of Butter for cooking, I doubled the amount of Chardonay white wine, I doubled the Lemons to (2) Lemons, I doubled the amount of capers to 2 teaspoons, and I doubled the amount of Parsley to 4 teaspoons. I chopped up my parsley in a chopper and I added it to the saute pan with the liquid at the end and I let it simmer in with the wine, capers, butter and Lemon juice for a few minutes, before I added my chicken to the saute pan. I then let the chicken simmer in the pan with the juices before I put all in a serving dish. I then poured the remaining saute pan liquid over the chicken. The recipe passed the toughest critic, my husband. Thank you very very much. For the first time I made a successful chicken Piccata."

I adjusted quantities a bit, to fit the amount of chicken I had -- one humongous half-breast, weighing almost a pound -- and I cut the breast into four slices rather than into pieces. Half a cup of flour was more than enough, and I think I used about a quarter to a third cup of butter. Saved some butter to add when the sauce was almost done, to swirl in and thicken. Having found out another time that we don't like capers straight from the jar, I rinsed them this time! Also, I didn't have an extra lemon, so no lemon slices."

I also used bottled lemon juice instead of a fresh juiced lemon and used about 1/8 of a cup. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T\nIn hindsight, I wish I had doubled the sauce because we had 4 huge breasts that my husband butterflied, so we ended up with 8 pieces and there wasn't sufficient sauce to go around. Note to self for next time :)\nWe served it with buttered linguine and salad-it was an excellent meal!"
