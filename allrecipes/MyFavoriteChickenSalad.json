I chose to do a whole chicken which I roasted with butter olive oil, salt pepper and garlic powder. I let the bird cool long enough to where I can manhandle it and ripped all the meat off of it and then chopped it up fairly fine. I followed this recipe for the most part but I like to throwing my own little spin on things so I went kind of heavy on some of the ingredients and I didn't do the fresh Dill. TASTES AWESOME!!!"

It wasn’t “bad”, it’s just not for everyone. I would not say that this is the best chicken salad because of all the extra ingredients and the ratios weren’t quite there. Uncooked yellow onion gave this a strong onion flavor; sweet onion would be a milder alternative. I won’t be making again."

Of course the size of the chicken breasts varies, but unless yours are fairly small the extra sauce will keep it from being dry.

I like onions so I did 1/2 of a small onion, diced super small. I had huge stalks of celery, so only used two rather than three, diced up super small. When I stirred it all up, mixed it well, took a taste......My taste buds lit up with so many different flavors and it was delightful! I love this recipe. Truly deserves 6 stars!"

"reviewBody": "This is a good base recipe. Plenty of flavor. I omitted the sugar, onions, and pecans (didn’t have any on hand). Even the kids that don’t usually eat chicken salad enjoyed it. I put chicken breast in the crockpot with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and dill the day before. It added a deep flavor into the chicken. I also added sour cream instead of just using mayonnaise, which makes a major difference. Will definitely use this recipe again. Thank you."

"reviewBody": "This is my absolute favorite chicken salad recipe! I’ve been using it for years. It’s great with smoked chicken(my fav), or even leftover rotisserie or oven roasted chicken. Be careful with the salt depending on how your chicken was cooked. I only use 1/4 tsp at most, and only about 1 tsp of pepper. I like to sub slivered almonds for the pecans sometimes, and to really put the salad over the top, sub sweet chow chow in place of the sweet pickle relish."

I didn't have any sweet relish on had so I just used about 1/4-1/2 c of chopped up grapes and I omitted the celery because my family just doesn't like it in salads. I also substituted pecans for almonds since that is what I had in the house. Came out delicious!!!"

I made it without pecans (didn't have any) and because I had a limited amount of roasted chicken I eyeballed most of the ingredients. Delish. I didn't add the sugar after tasting, but put a bit more relish which worked beautifully. This will be added to my rotation especially since summer is here, even tho the calendar say May 2nd (88 degrees) :-)"
