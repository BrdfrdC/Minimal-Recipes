I always wondered with all the reviews with edits if anyone has ever been one of those people ^_^ I loved this recipe because I do variations in my slow cooker but this is a very pleasant change up. Only thing I did and always do with beef tips is season flour and brown in my cast iron pan scraping in the bits. Browning keeps the tips super moist by locking in the moisture and gives another flavor element even if you underseason the tips. Thank you."

To the sauce I added about 2 T of balsamic vinegar, a T of brown sugar, salt, pepper and worcestshire sauce. And by all means dig out your immersion blender at the end. Remove the meat from the pan and whir up about 80% of the sauce, leaving a few nice chunks. You will be amazed what a big difference this makes in the end product."

"reviewBody": "I do not understand the no flavor comments, they must have left something out. So I made it straight up very good. Then made again and I added garlic, fresh basil and oregano, 1/2 cup red wine and 2 beef bouillon cubes. Wow so so good. So if you need more flavor add fresh herbs, garlic and beef broth or bouillon cubes. So so good. I like it better with mashed potatoes than rice. Serve with stir fried vegetable of your choice and peas. Perfect."

Served it over mashed potatoes with a nice green salad. Delicious and will definitely try again."

I do love the taste I must say. It's been more than 20 years since I've had Swiss steak and this is a great recipe to follow. Also, I had some boxed \"potatoes al gratin\" that needed to be cooked so that was the side. Hope Mike likes this."

"reviewBody": "Since canned diced tomatoes have no flavor, IMO, I replaced them with two cups crushed San Marzano tomatoes. I also omitted the oregano since I didn't want an \"Italian\" taste (that's not traditional for Swiss Steak). I added about a tablespoon of Worcestershire to the sauce while it cooked instead. Had no celery on hand so I seasoned the steaks well with celery salt and black pepper before browning them, as well as adding a bit of salt and pepper to taste while this cooked. Turned out very good."

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I lightly floured the steaks before browning them, after a light application of salt and pepper. My husband was underwhelmed, sad to say, and so was I, after such a long cooking time."

Had cooked strip steak &amp; grilled mushrooms leftover, as well as parts of onions &amp; bell pepper, &amp; even a small amount of homemade marinara which I used in place of the canned diced tomatoes. Served it over leftover pasta but I could definitely see it over mashed potatoes or rice also. Very good &amp; flavorful comfort food. And as an added bonus I have a clean fridge too!"

I used a can of onion/green pepper petite-diced canned tomatoes, cut up some green pepper and onions and cooked them in the skillet after browning the beef. I added some water and a beef boullion cube and let the veggies simmer until done. I baked the swiss steak at 325 for 2 hours. It was tender and made a great gravy for my mashed potatoes."
