Remove shrimp shells and use the wine reduction for part of the liquids, reducing the butter and oil. I didn't have pesto on hand so just used basil. I used mini penne and added to pan with most of a bag of spinach. Perfect with a sprinkling of parmesan on top of each serving!"

I just used about 1 tablespoon (or less) of butter and just enough olive oil to coat pan. I served it over angel hair pasta. It was delicious and will definitely make it again soon. Next time I will increase spinach, garlic and spices. It is a great, easy recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I took the advice of other reviewers and only used 2 tbs. each of butter and olive oil. I did add more pesto (approx. 4 tbs.) and didn't add any additional garlic. With the pesto, there was plenty of garlic. I used a whole bag of baby spinach, an additional tomato, and 2 lbs. of shrimp and there was plenty of sauce. Served over brown rice it was delicious! I think the suggestion of thickening the sauce with a bit of cornstarch and water would make it even more amazing. I will definitely make this again!"

I love it that people can leave reviews on these dishes--as long as there are only a minor change or two to the original recipe and if there are several people recommending the same change, I usually follow it. I did cut back the butter and olive oil and added a bit of white wine and juice of 1/2 fresh squeezed lemon, and it was wonderful! I had olive pesto in the cabinet and used that. The tomatoe-y flavor of the pesto and the tomato really make the sauce good, as does the spinach. Excellent recipe."

"reviewBody": "Minimal effort for fine Italian restaurant quality. I scaled this down to two servings (just for myself). This comes together VERY quickly. After reading reviews, I further cut back by half on the oil and butter (~1 tblsp each). My small shrimp were frozen-cooked, so I thawed and cooked just until heated. I didn't want to open a jar of pesto sauce, so I just used dried basil. Nice bite from the red pepper flakes; used regular tomatoes. I also added a splash of white wine, and I found that it does need salt. I had as-is (no pasta), so that was a nice, low-carb treat! Definite keeper recipe!"

Next time I will add a little more spinach since we are spinach fans and it really shrinks down. For those of you that think there was too much oil and butter, just pour the entire shrimp dish into a pan of linguine and it works perfectly."

After sauteeing the garlic &amp; spices, I added the shrimp, tomatoes &amp; spinach all at once &amp; cooked til heated through. Served over linguini &amp; it was truly scrumptious. Update: I have to laugh as this was in my \"favorites\" &amp; I didn't remember I had already made it. This time, I followed the recipe (no added wine or lemon juice) but I added 1/4 c. Chopped red onion &amp; 4 oz sliced mushrooms at the beginning. It was truly delicious made this way! 5 stars again!"
