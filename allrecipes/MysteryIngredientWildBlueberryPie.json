I actually don’t usually care for blueberry pie, or any cooked blueberries, but this, with the touch of almond extract and less sugar than many others, was really good. Will be my go to recipe in the future."

Alas, wild blueberries were not to be had. My supermarket fresh blueberries tasted a bit bland, so I added 2 tsp. of fresh lemon juice to give them some tang and 1/2 Tbsp more flour for my very juicy berries. No other changes. When the pie was completely cooled, it thickened up just fine. This recipe is terrific! Thanks for sharing."

I will make it again because the flavor of cinnamon and almond extract was wonderful. When I make it again I plan to make the following changed; cut ice cold butter with the sugar, add 2 tbsp more of flower with it, add lemon zest to the blue berries, bake at 425 for 15 min, cover the crust and bake for another 45 min at 350."

Also, the author is dead serious about 5 1/2 cups of berries. I used a 16 oz bag of frozen wild blueberries, because clearly I have no concept of how much frozen weight translates into cup volume (and I still don't because I didn't measure my frozen berries to find out how much I was off by, which is my own fault). Anyway, 16 oz of frozen berries is not enough because my pie had that \"too much flour\" texture in the filling, which is 100% my own fault. I made this as a no-topping pie and that worked fine with the given cooking time, following the same rules for covering it and then uncovering it. This is a good recipe, I just don't love the cinnamon and almond like I thought I would. Thanks for sharing!"
