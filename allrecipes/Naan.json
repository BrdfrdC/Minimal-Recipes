I usually make a half batch on the dough setting of bread machine - the only change is to cook them in a hot, dry frying pan. They freeze well &amp; thaw quickly for a speedy meal idea. Just add sauce, toppings &amp; cheese then pop under the broiler for about 5 minutes. We love this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This was really, really good and so easy to make! I was even exceptionally lazy about the process and cut a few corners, and it came out as chewy, delicious naan with a subtle garlic flavor. Things I did that weren't mentioned in the recipe: 1. I didn't have milk, so I substituted in heavy cream. 2. I didn't grill them. I just used a nonstick pan because it was convenient. 3. I absolutely obliterated the garlic until they were in tiny, tiny pieces. It was raw when I added it to the dough and I didn't want to bite into a giant piece! 4. When frying them, I brushed each side that was facing up with butter, then sprinkled with a very small amount of kosher salt. 5. Medium high heat would be WAY too high for my stove. I set it to from setting 3-4 out of 10 and it still got a great char/cooked fully. 6. I got too impatient waiting for the second rise, and only gave them about 10 minutes. I would recommend giving them the full time if possible, but...I was gettin a little hangry. I paired it with the curry stand tikka masala also on this site, and it was so. Good. I would give it a try!"

Several commentators recommended including the sugar in the water in the proofing the yeast. I don't usually do this when proofing yeast but figured it couldn't hurt so I did - not convinced it was necessary. I cooked them on an electric griddle so I could do several at once. Very pleased with the results. We'll make this recipe again."

I made it on my grill out back with coals from our evening fire, it cooked fast, with a crispy outside and soft inside, it also opens easily to form a pocket if you like to put your food in a pocket-bread. I followed another person's advice about making garlic butter and brushing it onto the bread before cooking, rather than kneading the garlic in. it was perfection."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was very good! I think 4 1/2 cups was a bit too much flour, though. The dough was dry and crumbly and not really coming together into a nice ball so I had to add more milk and some olive oil to moisten the dough a bit. It came together nicely after that. Next time, I'll probably cut it down to 4 cups of flour and see what the dough looks like. I didn't have an indoor grill, so I decided to cook the bread in a large cast iron pan on low to medium heat. That worked beautifully. The recipe was quite large so I froze half of the dough balls. This recipe is a keeper and I will definitely be making it again."

I also used only 4 cups of flour, 4 and a half would make the dough WAY too dry. Also used garlic powder instead of legitimate garlic the second time which worked incredibly well to get the garlic flavor throughout all of the bread.\n\nBut yeah, this is seriously a good and easy to follow recipe.

The portion is substantial, with one recipe feeding two adults and two tweens generously, for two meals. The left overs were carefully portioned out the next day, lest anyone get even a bite less than anyone else!\n\nMade them exactly per recipe, though let them rise longer the first time, simply because I made them too early in the afternoon. Grilled them on an outdoor gas grill, which was made much easier with the assistance of my wife, who rolled them out grill-side whilst I grilled, buttered, flipped, and plated these lovely treats. Will definitely make again."

That says a lot! \n\nI thought it was doomed to fail when 1) no foam formed, but only had few tiny bubbles and 2) my dough did not rise within an hour. After reading the other reviews here, I realized the recipe did not mention that sugar had to be added in the yeast proofing step. Nevertheless, it still turned out great! There were a lot of bubbles and it tasted good too. My family loved it!\n\nI'm willing to try this again using bread floor and adding sugar when proofing my yeast."

"reviewBody": "This is amazing! I gave it four stars only because I ended up using 3.5 cups of flour and a tsp of garlic powder instead of minced, it was fantastic that way. So, so good! We make them almost every weekend now. I also had to use instant yeast (all I have) so I decreased the yeast amount and proof time by 25%. The first time I made these I made golf ball sized like the recipe calls for but the second time I tried a little larger and it was still very, very good. This recipe does make a couple dozen naan so after the second proof when theyâ€™re in balls I froze half. The next weekend I thawed in room temp water for 30 minutes and they came out just as good. I recommend playing around with stuffing these. After the ball proof I rolled them out about half way, put a tbsp of filling then continued rolling them out. Donâ€™t be afraid of rolling over the filling, it incorporates into the dough that way. It also takes me about 20-30 minutes to roll out half the balls so itâ€™s not really â€˜grill sideâ€™. Plan your time accordingly. Weâ€™ve stuffed them with various ingredients. One was just cheese and garlic (omitting the garlic from the earlier step). One was potatoes (I cheated and used hash brown leftovers) and cheese, one mix was chopped, really dry cherries and unsalted pistachios, next Iâ€™m going to try dates and feta! The combos are endless."

I've done this before with tortilla dough, so I'm hoping it'll work here, too. I'll just leave them out for an hour or so to defrost within the next couple of days."

I didn't have bread flour and with the pandemic, flour is in short supply so I used AP, which worked out beautifully. I didn't mix the garlic in the dough, I was afraid it would be too overpowering so I added it to the melted butter and brushed it on both sides before grilling. For me, it added just the right amount of garlic flavor. I didn't have a grill pan so I used a regular saute pan and that worked just fine. Lastly, I rolled a few out thin like it states but it was too thin, I didn't get that chewy texture so rolled the rest to about a 1/4 of an inch. These are all minor items and I used the naan for chicken gyros...Oh my - so good!!!"

I followed the recipe with these changes: Based on other reviews I added tsp of sugar with the yeast so it could \"proof\" for 10 minutes, then I added a 1/2 tsp of baking soda to all the other ingredients in the mixture. I let my Kitchenaid knead the dough for me for 8 minutes. Rolled it out on a floured surface and it rose beautifully after an hour. Punched it down and let it rise again in 12-16 balls. Grilled it on our gas stove with a grill/griddle greased and on medium high. The naan bubbled up perfectly and I cooked each side 1 minute then flipped with tongs. Turned out perfect. Lots of leftovers that we froze. Perfect tast and texture. We melted 1 stick of butter with 2 tsp of garlic to baste on it since the 1/4 c was no where near enough. I am so Proud of myself! lol Woohoo! You can do this! Thanks so much for this recipe!"
