I’ve made this type of frosting from this recipe previously, neither my family or I really liked it. I used a buttercream instead, it worked very nicely. \nAs far as the cakes in this recipe, they are lovely. They taste almost like the cake part of devil dogs, very yummy! Be sure not to overcook them, they are much better if they are still somewhat soft. \nI will definitely use this recipe for whoopie pies again, they were a big hit!"

I wish I had read the reviews first because it was definitely too much frosting, especially because I only got 42 cookies instead of 48. Haha. Cakes are great, but definitely not as dark as the ones in the video. I’ll make them again."

Also added a bit of vanilla... \nI cheat and make the cakes themselves with cake mix - using 3/4c (or less) of water instead of 1 1/4c. cake mix *with pudding* gets sticky so avoid that kind. \nUse ice cream scoop to keep consistent sized cookies regardless of recipe used."

The recipe does not say to refrigerate after making but I leaned on the side of caution and will keep them cool since it is a milk base. The cooler temps do not affect the pie at all if you give it 5 minutes to warm up a little before eating."

However I had to make some adjustments to it, for it was a little bland. As experience rules, I used powdered sugar instead of regular granulated sugar, much fluffier and smoother. As far as the cake goes it was fine."
