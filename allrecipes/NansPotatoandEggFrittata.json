I added a pinch of garlic seasoning and red pepper flakes. However, who doesnt really like eggs or potatoes. I used 2 standard sized russets cooked the day before. I highly recommend precooking the potato, sliced that thick. This is definitely very basic."

ONce everything was LIGHTLY fried I transfered everything to a casserole dish and poured in the egg on top. Cooked it in the oven for about 20 min and then covered it with swiss cheese. Was really wonderful after all that!"

I added some sliced bell peppers and chili powder. It really was quite good. The confusing directions were the only drawback for me."

Made some tweaks, including microwaving the potatoes for 3 minutes as another reviewer suggested, then frying in 1 Tbsp oil with 2 cloves garlic and basil (dry as had no fresh on hand). Then added eggs with salt and pepper mixed in to eggs first. Turned out lovely. Will be making this again soon."

"reviewBody": "Warning: I changed a lot of things. I followed the advice of previous reviewers for a few things. I microwaved the potatoes first and added sauteed onions, and a bit of cheese on top. I also added about a cup of broccoli to make it a complete meal (I feel a meal must have some veggie and potatoes are not veggies for me) and a couple more eggs. I gave it four stars, because flipping via a plate seemed like a bad idea for me. I put in under the broiler for a few minutes to finish it. The cooked potatoes would have had a nice flavor on their own, but adding onions just makes it that much more. The end result was gorgeous and delicious."

The only changes I made were: I didn't peel the potatoes but left the skins on and I cooked them for 3 min in the microwave before browning them. I cut out the olive oil completely and just sprayed my frying pan with Pam. And I added some diced onion.\nMaybe next time I'll try adding some ham or mushrooms and maybe a little onion powder/garlic powder to give it more flavor."
