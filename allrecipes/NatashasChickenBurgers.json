The only change I made to the recipe was to not use breadcrumbs but instead to use ground up crackers. The grated onion makes all the difference. I put in a little bit of fresh parsley and they were heavenly!"

I didn't love the idea of grated onion instead I added onion powder about 1tsb, then I chopped up some green onion and Red pepper very finely and added that. I already had 2lbs of Chicken out so I doubled the recipe but only added one whole egg and one egg white. They were absolutely delicious. I cooked 5 and froze the other 3, but now I wished I had cooked all 8. We will definitely be keeping this little gem for another time."

I added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper for a little zip. It's very good!\nI used Panko Italian bread crumbs in the chicken patty mixture and plain Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little Italian Panko bread crumbs for the coating.\nMake sure you cook until the inside temperature is 165 degrees or higher. I always like to cook my chicken a little higher. You can finish in the oven if the coating is done but the temp isn't 165 yet."

The next day I microwaved 1 minute each side. While this recipe replaces my need for the Don Lee chicken burgers (That costco isn't selling anymore...) I did find them to be a little bland. I will be adding a little taco seasoning next time or a little more salt. I also did not coat the patties in crumbs, I just added it all to the mix. Great recipe all around though."

My only sub was regular bread crumbs , adding Italian seasoning t hat since I didn't have preseasoned crumbs, These are great as a slider or just by themselves"

Also, I don't bread them. The next time I make them I'll add some sort of heat factor. I pattied mine up the day before and allowed the flavors to marinate. #Yum"

I also let the mixture rest for a few minutes burger mix before forming into patties. These patties were not bad--I think the added seasoning helped them. These were extremely economical and simple to make."
