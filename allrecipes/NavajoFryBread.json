It's been a couple of years but this tastes just like the fry bread recipe from that little booth at the fair. About the salt. I didn't have a clean tablespoon so I eyed 2 tablespoons and it was fine. (Former chef experience). I also used small dabs of cooking oil on my hands( gloves ) to prevent the dough from sticking while flattening. Flatten dough to the thickness of a cooked pancake and cooking one at a time, I had 8 fry breads. Too thin and the fry bread gets hard. i turned them once when golden brown areas appeared."

I would have known this if I had read some of the reviews but I actually thought this was a recipe I had used and liked before. I couldn't remember my login info on an unfamiliar device so I just googled the recipe, not realizing there are multiple similar recipes on Allrecipes.com. If you're interested, the one we've used and liked is Navaho Indian Fry Bread. I also disagree that this is a 9 serving recipe because it made a lot! I think we ended up with about 14-16 large biscuit-sized pieces (about 4-6 inch diameter by 3/4 inch thick). I will not be making this one again."

For those on a diet, I wouldn't use this recipe too often. lol. The tablespoons of salt is not right. Use teaspoon instead.

"reviewBody": "So yummy! I grew up eating Fry Bread often in Arizona and this recipe did not disappoint. This is extremely tasty and extraordinarily quick. \n\nNow for the changes--luckily I read the reviews so I did the 2 tsp salt and went ahead and added flour until it would be ready for ordinary bread--tacky but not sticky. If you are in a bread mixer like a Bosch, this would be when the dough all pulls away from all sides (and middle for a Bosch). For me this was 5+ cups of flour, but I don't really keep track exactly for bread.\n\nI will be making this often. Thank you!"

"reviewBody": "I have a friend that is Navajo. He and I got together to do this recipe. With a bit more flour and 2 teaspoons of salt, the recipe tasted like his Mom's. Make sure the oil that is used for frying is good and hot, otherwise they will taste greasy. Also, he said that they are best if fried in hot lard. My friend made a topping that is similar to taco filling with beef, beans, tomato sauce and spices that was absolutely delicious. He topped each one with cheese, lettuce and fresh tomato pieces. We ate them \"tostada\" style. As with many family recipes, there is no recipe, I am still trying to replicate that so that I can continue to make them for my family."

After making several modifications it came out great. I upped the flour, decreased the salt, added garlic and thyme, and for the milk, I was short on milk so I used 1/2 the portion of milk and the other 1/2 was vanilla yougurt. My husband loved it (he ate 3 pieces alone) and my 3 year old also enjoyed it."

When Native Americans started being forced onto reservations and separated from their traditional foods, they had to make do with the lard, flour and salt they were given.So...fry bread. Also, I'm Canadian too and around here we call fry bread \"beaver tails.\" Pretty corny, I know :)"

I didn't have my milk warm enough the first time and the breads were quite heavy. And to make them just a touch sweeter I added about 3 TBLS of raw sugar to the mix. Drizzle with warm honey and they are to DIE for! Particularly good served warm with some chilled muscadine juice! YUM!"

Because most Navajo would not have access to milk and most frying is done in an open pit or on a wood stove, the recipe is a very simple flat bread that is fried. It is the topping that makes the meal."

"reviewBody": "I made these to be used as \"gordita\" style taco shells and they were wonderful. I mixed it up in my bread machine, on the dough cycle just watching it until it formed a ball - it never really did though - I had to add about 3/4 of a cup extra flour. I then tore off palm sized chunks of dough and rolled them into a ball. I put each ball inbetween two pieces of wax paper sprayed with cooking spray and rolled them out until they were quite thin. They fryed up beautifully, looking just like I expected. I made them about 6 inches across so they were the size of a taco shell when folded. I tasted one without any taco toppings and thought it was way to salty (I forgot to read the reviews), but after loading them up with mexican rice, lettuce, and cheese to make vegitarian tacos they didn't seem salty at all with all of those other flavors. I will use this recipe again and probably only use two teaspoons of salt. My husband filled one with taco meat and cheese and liked it also! Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!!"

Says to form into balls and pat it out?! I couldn't even get it off my hands! I probably added another cup or so of flour just to be able to work with it. My advice? Skip the headache and open a can of refridgerated biscuits."

"reviewBody": "In Canada this isn't \"Fry-bread\" or \"navajo fry bread\" its just BANNOCK. Now Bannock is really good, but fatty. the best thing to put on it is jam. Any jam will do the trick, my favs are raspberry and strawberry (yes i now, how very unconventional). anyhow, this recipe wasnt the greatest bannock recipe, but it was pretty good. If you want the best bannock on earth its gotta be cooked over the fire in a skillet, the resipe being made by an old cree \"cookem\" (grandma) from northern alberta, trust me you can't go wrong."

I rolled mine out instead of patting them. I had NO idea how thick these are supposed to be since I have never even seen fry bread before let alone eaten it. I was afraid that I would pat them out and make them to think therfore they would not cook well in the middle. By rolling them out I got something almost like a carnival elephant ear. My whole family loved them."

I showed this to my Grandma and she only said \"That too much salt!\" \r\n\r\nAnd Here are some tips I learned from Granny:\r\nIts all in the mixing! For whatever type of Frybread.\r\nAlso my Granny lets her recipe sit over night brushed with oil so it doesnt dry out. Then she pats it out and fries it all up. \r\nKneading.....dont knead much!lol Very lightly or else it will come out hard as a hockey puck! Pat only if you can."
