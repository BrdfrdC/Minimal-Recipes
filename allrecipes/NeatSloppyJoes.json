Adults love it along with the kids. 5 stars to Aunt Mamie who submitted this recipe! A p.s. note, if so desired, because people's desires vary, drain off the grease as noted in the recipe, because if not, there may be a greasy texture left on your lips."

Next time, and I would definitely make this again, Iâ€™d use less brown sugar. Thanks for a pretty good dinner solution."

Didn't have celery, so I used about 1/2 tsp of celery flakes. Browned the lean beef meat with a tad of olive oil in my electric Dutch oven, added the onions, then mixed in all the spices and let this cook at about 300 Deg for an hour or so. Reheated it for dinner. Tasted great and healthier than the canned alternative! You can always add more salt or other seasonings to taste later :)"

"reviewBody": "This recipe was my first attempt at Sloppy Joe's. My husband and I loved them and I'll definitely be making them again. I did make a couple of changes, but they were out of necessity. I did not have white vinegar so I used cider vinegar. Since that's a little sweet I only used 2tbsp of brown sugar. I did not have celery, so I used 3/4cup onion and a yellow bell pepper. (During a New England winter you need all the Vitamin C you can get.) Lastly, I used whole wheat buns and topped with a slice of sharp cheddar."

"reviewBody": "I multiplied the recipe by 5 and served to a group of Boy Scout leaders. The only change was that I had to brown the meat in batches. I added veggies to the last batch after draining the meat. After meat and veggies were done I put everything into an electric roaster. It was a big hit - several people asked for the recipe. No complaints about the sweetness. Thanks for the great recipe!"

I've always used a similar recipe (it happens to be similar to the base seasoning for my mom's chili and I didn't feel like digging out her recipe lol) so no big surprise that I had no problem adjusting it to my liking. I cut the brown sugar down by half, added a little extra vinegar and Worcestershire, and added a little chili powder. Nice thing about sloppy joes it that it's so easy to start out with the bare minimum seasoning and keep adding more til it's just right!"
