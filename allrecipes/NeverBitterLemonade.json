I only used half the water to dissolve the sugar. I added the rest after to help cool it faster. and I cut back the amount of sugar by a quarter.\n\nI also made a double recipe. I've made it twice now everyone in the house thinks it's perfect except. the person who said it's bad must be fooling around or they did something wrong... or possibly they don't really like lemonade. this is my go to now."

We liked it so much that we all drank the whole pitcher in just an hour. Next time, I think I might add a quarter cup more lemon juice as it was a little on the sweet side, but it's really good as is. NOTE: I used Meyer lemons."

I used much less sugar because I was using Myer lemons from my tree and, after reading the Ginger Lemonade recipe, I decided to make a second ginger infused syrup that could be added to the Lemonade if desired. So I did not want the Lemonade to be overly sweet. I also made a Pomegranate Syrup and served it an the Ginger syrup in little pitchers to be added to the lemonade. Worked great and was very popular."

That salt trick really works (I do that when I make sweet tea also) - no bitterness AT ALL. My family went nuts over this. My only complaint is that it doesn't make enough! Oh well, I guess next time I can double or triple it!"

I think the salt is the trick. It really made a difference. I used 4 small lemons and it was just over a 1/2 cup of juice. Perfect. Thanks for sharing this one Sue!"

I'll never use another."
