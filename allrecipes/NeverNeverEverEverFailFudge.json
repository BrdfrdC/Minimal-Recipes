"reviewBody": "I didn't rate this one star because technically my kids will eat anything sweet, but it's really not good. Ignoring the fact that the recipe writer completely forgot the part about stirring the mixture for five minutes after it reaches boiling, there's just so much wrong with this recipe. For starters, the photo shows a nice thick piece of fudge. The recipe itself will make fudge that is maybe half inch tall in an 8 by 8 dish. It's also extremely sweet and overly dry. I have made a lot of candy so I recognized the mistake in the recipe, and I only tried this because I have an overabundance of large marshmallows and wanted to use them up. I assumed the poor reviews were from people who followed the recipe exactly and the fudge didn't set up. I did not realize that even made correctly, it's just crummy fudge.n"

"reviewBody": "I've made a lot of fudge recipes over the past 25 years, but they are always hit and miss. I made two batches of this recipe today, and both came out perfect.\n\nLike others, I would clarify or add two notes to the recipe:\n\n1. Heat the liquid on High to bring it to a \"rolling\" boil so the entire surface of the liquid is boiling/foaming, while stirring occasionally. Don't go to the next step until the entire surface is boiling/foaming. It will foam so much that it looks doubled in size.\n2. Once you're there, turn it down to Medium or half heat, or as low as one quarter heat, just so it keeps up the rolling boil, but doesn't foam more than the previous step. Then you need to keep that boiling/foaming going for 5 minutes, no more, no less, all while constantly stirring.\n\nOnce you do those two steps, you continue the recipe and this fudge will be perfect every single time. #1 above is common for candy recipes like this, so many people assume you already know this, but most people don't. I think that's why a lot of people fail on this recipe. Some candy recipes also go so far as having you drop a drop of the liquid in cold water to test if it holds together before stopping the boiling, but 5 minutes should be perfect.\n\nThis recipe was so great, it was setting/hardening as soon as I poured it. Then I just put it on the stove with the fan on high to vent most of the heat, and when it's no longer burning hot, put it in the freezer for 30 minutes and you're good to go."

(Though she was a rather strict English granny). The thing missing from this version is that you must keep it on the boil 5 minutes and stir all the time!!!!!!!!!\nOnce you have the hang of it you can add all sorts of bits and pieces to it - just do it quickly when you stir them in right at the end after you lift it off the heat. A nice heavy pot helps, too.I made a batch and sprinkled \"skor candy bits\" on top and brought it to work today and EVERYONE LOVED IT!!!!! (cut it up small so even some of the exercisers and dieters chose to try a bit)."

Honestly, if my husband hadn't been here to take over the stirring at the last stage, I would have thrown a globby mess in the trash, just like some of the other reviewers. The trick is to get it stirred together quickly and completely before it begins to set. It takes a strong arm!"

It is a great base fudge recipe that you will be able to customize your ingredients depending on flavor and or additions such as nuts and/or chips etc ...The other recipes that use condensed milk are really not fudge ... if you like the taste then fine, but fudge is the melting of sugar and cream or evaporated milk and melted chocolate with a marshmallow creme or even marshmallows. The fudge makers of the candy world use Mazetta and invertase, but that is going too far for such a simple fun snack. Enjoy and be bold, experiment!"

"reviewBody": "This was very easy. I read the reviews first...maybe that helped. This is my second attempt at making fudge (1st attempt -someone else's recipe which did not set) and I stirred like crazy. You must keep stirring until it feels like your arm will fall off. I found that while the saucepan was off the heat and I was stirring in the marshmellows it was starting to set. I guess the temperature in the room had something to do with it. So I put it back on the stove (did not turn the heat on) to ensure that all the marshmellows melted. So far so good, just waiting for it to cool completely so I can cut."

Bring to a boil - turne down to med-high heat and boil while stirring constantly for 5 min. Remove from heat. I used 2 cups of small marshmallows and stirred them in first then added the choc chips. Poured it directly into a buttered 9\" pie place and let cool - put in refrigerator. It set up perfectly. I do think the trick is to cook it for 5 min."

The milk/sugar mixture began to scald/burn before it boiled, but since the sugar was totally dissolved, that's when I took it off the heat and added the marshmallows. I'll probably use this recipe again. My first attempt ended up tasting good, although it did not set. I had it in the refrigerator overnight, and then in the freezer for awhile. It was a Christmas gift for my brother-in-law, and I only had one shot, so I thought never ever fail fudge would be the recipe to make. Mine failed."

I cut each marshmallows in fourths to increase speed. I also had everything ready when I began- nut chopped, chips measured, etc. For a candy this isn't a really hard recipe. (I didn't have to break out the candy thermometer!)\n\nMy only complaints are that the fudge is a bit too sweet for my taste and it isn't as creamy as some of my previous attempts. It is also annoying that I have a cup of leftover evaporated milk! When I asked my daughter to try it and give an opinion she asked if it was made with instant cocoa mix as she thought that it tasted like Swiss Miss."

The first time I blamed the chips, I used milk/peanut butter mix and only a full bag (so 1 3/4 cup instead of a full 2 cups). Today I used a full 2 cups of semisweet and it doesn't appear to be setting up right again, 3 hours after the fact it still appears soft. In reading the reviews (I didn't before attempting this since it had high stars) it appears you are missing directions? Isn't that what Allrecipes reviews it for? If there is a specific time the fudge needs to be boiled it would be nice if someone would SPECIFY IT. I'm putting the fudge in the fridge in hopes I didn't waste all that chocolate (I made a double batch for a large group) and won't have to buy something to take instead. If it doesn't set this will be the last time I make this."

I've had trouble with fudge in the past, so I was thrilled to find an easier way to make it!!"

I brought mine to a rolling boil and then removed it from the heat. The only thing I did different from the recipe was I added the marshmallows in first and stirred them until completely melted before adding the chocolate and vanilla. The marshmallows are part of what prevents the sugar from making the fudge grainy. Also, always use a top of the line sugar, such as Domino's brand. Cheap brands, or store brands have a more course grain. Mine turned out great, chocolatey and smooth. I prefer a softer fudge, so this one was perfect."

"reviewBody": "The key that is missing here is in the preparation. This particular recipe has been in my own family for generations, and it has never failed - providing you follow these particular directions: any seasoned fudge maker will realise those first three ingrediants in the saucepan need to be boiled about five minutes - but no more - and no less. The preparation instructions fail to mention how long it must be boiled. Five minutes is the key. \r\nWhen we allow this fudge to set in our household, we usually refridgerate it until set. Once it has set about an hour or a bit longer, I wouldn't keep it in the fridge permanantly, as it can get hard as a rock if left too long, although some members of my family have left it there and had no major trouble. If you like firmer fudge, leave in the fridge. If you like softer, allow it to set, and then take it out.\r\nGood luck.\r\n*Also, please do not forget, while it is boiling for those five minutes, do not stop stirring!"
