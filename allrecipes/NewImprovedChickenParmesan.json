"reviewBody": "I like this! The cheese variation is brilliant, though I did pile it more than an inch high and left room around for the melt. Used Monterey jack, no cheddar in the frig, so maybe that was the reason for the cheese spreading onto the pan around each breast for a couple inches. I wonder if chilling the cheese mix first will remedy that. Want more cheese on it than the pan! Still a 1/4 inch cheese on it and was delicious and soft. I baked at 450, 20 min. Love it with the ricotta. I'll keep trying til it looks like the chef's beautiful photo. Thanks, Chef John!"

I sprayed the baking pan with Pam and drizzled EVOO on top of the chicken before baking to retain moisture. Cooked at 400 for 30 minutes. I also used grated mozzarella instead of cheddar, added salt and pepper and little dried parsley and parmesan. I then topped each piece with the mixture and topped each piece with sauce, not much just enough to cover the cheese mixture. I baked at 375 degrees for about 20 imnutes."
