Check to see that the sides are still tucked well. If they aren&#39;t slide them in a bit now that you have the filling covered. Finish by tucking the bottom flap that you pulled over the filling UNDER the filling a bit to seal it, then continue rolling the burrito up to the top edge, forming a tight cylinder.

I am able to get fresh hatch chilis for about 2-3 weeks in September at our local grocery so I changed things a bit since they weren't the canned pre-roasted type. After chopping the peppers, garlic and onions I quickly fried them in the left over bacon grease before simmering them in beef demi glace (I was out of chicken stock and keep a jar of demi glace in the fridge). Otherwise I followed the directions. I'm sure Mr. Ross is correct and this is a heart attack on a plate but it is so good!"

"reviewBody": "It's interesting to see all of the variants of my recipe, and some of you have some great ideas! There really is no substitute for green chiles from the Hatch region of New Mexico. Several companies, sadly, have been growing what they call \"Hatch\" but are from Texas, and have virtually no flavor. Bell peppers? Oh, my, no. That's like substituting ketchup for Tabasco sauce. The best frozen chiles are from Bueno (expensive) and Berridge Farms. You can find canned chiles with the \"Hatch\" brand in most Whole Foods stores, but as the one chef remarked, they will break down a lot faster than the fresh, so add them at the end of your sauce making, once the onions are cooked through. \n\nIf you become totally addicted to NM Green Chiles (I have other Green Chile recipes) I would recommend buying a bulk box of the fresh chiles in the Fall. They are shipped to your door. You roast them on your bbq, and (using gloves) peel off the charred skins. You can either chop them and freeze containers for later use, or you can keep the chiles whole and put them in freezer bags. I get them here, but there are several companies that ship Hatch chiles every year... http://www.hatch-green-chile.com\n\nAs for the potatoes, frozen will work, but if you have a food processor with a shredder, go for the fresh, because the pop that fresh has over frozen can't be beat!"

On anything. A green bell pepper (although I love them) is not going to cut it here. Google Hatch green chili. There are companies in New Mexico that will be happy to send you some. The canned variety is also good."

Take the time and do the fresh potatoes, just added flavor you don't get from the frozen potatoes. We like to just roll them up and eat them on a plate so we can get more filling."

As long as you make the sauce as directed, the rest it a mute point. It doesn’t matter if you use frozen hash browns or leftovers from a previous breakfast. The sauce is what makes or breaks the burritos. I used fresh roasted Hatch green chilies this time, but I also froze Hatch chilies for future use. No doubt about it, this one’s a keeper!!!"

When simmering the chile, make sure to not let the peppers simmer for too long, they can begin to lose their flavor as they're already roasted/cooked beforehand. Also, if you can find it - use the FROZEN hatch green chile. \n\nOkay. So I'm kind of nervous to say this, as there may be several New Mexicans lurking about... BUT - I do hate green chile. Yes, I am a resident of New Mexico. Born and raised. This was the first time I've EVER liked green chile. I used mild because I don't like my chile to overwhelm the taste of the dish, but I still want a little \"kick.\" I could walk across the street and pay $5 for this burrito at a taco truck, but it tasted 200x better while relaxing in my pj's and chowing down on this baby. THANK YOU \"applejedi1,\" for this outstanding recipe. Now, if only I could eat one everyday without increasing my chances of that heart attack ;)"

I reduced the serving size to three because there is only the two of us. The only thing I did different was to use Ortega canned chillies because that is what I had on hand. I used my hand blender to smooth out the sauce because I don't like chunks of onion and thickened the sauce more. I will be making these again for sure."

But... the green chili sauce in this recipe makes these amazing! I don't think I'll ever eat another breakfast burrito without it. I did change the recipe a little bit. I could not find frozen Hatch, New Mexico green chili peppers so I used canned diced and roasted green chilies, since I was using canned I used 2 7oz cans to make sure I got a lot of the green chili flavor. Also instead of using vegetable oil to fry the potatoes in I used the bacon grease (why let all that flavor go?). My potatoes must have been really big because I had way to many after shredding them. I think 2-3 would have been perfect. Thanks for the recipe I will be making this again!"
