First off, I sauteed everything in a cast iron skillet, meat first, and put that in the slow cooker. 2) I used Tomatillos instead of Tomatoes 3) I cooked the pork tenderloin separately and then I set it aside. I added it at the end of the cooking run for the last hour. Pork tenderloin is much more tender naturally than beef stew meat, so I didn't want to overcook it in the slow cooker for hour and hours."

It’s really good, but not really the New Mexican green chile stew (not as thick and doesn’t have a deep flavor) I was imagining from my childhood. Also, to liven up my meat before adding it to the liquid, I heavily seasoned the corn meal before tossing the meat in it, so it brought out some really good flavor."

I make a fair number of substitutions to this: canned tomatoes if fresh aren’t in my fridge at the moment, venison (if stew meat I try to cook it for 8+ hours in a slow cooker on low, if burger meat it only needs ~2 hours of simmering on the stove top), I’ve also tried adding carrots. Every time this comes out great, despite my various substitutions. The masa harina (I’ve substituted corn meal) gives it a heartier taste so don’t skip that! Excellent recipe."

I doubled up on the pork shoulder, and did not add any beef. We are on a low carb diet, so I used flax meal instead of masa harina. I used chicken stock instead of beef stock, and diced canned tomatoes, drained vs. fresh. Next time, I will try rutabaga as a potato substitute."

Stick with pork, don't waste beef tenderloin in this, replace the cumin with chile powder or ancho chile powder. Cumin has NO place in authentic NM food. The masa adds a unique flavor that wheat flour cannot duplicate; don't make that substitution. Most of all, enjoy this tasty NM dish!"

"reviewBody": "This is a STEW! Why would you want to use an expensive cut of meat like a beef tenderloin in a crock pot. OMG! I live in Albuquerque, born and raised and any lesser cut would work just fine! We never put beef in our Green Chile Stew just pork! Do use the masa, it adds depth to the stew and remember if you are not from around this part of the country that if you have fresh green chili that you need to roast it first. There are several ways to do it: You can put it on a pan and broil it, turning it when each side gets black and blistered. You can put it on your outside grill, or my preferred method for just a few chilis at a time, I roast them on the top of my gas range. After blistering the skin, put them into a large resealable bag and let them steam for about 15 minutes then peel off the charred outer skin. To tell if your chili is hot, look at the stem end. The more points it has, the hotter it is. If you don't want you chili hot remove the stems and seeds. Enjoy!"

What I did differently was, I left out the beef and doubled the pork (we didn't have any beef on hand), I substituted whole wheat flour for the masa harina, used sweet yellow onions instead of red (my husband's preference), and coriander instead of cilantro. One thing I did also was substitute a rutabega for the potato, in order to cut the carbohydrate count considerably (we try to watch our starches when we can). This was so wonderful, and even though it may seem like a lot of prep at first glance, was quite easy. We served it to guests on Halloween and they all loved it!"
