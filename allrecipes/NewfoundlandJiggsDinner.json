"reviewBody": "Best meal ever! I only do this at Christmas when I also cook a turkey (slow roasted overnight in the oven) with Newfie dressing - not stuffing. They are two different things. I agree with previous reviews - keep the liquor water (or broth as mainlanders would call it) to flavor your gravy. I don't dumplings, but add parsnip for my mom and brother. Even my daughter who was born on the mainland has official declared she's a \"Salt Beef Junkie\" (is a song from Newfoundland and she loves her salt beef...as do I). I soak the beef for about 2 hours before cooking it, and soak the split peas in the same pot as the beef."

They invited a number of us up to their house for a Jigg's Dinner, which none of us Albertans had heard of. Well to tell you, that was one of the best meals I have ever had. We didn't have the dumplings but the peas pudding was out of this world as was the way the meat and vegetables were good. Looking forward to having another one."

My main difference was winging it with the corn beef brisket(you can'r get riblets here)and the peas pudding...but both came out okay, if not a little overcooked with the salt beef.Doing it up again for Christmas dinner as I type this. \nYou need to add the recipe for Newfoundland Dressing...Mount Scio Savory, bread crumbs and a little onion. Great stuff."

If its not too salty or fatty, I'll also drink a cup of the liquor with my meal. (like soup... it has all the vitamins. You'll crave it once you do it.) and like someone else stated on here... if you also cook a chicken/turkey and add the liquor to the gravy... its insanely delicious. OR save the liquor for the next time you're making turkey soup. DON'T WASTE THE LIQUOR!!!!!"

I boil it for about 20 minuts first. drain about half the water and keep a cup or two of the salted water, just in case the dinner gets too \"fresh\". Also instead of making dumplings I make blueberry duff. Always a big hit."

I can't get enough of the pease pudding and salt beef...always my favourite.\nNOTES: Salt beef = aka: cured naval beef, you can sometimes buy it in bulk where you can pick and choose your beef rather than buying a bucket that is often very fatty. If you come across a Newfoundland store, just ask the owners (they usually have the bulk beef in the \"back\"..they're not really supposed to advertise/sell it in bulk due to new regulations).\n\nOther than that....eat it up, it's some good 'by!"

"reviewBody": "I love this recipe but there is one thing that I do differently. When making peas pudding I always hated cleaning the bag afterwards so instead I use a mason jar. Fill jar about 1 third to 1 half full.(The more people that you are cooking for the bigger the mason jar) Poke about 8-10 holes in the lid with a sharp knife. ( be very careful when doing this and remember to keep the lid so you will only have to do this once) Tie a string around the bottle just under the lid and tie the other end to the handle of your pot for easy removal. After it has boiled with the meat and it is time to start adding vegtables, carefully take the bottle out of the water and let sit until veggies are almost cooked. before removing lid drain off any excess water through the holes in the lid, then just dump peas into bowl and season with butter and pepper. Clean up is so much easier, just rinse jar and put in dishwasher or clean with warm soapy water and a bottle brush."

Although corned beef is completely different than salt beef, it's also completely tasty and can be used in the dinner instead if desired, although this makes it more English/Irish than Newfoundlander.\n\nI also had a hard time even finding corned beef, but eventually I did find some at a specialty meat market."

Corned beef is a completely different product, with spices and a different taste. Allrecipes changed the recipe when I submitted it, they probably thought it was the same thing and it isn't. Also, it's probably best to keep the potatoes whole, or halved of they're large otherwise they'll end up boiling away to nothing. Happy eating!"
