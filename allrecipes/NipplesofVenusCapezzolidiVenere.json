"reviewBody": "These came out great until the white chocolate phase. I made the mistake of going to a market that although had high grade bar chocolate there was no white. So to anyone who makes this recipe DO NOT use the Nestles White Chocolate Bits. They don't work despite what the video says. They melt to a degree where it doesn't become fluid. What you get is a consistency of cake frosting. So get the good grade bar chocolate. I also took a look at chestnuts on Amzon and thought they were too expensive. I purchased chestnuts in the store, scored them, soaked them in boiling water and roasted them in the oven. much cheaper and as a side note use something like a small espresso spoon to remove any nut meat that doesn't slip out. Oddly enough one would think any store that sells chestnuts would sell white bar chocolate but alas no. So happily I popped these back in the fride, went out and found the proper white chocolate and was very pleased with theresults."
