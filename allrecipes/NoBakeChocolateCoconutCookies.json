She said this recipe is similar to candymaking in that you have to melt the sugar or we would have a grainy loose (but still delicious) mess instead of cookies. I use butter instead of margarine, as well. Another tip I use: Press the mixture into a pan and refrigerate, then cut into bars. Saves alot of time. I also use this recipe as a \"crust\" for ice cream cakes."

I remembered my mom uses to make these kinds if cookies all the time when I was a kid so I wanted to do the same for my kids. I had no recipe and had to find one. I read the reviews for this one and the changes people made. So I gave it a go. They turned out so good they are now officially the family favorite. The only thing i did different is change the margerine for butter. And added maybe a 1/4 more coconut then it asked for cause well, we love coconut. They turned out perfect each time and this is now the third time. Also I read some let the butter melt before adding other stuff to saucepan. I did the same and it worked great. Good luck to all who try! Thanks for the great recipe! Its a major hit"

"reviewBody": "I just made these and they came out amazing! I only have unsalted butter on hand, so I used that instead of margarine. I also cut the Sugar by half a cup because I don't have that much of a sweet tooth. They are plenty sweet for me! I didn't read other reviews about the boiling time, but I cooked mine on a medium heat until it was runny and it seemed that the sugar had fully dissolved. I also used Quick cook oats like the recipe specifies. Mine are not grainy nor are they crumbly; they are perfect! I want to try making these again with coconut oil instead of margarine to see if that will help with the hardening process. I had to set mine in the freezer for about 20 minutes before they were firm and would stay together."

This isn't the recipe that I remember from when I was young, the chocolate flavor is a bit too intense, so much so that I can barely taste the coconut. It's a good recipe, but not exactly what I was looking for."

It made about 32 cookies. SO EASY and delicious! My husband loves the chocolate and coconut combo and thought they were excellent. I'm thinking about doing these for a Christmas cookie swap but not sure if they store well."

"reviewBody": "I added 2 cups coconut and 1/2 cup peanut butter. The trick to knowing when the boiling is done is the way my Momma used to do it. Take a glass of cold tap water And after a couple of minutes boiling use the spoon and let a drop of the sauce fall to the bottom of the glass. If it looks like a tadpole it is called a soft boil and it is ready. Too early and it will splatter. Perfect cookies using that method. Also I never go above medium heat. Patience will make them perfect. Oh yes...and I always add 1Tsp of Vanilla!!!"

Using the following: 2 c. quick oats + 1 c. cold milled flax seed, 1 1/2 c. white sugar (reduced), 1 1/2c long coconut (increased), 1/2c. cocoa, 1/c. butter, 1 1/4c. milk (increased/I used almond milk). I followed the same directions. The cookie is still very sweet, possibly tasting slightly more dark chocolate flavour. Delicious results."

"reviewBody": "Craving killer! Great variation of my mom's recipe. I used this as a base recipe and heeded previous reviews. Having only two to cook for, I halved the recipe- I know these cookies tend to dry out, so I didn't want a ton of leftovers. I also halved the sugar as I know too much sugar in these cookies makes a grainy texture horrible for us with sensitive teeth. I added the peanut butter as recommended and doubled the ( sweetened) coconut flakes. I threw in a dash of vanilla flavor. THEY ARE DELICIOUS! Albeit, I believe with the addition of Craisins or another dried fruit, they would go from craving killer to party sensation. This recipe has a great process, which is why I will recommend to everyone! Thank you!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe works although I cut the sugar in half and added a teaspoon of Vanilla and a tablespoon of maple syrup and boil it for about 3-4 minutes. I use regular large flake Oats and a bit more coconut and put it into the pan with the boiling liquid and mix it very thoroughly pressing the oatmeal down as I mix to force the liquid into the oats. I then take out large spoonfuls and press it together with my fingers so it is not loose and place it on the baking pan. This makes about 36 cookies. They dry out over the next 12 hours or so and you get a nice cookie that doesn't fall apart and is a bit crispy without being too chewy. Just leave them in a cookie tin and they last for a long time if nobody knows where they are!"

If you use the wrong oats, or not enough,(I use 4 cups) they do not harden properly.

"reviewBody": "I added an extra cup of coconut for these and used butter instead of margarine... Turned out just like Mom's! Without the extra coconut these would have been too runny, I think.\n\nAlso, a tip... It's VITAL that you let the butter, sugar &amp; coconut cook together until totally smooth. If you rush it, your cookies will turn out grainy &amp; crumbly. They need cook cook together at a BOIL for at least 2 min. You'll know its ready when the mixture is completely, silky smooth. Also-- stir constantly. The sugar will burn if you stop stirring while cooking, giving your cookies a burnt, icky taste. DON'T STOP STIRRING!"
