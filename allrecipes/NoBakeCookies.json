Turned out great. Used an 8X8 inch cake pan. Will definitely be making more in the near future. Thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "ive made these for decades except i use 2 cups of sugar. Its a great basic recipe. Use crunchy or smooth peanut butter. Old fashioned oats will make them chewier if you prefer that, you can add whatever you want to it. Dried fruit, raisins, other chopped nuts, anything you get the whim to add. A couple packages of the flavored microwave oatmeal substituted for and equal amount of the other can make a new twist too. We tried 2 packs of apple cinnamon once and it was pretty good. Chopped candied pecans mixed in are REAL good. It's a fun recipe to play with, especially if you have a little one that always wants to do something in the kitchen."

Bit she used to use a cold cup of water and make it for a ball on the bottom of the cup to know when it was ready to start with the other ingredients. But I could never get mine like hers, so I played around lots of times trying to get them just right and I found if I let it Boil 5 minutes and turn it off the heat and finish the other ingredients it works just fine. I hope this helps others who are having trouble getting it just right."

I also sprinkled dairy free chocolate chips on top after letting them cool a little. After I mixed all the ingredients, I poured them in a separate cool bowl so they would start cooling down. I also packed them in the cookie scoop so they would keep their shape. These came out perfect!"

I've been making these for almost 50 years(!) and my recipe calls for 2 cups of sugar, not 1 3/4. There is not enough liquid volume to coat the dry ingredients, therefore they crumble. Try making them with 2 cups of sugar and boil for exactly one minute, then they should turn out just fine. Also, you can add an extra tablespoon of cocoa, if you wish. These are one of my family's favorites!"

Next time I will start by melting the butter then the milk and sure then vanilla instead of all the ingredients at once. I turned off heat, melted the peanut butter with the liquid hot mix before adding the oats. I added about an extra half cup of oats and my cookies turned out great. They set almost immediately."

Especially the boiling of the boiling of the chocolate. 90 seconds. That's it."

Every time I follow this recipe to a T, cooking at a rolling boil for 1 1/2 minutes, they turn out perfectly.?? I also have the peanut butter and oats and vanilla measured and ready to go when I pull it off the stove.?"

I did also make sure to have the oat mixture already mixed and ready to go in a large mixing bowl.... that helps the cookies and process also... :) thanks for sharing!"
