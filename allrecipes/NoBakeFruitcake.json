"reviewBody": "My mother used to make this only using graham crackers. I didn’t care for them but the rest was good. I started hunting for a recipe and found this one. I made it; however, after reading a number of comments about it turning out sticky, I decided to skip the coconut milk. It turned out pretty dry but I packed it 2 loaf pans and refrigerated them. When I tried cutting one, it was pretty crumbly. After thinking about it for a while, I decided since it wasn’t cooked, I could “deloaf” it back into a large mixing bowl and added 1/2 the can of coconut milk. I blended it and kept turning it so all would be moistened. I also added a small tub of candied orange peel. I packed and mashed it all back into the loaf pans and have refrigerated it. I think the instructions should be changed to 1/2 cup of coconut milk. An optional amount of candied orange peel would be a nice added touch!"

No actual coconut milk. I used maraschino cherry juice in place of the coconut milk. I molded mine into a bundt pan which I sprayed with coconut oil spray. Fingers crossed it slides out in one piece."

Other than that the recipe is the same. We make it a couple of weeks ahead so it can age. It’s so good, more like candy than a cake."

"reviewBody": "Omitting the coconut milk will solve the 'too soft to cut' issue and the fresh/frozen coconut provide ample coconut flavor. My Grandmother and aunts made this cake annually for Christmas, packing the cake in small narrow boxes lined with foil to reserve moistness. Slicing thinly is imperative as it is rich and makes the cake last longer if you can stay out of it, lol."

"reviewBody": "I must give this recipe 5 starts for its wonderful taste. However, it sure comes out looking as something other than a loaf of fruitcake: it's gooey, and that aspect may turn some people off (like it did my husband). I think I'll try adding some more crushed Nilla wafers to it to try and firm it up more. Again, as to the taste, one can't stop eating."

"reviewBody": "This was a great, quick to prepare recipe. However, instead of putting it in a pan, next time I'm going to make drop cookies out of it, using a small ice cream scoop and putting on a waxed paper lined platter. My family didn't think it would taste good because it looks dreadful when done, but it went over great. It made two loaf pans full. I was able to send some home to guests. Some of my family doesn't like fruitcake, but they liked this recipe. Only a tiny bit is now left for my husband to enjoy. I, alas, have diabetes and can't eat this. It is best to let this sit in refrigerator overnight for more flavor."
