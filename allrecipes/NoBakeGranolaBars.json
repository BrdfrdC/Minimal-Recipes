I was worried about wasting all that flax seed, but very happy with the result.\nI did exclude the chocolate and didn’t have the fruit, only used about 2/3 c honey to save a few calories- this was still quite sweet for all here. \nNext time I’ll mix in a little extra PB, raisins, sunflower seeds and crispy rice cereal after looking at another recipe. Thanks!"

Easy recipe to alter the mix-ins and change up as you see fit!\n\nI have made them as written, ditching the Craisins, adding extra chopped nuts, adding rice Krispies, adding mini M&amp;Ms, endless possibilities.\n\nUSE A HEAVY SPOON FOR MIXING, THEY ARE VERY DENSE. \n\nTo make it easier, I roll mine out between two sheets of WAX PAPER using a rolling pin instead of pressing into a pan. Easy clean up! (And you get to pick at the edge pieces as you cut them to shape )\n\nI like to sprinkle a few m&amp;m minis on top for the kiddos, but my batch gets extra nuts and craisins. Such a good recipe. Thank you!"

The recipe is wonderful as is, quick and easy to prepare, so portable and most importantly, totally yummy! I’ve found a few small changes work well for us which I feel allows me to include a little more nutrition which is to substitute 1/2 cup of the flaxseed with 1/4 cup of chia seeds and 1/4 cup of hemp hearts. Everyone I’ve shared these bars with, either the original or with the changes, has gone ga-ga for them. Thanks so much for a super recipe!"

"reviewBody": "These bars exceeded my expectations! I can’t stop eating them. I have allergies to peanut butter, nuts and soy, so I made my bars with “SunButter”brand sunflower butter which tastes just like peanut butter. For the chocolate chips, I used mini semi-sweet chips made by “Enjoy life” (these chips don’t have soy in them). Also, I thought I’d try using some baking cranberries that were already Julienne cut instead of whole Craisins. The recipe turned out well. For my next batch, I might even add some roasted sunflower seeds since I can’t eat nuts. I liked that these were super easy to make. Thank you for such a great recipe!"

I had about a cup of homemade almond butter that I used to replace a cup of the regular peanut butter and I added about a tablespoon of Chia seeds for extra crunch. I also used half agave nectar and half honey in the recipe. As several others stated, these are very compact and filling so I actually got 40 bars out of one 9 x 13 pan. For those of you doing Weight Watchers, as I am, the points are daunting for a total amount for the pan but they come out to five points for each bar if cut into 40 bars."

"reviewBody": "This is a very flexible recipe, so long as the consistency is proper with right amount of moisture. I needed a nut-free version to put in my kids' school lunches, so I made the following changes for my first pass at this: I halved the recipe; I used sunflower butter and no peanut butter; I added: flaked coconut, some chia seeds, sunflower seeds, and (because I had no chocolate chips on hand!), a few crunched up kit kat rectangles for chocolate and crunch. I also put the mixture into small silicone molds, and baked 8-10 minutes at 375 degrees. My kids (and husband) loved them. \n\nNext time, I am going to add chopped up dried apricot or raisins. Based on how these came out, I think you can throw in whatever your family likes, just make sure you have enough (but not too much) honey and peanut/sunflower butter for moisture, but not too wet. I found the consistency should be akin to a chocolate chip cookie batter before you cook it! Enjoy!"

The mixture of flavors works well and you can be creative with what you have on hand. I didn't have chocolate chips so used peanut butter chips, and chopped walnuts instead of almonds. I think next time I will cut the flax in half. 1 cup = 48 tsp which I split into 24 bars but still could be halved. Individually wrapped in saran wrap and keep a few in the fridge for quick snack and the rest in the freezer where it's keeping well."

I have switched out various nuts, like pecans, pumpkins seeds work great. I have also added different chips such as butter scotch, salted Carmel, heath slivers mixed with the chocolate to make the 1/2 cup. A real nice twist is to use 1 cup crunchy peanut butter and 1/4 cup of hazelnut nutella... yummie! I typically do not use a full cup of flaxseed and the texture is still great. I too cut them into small 1 inch squares as they are jam-packed with lots of good stuff! Fun to experiment with different combinations of ingredients."

I also did what another reviewer did and in place of honey used brown sugar and syrup. I microwaved the corn syrup, brown sugar and peanut butter before adding the dry ingredients to make it easier to mix. No cranberries so added honey roasted peanuts. Also added a touch of vanilla extract to the microwaved ingredients. I didn't add the almonds either. The mix was a little wet so ended up added just a bit more oats. Turned out pretty good!"

To mine, I added whey protein powder, chia seeds, and used powdered peanut butter instead of regular peanut butter. I wanted to cut way down on fat and calories thus allowing for the few additions without going crazy on those added calories. My batch made 22 bars and they are thick bars too. Thanks for sharing your recipe. Its one I'm going to make many more times."

To push it down into the pan, I got on a chair to give myself more leverage so I could really pack it down. After I cut and wrapped them, I kept them in the fridge. I've made them for my family two weeks in a row now and they keep disappearing! Very delicious."

I love how the flaxseed makes them healthier than your average granola bar. \n\nHere are some of the changes I have sometimes made:\n~Trade Craisins for raisins\n~Trade honey for maple syrup\n~Omit the nuts (only if already using crunchy PB)\n~Use creamy PB and add nuts\n~Omit chocolate chips (if I don't want them too sweet)\n~Add coconut flakes\n~Add pumpkin spices in the fall (MMM!)\n\nWe LOVE these! My husband rarely eats breakfast, and when I started making these, he said, \"I'd eat THESE for breakfast!\" He regularly requests them, and we love eating them after working out or just as a snack. If you are questioning making them, don't hesitate! Just go for it!"

It didnt taste bad, but wasnt quite chewy as others I have tried of copycats of the store bought Quaker granola bars. I sort of like oatmeal cooked or mixed with the hot syrup. The raw oatmeal taste can be sort of chalky. I would recommend this type of granola bar recipe more for a person on a raw foods type diet. I used mini chocolate chips, chopped dried sweet cherries, and finely chopped almonds. Main issue I had though was it coming together easily. It was sort of sticky. I finally opted to shape them individually in snack bags scooping an even amount into each bag. I got 5 large bars and from the appearance it seemed to do the trick. Overnight, they seemed to hold together into the shape I made them in. I used a sharp knife and cut them in half in the morning. It made 10 approximately 2-3\" bars at 164 calories each according to on-line calculations."

Not low-cal, but for a \"meal\", not bad. I like the high fiber and protein content, and the taste is good, too. I made them as stated, but heated the ingredients in the MWO to make stirring easier (still a JOB!) Because the mix was warm &amp; I used mini chips, they melted into the batter, but the taste was good anyway. I'll try regular sized chips next batch. I froze some, and they were just like fresh when thawed. I packed them a little too hard in the pan, so will go a little lighter next time, so they're softer to eat.
