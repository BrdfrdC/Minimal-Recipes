I used sugar free lime jello and used 12 ounces of made crystal light lemonade. I also used sugar free cool whip. Also used 2 pkgs cream cheese.\nCool liquid before adding to cream cheese, blend with electric mixer, add cool whip and fold. I only used 3/4 of the cool whip. Texture was great and stayed firm. Best to refrigerate overnight, If you like tangy it is great."

When I added the cream cheese into the boiling mixture it began to form into little clumps so I quickly attacked them with my immersion blender to smooth them out. I did let the mix cool before adding the whipped topping and it blended well. I use a graham cracker crust and limeade for the pie. I did freeze the pie and it turned out perfect. The first bite will be a little tart but you'll be going back for more."

Once the gelatin mixture is firm, then mix in the cream cheese, followed with folding in the whipped topping. I also think I might make it in a graham cracker or cookie crust instead of the traditional pie shell. (Even though I haven't tried it yet, I'm rating it a 4-star for simplicity.) I'll let you know what happens."

I would actually say to use your mixer to whip the softened cream cheese, then gradually add the jello/limeade. I would also leave out at least 4 oz of the limeade concentrate. I'm so mad that I wasted the ingredients. I'm actually going to try to take the filling out and mix in another pkg of cream cheese so that I can eat it, I don't want to throw it away."

"reviewBody": "The flavor of this was great! I read the reviews and let the limeade/jell-o/cream cheese mixture cool completely before adding the Cool Whip, but it still didn't firm up in the refrigerator. I made a few \"tester\" mini pies and put them in the fridge and freezer at the same time so I could tell/taste when they were ready. The frozen pie was ready in about 2-3 hours, and was a great texture straight out of the freezer. The refrigerated pie sat all day and overnight, and was barely firm enough to hold its shape but was too goopy...kind of like pudding. I liked it with the limeade but would cut back next time on the concentrate because it was pretty tart (my husband and I liked it but like sour sweets). It's still great right out of the freezer, I'll make it again!"

I read in other reviews not to add the whip cream until after it cooled, but of course, didn't read this until it was too late. Mine turned out runny with little lumps and I had to put it in the freezer for it to even firm up. Tasted awful!"

I did allow the mixture to cool before adding the cool whip like a previous poster sugggested, and it stayed in the fridge for several hours before I tried serving it, but I guess that wasn't enough to fix the problem. We tried freezing the pie for an hour, but even then it was still a bit runny. Everyone loved the taste, though - so I guess I'll just have to serve it frozen solid in the future!"
