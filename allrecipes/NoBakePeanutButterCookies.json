Also, I used 1 cup brown sugar and about 1 1/4 white. As a side note, these make fantastic dog treats being as how there are many alterations you can make and still have them come out delicious.

I, like others who's reviews I read before fixing them for the first time, only used 2C of sugar and they were plenty sweet. I did not use the quick oats either, I used regular old fashioned oats and they were very good. I didn't drop on paper either, I greased a 9x13\" pan and pressed into pan ever so gently as not to compact them too tightly. Do yourself a favor and make these, you'll never fix chocolate no bakes again!!!!!!! Thank you for sharing the recipe :)"
