Just use chocolate chips.\nUpdate: I made it a second time, but with slight changed to the recipe.\nAs I last said, I didn't use the chocolate chips or almond flakes.\nI substituted olive oil (last time it had a bit of an olive oil taste) with coconut oil (equal amount), and added a bit of water, maybe about a tablespoon.\nThis drastically improved the recipe. I would pair it with whipped cream, ice cream, and add chocolate chips if I had any of those, but with the changes I made it tasted way better!"
