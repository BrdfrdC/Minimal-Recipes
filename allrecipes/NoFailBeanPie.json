Perhaps add 1 cup, taste and add sugar until your personal sweet level is reached. The grated nutmeg is lovely. I thought the 2 tablespoons of vanilla would be too much, but it was perfect. I will make again."

Donâ€™t think I will use the almond extract next time for this recipe it was a bit overpowering and will use brown sugar instead. Even still it was perfect."

It was delicious! All the little kids in the family love it too. It doesnâ€™t have that darker brown color you normally see when people sell bean pies in the street (maybe those have some dark brown sugar) but the taste is phenomenal. This will be part of or rotation now."

I followed some user tips and my own tweaks 2 1/4 cup white sugar and 1 tblsp brown sugar, baked at 350 for 1h 10m. The pies turned out great after they settled. I used a blender to mix the ingredients DONT OVER PULSE. The batter will be a bit loose but will bake up great. The next day they are even better, the color deepens and the flavor is awesome. Who knew you could turn beans into a delicious dessert, gonna add a little whip topping and next time use the egg whites as a little merguie."

It tastes like a cross between a Chess pie and a sweet potato pie. Custard like sweet and flavorful through and through. My 2 year old even asked for 2nds and he is super picky! If he knew Navy Beans were the main ingredient he probably would run! Lol thanks for the experience!! Wonderful!"

"reviewBody": "I followed the recipe to my personal taste. I like pretty much all my pies sweet except pies with meat or without berries. When I made this I followed the recipe I found but added more vanilla, sugar, butter, and even added brown sugar to the recipe. What I got was so scrumptious before I put it in the oven...I was so excited. Now I have the pie setting and cooling off. I made this pie from scratch. The crust was from flour, brown sugar, and butter. Wow! This crust is so good! I'm excited about this pie. Oh and I soaked the beans over night. Then I got a huge cheesecloth and cover the inside pot with the cloth. I then put the beans in the middle and folded the cheesecloth. I poured water around the inside of the pot and boiled the beans for a few hours. I smashed the beans a few times. Having the cheesecloth prevented the beans from burning and it kept the beans moist. I would recommend using cheesecloth."

I only used 1 3/4 cups of sugar, I used dried great northern beans (let them soak all day), I used a premade graham cracker crust, and I used my vitamix. It was so creamy and sweet and delicious!! Would never be able to tell I used beans, because it does not taste like beans at all. I love the cinnamony taste!! Excellent recipe!!"

"reviewBody": "This is my first time I made the Traditional Navy Bean Pie that I was introduced to by the SiStars of the Nation of Islam. I made mine without crust to save myself some calories because I am calorie counting. \n\nThis recipe from allrecipes.com Called \"No Fail Bean Pie\" says that it is 539 calories per serving but I made mine without crust. I save myself 108 calories. 431 for a healthy treat!\n\nThe recipe calls for 2 Tbs of Vanilla - I substituted 1 of those Tbs with 1 Tbs of Maple syrup. I also substituted the canned Navy bean for dried beans which I soaked for a few days. I also made evaporated milk from a powder form.\n\nIt tastes close to what I'm used to in a bean pie. Although, I would like a creamier texture.\n\nI broke the last blender we had right in the middle of making this recipe! .\n\nSo if anyone has a food processor or heavy duty blender that that don't Love anymore I'll Love to have One. PLEASE aaaaand Thank You!"

This pie has minimal flavor, is not dense enough to be bean pie, and unfortunately the recipe makes two pies that I had to toss into the trash. I will keep looking for the actual bean pie recipe or create one myself. This recipe was extremely disappointing given the 5 start rating that it has. What a waste of ingredients."

"reviewBody": "To call this a traditional Muslim dish, it might be best to specify the vanilla extract must be alcohol free. That said, I made this as directed and with the frozen pie crusts in the foil pans. I think the bean mixture could have used twice as much time in the food processor (I kept getting bits of bean skin that was texturally distracting) and they got rather dark after the first 15 minutes at 450. I would suggest that you bake in the bottom third of the oven or use a pie shield/foil wrap the crust. The pie has a nice flavor and a very curious texture."

As others have said, they were tan in color but, I turned the oven on 400 for the last 20 mins and they were nice and brown. The next time I will cook on 350 for the hour and ten mins as suggested. One person was correct, after refrigerated over night, they taste better and the color is then the rich brown we're used to. So easy! I will make it again. Thanks for sharing."

We use to get bean pies in the city of Baltimore but we now live an hour away so I was looking to try to make my own and this recipe is perfect. People think a \"bean pie\" does not sound like it would be good and are always pleasanytly surprised when they try it. I usually say it is similar to a sweet potato pie. If you like sweet potato pie you will probably like this recipe. Great with a little whipped cream or cool whip. Thanks for posting."

I would substitute a homemade crust for the ready-made crust to keep with the tradition and roots of this dish. An additional of brown sugar with the white sugar would result in a richer, darker color and taste. Additionally, make sure to use a vanilla extract that does not contain alcohol! Well done."
