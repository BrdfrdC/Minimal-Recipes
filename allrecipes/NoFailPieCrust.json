The flavor and flakiness was good. I’ll definite make it again."

It makes a very soft dough so I divide in half and refrigerate for several hours taking out each piece separately to roll out. As it warms up it becomes a bit soft so I work fast. It makes. Wonder flaky crust that browns nicely. I usually brush pie top with a beaten egg yolk and a bit of water and sprinkle top with sugar or cinnamon sugar depending on the pie."

I use Crisco shortening, but I substitue part of shortening with softened real dairy unsalted butter because it tastes better than the flavored stuff. In addition, I use a circular zippered clear plastic case to roll the crust as thinly as I can without it losing its integrity. Wax paper works also, but the thinner crust bakes to perfection and helps the waistline. I also brush the crust with milk using a pastry brush. An unused chip brush for painting works also."

With that change, I think this is my new favorite. My previous favorite has been a similar recipe that I've made for years, but is a five-crust recipe. This recipe is great to make a one or two crust pie now and then have only one or two to freeze for the future."

"reviewBody": "I'd almost given up baking pies and resorted to the refrigerated crusts for years as I couldn't replicate my grandmother's flaky crusts. Tried this one on a lark and am hooked. Haven't had pie crust this flaky anywhere since my grandmother quit making pies over 40 years ago. This one's a keeper. Even the bottom crust of fruit pie was flaky and my non-pie loving husband came back for more."

"reviewBody": "This pie crust was perfect and simple. Only suggestion is not to use an extra large egg. I made pies at home with a large size egg and the crust turned out flaky and was perfect for slicing. When I used an extra large egg, it turned out too mushy and was not suitable for rolling out. One other suggestion is that I was able to roll out the dough (with the large size egg) between two sheets of waxed paper. Using the waxed paper prevents from having to flour the surface where you are rolling the dough, so dough does not get so tough or dry."

"reviewBody": "Came out badly, did not roll out well &amp; mult. cracks &amp; tears! Very disappointing. I followed all instructions and hints. Used Crisco butter flavor, tho1 cup seemed excessive; It felt fine until kneading, then it seemed not enough flour in mix. Maybe water was too cold, or not enough water - latter is diagnosis according to cooking site &amp; book. I've never made such a torn up ugly crust + not big enough for the dish! I'm known for excellent hand made pie crust &amp; pies, so this is a real setback. Also think, if you are using an acid, orange juice or tangerine would make crust taste better than white vinegar. I used the 1 tsp. of salt as many suggested. Searching for new pie crust recipe again!"

I used butter instead of shortening ( I didn't have any on hand, and I saw other crust recipes that used butter instead) it was also a bit sticky for me (I've read that it shouldn't be, if it's too sticky, not enough flour) I added about 1/4 cup while mixing and it worked perfectly."

"reviewBody": "Made a scratch blueberry pie using this crust. Now, I cooked for years, and the only use for my pie crust was resolving flip flops. it was leathery and solid. My pie was incredibly delicious. My wife, the ex cook, and my in-laws almost passed out it was so good!! I used coconut oil as shortening along with all organic flour eggs and vinegar. it was light, short, and wonderfully crisp. Tomorrow, I'm making chicken pot pies with it. expecting a marvelous experience. Took a whole fifteen minutes to make four crusts (not rolled yet). And tools all rinse clean for the dishwasher!! If there were ten stars, I'd use them all."

I read the reviews that said the dough wasn't elastic or didn't roll out right. I didn't even try to roll this dough out because I had a (I thought) brilliant Idea! Since I was making a pumpkin and sweet potato pie that needed no top crust, I just took the dough, molded it into the bottom of my pie pans, covered with cling wrap, and refrigerated until I was ready to fill and bake. It was SO easy and really good! I recommend trying it this way."
