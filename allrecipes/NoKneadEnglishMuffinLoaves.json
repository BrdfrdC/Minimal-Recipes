I scooped it into the pans and crossed my fingers. Turned out good with nice nooks and crannies. Will make again."

"reviewBody": "Very nice toasted and for breakfast. I guess it's the baking soda that puts the holes in the bread. Really easy, and because I made very small loaves ended up with 3 of them. I'm freezing two of them for when I don't feel like making bread. Didn't have any issues with the dough being too sticky or not sticky enough. I did roll in corn meal before baking just to make them a tad more English muffin-y. Thanks for the recipe!"
