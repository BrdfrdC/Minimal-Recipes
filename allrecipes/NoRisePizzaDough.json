Some of these are ridiculous. ‚ÄúI only used half of the dough and put it on a large sheet and it hard.‚Äù ‚Äú This (quick no rise) recipe needs work. First you should let it rise. Second, I like more salt and garlic in mine, so I‚Äôm gonna take away a star for that too. Oh, and I like honey too. (Deducts an star) And now that it is no longer a quick dough you can throw together on a busy night, it needs to be rolled after you make it exactly to my preferences so no star for that either. Bake it exactly as written if you‚Äôre going to add a review. Or add what you like because you are, in theory, a capable grown adult. However, you sound ridiculous when you leave a review saying it was terrible after you‚Äôve changed everything or missed the entire point of a recipe."

Extra salt and sugar make this a top shelf dough. Same goes with sauce BTW. \n\nToss 1 tsp or more thyme in either or both to make thyme appropriate (most) pizzas waaay better. Think about garlic butter and cheese croutons inside a rolled crust, too :). Ok I'm done suggesting ways to get to carb heaven haha."

Poked holes with fork into the dough to prevent bubbles. I did two bakes. The first was for 12 minutes at 400¬∞ F. Brushed bacon fat on top of partly baked \"dough\", to prevent the sauce, toppings from making the crust soggy. Brushed bacon fat on top edges for a nice brown colour for the crust \"handles\". Laid toppings. Baked a further 25 minutes. Cooled on a rack. Can you tell we like a thin, crispy crust? ??"

I followed the recipe as is and get pizza in under an hour instead a few hours. To do a thin crust pizza, I split the dough in half for a 13‚Äù pan."

I rolled it out and it looked very thin but it raised thicker when it cooked and had a tough time getting done. Do, roll it thin and recommend making two separate pizzas if you need more pizza rather than trying a jelly roll pan! We heated the stove top center grill and browned the bottom of the middle pieces, they browned nicely! A good and easy recipe. Thanks!"

I am sure a more complex pizza crust is much better. This is more dense. But when the kids are crying for food, there's no time for pizza crust to rise. With the kitchen-aid mixer, this couldn't be easier, so I will definitely make it again."

"reviewBody": "I let the dough rest for 30 mins after it comes together. Then I gently knead it adding flour to my hands and surface ( I use an old cotton pillow case.) until it is smooth and elastic. Half is put into a Pam sprayed container and frozen. The only changes were to increase water temp to 115 to 120 degrees and add 1 TBLSP extra water. This will leave less flour in the bowl. The temp increase is ok because you are adding the yeast to the flour mixture not the water. Thanks a lot for the recipe. We now have pizza every Friday night. No allergy worries with home made pizza!"
