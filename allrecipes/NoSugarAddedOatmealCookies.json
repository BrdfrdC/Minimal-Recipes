The pictures shown dont do the end result justice. If you shape them with your hands and press them round they look great! In other reviews they mention rubbery... They are dense cookies but they taste great and they are sin free! \ncheers! enjoy! make em youll love em!"

I added two small boiled sweet potatoes, nutmeg, zest of a tangerine and 1/4 cup of 50% less sugar dried cranberries. I may try adding chopped prunes or dates the next time."

I was looking for some vegan cookie recipes and was very glad to find this one that listed ingredients that I always have on hand. Thanks to helpful suggestions, made this recipe twice already. The first time I made these with small addition of 1/4 cup brown sugar and used 1 1/2 cups of oats and 1/2 cup of flax seeds, and I kept them in the oven for 10 extra minutes. The cookies were good, soft on the inside, a bit chewy, but since my partner likes his cookies sweeter, I added 1/3 cup of maple syrup the second time and substituted almond milk with orange juice. They came out much tastier with enough sweetness and same soft consistency. Half a batch is already gone. My daughter was helping me make the cookies and she also loved the flavor. Thanks to the author and all reviewer suggestions, will definitely make them again, want to try with chunky peanut butter...."

They came out dry and tasteless (but for a sort of faint, dry, baked banana taste). If I ever made them again (which I won't), I'd maybe increase the apple sauce and leave out the bananas. I did include the optional raisins (thankfully). Because they were so terrible and hating to waste food, I put them in an airtight container in the freezer for later. Thawed, they are now rubbery. I even tried breaking them up in cold milk with artificial sweetener -- possibly they could work as a cold breakfast cereal. Nope. Unfortunately, the remaining ones are going into the trash. Even for diabetic diets, I've tasted better things."

I used reduced fat coconut milk instead of almond milk, I used 2 tsp vanilla and a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon. I added a 1/2 tsp salt as well. I cooked at 350 until the edges started to brown. \n\nThe texture is still very cakey, but not spongy like the original recipe. I find them easier to eat this way."

I added a full cup of dried cranberries. I made sure the bananas were overripe -- soft and perfect. I also made sure the bananas were well blended - no lumps. I doubled the vanilla and cinnamon, too. (Cuz I love those flavors.) These would have been super healthy, but I added a 1/2 cup of mini chocolate bits. (Not that they needed them.) The texture was more like a fruit bread than a cookie which was fine by me. My husband and son liked them, too. Oh yeah. I will be making these again. I think I will add pecan pieces next time!"

"reviewBody": "Have made these twice, and they were much better the second time--actually really good!--so here are my tips to making the best of the recipe.\n1. Make sure the bananas are really ripe. Mine had some brown spots on the fruit under the peel.\n2. I increased the unsweetened apple sauce from 1/3 to 1/2 cup.\n3. Don't stint the raisins--these provide most of the sweetness. I used a cup full.\n4. I also increased the amount of cinnamon, to at least 2 tsps.\n5. I used skim milk rather than almond milk the second time around--no difference that I could detect. \n6. I added a lot of walnuts--at least 1 cup, coarsely chopped--you could add more. To me these are the best part. \n7. When you put the dough on the cookie sheet, flatten them into a cookie shape--the dough does not melt and spread out like other cookie doughs, so the shape you put in is what comes out.\n8. I forgot to grease the cookie sheet but I think it would be a good idea--the cookies do stick a bit.\n\nThese are delicious for breakfast with coffee, and would be great to have handy for a breakfast on the road as required."

"reviewBody": "I think these were great. I took the advice of some of the people that made these and added peanut butter and I did chocolate chips instead of raisins. I only had skim milk and I didn't bother with the cinnamon. I'm not a huge banana fan, so I used a mixer to beat the bananas instead of mashing. Occasionally I still got a lump of banana so next time I will beat them even longer. I made them slightly larger and got 19 of them. I worked up the nutritional info and mine worked out to 3 pts each on weight watchers. They definitely have more of a muffin consistency than a cookie. Now I just have to keep myself from plowing through all 19 of them!"

"reviewBody": "They turned out wonderfully, with thanks to the many intrepid bakers who offered great suggestions and substitutions. Here are some of my own: DRY INGREDIENTS - added 1/2 cup cranberries, 1/2 cup toasted chopped walnuts, 1/3 cup shredded coconut, 2 tbsp ground flax seed, 2 tbsp wheat bran, 1/2 tsp kosher salt AND two tiny packages of Italian \"Vanillin\" powder (brand: Cusina della Nonna). WET INGREDIENTS - one tbsp blossom honey, one tbsp molasses (plus the vanilla extract as per the recipe). TECHNIQUE VARIATIONS - 1. increased oven temperature to 375 degrees F - 2. lined baking sheets with parchment paper - 3. combined wet and dry ingredients in separate bowls - 4. Baked cookies for 21-22 minutes - 5. Yield = 36 cookies. \n\nGave the recipe to some friends, and one highly skeptical friend called and apologized for ever doubting me, as she thought they were fabulous. My second batch turned out better, and I accidentally used a bit less soy milk. Baking them at a higher temperature (375 degrees) for slightly longer, and by adding nuts, coconut, ground flax and wheat bran seems to have made them less bland and lumpen. All I know is that they are the best healthy cookies I've ever made, and I'm grateful to Gene Payne (and all the wonderful reviewers) for this excellent and highly adaptable recipe."
