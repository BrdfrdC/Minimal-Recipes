Added some garlic powder (with nondescript spices) and threw it all together. Didn't read the part where it suggested the kneading and the resting, Also ignored the section where it wanted you to blind bake the crust.... perhaps it would have been less... Dusty? The crust crumbled like shortbread, but hey, it was pizza with loads of cheese, sauce, and cubed ham, could not possibly go wrong, ate the whole thing."

Seems like a great ratio….hope the kids don’t mind i put seasonings lol but thanks for the recipe."

Sometimes I add onion powder, cayenne, or red pepper flakes. Often after rolling out the dough before putting on the sauce I will brush on some melted butter with garlic powder and oregano to give it more flavor. This won’t rise much as it doesn’t have yeast but I’m a thin crust lover most of the time. I love it!"

In the future, if I want pizza I'm either going to make actual dough or buy some at the store. This was pretty much a fail, sorry."

"reviewBody": "I had to make my daughter dinner in a hurry and I thought I’d look up an easy pizza crust. I was very happy with the results. I didn’t have much on hand so I just sprayed the pan with vegetable spray and rolled out the crust and pinched up the sides. I put tomato sauce, some Parmesan cheese, then chili flakes and topped it with shredded cheese and a few big drops of ricotta, which I spread around once it started baking. When it came out of the oven I lightly salted and peppered it. My daughter came back from her room and said I don’t know what you did to that pizza but it was great. She liked the nice thin crust."

I only had to use 1 cup of flour for it to form the dough.\n\nPersonally, I added cheese, alfredo sauce, basil, green onions and crushed red pepper. It was amazing, tasted and looked like something from a restaurant. I definitely recommend this recipe and this is the only pizza dough I will be using."

I use a pizza stone, and pre-bake (with an olive oil and seasoning blend brushed on) for about 10 minutes before adding toppings. After adding toppings, another 20ish minutes - sometimes a brief go under the broiler to crisp the cheese. This one has been added to my permanent, hand written recipe box."

"reviewBody": "I multiplied the recipe by 5 to make a meal for our large family. As I always do, I added a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic, about three teaspoons of dried oregano, a healthy pinch of crushed red pepper, and a bit of extra salt. The dough is easy to make and easy to work with while forming the pizzas. Most of the pizzas we rolled very thin--almost to the point of tearing--and baked for just ten minutes on the second bake. This gave us a very crispy crust. (It was brittle in the thinnest parts.) We liked it, but will probably bake only 5-8 minutes on the second bake next time. We made a couple of pizzas thicker and the result was biscuit-like. I didn't like it as much, but I topped one with a few eggs cracked whole onto the crust (like a breakfast tart w/butter pastry); it was pretty tasty and would probably make a good breakfast pizza. I still prefer a yeast dough, but rolled thin, this is a terrific quick and easy substitute recipe if you cannot eat yeast or don't have it on hand."
