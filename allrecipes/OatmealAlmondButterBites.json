"reviewBody": "These were tasty, but harder to make than similar recipes. I don't have a standup mixer and so used my hands. Mistake! I couldn't get the almond butter to mix very well and so had a lot of other ingredients left over that wouldn't form into balls. I saved it by adding peanut butter and honey to the rest. I think this could be easier by letting the almond butter come to room temperature. Otherwise good!"

"reviewBody": "Loved these little balls of scrumptiousness. This made 27 balls. I did make a couple of changes due to what I had - Nutella instead of almond butter and all chia seeds rather than chia and flax. I'm sure these will be just as good as written. Keeping them in the freezer and grabbing out a couple at a time when I want a treat."
