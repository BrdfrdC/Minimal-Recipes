My daughter accidentally put in an additional 1/2 cup of flour (total 1 3/4 cups) and the cookies came out much better than using 1 1/4 cups of flour (see photo...the smaller cookies were made using the extra flour). Based on some other comments sounds like you may be able to fix this by refrigerating the batter but we think the extra flour cookies tasted better and there was no additional wait time."

"reviewBody": "The perfect cookie, in my mind, has a crisp outside and chewy center. This recipe (with some adjustments) is exactly that! I MADE THEM GLUTEN FREE with fantastic results! Here are the changes I made: I used gfJules all purpose flour (the best hands down!) in the same amount called for in this recipe. I added ½ cup butter flavored Crisco to the butter called for. I also used GF oats, cane sugar, and added the whole bag of butterscotch chips. The rest of the recipe was followed as written. I refrigerated the covered dough for 1+ hours. To bake, I used a 1 tablespoon cookie scoop on Silpat liners, and baked at 350 degrees (my convection oven automatically knocks that down to 325) for 11 minutes. You want to pull them out right as the edges start to hint at turning brown. They will look puffy and under-baked, but they will be perfect. Trust me. Leave them on that hot pan for 5 minutes (set your timer) and then move to a cooling rack. During the initial cool down on the pan, you will see them solidify and continue to darken ever so slightly. This recipe, with my changes, made 70 cookies. Once cooled, they are sturdy enough to pack up without breaking. I will store them in an airtight container on the counter. They are sweet, but not overly so. There is the slightest hint of cinnamon, it’s only a bit of an undertone, but it absolutely takes this cookie to the next level. I wouldn’t add more, but I wouldn’t leave it out."

"reviewBody": "Perfect! Just like mama used to make in the 80s. Instead of butter (which is so expensive where I live), I used a storebought blend of 20% butter/80% margarine. I didn't find the dough too crumbly or dry. The hint to leave them on the sheet longer than normal before moving to a cooling rack was helpful. I made decent sized cookies (rolled them in my hands and then smushed into an oval), and in my oven, I cooked them for about 12+ minutes. Took them out when a few started to brown at the edges. Thank you! :) The kids are very grateful for this recipe, too. ;)"

"reviewBody": "Ok- I messed up the recipe but it ended up being for the best! I added 1/2 cup each of brown, regular and powdered sugar. I accidentally added the powdered sugar and wasn’t sure how it was going to turn out. I ended up adding 2 cups of flour and a teaspoon of cinnamon and 2 cups of butter. I did up cooking one batch thinking I may have to redo the entire batch. They turned out fantastic and soft. No refrigeration needed. I would definitely make again"

"reviewBody": "I made an account just to warn people about these cookies. I have baked 1000 batches of cookies in my life and these are some of the worst. If using a new recipe, I'll come on here, look for a well reviewed one and follow the agreed upon suggestions in the comments. So for this recipe, since I like chewy cookies, I went for the full cup of butter, chilled the dough and did 9 minutes cooking time. I basically had a giant flat cookie in the pan time after time because the amount of butter was way too much. At nine minutes they were not done and required about 5 more minutes. The cookies were very greasy. I didn't see anyone mention the amount of sugar so I went with it against my better judgement, but it is way too much, and I have a major sweet tooth. Butterscotch chips are incredibly sweet as it is, you don't need 1.5 cups of sugar on top of that. I would suggest 1/2 cup white and 1/4 cup brown. This was a waste of ingredients and I urge you not to make them unless you want a sugar-induced headache."

I refrigerated the dough which helped my cookies not flatten. I suggest watching the cookies for the last 2 mins because each of my batches cooked differently. Also, to know when done look at the bottom corner of the cookies and when they begin to turn brown they’re close to being done! Don’t wait for them to “get golden”... it’s all about the edges to get the perfect and chewy cookie"

"reviewBody": "Outstanding cookies! I have been baking for many (MANY!) decades. I have been looking for a 'chip' recipe that uses butter. I almost always put oatmeal in my cookies, and usually use semi-sweet and butterscotch chips combined. \n\nI tried these with just a couple of tweaks based on comments. I used 1 c. (2 sticks) of butter, and increased the flour to 1 1/2 c. Cookies came off the sheet perfectly (let cool 6 minutes before removing to rack) and held their shape perfectly. \n\nThey are moist and chewy and perfect. I left them out, uncovered on counter to see how they were on day #2 and they had not changed at all. Hurray!!\n\nI recommend Guittard's Butterscotch chips for incredible flavor. Head and shoulders above Nestle's and store brands. Made 3 dozen nice-sized cookies using my medium scoop. Neighbors and SIL raved."
