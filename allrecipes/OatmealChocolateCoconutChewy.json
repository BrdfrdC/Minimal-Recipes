I’ve also cut the sugar in half and still come out awesome. I know sounds like a different recipe, but this great recipe allowed me to have a great starting point. Still excellent as is!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe gave me a perfect foundation to tweak to my preference! This says something because it doesn't always work the way I envision it. I substituted 1/2 C of the butter with applesauce; I used whole wheat flour; I used only one C brown sugar and no white sugar (plenty sweet, applesauce helped); I read that someone added a teaspoon of lemon juice to keep the cookies moist, so I tweaked that a bit and added a TBL of lemon juice to the milk (shortcut to buttermilk) and measured my two TBL of milk from there. No nuts in my baked goods. ;-) Also, I have a tendency to over-mix leaving dry cake-like cookies, I was very careful not to do this. They turned out moist and really delicious!"

I took them out at 16, though they were still very soft. As they cool, they harden up quite a bit, and 16 minutes was too long. 12 minutes was perfect for the next batch, but just know they’ll come out of the oven still looking underdone.\n\nAfter reading some people’s came out flat, I refrigerated the dough for an hour first and used parchment paper on the baking sheets. They still flattened some, but they weren’t too thin."

Only difference is I used 1.5 cups mixed mini chocolate chips and heath bits, and a little bit of cocoa powder instead of the 2 cups of chocolate chips recommended. Only because that was all I had left in the pantry. \n\nThese cookies were delicious and I'm sure to make them again with very few changes. However, next time I'll likely cut the recipe in half as I didn't notice ahead of time how much it would make."

Interesting crispy, chewy, and still somehow fluffy texture - maybe due to the coconut addition? I made again and froze some dough balls for later use. Likely to become a family favorite."

Yes, I did use parchment paper as I always do.\nAfter my first batch, I turned down the heat to 350 and added a little more flour, baking powder and chopped butterscotch chips. These came out PERFECT!! The butterscotch picked up the flavor and complimented the rest of the ingredients. Now I would give these 5 stars!"

I added chopped peanuts, chopped pecans, dried cranberries, unsweetened coconut flakes &amp; chocolate chips into 1 cup alternating until the cup is full. The times suggested in the recipe was accurate. This is officially the “my cookie” recipe. My son: oatmeal chocolate chip. This one is mine. Highly recommend this recipe. Thank you to the author."

"reviewBody": "The five-star rating enticed me to make this recipe. It was easy and I didn't mind or think the add-ins were too much. I could see where the recipe could be changed up like many others did by using a mixture of different flours, etc. I also halved the recipe and it still yielded a decent number of cookies. The flavor profile was good. I really think the directions should be modified to clearly state that you need to chill the dough for at least an hour before baking. I would definitely use a smaller scoop as recommended rather than a larger one. Also, keep the cookies on the sheet to cool the recommended 1 minute, but promptly remove after that. I rated a 3 only because I'm not sure I would try this recipe again, but if I did, I would definitely chill the dough to see if I get a better result in the appearance of the cookies."

Actually, used half and half because that's what I had. Only had a cup of semi-sweet chips. Baked in convection mode so reduced heat 25 degrees and baked 8 minutes on bottom shelf and 2 on top and they browned up and were perfectly chewy. I used a small ice cream scoop and ended up with 48 gorgeous cookies. Per Woody's update I will add a little more coconut next time and hopefully will have a whole bag of chips!"

We follow the recipe with the exception of only putting in 1/4 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and 3/4 cup of white chocolate. We also put in about 1/2 cup more oats. We have put in either walnuts, cashews, or pecans, depending on what we had at the time of making them. Amazing."

As for cook time, I changed it to 350 degrees for 12 minutes like what some reviewers have recommended, which I think is perfect because it is crisp outside but still soft inside.

Some mods: Unsweetened coconut; coconut \"extract\" (1t); white chocolate chunks in place of dark chocolate; dried cranberries (1C); sub macadamia nuts; sometimes some Demerara or cane sugar crystals (a bit subtler sweetness) sub equal for white sugar. OK a lot of mods, pick and choose, but the real beauty of this recipe is that it is (as many have noted) both chewy and crispy no matter which mods you choose! Really neat. Who knew?! I always have some dough in the freezer. Thanks."

I did not add the optional salt. Also, I baked them for 10-11 minutes. Overall, I thought they were yummy and had a good consistency. Next time, I will cut the sugar even more since I thought they were plenty sweet, maybe only 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar."
