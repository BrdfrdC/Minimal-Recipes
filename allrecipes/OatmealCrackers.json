"reviewBody": "Great base recipe. I replaced a tsp of the oil with coconut oil and used 2 Tbsp applesauce for part of the moisture. I added water until I got the consistency I wanted. I wanted them plain so I left out any seasoning besides the salt until I had them on the baking sheet. I sprinkled some with cinnamon sugar and some with a little extra salt. To save time, I made the dough yesterday, wrapped it in plastic and refrigerated it overnight. That gave the oats time to soak up the liquid. I brought the dough to mostly room temp before rolling it out a little thinner than 1/4\" between sheets of plastic (keeps my rolling pin and countertop clean. I often save cereal box liners for this), flipping it onto the baking sheet and scoring/seasoning it before baking. I cut mine in long rectangular sticks to use as scoops for yogurt and hummus (mostly). Thankful for this simple but versatile recipe! Far less expensive than boxed crackers and I know exactly what's in them. (c:"

I used 1 tbs of buttermilk plus 4.5 tbs olive oil, a dash of sugar, parsley and seaweed flakes (they add pretty purple and green fleks) and the crackers came out perfect--the buttermilk flavor added that lil extra mfp! They taste better the next day. I will def make these again and try using a bit more salt. These would be great with a seasoned olive oil for dipping!"

They are bland, but I sprinkled stevia and more seasonings on top to give it a nice taste. My biggest issue was just that the flavor wasn't initially there and the dough seemed to need more water. If that was specified originally I think they would have came out a lot better."

If my dough is a bit dry, I knead in a little honey until it's workable. Then I bake them and bring 'em to work! \n\nI tried swapping the oil for applesauce once. The result was kind of like a pita. I will do equal parts applesauce and oil next time."

"reviewBody": "Added a tsp of vanilla, substituted in 1/4 cup applesauce for half the water, and substituted honey for white sugar. This makes a nice slightly sweet cracker but is not truly sweet like a cookie. I rolled all of the dough out in a 10x15 inch pan and cut lines every inch going both directions to make 1 inch squares. This seemed to be just about the right thickness and easy to break into tiny crackers. Baked 15 minutes until crispy, but in retrospect I think they might have been better a little softer. My 1 year old likes them a lot. We use them as rewards for potty-training."

I took the advice of some reviewers and added a little more cinnamon and a little more sugar. I also topped them with a little cinnamon sugar, but I think I would not have been necessary. My kids like them, and I like that they are whole grain and not too sugary."

I used cracked black pepper instead of cinnamon and used cookie cutters shaped like a turkey instead of just rolling them out. I like them but next time I will probably double the amount of spice I used but all in all a good basic recipe to add onto. I will probably share this with a friend who just had a baby, would be a much cheaper alternative to brand name baby biscuits and crackers if you leave out the spice."

You will need a large baking sheet for this recipe. Since this is rolled out on the sheet, it's best to use one without sides to allow room for the rolling pin. I may try a savory version of these using parm and garlic."
