"reviewBody": "This is THE most popular cookie I have ever made. People are clamoring for it. I add 1 t ginger and 1 t cinnamon. I cut down the sugars to 3/4 cups of each. Then when making for my grandboys, I omit the craisins and raisins and add chocolate chips. They devour these. Better than regular chocolate chips because of the oatmeal. Lastly, for the adults, I add kosher or sea salt to the top of each cookie. I think THIS is why they are so unique."

I used a scoop so cookies were uniform and I slightly flattened with a fork before baking. I left them on the cookie sheet after baking for 2 mins and then transferred to rack. I’m making for a gathering and made extra for family. Family liked them. I don’t buy quick oats but was given a good amount so I will definitely make these again."

They do spread but I liked that the were crispy on the edges with chewy middles. Recipe makes a lot of batter, so I made about 12 cookies and spread the rest in a brownie pan for bars... soooo good! Standard size brownie pan about 40min at 350. I think next time I will cut 1/2cup of sugar (they were really sweet) and add the extra cup of oats as other have suggested."

"reviewBody": "Great Recipe. Made these Gluten free using cup for cup flower and Bobs Redmill GF oats.I took other reviewers suggestions and added an additional cup of oats, 1.5 tsp cinnamon, used 2 cups craisins and no raisins. I used an icecream scoop as we like large cookies, recipe yields 24 cookies. Bake for 15-17 mins. I freeze most of the uncooked cookies on a cookie tray and then put into freezer bag so we can have fresh cookies any time."

"reviewBody": "Delicious recipe! I made the following changes: based on other reviews I added 1 cup oats (used thick cut rolled oats rather than quick oats) and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. It was a little dry with the extra oats, so I also added appox 1/4 cup avocado oil. In addition, I substituted half the white flour for whole wheat and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup each (in the future I would reduce it further). I also omitted the raisins and added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips. The kids and their friends loved them! This recipe made almost 6 dozen cookies!"

I did modify the recipe by using rolled oat (not quick), 1 cup of white and 1 cup of wheat flour, no raisins but 2 cups of craisins. I think it would have been even more delicious with white chocolate chips if I had some in my kitchen. Great recipe!"

I hate when people leave great reviews but then basically note how they changed just about everything in the recipe. I used craisins &amp; white chocolate chips, because it what I had in my panty. This cookie recipe is so yummy, you could use just about anything you’d like. I also added a little more oatmeal and a little less flour the 2nd time I made them because I was running low on flour &amp; they came out a littler chewier which we loved!"
