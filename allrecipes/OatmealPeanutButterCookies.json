Oh and also, because I do everything my way, lol , I added a packed half cup of fresh raisins and a quarter cup of chopped pecans.

Just a little too sweet for me,(at 77 my taster has changed.) So for me, I think I will reduce sugars next time. Mine came out perfect at 11 minutes. Also, forgot to add, if you live in a high altitude state, here is a sure fire trick. Put batter in the freezer for 30 minutes. Perfect cookies for any recipe."

"reviewBody": "Excellent cookies. I loved them. I read reviews that others left. Many suggested that the oatmeal should be doubled so I did because I love oatmeal cookies. I used softened butter in place of the margarine and shortening. They turned out fantastic. My husband didn‚Äôt like them as well as my oatmeal craisen cookies but those are really hard to beat. He kept eating them though. I told him he really didn‚Äôt have to just to spare my feelings. Lol I used an eighth of a cup measure for the size of the cookies just like I do for most all of my cookies. That makes them crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I cooked some of them a little longer because sometimes I like a crunchy cookie. That‚Äôs just me. I noticed several reviews stated that they were too crunchy. That‚Äôs because you cooked them too long. These are great to freeze in ziploc bags for another time. I‚Äôll stand up 6-8 cookies, however many will fit in a qt freezer bag and put them in the freezer. I you can grab a few or the whole bag later and either let thaw or pop one in the microwave. They really are quick and easy to make. I‚Äôll be making them again soon. Thanks for the recipe."

Place dough right on a dry cookie sheet (do not use parchment paper) as it sucks the moisture out of the cookie). Also, I suggest adding more peanut butter if you are going to add additional oats to keep the mixture from getting too dry, in addition to adding more flavor."

And since these are baked for teenagers, I added 1 cup chocolate chips - not enough to take away from the Oatmeal/Peanut butter combo, but the added chocolate was delicious !! Thanks for the recipe."

"reviewBody": "My cookies were cracked on top and too crumbly. I cooked for 13 minutes at 350¬∞F. I have no idea what I did wrong. I used butter instead of margarine. I used a small spring-handle scoop to measure the dough and then drop on the cookie sheet so each cookie would be identical. I got exactly 3 dozen cookies. I‚Äôm going to try again with margarine and crisco exactly as the recipe, but still can‚Äôt figure out why I got 3 dozen (36) cookies."

"reviewBody": "I‚Äôve made these a couple of times now. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, the second I added about a half cup of oats, a splash of vanilla, chocolate chips and a bit of cinnamon. They are really tasty but very soft cookies. I found 10 minutes to be too short - 12 cooked them a little more and didn‚Äôt make them completely fall apart trying to take them off the baking sheet. I found my cookies got really flat once they cooled down though. They were nice and fluffy when I took them out of the oven but then completely flatten. In some other comments someone had mentioned it could be because your data are too warm. The second time I made it, I put my dough in the fridge for a bit and once the cookies were on the sheet I refrigerated those too. Still came out flat... They‚Äôre very tasty and my kids and husband loved them. I just wish they were thicker and a little crunchier. I got 55 using a tablespoon."

But if there's anyone else who wants to make these healthier, here's how: Replace the shortening and margarine with 3/4 cup oil. Use whole wheat flour instead of regular, up the oats to 1.5 cups. And then add in egg to keep the dry/moist ratio. Under-bake slightly for a chewy cookie."

Nice PB flavor without going overboard. Keeping this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I love both peanut butter and oatmeal cookies and this was the perfect combination of the two. I had to use room temperature butter (which is a challenge in this heat when you don't have central air) because I limit my shopping excursions due to the quarantine. Also, it didn't specify creamy or crunchy peanut butter so I used a combination of the two. Next time I think I'll use just crunchy. I also might up the amount of oats just a little. This is definitely awesome as written. I finished making 4+ dozen around 11:30 night before last (it's so much easier to be in the kitchen with a hot oven after dark these days) and there might be a dozen left. Might. What can I say? 2 teenagers. Thanks so much for this recipe! I will definitely be making them again and passing it along."
