I got about 50 biscuits so probably my teaspoon was a bit small, though it was more than a teaspoon regular i’m sure. Added walnut, 1/4 cup, used 1 cu coconut sugar, used wholewheat flour and added cardomom. They seem great to me, a bit more crumbly at this stage than chewy, but not over sweet. I find baked goods oversweet in general."

"reviewBody": "Wow. Did I say wow? I meant it. For dietary reasons (like cookies are part of a diet!) I used all whole wheat flour and thick cut oats, but other than adding more cinnamon, made these as directed. I honestly don't know how many I made because there was a cookie monster in my house eating them as quickly as I could make them. I didn't have a full cup of raisins so I added some cranberries and almonds and they are great. I made them for an event here this weekend, but don't think they will make it that long. Great recipe!!"

They are delicious with just the right mix of crispiness and moistness. I baked for nine minutes at first and switched to 10 for later batches."

Followed the recipe to a tee, baked at 375 for 8min, they looked burnt but still gooey in the middle. Did one pan for 9min and the pic is the result. Not sure what happened or what to fix. But I probably wont ever use this recipe again. Wasted someone elses ingredients. Super disappointed."

The only adjustment I made when making the cookies was I thought the temperature was a little too hot. I baked the cookies at 350 F. for about the time shown in the recipe and they were fine. Additionally, I added some chopped walnuts to the batter. Thanks for a really good recipe."

They were crispy on the bottom &amp; chewy on top. I also added 1/2 c. Craisins &amp; 1/2 c. Choc chips. Instead of raisins. This time I was short 3/4 c. Oats &amp; substituted @ tsp syrup, because I had no vanilla. The batter was thinner than the 1st time &amp; I worried they wouldn't be as good, but voila, they were every bit as good! I even made one batch in a muffin tin &amp; they were slightly \"cakey\" but still delicious! I am delighted with this recipe, as you can't really go wrong,if you use a little imagination."

I also leave out the you raisins because nobody wants those in cookies. The recipe says it makes 4 dozen, i yeilded about 2 1/2 dozen 2 inch cookies. Very happy with results."

"reviewBody": "IT'S SCIENCE; NOT THE RECIPE. This is a standard tried and true cookie recipe. There is no need to changes anything other than your own taste preferences. The ISSUE OF STICKING, HARD COOKIES, FLAT COOKIES and more doesn't have anything to do with the recipe; it has to do with HOW you bake them. If you bake a cookie on a non-stick baking mat, paper, insulated cookie sheet or standard cookie sheet, the cookie will come out different for each. For this bake, I used both the baking mat and the insulated cookie sheet. There was a little more browning on with the mat, and a little cookie residue left on the insulated pan (did not stick). I always decrease sugar for my cookies, but didn't do anything else. They turned out fine. If you do have one of those very old cookie sheets that you've been using for a life time, you might want to try baking your cookies using the mat or paper and I think you will be happier with your results, and have less clean up! I didn't give it a 5 because the recipe would have to be over the top and this is a standard good recipe."

Refrigerated the dough and used probably a tablespoon sized drop on an un-greased cookie sheet one insulated and the other non insulated cookie sheets and did not stick to either. Probably went a bit more raisins then called for light and dark , newly opened boxes so the were moist. Cookies are chewy and rich, definitely a keeper! Thanks for posting!\nTried uploading picture but even as smallest size wouldn’t load. It was actually for the nay sayers who claimed they ran and stuck to sheet. Well not here!"
