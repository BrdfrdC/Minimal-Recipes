The bottom crust was a bit thick, but not too bad, and the flavour and texture was really good. It was a very easy quick bread to make, and I really liked the use of the sour cream because I rarely have buttermilk on hand."

It firmed up and was fine, but the bottom was a little hard. Over than that, a great side dish! We served it with bean soup and everyone loved it. Great leftover with butter."

"reviewBody": "I love this bread! It's much better than any other soda bread I've made. It has a really nice flavor and is actually best without any honey or butter or jam on top. The texture is great, you could even use it to make sandwiches if you cut it thick. We don't usually enjoy thick crusts, but the crust on this bread is really tasty. Like others have said, the loaf isn't necessarily done when the top is browned. I suggest sticking a knife into the loaf to see if it's cooked in the middle. I'm glad I did this because the first time I took it out of the oven, it was still raw inside. To keep the top from browning any more, I covered it with foil. This kept the top nice but allowed the insides to cook more. The recipe says to let it cool completely before slicing, but if you cut wedges out of it while it's still a little warm, it's amazing. Leftover cooled bread can be used for sandwiches like I mentioned earlier, or you can put it in the toaster and it will be almost as good as when it came out of the oven. Great recipe, I will make this again and again! Next time I'm going to try using wheat flour."

It puffed up nicely and looked so beautiful! But it was almost inedible because the inside did not cook through. I scrapped off the outer crust and it was delicious, but I was so disappointed not to be able to serve it. Next time I will bake for 1 hour and see what happens."

The majority of this huge loaf was eaten by me, as I could not stay away from it. Also, the flavor of this bread is so amazing that I liked it best just plain. Slathering it with butter or jelly just takes away from the experience."
