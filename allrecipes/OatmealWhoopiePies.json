I used the substitute frosting as suggested by one reviewer (to avoid the use of a raw egg white) and it also wasn’t the whoopie cookie frosting flavor I remember. Will have to play with the flavoring in the future. Also took longer to bake for me - about 12 minutes so they kept their shape."

I used 10 3/4 oz (2 cups of brown sugar is approx 14 oz.) I already have another basic filling recipe I like so I used that (9 oz shortening, 1 7-oz jar marshmallow cream, 1 cup conf sugar, 1 tbsp vanilla) and I think it helps balance the sweetness. This recipe is definitely a keeper for me."

When assembling the cookies for baking, I rolled them into small balls and then partially flattened them with the bottom of a glass. Next time I will flatten them even more since they still puffed up quite a bit. Even a little too thick, they still made excellent sandwich cookies and my DH was a very happy guy!"

I omitted the egg whites from the frosting (kiddos and pregnant ladies would be eating them) and reduced the shortening based on other reviews. I got more than 30 cookies from my batch (maybe 38), and there is not enough frosting to fill all of them, even if I used the extra 1/4 of shortening. I suggest doubling the frosting."

"reviewBody": "These are way better than the store bought version (and way less preservatives). I used the medium sized Pampered Chef scoop and flatened the dough out a tad on the cookie sheet. I baked them for a little over eight minutes and they came out perfectly done. With the PC scoop, the recipes made twenty sandwiches. I also sneaked a little (okay maybe a lot) of raw dough, so it may have made a few more. I used a little less shortening in my filling also. Yummy, yummy, yummy!"

The cookies looked like pancakes as they came out of the oven (they expanded and all mushed into each other, and they were totally flat) and they were rock hard. Not at all what I was expecting. I gave two stars instead of one because they did taste good. I didn't bother making the frosting since it wouldn't have worked out with hard cookies. :( Bummer."

"reviewBody": "I made these for the Super Bowl. They were fantastic, and everyone loved them! After I read the reviews of under-baking them slightly to make a more \"chewy\" texture, I decided to bake some of them for 8 minutes and some for 9. The key word is SLIGHTLY, because the ones I baked for 8 minutes were too soft and they started falling apart. The ones I baked for 9 minutes were perfect. After reading the reviews about the vanilla filling I decided to use a different icing. I used the easy buttercream frosting recipe from this website (using all butter and no shortening) and the results were fabulous. I thought it complemented the oatmeal flavor perfectly. I will definitely use this recipe again!"

"reviewBody": "These cookies are awesome but they're too big, especially when the filling is pure delicious fat and there's two cookies instead of one. I make mine mini size. They're still super soft and chewy. I just put the batter in the freezer for about fifteen minutes so they don't come apart during baking. They stay nice and tiny in the oven if you chill them first. I never use egg whites for the filling though, too scary. I've made these cookies three years in a row for cookie exchange and they're just unbeatable even though I have to make three hundred cookies... so worth it. Yum! Thanks for the recipe!"

These would be a great treat for bake sales and picnics, and are suprisingly quick to make and assemble. The cookie recipe is great alone, but made even better by the filling. I used a 1/2 cup of shortening for the filling, and will try butter next time. Be generous with the filling, I used it sparingly and had lots left over. Great recipe!"

I always adjust recipes to my taste. Added vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice to the cookie part, and added a dash of salt to the creme filling. It helps to alleviate some of the sweetness. Thanks for a great recipe."

The filling has always been made with Crisco and egg whites and I never heard of anyone contracting \"food poisoning\", ever. In fact, you will see most any version of a whoopie pie at any local bake sale, wrapped individually in wax paper (just like the Tastykakes of yore,sigh) and I would bet they were made from a recipe handed down through the generations which included egg whites in the filling. Whoopie Pies are what they are...changing anything out would be breaking a long-standing traditional recipe."
