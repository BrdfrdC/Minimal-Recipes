Let me tell you, this dish was amazing. Everyone raved over them. Even the non grits people loved it. Needless to say, there were no leftovers. This one is a keeper."

I especially appreciate the suggestions made to simply combine everything in a baking dish, throw it in the oven, stir it up after cooking a half hour and then finishing it in the oven for another 30 min. It came out great! Also I did agree with the changes to cut out the seasoning salt and eggs altogether and cut the butter back to a 1/4 cup....it STILL tasted fantastic! Also I chose to do a mix of 2/3 pepper jack cheese to 1/3 processed cheese. DELISH!"

"reviewBody": "I just made this scaled down to four for my small family in an 8X8 pan using several reviewers' suggestions. I omitted seasoning salt (didn't have it), used cheddar cheese (it's what I had), omitted Worcestershire sauce cause I was making this for breakfast, added some precooked sausage (to use it up), and most importantly, followed Brandy Lee's suggestion to just dump all the ingredients in without precooking the grits. That was a huge time saver. Also, I didn't even realize it when I was eating them that I'd completely forgotten to add the butter! Oops! We didn't miss it at all, so I guess those who want to save calories could leave it out. I might add a little the next time I make them just for curiosity and comparison, but these were great without it."

"reviewBody": "Caveat: Neither I or my better half are grits fans but we loved it. Tweaks we made: We cut the recipe in half for two people. Keeping in mind we cut the recipe in half, we used 1 teaspoon of season salt but replaced the 1 teaspoon of salt with 1 teaspoon of season salt. Next time, I would reduce the 2 teaspoons of season salt to 1.25 or 1.5 teaspoons of season salt and just leave out the salt. We also added 1 cup of diced ham to our \"half\" batch and used just 2 eggs. Finally, I baked it in an 8x8 pyrex dish in my oven using convection mode at 375 for 50 minutes. On my convection oven reduces the temp approx. 25 degrees... that's why I bumped it up. Finally next time instead of using the 8x8 for the half batch, I will use a 9x13 so the finished product is thinner and hopefully a little firmer."

I served this with collard greens and cornbread. Several of the girls said they thought it was macaroni &amp; cheese. When they found it was grits, they were initially disappointed until they tasted them. The grits got very good reviews. There was one purist among the group that said grits should not be a casserole, but other than her, they were a hit.\n\nI also had them for leftovers the next day. I heated them in the microwave and added a pat of butter on top. WOW.\n\nAccording to reviews' suggestions, I used one tablespoon of wocestershire sauce and two teaspoons hot sauce. I also used 8oz Cheddar, 8 oz Velveta.\n\nI used quick grits, but I could've cooked the grits until they were ALL THE WAY DONE, which for me is more than 5-6 minutes. \n\nGreat recipe! Could be used for brunch or dinner. Instead of standing over my grits, I socialized. Thanks."

My mom used to make these all the time, and since she passed away, I have been sad that I never paid more attention -- they were made so often and I helped her so often that I thought I \"knew.\" At any rate, I read the recipe and immediately recognized it! I, unfortunately had been forgetting the eggs. At any rate, I followed the recipe to the \"t\" and it was perfect. They should be a little salty and decadent, because its not an everyday dish. Its a Sunday morning brunch type thing. \n\nI am so thankful that I found this recipe, and that I could recreate a bit of home.

For the salt, I used 2 tsp garlic salt and 1 tsp regular salt. I left out the worcestershire sauce. I baked them in my slow cooker crock, then plugged it in when I got to work to keep them warm. It worked great! I will make these again."

"reviewBody": "I'm an Alabama native, so I've had my fair share of grits in my life. This was by far the most flavorful grits recipe I've ever had. My fiance RAVED over this dish. He loved it!!! I thought it was good as well, but I found it to be a bit salty. I kept taking a bite of my scrambled eggs with it to cut the salt flavor down a bit, which tasted awesome. I think I would decrease the regular salt by half if I make it again. It's a strange \"breakfast\" flavor, and I was originally concerned that the worcestershire/hot sauce flavor wouldn't go well with bacon and eggs, but it seemed to taste just fine. FYI, I followed the recipe exactly, but took the recommendation of practically every reviewer to use cheddar cheese instead of processed. I would definitely make this dish again (in fact, I think I have to for my fiance's sake...haha)"

For the cheese I used a mix of Dill Havarti, Caraway Seed Havarti and Sharp Cheddar and extra Tabasco, as we like/love spicy ... I also skipped the \"Lea &amp; Perrin's\" since we aren't too crazy about that sauce ... We are hooked on Cheese Grits ... Thanks for posting Sara Lee ..."

I had some instant packages of grits that I added to firm them up (I had to add 4 individual packages) Then I had to compensate by adding some more of the spices to balance it out. The end result still tasted great, but I definatly will use less water next time (or) different type of grits."

I 1/2 the recipe and it called for 1 1/2 eggs, I used 1 egg and milk to make it a little more creamy so I didn't have to waste an egg or worry that it would be too eggy. Otherwise I followed the recipe with the exception of the hot sauce (I didn't have any). I used Tony C's for the seasoned salt to give it a kick to make up for the lack of hot sauce! No one in my house found it too salty. I have always been partial to another grit recipe but now this will be my go to recipe! Thanks :)"
