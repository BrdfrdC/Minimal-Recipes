File powder is made from the dried ground leaves of the sassafras tree. They were believed to have been first used by the Choctaw Indians from Louisiana bayou region.Today the powder is used to both thicken and flavor gumbo."

Okra is \"new\" for me - after experiencing the slimy sort when I was a kid - and I'm so happy to be able to introduce my kids to okra with a great recipe like this! Completely non-slimy!! Added a couple cloves of garlic with the onion, used about a tbsp of olive oil to saute the onion and garlic, and didn't have any file powder, so used some Cajun seasoning. Also used a combination of fresh and canned tomatoes, and fresh okra from the farmer's market. So glad I tried this - you won't be disappointed!"

It was my 1st time using okra. I was a little apprehensive because of the slime factor involved, but it wasn't a problem. I also didn't have bacon or onions so I used canola oil and onion powder. Very simple recipe."

I did this on the spur of the moment after purchasing fresh okra from the fruit/veggie stand down the road, so I altered it by using fresh okra and went with another reviewers suggestion of cutting down the corn! It is awesome and NOT goopy like some okra recipes I've made! A much better alternative to breading/frying healthwise! THUMBS up!"

I knew he'd ask us if we enjoyed his okra and wanted to be able to answer him honestly. I was happy to find this recipe with all the positive reviews. To a Dutch oven I added and crisped the diced bacon. Set aside to drain on paper towels reserving a tiny bit of the bacon fat. Sauteed the onion and okra. Added undrained tomatoes and leftover cooked ground turkey. Added a can of water. Simmered for about 20 minutes, added the file' powder, which was easy to find in the creole section of the spices. The file' powder really makes this recipe. I added leftover corn and salted and peppered as needed."

This was it. My daughters devoured it, and my picky, veggie HATING\nson simply ate it without a fuss-that RARELY happens. So this one is going in the file for keeps. \nPersonally, I try not to eat meat but I can handle the small amount of bacon used for flavoring in this. I'm going to try the recipe using olive oil and play with the seasonings a bit though to see if I can't make it more vegetarian friendly. Thanks for a great recipe!"

I also used about 3 tblsp of olive oil to cook the okra and onions, then poured in a pouch of real bacon bits. I used fresh okra and cherry tomatoes from our garden with two nice spicey chopped jalepeno peppers. And just poured in a can of whole kernel corn (drained). The flavors were wonderful together and gave it just the right amount of \"bite\" that my family enjoys. We served it hot over cornbread. A definite hit for my family. Will be making this again. Thanks for the recipe :-)"

I used Trader Joe's frozen sweet corn. Plus I only used a 16 oz bg and it was still way too much corn. I'd use less or no corn next time. Otherwise the flavor was good. \n\nI'm surprised people have a problem finding file powder. It is gumbo file and should be available with the creole seasonings in most big supermarkets."
