The root is cleaned and shaved into small pieces and boiled, to make a tea which can then be carbonated if you like."

"reviewBody": "I am not a huge fan of okra gumbo, but I made this for my husband. It was delicious! I did about 2.5 recipes using 4 cups of fresh okra from my garden. I used 1 can of diced tomatoes and several fresh ones from my garden. I used coconut oil and white whole wheat flour. I only used about 1 Tbs tomato paste because I really didn't think it needed much, and I needed the rest for my spaghetti sauce (ha!). I did not have mushrooms or file powder so I omitted them. It was also pretty spicy. Oh wait, that's because my husband threw in a cayenne pepper while it was cooking. He also thought it would be good with carrots, so I threw in some shredded carrots to give it a little more nutrition. I tasted it before adding the roux, and it was plenty thick and tasted excellent. After adding the roux, it was even richer and better! I will definitely be making this every summer with our fresh okra and tomatoes."

"reviewBody": "Okay, so I understand the criticism that people don't like it when you don't follow a recipe exactly, and then you try to rate it... but the way I see it, making the recipe as written (especially after reading the reviews) would be a waste of a perfectly good meal. Okay, so I'm no gumbo expert by any means, I was just looking for a soup I could turn into a one pot meal, so I started with this recipe. The hubby doesn't like mushrooms so I subbed other veggies, then added some chicken and andouille sausage for some extra flavor and protein since when I looked at the nutritional profile, this looked like a great side, but not a full meal. The recipe as written is severely lacking in liquid (Like I said, I'm not gumbo expert, but I thought gumbo was supposed to be a soup!), so I added 4 cups of vegetable broth. After reading other reviews, I was a little afraid to follow the instructions as written with the file, and perhaps this is why I found the flavors lacking. I added some creole seasoning (Sorry I can't advise how much, I just kept adding and tasting till it had the flavor I was looking for) and only added the file to the bowl at the end. The result was delicious, but it wasn't the recipe as written. Still, I couldn't have made this without the recipe instructions plus reading several very helpful reviews!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe needs a lot of adjustments, but it's an okay place to start. Agree no file; but we did add some thyme. And used celery instead of mushrooms. As well, at lest two cans of vegetarian broth or you won't have a gumbo but a mushy stew. Added a pretty dark roux and served with short-grain brown rice and fresh chives. Next time will use more onion, pepper, celery for that large amount of okra. Oh, a little tomato paste won't hurt, but will try double diced tomato--no paste. UPDATE: Second time no tomato paste--huge improvement. Soaked okra in milk and it made the texture perfect. Went for a slightly darker roux and that nailed it. Added shredded chicken for the meat eaters in the family."

I added 1 cup of vegetable broth along with the tomatoes, and then I added a second cup of vegetable broth along with the roux. I left out the file powder completely. I also added about 1 teaspoon creole seasonings. Overall, it was a pretty good recipe and I will probably make it again."

I think in the future if I want to make a veggie gumbo, I will use one of the traditional recipes and just substitute vegetables for meat. Also, the only veggie used in this recipe that isn’t included in standard gumbo is mushrooms so it especially disappointed. How about adding some corn, lima beans, green beans, carrots, cauliflower, or some combo thereof? Finally, never use both file powder and okra in gumbo. That part I already knew; use one or the other."

Even without file powder, the roux, tomato paste, and okra created a nice, thick texture; I actually added about 3 cups of water so it wasn't TOO thick. I suggest keeping a large glass of water handy and adding it as you think it's necessary. I also added thyme and celery seed, and both added a nice flavor to the dish. Very, very good—I will definitely make this again."

I'm of French Canadian heritage and we use roux frequently as a thickener. Thanks for the recipe, roux or no roux, it's a mon gout!!"

However, when making the roux, I made an almost black roux -- which provides a lot of flavor (and the darker the roux, the less thickening properties it has). So, the issue of \"too thick\" did not happen. (Besides I did not have any file to use.) I used frozen/chopped okra and the entire dish was quick and lovely. The only change I made was to add another teaspoon of salt and then added 2 TBL of Frank's Hot Sauce to give it both a little heat and some acid in the background. We will have this again!"

Usually okra is used with seafoods and file is used with chiken and sausage. Some people will add some seafood with their meats, but usually don't combine okra and file in the same dish....at least not in the real New Orleans."

The dark roux is key to this dish and it's where all of the flavor lies. Making the roux is a bit time consuming, but it's well worth the effort. Otherwise, you're just making an ordinary soup type stew. I personally don't use tomatoes in my gumbo. Give it another shot and I'm sure you'll see a huge difference in taste."

I used some Creole seasoning with a hint of wasabi for extra spiciness. Also I had canned shitake mushrooms as well as button mushrooms. All in all it turned out great. My husband was thrilled since we are trying to go Vegan. Thank you! Can not wait to try it with all fresh ingredients and file powder."
