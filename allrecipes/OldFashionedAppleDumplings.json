Even so, the bottoms of the crusts were sopping wet. \nI suggest using honey crisp apples, adding 1/4 cup of cornstarch and 1/2 cup of water (for more sauce but keeping a tiny bit of thickness), and adding the sauce after the apples have been baking for 10 minutes so the bottoms have some kind of substance to them.\nHappy baking!"

Cooked turkey at the same time and had the oven at 350 for 30 minutes then 15 minutes at 400. The sauce part was on top as a sorta sugar crust and it worked. Thank you for sharing this recipe. Probably going to be making it for family a lot more due to how scrumptious it is."

"reviewBody": "I made the dumplings following the recipe exactly as written. I made the pie crust by hand and used Granny Smith apples. I boiled the sugar water for exactly 5 minutes then poured the mixture over the dumplings and placed the dish in a pre-heated oven. The outcome was the dumplings “boiled” in the syrupy liquid, the tops browning nicely and the bottoms having a texture of noodles. The syrupy fluid was still very deep in the dish after it was finished. After sitting for 30 minutes, the fluid thickened and reabsorbed into the dumplings. These were super sweet. I will not make these again- I disliked the texture and watery, overly sweet syrup."

Especially if you don't use GS apples (which I don't like) I like the idea of using brown sugar and cider for the sauce. I made a vanilla custard recipe from this site and put some of that on too, because that's how we served it at a restaurant I used to work at. (The 'n' Bull, Peddler's Village, Lahaska, PA)"

I think it would be better with half the butter in the apple, only 1 tbls of brown sugar and sprinkle some cinnamon over the peeled apple before closing. Next time I will make pie crust out of 1.5 cups cold flour, salt and 1/2 cup of lard 2 times to make sure I have enough dough."

I useful my favorite tried and true crust recipe and the dumplings are delicious on top, where the crust is flaky and amazing and the apples are tender, but everything below the “sauce line” is just an unbaked sugar and crust goo. I’ve put them back in the oven after removing one dumpling and trying to scoop out some of the sickly sweet sauce, and I hope they’ll crisp enough to be edible."

Was delicious but I thought the pie crust was a little gummy on the bottom and a little overcooked on the top. An idea: use some of the apple slices on the bottom to elevate the crust-covered apples. Foil sheet just laid over tops for 7-10 minutes may prevent dryness. Will also back off on sugar; was very sweet. Will try again."

I added pecans to the recipe but didn't make the sauce. It just sounded like too much sugar to me. I guess the dumplings leaked a bit while baking so that made some sauce with not as much sugar content. They were very tasty though and would make them again."

Yes, they're sweet - yes, they're old fashioned -- yes, they are awesome! I rolled out only part of the dough at a time to make it easier to work with. I also used Granny Smith apples, as they are nice and tart, and worked to balance the sweetness. These are very reminiscent of heirloom apple dumplings."
