The flavor was almost there. The ingredients and cooking need some modifications, which I will attempt the next time I make it. Maybe add more flour, some lemon juice, adjust the oven temp., etc. Again, this was my experience. It might work better for others using different apples."

I also used some cinnamon and sugar on the crust to add a delightful color to the crust as well as a nice crunch kinda like candy but only sorta."

"reviewBody": "Don't follow the recipe for the cook temp time, it ends as an EPIC FAIL. I was out of town and wanted to make 'my' apple pie - found this recipe which seemed like the filling was very similar to what I do - but as I only bake once a year, I failed to see the problem with using a 275 degree oven for the cooking. Cut to the cooking, the crust was NOT getting browned at all. Started increasing the temp, and increasing the temp, eventually getting up to 325, and then pulled the pie as soon as it was slightly browned and the juices were running. When we cut into the pie after dinner, the apples had turned to apple mush because I had to leave it in longer to get any kind of browning (and juice running) action. I was horrified - but if you read the other reviews all complaining of being too runny it can all be attributed to the undercooking at too low of a temp. Do yourself a favor, follow everything but that last instruction, you need to cook the pie at 325, not \"275-300\" (which was my first flag, why use a range...). Two stars for what I perceive to be the correct ingredients for the filling, \"F\" for the cooking instructions. Cooking apple pies longer than necessary will turn the slices into apple sauce. Should have been awesome based on the ingredients, but hard to rate apple mush as awesome... Writing this review to hopefully save someone else the next time! Cheers."

Sugar pulls the water out of the apples so if it sits the water starts coming out. . It was amazing! It truly is an old fashioned recipe. It is the way my Grandmother makes it.

"reviewBody": "Hubs and I agree this is a darned fine pie. While I made a couple of minor modifications, none were necessary. I most frequently make my apple pies with just white sugar, but this time I wanted a little “caramel-y-scotchy” taste so I used half white and half brown sugar –just fun for something different. The amounts of cinnamon and nutmeg were just right. I typically don’t care for nutmeg in apple pies, but the little bit of it that was indicated here enhanced rather than dominated. As for the flour, I’m always nervous about that – 2 T. is a common amount used in apple pie recipes but you can never know exactly if that will be too much or too little. The Fuji apples I used were very juicy so I used two HEAPING tablespoons and so far I’m happy with that. I’ll be interested to see tomorrow morning, however, once the pie has set overnight, if I’m still as pleased! I’m hoping it won’t have turned to paste! I used a rich pie crust, “Never, Never Fail Pie Pastry,” also from this site, and brushed it with a mixture of one egg yolk and 1 T. half-and-half before baking. I baked the pie at a consistent 375 degrees – 25 minutes with the crust uncovered, then another 25 minutes or so with the crust edge covered with foil. This pie recipe and the pastry recipe I chose was a winning combination and lived up to its name. This was indeed a good “Old Fashioned Apple Pie.”"

Hubby declared it \"EXCELLENT\". It did take a little longer to bake as I turned the oven down to 275. I feel that 300 would have been better. Thank you Arletta for sharing this EXCELLENT recipe!"

I used Saigon cinnamon, fresh ground nutmeg and added just a dash of chipotle pepper. It gave it the kick I was looking for and still had that sweet apple taste. It's my new favorite apply pie recipe!"

To counter that without giving the pie a flour-y taste, I gave a generous sprinkle of minute tapioca in the bottom of the shell. I will use this recipe again for sure!! Definitely didn't have to worry about left-overs on this one"

"reviewBody": "To avoid wateriness in an old-fashioned apple pie you need to do two things: Use Cortland or other cooking apples (never use Macintosh!) and add 2 tablespoons of uncooked tapioca right out of the box (more for a 10\" pie). Spread the first tablespoon over the bottom of the pie crust before you add any apples, then sprinkle the remaining tablespoon throughout the pie. The tapioca helps absorb the moisture resulting in a perfect pie--don't worry, you can't taste it! :) You may need to experiment and adjust the amount of tapioca to suit your individual preferences. This trick was passed down to me by my father whose Swedish grandmother taught it to him as a child... she made the best pies! Another tip from Nana: Don't just dump the apples into the pie crust, place them individually in concentric rings. This takes a LOT longer but your pie will not sink at all--you can have a true \"mile high apple pie\" and you don't pour in the \"sugar soup\" at the bottom of the mixing bowl that can also contribute to wateriness. I like my pies a little moist, so I do pour a little of the sugar mixture in, but not all of it. Also, if you're storing your apples in lemon water to prevent browning between peeling and putting them in the crust, make sure you give them time to drain and shake the colander well to get rid of all the extra water."

I did make sure to use heaping tablespoons of flour and 7 cups seemed like too many apples; even after heaping them into the crust, I had some left over. I will definitely make this again, thank you!"

"reviewBody": "I made three of these at once for Mothers Day gifts, mostly because I wanted to use my entire pound of lard at once, which makes 3 double crusted pies. To ensure it was not too liquidy I used 2 heaping tablespoons of flour in my filling mixture. I also added a light sprinkling of cinnamon before laying the top crust down. I over heaped my filling and it did not shirnk much, perhaps the apples I used? GALA... made for a sweet, yummy, pie. I've never made pie before and everyone RAVED over this recipie. I have one of the 3 frozen and can hardly wait to cook it! TIP from my 86 year old Grandmother: Touch the crust as little as possible when it is dough, otherwise it will be tough after being cooked. 2nd TIP: Freeze the pie before cooking, that way retains it's juicy-ness without becoming soggy once you cook it!"

All in all a pretty good recipe."
