In with the drippings I added a blend of peppers with drippings, I seasoned the rue and then added the water and allowed it to come to a boil. I then mixed together 1 tspn of corn starch and 1 tspn of water and stirred it until it became a paste (thickening agent)\n\nAfter it came to a rolling boil, I added the paste slowly while stirring and allowed it to contiue to boil. This helps!"

I cooked them until a deep brown, but it seems I was unable to get rid of the raw flour flavor. \n\nUsually that's taken care of by just cooking it down and adding more water.\n\nWhile thick, it was bland even after I added tons of pepper (black, cayenne and paprika) and over three grams of salt."

It has the right foundations, but we just had to kind of make it up as we went. Maybe if the cook could have just had better instructions. I am a new cook so it may only be me."

"reviewBody": "I made this gravy using drippings from my chuck roast cooked in the crock pot. In order to make a rue with the right consistency, I used at least 6 tablespoons of drippings to the 2 tablespoons of flour. Otherwise, I followed the recipe for milk and water. The gravy cooked and thickened nicely. I'm giving 3 stars only because I was in a hurry, and had I not saved any more drippings than the 2 tablespoons called for in the recipe, I'd have been in trouble!! Will use recipe again, but more drippings."
