I didn't account for the extra liquid in the pineapple and carrots so I had to add extra flour to get the consistency I knew that I needed from those box cakes that I learned on. So with that being said, I love Carrot Cake, and this was a fantastic recipe and made an excellent cake. One of the best I've ever had, and I've had quite a few..ðŸ˜‹"

Here are my adjustments: added 1 tsp of ginger powder, 1 tsp allspice and 1 tsp nutmeg to make it more flavorful. The reason Iâ€™m giving this a 4 start rating, is because I can taste the baking soda. I would have to replace it with another leavening agent. Not sure what yet. I reduced the baking time to around 30 minutes for the cupcakes instead of the suggested time for an actual cake."

This last time, I just made the standard amount, and had a \"nearly naked\" look to the cake. The only comment I have is that 55 minutes in the oven for 2 cake rounds would be too long. The recipe is for a 9 x 13 pan. Thirty-five to forty minutes is plenty for a toothpick to come out clean for 2 cake rounds. I actually checked it at 33 minutes and it was fine. Try this cake!"

I made my frosting with 16 oz cream cheese, 1/2 c butter, dash of vanilla, 1/2 c confectioners sugar and a few tablespoons of the pineapple juice left from the crushed pineapple (as another reviewer suggested). Not too sweet. The whole thing was perfect!"

I substitued the coconut for 1 and 1/4 cup of oats, reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup (could reduce even more), and substitued 1 of the cups of flour with whole meal flour. Added an extra 1/4 cup of flour to make the cake a bit more firm. Added 3/4 cups of raisins. Replaced one of the teaspons of cinnamon with ground nutmeg. Baked in a bundt cake pan and drizzled icing (made it a bit more runny and made a lot less than recipe). Decorated with grated carrots and raisins. This is how much my son ate in one sitting! We'll have to get him to slow down a bit."

This was a spur of the moment thing as I needed to used up carrots. I had to use sucralose (hubs is diabetic). I substituted Kefir milk for buttermilk, I only had a small can of pineapple, I added pecans &amp; some hemp seeds. No icing, either; just a dusting of 10X sugar. Delicious &amp; moist! I want the real version so badly!"

I did add raisins, nuts and pineapple and it was perfect! I did make in a 9x13 pan and ended up taking about 50-55 minutes total to bake completely but will worth the time and effort!!"

"reviewBody": "Fabulous!!! I have done a lot of baking, but this was my first attempt at carrot cake. I suppose I was intimidated and nervous it wouldn't turn out. Carrot cake is my absolute favorite cake by far. I cut the recipe in half, as I knew a whole recipe would be too much for two adults and a child. I used one round cake pan.\n\nThe recipe calls for 3 eggs, and I used two in this halved version. I believe this added to the nice moist texture.\n\nThe pineapple added deliciously sweet moisture. I didn't have crushed pineapple, but I did have a can of chunks. I took half of chunks from the can and chopped them finely.\n\nFor the frosting, I used a mixer to mix it together. The instructions don't say to do this, but I highly recommend it.\n\nI used a convection oven to bake. It took 50 minutes on 325.\n\nThe only thing I plan on changing next time is the amount of spice used. I will add more cinnamon and some nutmeg next time. This is for my personal taste, as I enjoy foods that are richly spiced."

Plus, I used only 1 tsp of baking soda and added 2 tsp of baking powder since there is already salt in the recipe. Plus I added a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg for added flavor. it was easy and very moist. My husband loved it. I'm going to make it again for sure."

Oh i also added raisins another personal choice. I will most definitely make this again i am already getting request, your recipes on here never disappoint."

I grated up an entire bag of carrots (1 LB?) and had them in a bowl for my wife to measure out the 2 cups. She thought I had already measured out the 2 cups and threw in the entire bowl. I would have guessed it was closer to 3, maybe even 3.5 cups. The cake was so moist and delicious! Will make this again for sure."
