This could be a casserole or maybe a pot pie filling. Don’t know what some people are thinking when they review and start changing everything about the recipe until it has nothing to do with what it was supposed to be Stop it! If you could cook the dish better why are you looking for a recipe. Chicken and dumplings is a one pot boiled dish. Chicken milk cream butter salt pepper stock dumplings made at home or canned biscuits. Simple easy and delicious. This is how it’s made it isn’t ment to be an expensive gourmet meal."

I never use baking soda in dumplings, just egg, flour, salt and water. I drop the dumplings off the tip of a spoon into the soup or boiling water and slow boil until they rise to the top."

"reviewBody": "I have never left a negative food review for a recipe on any site before. \nI did make my chicken and broth from scratch the same as I have been for the last 20 + years. I boil a whole chicken with carrots, celery, onion and garlic with a couple of bay leaves and pepper. I do add chicken bullion if I want to make a lot of broth for soup and other recipes and do not add any additional salt due to the saltiness of the bullion. I strain and discard all the vegetables. (Sometimes I reserve the carrots and give them to my dogs since they both love carrots mixed in with their food). Great base for soups or broth for other recipes rather than having to buy the box broth. I shredded the chicken and discarded the skin/fat and bones. \n\nMy negative review is due to the dumplings. My family is from Alabama and I have been eating dumplings my whole life. I couldn’t find my family recipe since I just moved and haven’t unpacked my box of recipes yet so I decided to try this recipe due to all the good reviews. Worst dumplings I’ve ever had. I made the dumplings EXACTLY as directed with no deviations at all. These are tasteless and just big chunks of dough sadly. I fished all the dumplings out of the soup and threw them straight in the trash. Very disappointed and a waste of time sadly. \n\nIn order to salvage dinner, I cut up/cooked more carrots and celery added to the soup and served chicken soup for dinner instead"

I added carrots to the stock and used boneless skinless chicken breasts, instead of the whole chicken, and then shredded the meat after it was done cooking. I also used an immersion blender to thicken the soup and added only half of the water flour mixture. Lastly, I doubled the dumpling mixture. I think I will cut the salt a little for the dumplings next time."

"reviewBody": "I have been craving a good bowl of homemade (scratch all the way)) chicken and dumplings. It’s obvious I did something very wrong with the dumplings! The base soup is very good... I added a few spices here n there. I had no cream of chicken soup so I used a chicken gravy that was ok. I beat up the egg and milk good then added the flour... baking powder etc.... but the once I added the butter I git past the crumbly stage fast and ended up with a ball. I dropped pieces in because it was too heavy and thick to do spoonfuls. Once cooked it was very gummie. I’m sure the dumplings are supposed to be light and fluffy?"

Last change was I removed the chicken/dumplings as it stated but I used my immersion blender and left all vegetables. I laughed at the comments that it said the recipe did not tell you how much flour for the gravy. Suggestion reread recipe. Total flour was 1-1/2 cup (DIVIDED). Only 1 cup for dumplings and 1/2 cup for gravy as stated. This was my first try for chicken and dumplings as the family loved it!!!"

I did not use water for flour, but rather pulled some of the soup out to mix with the flour."

"reviewBody": "I played with this recipe quite a bit, but it's a good basic place to start. I made a small batch, using one giant chicken breast, and made it with a little more liquid than the cut-down recipe suggested. I did not remove the vegetables and instead pureed the stock with an immersion blender before adding any flour to thicken. Instead of milk I used heavy cream in the dumplings (because I needed to use it up) and also added some extra cream to the stock for extra creaminess. Also I made small, walnut sized dumplings rather than large ones."

Made my own stock. 2 quarts of water, 2 tablespoons of Knorr chicken bouillon, bag of baby carrots, 4 stalks of celery, and 1 small onion all roughly chopped, salt and pepper and garlic powder. Combine all with chicken (thighs)in stock pot and cook till chicken is done. Taste to see if seasoning needs to be adjusted. For the gravy mixed 1/2 cup of flour with 1/4 cup of evaporated milk pour slur into chicken and dumplings (I did not remove chicken and dumpling per directions). VERY GOOD"

Added some mushrooms and zucchini after about 45 minutes. We don't really care for parsley so I used thyme in the biscuits instead. I saved all the veggies when I pulled out the chicken and biscuits to make the gravy, which was outstanding. Can't wait to make again."

I think many people used the full 1 1/2 cups of flour for the dumplings, NOT GOOD!!!!"

The only difference was my mother browned her chicken a little then added her onions, garlic, celery and carrots and then water (we are talking about many years ago. Then the roaster went into the oven. The smell drove me crazy. When chicken was cooked, dumplings were added and this was cooked on the top of the stove. Dumplings and chicken were removed from roaster. Gravy was then made. Complete withe vegetables. We always had mashed potatoes with this dish. There was never any left overs."

I just used this as a base recipe because I used the ingredients I already had on hand instead of going to the store. I used a mixed vegetable blend that included green beans and cauliflower and frozen pre-diced chicken breast. I've never heard of a condensed chicken mushroom soup so I just used condensed chicken. I threw all this in some seasonings. The dumplings are in now...I've already tasted the soup part and its SOOO good. ."

"reviewBody": "I made the dumplings in this recipe. After reading the reviews and reading the recipe it looks like a step was left out. The recipe does not say how much flour to reserve. Based on other recipes I would say 1/2 cup for the broth and 1 cup for the dumplings. \n\nThose that are saying it is crumbly likely used the whole 1 1/2 cups of flour. If you cut the flour in the dumplings they should not be crumbly or dry. \n\nFor the poster who said boiling chicken results in dry chicken. Dry chicken is a result of over cooking not the method of cooking. Roasting a chicken can result in a dry chicken if you roast it too long. I know because I have done that in the past. \n\nNow for the recipe. Basically I am only reviewing the dumplings as I already have my own chicken stew recipe. I gave the recipe 4 stars primarily because one step is left out making the recipe confusing. I did make a change as my son has dairy allergies. I used chicken broth instead of milk. As my son can tolerate butter I used that. Next time I plan on using solid chicken from making broth. I will have to remember to save it though."

I added way more broth. Also, the dumpling mix is great, but I would suggest making the dumplings smaller than this recipe calls for. The middle of the dumplings turned out kind of dry and I think that could be avoided by making the dumplings smaller."

Two family members took on bowls for lunches tomorrow. Still stuck on the perfect complement side dish. thinking maybe cucumber salad or a dessert dish of vegetable jello with lime. Topped with off with gourmet coffees, not or cold. Our family and friends loved it and we joined in to creat it. Cooking should be fun."

"reviewBody": "FINALLY a good chicken &amp; dumplings recipe! This is the 4th one I tried. I was let down by the shortcut recipes that use canned soups and biscuits. My family loved this recipe. I cut the recipe down to 8 servings. I used chicken thighs with the bones and skin because it really adds good flavor. I followed the recipe except I did not have fresh parsley so I used dried. The conversion rate is for every 3 teaspoons of fresh herbs you will use 1 teaspoon dry. One reviewer said the dumplings were dry. I made several size dumplings and found if too large the middles tend to be dry. The perfect size seemed to be a spoonful about the size of a small walnut. My family loves dumplings so I made extra. The dumplings use the broth so the more dumplings the less broth left for your gravy. Next time I will use more broth to start. At this point you will take out the dumplings and chicken. I pulled apart my chicken, removed the bones and skin and returned the chicken to the pot. When it says to press out the “veggie liquid” that means to strain your juices with a strainer then press the onions and celery in the strainer so you don’t have large hunks in your gravy but still have the juices and flavor from them, then dispose of the remnants from the strainer. The recipe did not designate how much flour to add to thicken the broth to gravy. I just went a tablespoon at a time and whisked it in and waited a minute and repeated till it thickened up."

So I just added a touch more flour. That was fine. I'm sorry, but I did not like the dumpling recipe. I did it just as said, and they came out so dense....like 'Klumplings' not dumplings. So, I made up another batch right away, folding my flour mixture into the wet ingrediants [also doubled the amount of milk] and they were only slightly better the second time. So frustrating! When I was little, my grandma used to take me to a restaurant on the south side of Chicago named \"Shay Joey's\" [sp?]. They had dumplings there that were light and fluffy - like a fresh baked dinner roll!!! They were amazing!! I need to find a recipe like that! Maybe I should be looking for a recipe that contains yeast?? I'll still be book-marking this recipe though. =]"
