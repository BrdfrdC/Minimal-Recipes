For those of you saying it does not set, you must stir constantly and cook on medium/high heat until it comes to a low boil. Once it starts bubbling it has usually thickened. And then u take it off and add coconut and vanilla. Put it in the pie crust and let it cool. Then I stick it in the refrigerator for awhile and then put the topping on it."

I, as many suggested, substituted the milk for a full can of coconut milk and topped it off with whole milk to total 3 cups. I DID toast the coconut. It was amazingly delicious and simple to make! If I could make 1 change, I’d add an additional 1/2 cup of sugar."

I used pastry pride to top it with and that was delish!! Not too sweet!"

I used half heavy whipping cream and half coconut milk for the base and substituted corn starch for the flower. What really helped me was to watch a video of the pie being made on YouTube which provided me with extra info that isn’t in these directions. For example, this recipe just says to combine all the ingredients in one pot and bring it to a boil. Well it’s slightly more complicated than that if you want a good result."

I followed the suggestions offered and substituted coconut milk for half of the liquid. I used 1 1/2 cups coconut milk and 1 1/2 cups half and half, which made a more coconut taste. I didn't need 1/4 cup of toasted coconut for the topping. Next time I make this I will use 7/8 cup of toasted coconut in the filling and 1/8 cup for the topping."

I made it shortly before Easter and wanted to decorate it to look like a nest with Easter eggs on top; consequently I added crushed pretzels to be the sticks in the nest. The pretzels actually worked really well, flavor-wise, with the pie. So if you're a fan of salty-sweet desserts, try incorporating pretzels on top or in the crust."

Just know that once it starts to brown, it browns very quickly because of the sugar. Stir, my little monkeys! Stir!"

I used 1 can coconut creme to replace half n half, then topped off with about 1 cup ½ n ½ as done by Shae1228 in her comment from 2017. I also used 3 yolks to replace the 2 eggs and corn starch to replace the flour. I don't like a lot of coconut in my pie, so I use only ¼ cup or less. I top it off with homemade whipped cream and toasted coconut. It's a hit. Everyone raves about it and insists I bake it for everything. My husband doesn't even like coconut, and he eats half this pie every time I bake one! Thanks Shae for the tips!"

The pie came out great, although I never got the custard to come to a boil. It still thickened up well enough, and set in about two hours."

"reviewBody": "This was absolutely delicious. However, I was afraid it might not turn out so good because it didn't set up properly in the beginning. After the 4 hours that it says to leave it in the fridge, I checked it and it was very runny. So, I left it overnight thinking it would be better in the morning. Unfortunately, it wasn't better in the morning. So, I scooped all the filling out into a pan and stirred on low heat until it was warmed up and then started adding just a little cornstarch at a time until it thickened up the way I wanted it. This was my first time making coconut cream pie and it was, like I said, absolutely DELISH! The only thing I did differently was add the entire tub of cool whip instead of just a cup that the recipe calls for. My hubby and my mom both loved it too. I will definitely be making it again using this recipe."

"reviewBody": "This is one of those pies everyone will remember you by. It’s going to call your name in the middle of the night from your fridge if there’s any left. You absolutely will sneak in to eat some. Modifications include: use entire can of Thai coconut milk and add half and half to make three cups. I used unsweetened coconut flakes and only toasted the topping ones. I also added more flakes to the custard by about 1/4 cup. I used a touch over 1/3 cup cornstarch instead of flour. I used two eggs and one additional yolk. Also I used the microwave whisking every minute until thick pudding consistency. (5-6 minutes). I bought a frozen deep dish pie crust and pre baked as instructed but don’t use the Gram cracker kind?. Make your own whip cream and be careful not to add too much powdered sugar. I can’t imagine how sweet this pie would be using suggested sweetened coconut. Use unsweetened! I would have used a bit of coconut extract in the whipped cream if I had some. I used vanilla extract. About 1/4 tsp. Usually buying frozen pie crust gives you two which will give you one shallow second pie. The recipe yields extra filling. Make one today! Make sure it came out properly by consuming the shallow pie when no one is home..."

I believe the only mistake I made was to measure the flour and then sift it (flour today seems a bit heavy and lumpy). But after sifting I remeasured (the sifted flour was much more than the recipe required). As a result the custard did not get as firm as I would have liked. But nonetheless everyone loved the recipe and so did I. Perhaps the flour error was not an error."

The frozen Marie Callendar is the very best one to use for any regular pie crust. I am not a graham cracker crust lover and have found the new Diamond walnut crust perfect for this recipe. There is also pecan which I haven't tried yet...both in the ready crust area. They are very mild, light, and only slightly sweet, which I prefer."

Like many other reviewers mentioned, I used one can of coconut milk, and used heavy cream for the balance of the 3 cups of milk called for. I also subbed 3 egg yolks for the whole eggs. Finally, I made this in a double boiler which ended up taking about 30 minutes to fully thicken (175 degrees). I’m not sure if the double boiler is necessary, it’s just a nice insurance measure if you’re worried about overheating and curdling."
