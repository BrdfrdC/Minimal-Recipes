"reviewBody": "I am soooo disappointed in this cake. It was time-consuming making the streusel topping, cinnamon/flour filling &amp; cake. I thought it would be wonderful because of the 3 eggs, 8 oz. sour cream, 2 sticks of butter &amp; 3/4 cup milk. It was DRY to me. I've had moist cakes before. This wasn't one of them. The streusel was crunchy, but almost too hard, and even though I almost 50% more the filling it was hardly there. This was time-consuming, very expensive to make &amp; a waste. I can't comfortably give it away. I told my husband if he doesn't want it, I'm dumping it. Sorry, but just no."

"reviewBody": "I followed the recipe to a \"T\" and it was just okay. The cake didn't have enough flavor and wasn't sweet enough. The cinnamon layer in the middle wasn't that good either. I think it should've been only brown sugar and cinnamon versus cinnamon, brown sugar, and flour. The streusel topping was good though but not enough to compensate for the rest. Overall, the cake was just okay. I have to say that I was disappointed."
