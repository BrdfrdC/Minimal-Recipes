I own a bakery/meals to go kitchen and plan on using this in my business to offer customers! I use 5-6 lemons, whatever I have and it still turns out great. Thanks for a fun easy recipe that even my kids can enjoy helping make!"

I sieved the pulp, got about 2 cups of juice from 6 lemons, using your recipe came up with a jug of Lemonade. With the rest of the pulp, I heated it slowly combining it with organic raw sugar. Most of it dissolved then did a final seive and it came out as nice as the first batch. Love the taste and experience. Thank you."

Do 1 cup on lemon juice which is more accurate than 6 lemons since they do vary.\n\nIf you don't like the way it tastes you can always easily adjust it. To me this base recipe was perfect and I loved it. I had 2 extra lines in the refrigerator so I added those in as well. \n\nI have tried the popular \"State Fair Lemonade\" which is supposedly the best, but I liked this better and was less work and faster!"

I hand squeezed the lemons with a simple juicer, running them in the microwave for thirty seconds (making sure to turn them occasionally) and squeezing lightly before cutting them to juice them. I also boiled one cup of the water to dissolve the sugar into. (Since I was halving it, it was a half cup of sugar into one cup of water. I'd suggest anyone else doing this to dissolve the sugar in twice as much water, so one cup of sugar in two cups, etc.) Used ice cubes to chill the lemonade. Maybe it was a little strong as I didn't measure the resulting juice, so maybe I had some exceptionally juicy lemons, but I liked it."

Then wound up doubling it because I had the extra lemons and wanted about 1/2 gallon.\n\nI will note that it does need to be chilled overnight for the best flavor. But wow is that refreshing! Just shake it up really good before serving. No issues with gritty sugar texture as I noticed in a cooler other reviews."

Our six lemons gave a little more than the cup of juice required, but we just used it all since this variety isn't as tart as some others. We served it over crushed ice - great and easy; we would definitely make this one again. Very happy not to have to boil anything or make a simple syrup like other recipes require."

"reviewBody": "I think you mean to say a Half Gallon container. A gallon is 16 cups: a half gallon is 8 cups. 1 cup sugar and 1 cup lemon juice plus 6 cups of water will be just over 7 cups, leaving around a cup for ice, and fit very nicely in a half gallon. I made it in a gallon pitcher, which was very difficult to find and buy, and it looked so empty I thought you must mean to add a half gallon of ice, but the lemonade got very waterey and weak. Next time I made it in a half gallon pitcher, which most pitchers are so it was easy to find one, and just poured it straight over a glass of ice and it was great! I think you made a mistake telling us to make it in a gallon container and you should change the instruction to making it in a half gallon container."

Then put ice and water, followed by the lemon juice. Even though I modified it for my family I still give it 5 stars."

"reviewBody": "It would be helpful to put the number of ounces, cups, or whatever when writing a recipe that is all about balance. 6 lemons -( huge ones, big ones, medium, small, tiny?) Is too broad for me. Size is subjective and amount of juice in one lemon could be 1/4 the amount of another. I ended up with sour sour lemonade. Added sugar, then water but it never was just right.... Ratios Ratios Ratios! (Like location in real estate, LOL!)"

Taste just like the lemonade at the fair, everyone loved it."

I followed advice from a previous reviewer and boiled the sugar in one cup of water in the microwave to eliminate grittiness. I put the pulp from the lemons into the pitcher. Only needed 4 lemons to get one cup of juice but used 5 for extra flavour. I sliced up the sixth one and put slices on a wooden skewer in the pitcher. Thank you for this recipe."

One thing I did when I made this recipe was that I used one less lemon, but that's just because I like my lemonade to be more sweet than tarty. I also mixed the sugar with one cup of boiling water so that it would melt. But that meant I had to put the lemonade in there fridge overnight for the pens cup of hot water to cool down."
