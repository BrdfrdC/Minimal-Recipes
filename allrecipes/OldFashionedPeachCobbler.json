I didn't have lemon or orange juice so I used what I had on hand, Body Armor Orange Mango (the flavor of the sauce was good). Also after reading some reviews I used a slotted spoon and laid the peaches in the baked crust then added some liquid. I'll update my review after tasting the finished cobbler."

"reviewBody": "I wouldn't change much- double the crust, and cook the fruit to get it to the right thickness before making the cobbler. My mama always made extra dough so she could bake several narrow strips while the bottom crust baked. Then as she was adding the filling she would lay those strips throughout the cobbler. Mama made the best and this is as close as I have found. Oh my!!! Hers was a little bit of Heaven in a 9 X 13 baking dish!!!"

I just don't have her recipe. I don't really care for cobblers with the biscuit topping. I was looking for a cobbler with crust and came across this recipe. \n\nThis one has wonderful flavor with the combination of orange and lemon juice and the combination of spices. I added 3 tbsp of cornstarch( I prefer firmer cobblers). Thank you for a wonderfully flavored peach cobbler."
