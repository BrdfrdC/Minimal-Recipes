All about personal taste for additions. This recipe as written is a 5 star as far as a good comfort home cooked recipe."

Doubled all the ingredients. By accident I got the Walmart brand sweet relish and that was surprisingly incredible tasting! Perfect amount of sweetness for this potato salad. Love this recipe ❤️ We eat a lot of different potato salads and this is by far the winner"

Added the eggs to the boiling potatoes, removed after 12 minutes, and chilled in ice water. Pulled the skins off the cooled potatoes, returned them to the cooking kettle, and chopped with the eggs, celery, red onion, and 1/2 cup red pepper. Made the dressing in a separate bowl, increasing the mayonnaise to 3/4 cup, used a heaping 1/2 cup sweet pickle relish and a heaping tablespoon Dijon ground mustard. The rest of the seasonings as per recipe. Taste tested b4 adding to the potato mixture. If too dry, add more mayonnaise. Easy to make and cleanup. Is my new favorite potato salad."

I left out the celery (because I'm not a fan) and used finely chopped sweet pickles. I used garlic powder not garlic salt and I used celery seeds instead of celery salt (both because they were what I had on hand). I added a a pinch of kosher salt to make up for it. It hasn't been \"marinating\" very long and it's delicious. I can't wait until tomorrow's portion! This is definitely bookmarked, printed and the link send to my own email. THANK YOU!!!"

In addition to the mayo, I added about 2 Tbs. each whole milk yoghurt &amp; yellow mustard. Blend veggies and dressing well before adding the potatoes (still warm) &amp; chopped eggs. Slice two hard boiled eggs into rounds and place on top of the salad, sprinkle with smoked paprika &amp; optionally place olive slices on center of yolks."
