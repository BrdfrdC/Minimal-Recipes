I do not consider myself a novice cook, I have been cooking many years and although I have a good custard rice pudding recipe, I decided I wanted to try something different. BIG, BIG mistake, as others stated it was eggy, and even though I stirred every 15 minutes the first hour and sprayed the dish the rice stuck to the bottom of the it. I followed directions exactly and read the reviews and thought the reviews that were critical did not beat the eggs enough or didn't stir during the first hour, wrong. It is just not an edible custard rice pudding...of course it's just my opinion."

"reviewBody": "SWEET OR SAVORY: What a truly amazing recipe! I was looking for a way to use extra 1% milk we had purchased by mistake. I used light brown sugar and the water bath some reviewers recommended. We loved it, and I will make a few tweaks in the future. I'll decrease the amount of sugar, leave out the raisins (which I usually love), add 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and perhaps double the vanilla. I'm also thinking of adding the vanilla after the first hour of cooking to decrease the amount of vanilla evaporation.\n\nBut most exciting, I will make a savory version: No sugar. After first hour of cooking, add about 1/4 pound of uncooked sliced mushrooms, a few scallions thinly chopped, and about a quarter pound of shredded cheddar cheese. I think this might be even better. If you have made a savory version, I'd love to hear about your experience."

If I make this again, I will try the water bath and maybe add some cream and more spices (more nutmeg, cinnamon) like other reviews suggested.

I did what other reviewers suggested, and used 5 cups of milk (I actually used 1 c heavy cream, 3 cups 2% and 1 cup whole milk) and the 3 tsp of vanilla (I used Madagasgar Bourbon vanilla). It would have been dry otherwise I am sure. I also used 1 tsp of cinnamon, orange-essence cranberries instead of raisins, and Jasmine rice because I didn't have any regular rice. I used a heaping 1/2 cup. I melted my butter before mixing it in. I did make sure to stir several times the first 45 min. or so. Then I let it cook just under 2 hours. Took it out and let it sit for 3 hours because that is when we got back from Christmas Eve dinner. It was absolutely wonderful and everyone raved. I put a little cream on mine, but it wasn't too dry. It was just right. Thanks for the recipe and the tips, everyone. This is a keeper!"

I've always made rice pudding before where you temper the egg before adding it to the mixture, I thought this might be ok since the egg would come up to temperature with everything else, but it never got creamy, just eggy. I think I'll stick with the Classic Minute Rice Pudding and Creamy Rice Pudding recipes from this site, they seem to work best for me."

Not only does it add extra moisture, but it adds a really nice creamy, sweet taste. The evap. milk also helps to brown the top just a bit (this is the part we all used to fight for). I will definitely make this recipe, but not without adding the evap. milk near the end. :) Thankyou for the recipe."

Tender belly needed tender lurving.\n\nI was without any measuring spoons or cups and all was done by eye. A bit of an \"OOPS!\" on the vanilla essence - elbow went a little high. I thought it would be too vanillaish but by the time it finished in a little under two hours it was great. Maybe a little dry but that is probably a new oven running a bit hot.\n\nWill probably raise rating to 5 stars when I do it again."

My mother-in-law always made rice pudding and since she has passed away, I was looking for a simple rice pudding recipe that didn't involve scalding the milk. I followed the recipe and used 1% milk, covered my pan and stirred twice while baking. The pudding has a smooth, sticky texture which was perfect. As a Swedish tradition, we leave out the raisins and serve the rice pudding with cinnamon, sugar and cream. This easy recipe will now become our family tradition for Christmas."

"reviewBody": "My mom used to make oven rice pudding with just uncooked rice, milk, and sugar, but we can't figure out how she did it. So I was looking for an oven rice pudding recipe that starts with uncooked rice. I found this recipe, and it's excellent! I made it as stated, with the raisins, except I substituted Splenda for sugar and it worked just fine. I halved the recipe and used a 1 quart dish, and it's done a little sooner than the time stated. Also, I recommend preparing this in a bain marie: place the baking dish in a larger baking pan like a lasagna pan, and add boiling water to the larger dish (not the recipe itself)--this is a classic technique for preparing custards with a nice texture that don't dry out. This recipe is a keeper. In fact, I need help to STOP making it because I like it so well. Sorry Mom, this one is better! Thanks, Juanita."
