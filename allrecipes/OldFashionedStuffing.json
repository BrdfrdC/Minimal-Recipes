I sautéed the onion/celery in butter and added that, broth, sage, salt and pepper to the bread bowl and adjusted seasonings - more sage - before adding an egg. I added a bit more broth for the right consistency and baked it in the oven. It was perfect. Thank you for this great basic old- fashioned recipe, like Mom’s!"

I only had fresh sage and added fresh thyme and celery leaves and used minced garlic in the onion/celery mix. Didn’t drain. Let it sit for about an hour before baking. Stirred it half way through cooking time, and added a bit more chicken bone broth. Wow, thank you for an easy and delicious recipe!"

Only variation is we didn't toast the bread pulled it apart out of the wrapper and we didn't cook onions and celery it cooked as it baked . Don't make to wet or it will be tough and for added hight add a teaspoon of baking powder to the broth and mix until smooth then pour it in bread. It's the best dressing. Love to cook it still today. My kids always ask for it at family get together"

I use half and half--Pepperidge Farm country loaf, cut into cubes and left out overnight and a bag of sage-flavored prepared stuffing mix. I also buy some turkey parts (legs and wings) the week before and make my own rich turkey broth, browning them with onions, carrots and celery in a 500 degree oven until they're very brown and then adding chicken broth and baking overnight in a 250 degree oven. This makes all the difference and I have the juices from the turkey to use in the gravy ( I also use the leftover broth that I've made if I want a lot of gravy). I'm told my dressing is always the best part of the dinner!"

I use more broth...3 to 4 cups, and the best results come from using broth and drippings from your baked turkey. I also add about two cups of diced turkey...those little tender niblets you can get from the neck and wing meat. Our \"clan\" family always made a huge pan of plain dressing plus a pan of oyster dressing on Thanksgiving day. My grandmother never wrote down her recipe either, but one day I stood in her kitchen with paper and pen and asked her to tell me the best she could. So glad I did. Been making it for years!"

When she taught me to make this, there was no measure on the broth. Her instructions were to add the broth in, cup by cup and when I could take two hands, grab some stuffing and form a softball size ball that held together, that was enough liquid. I have used the same \"measurement\" for 30+ years and everyone loves it. Always moist. Enjoy!"

I used 1/2 stick of butter, used mostly whole wheat bread, and also added the extra teasp. of sage, about 2 Tablesoons dried parsley, and 1 teasp. of thyme. Got a compliment immediately. Oh yes, I almost forgot, I took the advice on 'staling' the bread. After toasting, 4 slices in microwave for 1 min. will take care of making your bread nice and stale (I chopped easily with a large knife)."

I did have to double the broth content and the amount of sage. It turned out amazing!"

I also used a little more stock because I didn't want it to be dry, I just kept adding more stock as it was cooking. Also save some stock if you are reheating it or making this in advance, the stock really helps the flavor to stay in and the stuffing to not dry out when it is reheated."

As well I added my spiced to the Bacon mixture while it was cooling down, this seemed to let the spices meld better..In my opinion of course.. Thank you for this great recipe all!

I was looking for a recipe similar to what my mom used to make as she has passed and no one had her special recipe. i had, however, remembered her addition of Tennessee Pride sage or mild sausage and chicken bits. I added 1lb of mild saugage, cooked and crumbled and i crockpot cooked chicken breast. another change was that i used a sage mixture that included thyme and majorine, (sp). I also ended up having to use 5 cups of broth in order to make the mixture more wet. Overall, a great starter recipe and i'm glad I found it so I can tweak it a little here and there to make it just like my mom used to make it!"

Didn't have time to dry out the bread the night before, so I sliced it up, laid the slices flat on a cookie sheet, and stuck it in the oven at about 200 degrees for an hour or 2 to dry it out. The French bread made all the difference, and gave the stuffing a fabulous, chewy but not wet texture. Friends at the potluck raved about it. I did add some chicken broth halfway through, like others did."

Sorry, Mom, this is better than yours (it's a good thing she doesn't use the internet, huh?) I halved this recipe, as this was just to be served as a side dish for our \"Thanksgiving in July\" dinner (3 adults and 2 picky kids), and we had enough left over to freeze for another meal--I hope it freezes well! Anyway, I only made a few changes (as usual): I used homemade corn (flavored) bread from the bread machine, which I cut into small cubes rather than crush w/rolling pin; I added chopped celery tops with a small, diced stalk, one finely diced med carrot and 1/2 a diced green apple, I also used 1/4 red onion and 1/4 reg onion. When sauteeing the veggies, they looked so colorful and smelled so good, that I might end up creating some type of salad that I serve just as is. I ended up having to use 1-1/2 cans of chicken broth to get the right consistency, which when cooked came out perfect-not too mushy, not too dry. As suggested by BobL, DON'T drain the veggies mix, mix the egg in w/broth before adding, and I just mixed this w/my hands, as it's the way I always saw my mom doing it, and seemed like the easiest way. Great taste and really pretty easy to make--I'll be using this for the real Thanksgiving meal this year, as my mom doesn't cook the family meal anymore and my husband says his mom never could make dressing that wasn't from a box (thank goodness she doesn't use this si"

However, to indulge my wife's Mother's recipe I made couple of addtions in ingredients as well as sequence steps:\n\nWithin the celery volume I added cellery leaves.\n\nI added 1/2 cup of minced parsley.\n\nI shortened the drying time by first toasting all the bread to a light brown color...and then placing the slices in a large casserole dish in the microwave on a medium setting for 5 minutes. Then repeating it as needed until the bread was rigid when the microwave power was interrupted by opening the door and checking. That saved the 24hr drying time and brought it down into about 20 minutes.\n\nI did not use a rolling pin to crush the bread into total crumbs, but crushed it by hand until there were crumbs and pieces in the bowl. Pieces were never larger than the average thumbnail and there were a lot of crumbs.\n\nAfter placing the crushed bread in a bowl, add the dry ingredient-spices and thoroughly mix them together before adding the eggs and chicken broth.\n\nThen mix the eggs and chicken broth together before adding to the crumb-spice mixture.\n\nThen add the results of the sauted onion-celery mix without draining it.\n\nAdd more water if needed at this point so the resultant stuffing is moist and clumps together, but is not a mushy mess.\n\nFour family traditions loved it!!"

I've never made my own stuffing before, though, either, so I have a feeling that was the fault of the cook. I love the taste, however!!! I stuffed some in a chicken, and baked the rest. I liked the flavor of the stuff in the chicken more. I am going to keep trying this until I get it right!! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!"

Since I scaled the recipe down, I omitted the egg, which would have been 1/2 of an egg, so my allergic baby could enjoy some as well...and he did ;) Thanks Lynn."
