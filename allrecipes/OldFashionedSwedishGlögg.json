I divided the wine and liquor by five -- 1 bottle of port and 1/5-bottle (5 oz.) each of bourbon and rum -- but used the same amount of spices as called for in the recipe. Put the spices in the percolator basket, turn it on and let it run its cycle. I made this on Christmas Eve. I measured out the ingredients ahead of time so it was quick and easy to make. People loved it, especially the way the alcoholic fumes go up your nose when you drink it."

I use the same wine and spices, however, I cut the liquor to one 750 ml liter of brandy. The advice given is very good, use really cheap liquor and wine, the spices completely rule the flavor. I also cook this is a 30 cup percolator putting the sugar, spices and fruit in the basket. I also cut up and use a whole orange. By the time it perks thru its done. Serve from the coffee pot so it stays warm."

It makes a LOT, so I cut it roughly in half but used about the same amount of spices. (And for a very non-Scandinavian touch, I used some watermelon-infused vodka I had on hand from a summer party and substituted dried cranberries since I was out of raisins.) It was a huge hit Christmas eve!\n\nGreat idea about pouring back into the bottles for storage, BTW."

This is by far the best one to date. I don't even drink bourbon, but enjoy including it in the glögg. I'm still trying to grasp how good this recipe works. It's simply the best! That said, I made one modification: I doubled the amount of cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves. I also don't put the spices in a cheese cloth...just strain after it has cooled down a bit."
