Definitely added sugar (combo of brown and white) and used vanilla flavored almond milk with a bit of heavy cream. I used only 2 eggs. My family loved it and said it was not too sweet. The pie should jiggle slightly in the middle when done and sit for several hours to solidify. Actually, it tasted even better the next morning."

I thought it was wonderful. I used a no-roll pie crust recipe that I found here, too. (didn't have any shortening in the house) I really liked this pie and will make it again. We ate it warm, with vanilla yogurt, for breakfast. This could become our Day-After-Thanksgiving breakfast tradition."

"reviewBody": "I too am surprised anyone would blindly make this without adding sugar, although I'm not convinced that the ommission of sugar by Lisa was an accident. That said, I would never, ever use canned sweet potatoes to make this pie or any pie. Nor would I boil them. I bake mine to maximize the natural sweetness and flavor that sweet potatoes (actually Yams) are famous for. Yes, it's more of a hassle that way but if I was only after convenience then I'd buy a ready-made pie instead of making my own. I added the sugar amounts suggested by diab96 and also added more clove and less nutmeg than the recipe calls for. Not quite a complete swapping of the two amounts but about halfway inbetween that and what the recipe calls for. Sorry, no exact measurements. I tend to wing it and forgot to write down the precise amounts. I also added 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract (real, not the fake stuff)."

I did add 1/3 cup sugar bc I was making it for a birthday party and didn't want to disappoint the sweet tooths. Next time I will make it without sugar, though, bc I prefer things a little less sweet when the flavor is so good otherwise. I also used unsweetened rice milk bc there's a dairy allergy in my family, and that probably added a bit of extra sweetness."

"reviewBody": "This is the recipe we were looking for!\nIt's brilliantly simple, plain everyday food. Such a refreshing change from all the recipes whose overuse of sugar masks the nice flavors of the other ingredients. This pie is not sweet enough to qualify as \"dessert\" for lots of folks, but for me it's quite sweet enough and is a very nice way to eat sweet potatoes. For those wondering how much fresh sweet potato will yield the 2 cups of mash needed for each pie, we found that baking about 1 1/4 pound of potatoes per pie was about right. Bake in a covered dish with the skins on, let them cool, peel and mash.\nWe made a whole wheat pastry flour and \nlard crust that makes this pie a yummy\nearthy meal in itself."
