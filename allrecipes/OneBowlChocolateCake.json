It has a rich chocolate taste, it's moist, and so soft. The only real problem I had, was my own fault; I forgot to put down parchment paper, so the cake stuck to my pan and had to come out in pieces.

Whichever your store has. I also had to use nesquick in a pinch for coco powder and I actually liked it better. If you want it to come out of the pan looking pretty, do not wait the suggested 10 minutes! Wait 3-4 minutes and be careful. I usually use a toothpick to go around the edges, Then softly plop it onto the dish you want it on. Brace it with your hand if you need to. This cake is very moist but it also breaks easily!"

I made a sour cream frosting with just sour cream, chocolate powder and stevia sugar and it came out really well and went well with the cake. I will definitely make it again in the future."

"reviewBody": "SEE A REVISION OF THIS REVIEW BELOW: I really liked this simple recipe. In fact, it gave me renewed hope in cakes, because fundamentally, I'm just not a \"cake\" guy. I'm 70+ years old now, and throughout my life, dating back to the early 50s, the women in the family always made pies (not cakes), and if you asked the men, they'd all say, it's because cakes are just too dry! Not this one! This recipe yields a nice, not too dense, flavorful and moist cake. The problem is, like nearly ALL cake recipes that I've encountered over the years that utilize oil of any kind (corn oil, vegetable oil, etc.), they sag or collapse in the very middle, no matter how small a pan you use, and this even includes things like cornbread. Sag, sag, sag! This is a \"fatal\" flaw in my view, as it causes a 1/2\"-3/4\" deep crater in the middle of each 9\" round cake, that ends up pooling the icing, and I have not yet found a way to resolve it. Very frustrating! Otherwise, this is a fantastic and simple recipe. And let me be both fair and clear . . . I do not believe the sagging issue to be related solely to the oil or to this recipe or others. I think it's more a matter of elevation, oven temp, excess baking soda/powder or other things known to cause such sagging. REVISED: 01/20/2023 I tried this simple recipe again yesterday and it turned-out \"flawless\"! Absolutely flawless texture, moisture and flavor. I followed the recipe precisely, other than increasing the cocoa to one full cup, and baking at 360-degrees for 32-minutes (instead of the 350-degrees called-for by recipe). I greased and floured both pans, followed by parchment paper, then a light coat of PAM spray, and there was no sticking to either pan. The only change that I plan on trying in the near future is adjusting the total quantity of the final mixture. This most recent attempt led to two 9\" round cakes that were each only about 1.5-2.0\" tall in the finished pans, making the final (iced) cake height only about 4.5\" high. I would like to increase this height to 5.0-5.5\", without doing a third cake, so I'm going to try multiplying the quantities or volumes of all components by a factor of 1/4 (0.25)."
