"reviewBody": "I spiced up chicken thighs the way I like them and then quick pan seared them. I sautéed a couple of chopped celery sticks, a medium onion and a large shallot in the same pan until tender. I deglazed with about a half cup of white wine and then added another half cup of bone broth. I stirred that all into the rice/mushroom soup mixture. It was very good, but a lot more work and mess. I just had the stuff on hand and was in the mood to cook. If I was not in the mood to cook, I probably would add Lipton soup to the recipe and leave as is. I used a full cup of rice. I cooked @ 350 for 45 min, but my oven is a bit hot. The chicken temp came out perfect. It is a good recipe because you can easily make it your own if you like, or just enjoy it as is."

I also seasoned my rice mixture and used chicken broth instead of water.. I also used two 1 cups rice instead of 3/4 as listed. I seasoned my chicken breasts very well and let sit for 10 minutes giving the seasonings time to marinate. I partially steamed mixed veggies and added to the mixture as well and cooked mine on 385 for 1 hr 15 minutes. Some of the rice was undercooked so next time I will adjust cooking time. Other than that, this meal was a family hit with my adjustments!"

Once I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, so I used a jar of Alfredo sauce that I had on hand. I always season chicken before I cook it, and I add Worcestershire sauce to everything. To make it a one dish dinner, I add a frozen vegetable mix which also livens up the rice. My son eats seconds and takes leftovers for lunch the next day. It's a keeper!"

Then I also add chopped celery, carrots and onions, Italian seasonings and season the chicken with a pre-blended spice mix. This makes it more of a meal and adds a lot of flavor while making the rice creamier."

I added 1 tbsp of soy sauce to the rice and used a rub for the chicken made from 1 tsp Lawry’s, 1 tsp garlic salt, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp paprika, and a little black pepper left over from what I had ground for the rice. I seasoned the chicken, put it in the pan, and sprinkled the rice with the remaining seasoning, although I still threw out a pinch or two of seasoning. These were all modifications of Monica Keiffer’s modifications. I used bone in chicken thighs instead of breasts, so maybe that is why Monica’s rub made the dish way too salty for me."

"reviewBody": "Recipe as written is very bland. With the suggested changes by other reviewers it is awesome. I mixed one can cream of mushroom, one cup water, one spoon chicken base, one cup rice, 1/2 T Worcester sauce, 1/2 T minced onion, 1/2 garlic powder together. Seasoned chicken breasts well, then cut in strips and mixed in. Baked at 375 for 40 minutes covered, then set on counter for 5. It was perfect.\n\nI also browned some fresh mushrooms in butter and mixed them in about half way."

It came out perfect. The rice is soft and it had the perfect amount of moisture all around. I also used a cup of vegetable stock because I had some on-hand that I needed to use instead of 1 cup of water."

"reviewBody": "I like the one-dish idea, but it's a little bland. Here's how to make it more flavorful: up it to 1-1/3 cup of rice, eliminate the water and add 1/3 cup of wine, and either 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, or 1 can cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of celery soup. Mix the soups and wine and pour half the mixture on top of the rice (really soak the rice so it cooks well), place the chicken in the dish, pour the other half of the soup/wine mixture on top of the chicken, then top it off with a package of dry Lipton's onion soup. Bake one hour, and delish!"

"reviewBody": "My mother used to make something similar to this. I wouldn't say this is the exact recipe my mother used, but it's close. \n\nI took the advice of a few other reviewers and used chicken broth, as opposed to water, and it seemed to add a lot of flavor. I also chopped up some onion, and used some chopped broccoli, just for some extra flavor. Both seemed to work well in the dish. I left out the paprika, because I don't like the stuff. Still tasted fine. \n\nOne thing I did do was to heat the broth in a saucepan, add the mushroom soup and pepper, and let it simmer for a few minutes, then added it to the rice mixture. I'm not sure that would make the recipe any different than just adding all that into the baking dish. I just thought it would be easier to do it that way."

"reviewBody": "I made this for the first time today and I read a few reviews on the recipe before making it and so I did make a few changes and it turned out very, very tasty. I used 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth (I use Knorr's little tub dissolved in boiling water which has a really nice flavor) with 1 full cup of rinsed, long grain white and arborio rice, mixed. When the chicken bouillon was dissolved , I moved 1 1/2 cups of the broth into a 4 cup measuring cup and put the rinsed rise into the hot water and bouillon to start it cooking while I prepared the chicken. Some said that they found this recipe bland so, to the rinsed and dried chicken breasts (medium sized), I used the following spices: a sprinkling of sea salt and black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder on both sides and celery seed just on one side. I did not use paprika as I find it over-powers the other flavors. To the top side of the chicken breasts, I added just a light smear of unsalted butter. I then added the can of mushroom soup to the broth/rice mixture and stirred it well until it was all smoothly mixed and then added about two cups of frozen broccoli florets and mixed them in. I was making this just for the two of us so I used two chicken breasts and the two cups of broccoli florets. The rest of the recipe measurements works for four chicken breasts and servings as well. I poured the rice mixture into the bottom of a lightly buttered two quart casserole dish and placed the seasoned chicken breasts on top w"

Sprinkled extra spices on top of the chicken breasts once they were in the dish (seasoning salt, garlic powder, chili powder, paprika, and pepper) and covered/baked for over an hour at 375. (Took it out at 45 min and the chicken was still raw. stirred rice around a little under the chicken and bake about 10 min uncovered, then stirred the rice around a bit more, covered, and baked an additional 10ish minutes!

I couldn't find the chicken in the flavor.\nThe third time, today, it came out GREAT! I used a 16 ounce can of chicken soup broth, upped the rice to 1 cup and 5 chicken thighs, bone in, in an 8x8x2 (brownie) glass dish at 375 *F for 1 hour. I added also diced green california (ortega) chiles; 2 T juice and 2 T diced chiles strewn on top of the chicken rice mixture and baked it from there. It is gorgeous, not salty, rice light and fluffy and the all around flavor of the rice is beautiful."
