This is much easier to follow and will be my new go to recipe for spaghetti with meat sauce. The key is not to add too much spaghetti. I never have been able to determine with any accuracy how much spaghetti is in half a box because I've never seen an 8 oz. box of spaghetti. All are 16 oz. boxes. So, the amount of liquid to use is always a guesstimate."

I would make this again but probably change the order in which I add the ingredients (add the meat mixture on top of the noodles), so that everything cooks properly. I do like that the sauce was very thick and not watery. Thank you for a delicious dinner tonight. üòäüòä"

It's much too delicious to go back to the old way, where it was simply, \" eh, ok.\" I use whatever ground meat I have on hand, whether it's turkey, beef, chicken, or pork, and they're all great, and whichever spices I have,and feel like adding to the pot, have all worked out well, also!Especially loved it with beef bouillon added, too, while cooking. Absolutely a family favorite, and not only is it incredibly delicious, but it's quick and simple to make, very filling, and easy to clean up afterwards, as well, since it's all in one pot! I make pasta much more often, now that I use this recipe, and I am so grateful to allrecipe for sharing it, so that I am able to enjoy it whenever I want! Thank you!!"
