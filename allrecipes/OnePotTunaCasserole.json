My substitutions/additions were 1 1/2 cups of small elbow macaroni, 2 cups of frozen mixed veggies, 1 can cheddar cheese soup, 1 can cream of celery soup,1 cup of sour cream, 2 cans 5 oz albacore tuna ,1 can 2% evaporated milk, 10 slices of mixture of pepper jack and cheddar cheeses, 1 onion and crushed garlic sauteed in butter, and French fried onions crushed. I'm I'm a casserole lover so I did put this into a casserole dish and put crushed French fried onions on top and baked uncovered at 400 for about 20 minutes until bubbly. Left in Left in oven for 5 minutes. My husband does not like tuna casserole but I was in the mood to make one. He actually had 2 helpings and complemented me on my cooking!"

This would be a good recipe if you used 2/3 to 3/4 the noodles. I make tuna and noodle casserole a lot but thought Iâ€™d try a different recipe and it was a fail. I suggest looking at a couple other recipes because the measurements are incorrect here."

I accidentally got the cream of mushroom soup with garlic, but I think it really worked well with the recipe, you couldn't overly taste the garlic, it was just enough to give it that little boost. I used macaroni noodles instead of regular egg noodles also, I had a lot of them in the cabinet, and it worked out just fine."

Both my husband and I thought it needed more sauce, and so now I double everything but the noodles and peas; the peas, we use a 16 ounce bag. This makes a ton for us, probably about 8-10 servings, so my husband has a lot for lunches (which he loves). He served in the army and says this tastes very similar to the MREs he used to get in Iraq and uses red Tabasco to season. He says it brings back lots of great memories, minus the sand blasted face :)"

I too, have made changes to the basic recipe over the years. I use frozen peas &amp; carrots, and sour cream (instead of milk). I've also made it using a can of condensed New England Clam Chowder instead of Cream of Mushroom Soup, and it was terrific! I also add in some sliced mushrooms (either canned or fresh) since we love them. I like that you can do almost anything with this basic recipe, which is also very tasty."

I had to give it 3 stars because of the changes I made.\n\n I used 16 oz. of egg noodles cooked in UNsalted water; 16 oz of Mixed frozen vegetables that I added during during the last 7 min of cooking. (I didn't thaw first). Drained the veggies and noodles, then added a can of mushroom soup And a can of cheddar cheese soup, plus a half cup sour cream instead of milk. I didn't add salt as there's enough in the condensed soups. I used garlic powder and onion powder and freshly ground pepper. Then I stirred in a half cup of hot cheddar cheese, with extra pepper flakes, I had on hand, after shredding it. We like our tuna to be chunky, so I gently folded in 3 Cans of tuna without breaking it up down too much. Then transferred the mixture to a casserole dish and sprinkled cracker crumbs on top and drizzled it with a half stick of melted butter. Baked in 375 degree oven until bubbling and browned. Gave me time to set the table and toss a salad. We will definitely add this to our favorite weeknight meal list!"

Celery and tuna have an affinity for one another that mushrooms and tuna do not. I put tuna in bottom of microwaveable casserole dish, layer noodles, soup and cheddar cheese on top of the tuna, put a layer of cheese on top and pour milk on top of the cheese. Microwave on 60 (bake) for 8-12 minutes depending on your microwave or until the cheese is melted."

"reviewBody": "I modified it. For one, as written above with milk, the problem of dryness is solved. However, with just 1 can of soup, the milk just increases the blandness. So, to combat the dryness problem I added a can of Cream of Celery Soup too! (Came out about 2 years after the Mushroom variety). Fantastic flavor adjustment!!! After the first time I served it, my husband (a huge meat &amp; potatoes man) actually liked it, and asked if we could have again, BUT(!!!) \"could you put a little MEAT or more tuna in it?\"! Think about it, you have 8 servings, which amounts to less than 1 oz. of protein per person even with cheese added! So, I tripled the number of 6 oz. cans, of Tuna, now I simply buy larger cans of tuna. If I serve this at a potluck, for instance, everyone wants the \"recipe\"!!! Oh, another trick I learned, about 5-7 minutes before your pasta is cooked, throw in the UN-thawed peas, &amp; they impart a bit of flavor into the pasta! HTH!!! Blessings!!!"

The quantity of pasta and peas was too much, so you can either cut down on the pasta or add more tuna (about 1 can more as others suggested). I also decreased the amount of peas used. \r\n\r\nFollowing other reviews, following are some additional ingredients I added: 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon garlic, 1/2 teaspoon paprika, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, and a little bit more milk. It would have turned out too bland without these additional spices.\r\n\r\nI then put the mixture into a casserole dish, sprinkled Italian breadcrumbs and a little cheddar cheese on top, and baked it at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. \r\n\r\nNext time I would like to add coriander leaves and some additional vegetables and see how it turns out!"

I made this lighter by using light butter, skim milk and 2% cheese, and tuna packed in water. No one was any the wiser and it was delicious and very quick and easy."

It was cheap and really quite good. As another reveiw stated this is just tasty, good, affordable, basic, fast cooking. It's not meant to fancy. Thanks for featuring this recipe as I had forgotton about it after my kids left the nest. As a suggestion, for those who prefer chicken. I am sure it is fine to use the canned chicken or stop at the suppermaket on the way home to get a rotisserie chicken. This will be great with my leftover pasta. Fast and easy. Thanks!!!"

Which is fine, do what you want; but I think those people are kind of missing the point of this recipe. It's not intended to be the Best Tuna Casserole Ever. It's just like the description says: easy and fast. It's something to make when you don't have the time or gumption to make much or shop, but still need to eat, and would like the thing you eat to be as palatable as possible. So that's how I'm going to rate it. On those terms, this recipe is great: it's easy, it's fast, it contains a vegetable, and it tastes pretty good. The next time I make it I imagine I'll use two pots, one for the sauce and one for the noodles, since by the time the water boils and the noodles cook the sauce could be made."
