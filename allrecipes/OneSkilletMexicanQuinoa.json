"reviewBody": "So I decided to try this recipe. After all, Mexican food is usually robust and full of flavor and I must say, I will be making this again. I used every last ingredient on this list with exact measurements without reading the reviews. I started cooking it and as I waited for it to cook I decided to look through the reviews. To my surprise, I found that many people left out the jalapeno pepper and cut back on the crushed red pepper or chili powder etc, in fear that it would be too spicy. This made me very concerned being as how I added the exact measurements for all of the ingredients listed. I was worried that it may be too spicy and my family and I would not be able to eat this. While it was cooking I decided to give it a taste. It was definitely spicy. I felt the tingling in my throat and immediately went for the water. However, once the entire meal was cooked I served everyone with warning and we began to eat slowly at first. This was a shocker. It was not that spicy at all. It was just right. Even my picky eating daughter ate it all up. It was definitely good and knowing it was all healthy and natural made it a winner. I will use the leftovers as stuffing for tacos tomorrow and the next time that I make this I may also use one of the reviewers suggestions and add shrimp to it. Sounds good to me. \nTried to add pictures but they are too big to load."

When I make this again I will increase the crushed red pepper )we do live in Arizona, don't you know). The only other change was adding shredded chicken which I will also do again! Served with a dollop of sour cream. Fabulous, healthy and lots of fiber!"

I understand they wrote “or to taste” but I’m going off of the original recipe calling for a tablespoon and noone would eat this. Really disappointed because I’m sure this had potential but I wouldn’t know-my mouth is still on fire."

I will remake at a later date with additional changes to the cooking time and also only add 1/2 a lime and some onion. \n\nI did make a change to the submitted recipe, I only added 1 tsp of red pepper flakes as suggested and the heat of the dish was perfect for us. We do appreciate spicy food but as written, 1 Tbsp of red pepper flakes would have been way too hot"

I didn't have the type of tomatoes called for in the recipe so I used salsa instead and I didn't use a whole can of black beans or corn. ( I made it for 2 of us ) Obviously this is a recipe that can be tweaked to your family's likings. My husband thought it had too much lime zing. We juiced about 3/4 of a small lime. I will definitely make this again."

I was bored one day and just picked the first recipe that popped up. Everyone who says that it packs a bit of a punch is right, but that's easy to adjust. I like spice, but I still used only 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes instead of a tablespoon, which still left a bit of a punch. I also removed the seeds from the jalapeño and added the spices in earlier, when the jalapeño and garlic were almost ready, so that the fragrances and flavors could better meld. Just saute for a minute or under to release the essences. We added lots more lime and cilantro at the end! Even my husband, who loves very spicy, complex foods, really enjoy this. It's now in our monthly rotation!"
