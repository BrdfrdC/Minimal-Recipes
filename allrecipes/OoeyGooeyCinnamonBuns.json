Not only improved flavour, but the filling texture is improved. Raisins in the roll-up layer and walnuts instead of pecans round out my changes to equal a perfect ooey-gooey!"

Hit the dough button then carry on with the prep of filling and pans. After 90 minutes I roll out the dough and make the buns. Rise once more to double and bake and enjoy."

The other reviews are correct more gooey is required. \nThe only change I made was to put raisins in the actual cinnamon bun.\nThe actual baked cinnamon bun is kinda hard for my liking. \nI’ll stick to my own dough recipe."

I'll make it again because of the dough, but I'm not including the addition of the goop you put into the pan before you put the rolls in. Even my son was put off by all that sugar.\nIt didn't caramelize as shown on the picture, perhaps that had something to do with it but I didn't want to overbake them."

I didn’t have cinnamon, and used pumpkin spice spice instead. But with all those errors; these were the best “cinnamon rolls” I have ever tasted!!! The hubby and kids loved them; and although they were starving by the time they ate them (hence why I didn’t let them rise properly); they said it was worth the wait. So if I made these faux pas and they were still this good, I can only imagine how amazing they will be when made properly?!!"

For the 2nd rise, I put them in the oven with in on the warm setting for half the time, and it helped a lot. Didn't include nuts because I didn't have any, but I'm sure they'd be a great addition. Also didn't have a 2nd dish to invert them onto after baking, so I just poured the caramel on top of them instead of in the bottom of the dish so I could keep them in the same container. Turned out great! Will definitely try again, now that I have a better idea of what I'm doing."

I took about 1/3 cup of pecans and crushed them with a rolling pin and put into the cinnamon layer so it was rolled in. I also used a different caramel recipe where I had some heavy cream added into the caramel and cooked it until thick (about 8 minutes). Just small tweaks. Don’t be afraid to change things just a little bit when baking. Make it your own."

In the morning, I took the dough out 30 minutes before I wanted to use it.\n2) I doubled the amount of caramel sauce in the pan.\n3) Instead of putting melted butter on the dough, I combined the softened butter with brown sugar and cinnamon for the filling.\n4) I only baked for 20 minutes in a metal 9x13.

In fact, I would use a pan larger than a 9X13 because the rolls had to be stuffed into the pan and rose so much that the centers popped up above the outer layers. Overall, a good cinnamon roll but not sweet enough for me."
