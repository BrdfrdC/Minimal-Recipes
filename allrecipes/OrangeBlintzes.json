For each crepe, pour 1/4 cup of the batter into the skillet, and immediately rotate the skillet until the batter evenly coats the bottom in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the crepe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen; flip the crepe, and cook until the other side has turned light brown. Stack the crepes in a clean kitchen towel, placing waxed paper between each."

"reviewBody": "I made two minor changes: In batter, I used plain yogurt with a tsp sugar and a splash of vanilla. In the filling, I used only 2/3 C of cottage cheese (all I had left) and used graham cracker crumbs. Even with less cottage cheese, I had a lot of filling left over and had to make a second batch of batter. Hubby and I thought these were really good. 22 month old didn't like them at all."
