"reviewBody": "This was an easy cranberry sauce to put together and had good flavor. I think you will have to adjust to taste and watch the liquids you put into the cranberries. \"Water to Cover\" and \"Juice of 2 Oranges\" can vary greatly depending on the size of the pan you use and the size of your oranges or the amount of juice the orange produces. Mine actually simmered down quickly, so, I had to add a little more equal amounts of water and juice. It was also a little sweet for us, so, I would start with a little less sugar, taste, &amp; adjust accordingly."
