Smooth, creamy, melt in your mouth goodness. The butterscotch chips made it orange-ish. I added some red food coloring to the 1 cup reserved along with the orange extract. This made it a darker orange. This is a great taste that is quite different from the usual suspects (chocolate or peanut butter)."

I didn't have enough confections sugar so I only used 8 cups (because I was doubling it, it should of been 12) and it turned out great! Not grainy at all and more than sweet enough! Will definitely make this again and cut down on the confection sugar, regardless if I'm doubling the recipe or not."

I used about 4 cups of mini marshmallows instead of the marshmallow cream. I also added a glug of corn syrup to ensure no graininess. I'm in Canada and our packages of white chocolate chips come in 225 gram packs so I used one and a half to get to the 11 ounces. Next time I will be more careful with the food coloring because mine turned out pink. But this is so delicious it doesn't matter what color it is to me. It seems to be quite a forgiving recipe based on all the changes I made. Give it a go it's easy and delicious!"

And it still turned out grainy/sugary. So it's not as \"creamy\" as I would like, but it set up beautifully, great presentation on a plate, and most importantly, it tastes good and orange-y. Flavor is 5 stars, but because of the texture, I'm rating 4 stars."

I followed one reader's suggestion subbing powdered sugar for regular sugar and it is creamy, delicious and set up perfectly. Thanks for a wonderful recipe! Update! 12-18-11: I have made this recipe at Christmas time for the last three years. It turns out great every time if you use powdered sugar, granulated has always remained grainy every time I use it, but I just give those batches to people I don't like...this year, I switched out the orange extract for cherry extract and nixed the yellow food coloring and went with just the red...otherwise the recipe remained the same...Cherry Cream Fudge...HOLY YUM! This recipe is a super fun recipe to play around with, so get adventurous and try it!"

(I rub a little of the mixture between my fingers to check for the sugar being dissolved.) Also use only quality extract and use the cream &amp; butter as indicated...it makes a HUGE difference in the taste &amp; texture. This was the first to go off of my huge Christmas candy tray at the family dinner. Everyone wanted the recipe. Thank you Betty!"

Used a candy thermo AND a digital, and did measurements by weight so I was accurate and still it was grainy. And I didn't find it as orangey as it could have been either, but it was sickeningly sweet. It was however the right consistency, hence the 2 stars. What a waste (of ingredients AND time!). Did NOT make the cut for my holiday treats baskets... too bad, so sad."

"reviewBody": "I found this recipoe in a magazine several years ago and have been making it several times at Christmas every year. My insurance policy when making any fudge that is cooked like this is to add 2-3 T. white Karo. I learned this from Alton Brown on the Food Network on one of his fudge shows. It doesn't affect the taste of any fudge and the different type of sugar, or glucose, will prevent the other sugar crystals from clumping together which accounts for the graininess. You can also substitute a 10.5 oz. bag of miniature marshmallows for the marshmallow creme which makes this step a whole lot easier. This is a variation on the Fantasy Fudge that has been around for years."

"reviewBody": "One reason fudge gets grainy is because it is rushed... When heating the sugar, butter and milk start on low heat (I use simmer setting) for about 12-15 minutes until sugar is throughly dissolved (put small amount on spoon, raise out of pan, let cool a couple of seconds and rub some between your thumb and forefinger, if you feel sugar it's not dissolved yet, keep stirring), once dissolved then raise heat to med-hi to bring to a boil. If you don't rush it you will not regret it. This is true with any flavor fudge!"

Thank you Betty for this wonderful recipe!! You are certainly right.. it is an easy recipe to make fudge real quick."

The water that goes into the pan will not harm the syrup being made. This will keep sugar crystals from forming on the sides of the pan. The crystals will cause the syrup to sugar causing a grainy texture in the final product. Hope this helps. GRY"
