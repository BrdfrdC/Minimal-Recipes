Read the reviews, many said not \"orangey\" enough, so I added a healthy dose of Nielsen-Massey orange extract to both the dough and the glaze. This is a winner! Thank you, Erika!!"

I even added extra orange zest and I had to add some extra orange juice and it STILL isn't orange enough. They didn't taste that great so it wasn't even worth it."

"reviewBody": "These were quite good. I was, however, surprised that the orange flavor wasn’t more prominent. The recipe called for 2 ½ tablespoons of orange zest. I zested 2 large oranges plus a small one to get the amount required. In addition, there is another 6 ounces of orange juice in the batter. That being said, these Orange Scones with an Orange were tender and moist, and I’d make them again."

They were moist and delicious. The only thing I did different was use 1/2 plus 1/3 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of all purpose flour.\n\nDunking the scones in the glaze left a lot of zest in the bowl, so I used the back of the spoon to spread the remaining glaze and zest on the scones."

For the glaze, I used only 2 Tbl. granular sugar, 1 Tbl. orange juice, and 3/4 tsp. orange zest. Rolled it into a circle about 8 inches and cut into 8 wedges. I made it for my pastor &amp; think he will love it!"

The dough was extremely sticky and the scones were difficult to transfer to the baking sheet but they turned out incredibly light with a little crust on the bottom. The only thing I added was a pinch of salt to the glaze and extra zest throughout. Delish!"
