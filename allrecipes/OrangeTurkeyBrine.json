I don’t care for a sweet taste in my leftover turkey sandwiches or turkey salad."

I put the brine and turkey in a stock pot inside a rolling cooler and keep ice packed around it for about 2 days. I rinse the bird well before drying and loosely stuff the turkey with a quartered onion, a couple of garlic cloves, a sprig or two of fresh rosemary and one or two chopped lemons, limes or oranges, depending on what I have. The gravy from the drippings is the BEST!"

I did however, slather herb butter and all over and inside the skin. After Thanksgiving I took the entire carcass , including all of the drippings, and put them in a pot and cooked them overnight to make turkey soup. Do not add salt to this as you will not need it. This turkey was so incredibly moist it was wearing a raincoat out of the oven...lol."

"reviewBody": "This is an amazing brine. I have used it years past and it never fails. I doubled the ingredients for a 24 lb turkey. I will make a note on the citrus. If you boil the citrus with the other spices at the same time, some of the volatile (read flavorful) oils may deteriorate and become bitter. I add the citrus after boiling the other ingredients while the solution is still quite warm in order to bring the flavors together. I brine the turkey for about 18 hours. There is a very delicate citrus flavor to the bird that does not overwhelm. Be cautious about overcooking. Brining really does shorten the cooking time."

"reviewBody": "This was the first time I ever brined or roasted a turkey. The breast was incredibly moist. It was my favorite! Restaurant supply stores were closed when I was ready to brine so I bought a 5 gallon container with a lid at Home Depot (versus a food grade container), a brine bag &amp; a bag of ice. I separated the brine bag from the container with ice, as much as possible and refilled it only once before going to bed since it was a cool night. I used Alton Brown (Food Network) shorter brining times (8-16 hours) and easy cooking methods. Inserting a thermometer is key for newbies like me! The brining liquid took about 3 hours to cool down so I will make it earlier next time. I was scared of a moist but flavorless turkey, so I massaged the turkey (under the skin) with a paste of garlic, oregano &amp; a little canola oil right before roasting. It turned out great. I will make it on Thanksgiving. Thanks for sharing this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I have brined in the past but this recipe was fantastic this Thanksgiving. I will use this again. The turkey was so moist. I stuffed the turkey with an orange, lemon and an onion. I massaged melted butter all over and salt &amp; peppered inside and out. Go easy on the salt. Make sure you rinse the turkey real well before and after brining. Debra"

"reviewBody": "i used this recipe on a grocery store brand of 13# turkey that I paid $3.27 for! The turkey was moist and had a delicous flavor. I only brined it for 14 hours because I started late. I'll never hesitate again to purchase a \"store brand\" turkey knowing that brining really works!"

"reviewBody": "Amazing! I was an absolute hit at the dinner table all thanks to this recipe. I brined the turkey for 48hrs, washed it out and let it sit for an hour while preparing the stuffing. Then I put my Martha Stuart reading materials to use and stuffed the bird with help of a cheese cloth. Shortly after I lathered my hands up with butter and went to work on the bird. We squeezed a bunch of lemon on it when all was buttered &amp; ready to cook. Then, I based it a few times while cooking, but not all that frequently. The brining really kept the bird sufficiently moist and tender without the nuisance of constant basting.\n\nBoth the dark and white meat was extremely moist and tender. My family were truly amazed and we will definitely do this again next year! (now that they know what brining is)*"

"reviewBody": "My turkey came out nice and moist. I'm almost entirely happy with this recipe. The only thing I don't like is that it gets heated and needs to be cooled. To cool this safely within proper time and temperature constraints takes too much time, attention, ice, and patience than I really had on Wednesday. I wonder whether this wouldn't be equally effective without the heating step. If you're happy to do that extra work, I'd say you'll be happy with this recipe, just as I was. Next time, however, I'm going to seek out another recipe for brining."

"reviewBody": "WOW. I used a 7 pound chicken instead of a turkey for this recipe, roasted it in a roasting bag according to the instructions, then served it with some Brazilian-style black beans and rice with traditional fixings. Everyone said it was the best chicken they had ever had! Incredibly moist and great flavor.\n\nI also put the fruit and bay leaves in the cavity when I roasted it for maximum flavor. This recipe is a MUST try."

"reviewBody": "I've used Alton Brown's turkey brine recipe for 3 years. While his is great, this one is better! Easy to put together, much more economical and the taste was fabulous. I brine turkeys in a 5 gallon bucket with a lid. I reduce the liquid in the recipe and put ice in the bucket after placing the turkey in it. I set the bucket in the garage and in the cooler months the ice stays frozen overnight and well into the next day. In the warmer months I add ice as needed."
