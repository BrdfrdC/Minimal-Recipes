I did cheat and use Tropicana orange juice, since I had a huge 89 oz. container in the fridge and I was making a large quantity for my son's class party. I did squeeze lemons to get the lemon juice, though. Super easy recipe! I didn't find it too sweet with the original 1.5 C of sugar."

I initially made this recipe as written (a 4-star recipe) and thought the orange flavor was on the weak side, as others mentioned. I added the juice of 2 additional oranges as suggested by others and refrigerated it overnight. My husband tried it the next morning and thought it was perfect."

"reviewBody": "I followed the popular opinion of too much sugar and not enough orange flavor. So with that in mind, I increased the fresh squeezed orange juice to 2 cups, and I used 1 large juicy home grown lemon, I decreased the sugar amount to 1 cup, I did add about 1 extra cup of cold water. That was the right mix based on my personal taste. I love orange ade, and I haven't had it since I was a kid. Brought back great memories of my grandmother, and the occasional time my mom would make it. Something I will be drinking frequently."

"reviewBody": "Orangeade takes me back to my childhood and a hot dog restaurant in downtown Cincinnati that served the best orangeade ever. I made half a recipe but thought the orange flavor was just a little too diluted. I added the juice from another two oranges which brought the right balance between the water and the orange flavor. I thought this recipe was a little sweet, so next time I will reduce the sugar. I definitely will make again and maybe even try Splenda to reduce the calories. Nice change from all the lemonade, limeade, ice tea that I drink in summer. Whatever happened to restaurants serving orangeade???"
