I wanted a \"clean\" top to decorate for a 50th birthday so, instead of folding cookies into the cream cheese, I spread half the cream mixture on the crust, added a layer of cookie chunks, then poured the remaining cream cheese mixture on top. I reserved a handful of cookies for the final topping. I finely chopped them to dust the top of the cake. This not only concealed the cracks but provided a great backdrop for the other birthday flair I added. Overall, the cake turned out just as beautiful as it tasted!"

"reviewBody": "This was a very easy and simple to follow recipe. I ended up doing this as a birthday cake for one of my friends. I knew they were going to be a lot of people so I doubled the recipe, which ended up making 2-9” pie pans and a dozen cupcakes. Going by the normal recipe, it calls for 3/4 cup sugar, doubling that is 1-1/2 cups of sugar, so I omitted half a cup of sugar and use the Oreo filling instead which balanced out the flavor of the cheesecake. It was the perfect sweetness for the cupcakes, I used the rest of the crushed Oreo I had for the crust and placed it at the bottom of the cups. This filled half the pan, for the other 6 I used while Oreos as the crust and placed the rest of the cheesecake filling on top of them. For the filling of the cheesecake and the Oreos on top, are used peppermint Oreos which added a nice flavor to it. Upon my little cupcake experiment, both were very good but I opted to go with the crushed crust. I hope you find this helpful!"

The resulting cheesecake was tasty and dense, the way I like it. I will be making it again, but tweaking the amount of butter in the crust."

I took some other advice from 2 other reviews and added a little bit of lemon juice and I used the whole package of cookies (cream and all). It reminded me of a cheesecake brownie because the texture was a bit thick. Next time I will try making it with sour cream and see if the consistency is better. Thanks!"

Most my cheese cakes turn out spongy but this one was P.E.R.F.E.C.T. I'll make it again on special days. the cheesecae had my friends dying for more!"

It went into the oven (lowered temp to 320 degrees because of dark pan) and I let the kids takeover from there. Told them to make sure it wasn't jiggling in the middle before they took it out.\nThis morning I found it in the fridge only a few slices remaining so treated myself to some for breakfast. OMG, this cheesecake is delicious! I really don't care for \"Oreo\" anything, but I have to say, especially considering how easy it was to make, this is one of the best cheesecakes I've ever tasted. Totally rivals any Cheesecake Factory cheesecake for sure..."

For someone who has never made, much less never had, Oreo Cheesecake... the recipe does not specify enough on what to do. Obviously for the crust you have to take the cream out of the cookies, but it does not say that. \"24 Oreo Cookies, divided\". Divided what? In half? Into 3rds? One pile of 8, One pile of 16? Divided how??? That may need to be revised and reworded to prevent confusion for other first-time bakers out there!"

I changed things up a little to my own liking, but I feel like it'd be good regardless. I only used two eggs, added some heavy cream, and doubled the vanilla. I also used an obscene amount of Oreos. It was perfect. I'll make this recipe again in different cookie forms. Do it!"

After 30 minutes of arguing with my boyfriend over whether or not the white filling of the oreo should be crush up for the crust or not, I finally made the decision and did it anyway. It is not clear whether you should or shouldn't keep the cream with the crushed cookies, and in the picture it looks completely black. Well let me tell you, the crust was black and it was amazing WITH THE FILLING IN IT!! lol I love when I can prove men wrong. tehehehe (I think he secretly liked it too). P.S. I added about 2 TBL of Sour cream to my recipe after reading Ashley's review."

"reviewBody": "I give the recipe 5 stars because it is a great starter, but the recipe is unfinished. First of all, you should never have only cream cheese in the batter. I added a 14 oz can of sweetened condensed milk and a cup of vanilla yogurt. When you add the eggs, separate them first and stir the yolk and whites separately. This is a technique used for making cakes but for cheesecake will make the end result a light and fluffy cheesecake. I prefer it this way because you can really only take a couple bites of a heavy cheesecake. Then I used double oreos for everything. Double the oreo batter for the crust and double how many crushed oreos you put in the batter. Then I broke off chunks of oreos to add to the batter as well. While baking, I took the advice of another review on here and started the temp at 350 then lowered it by 25 degrees every 20 minutes while baking (bake for a total of an hour) then turn the heat off and leave the cake in the oven with the door closed for an additional hour. I didn't use a waterbath but using this method, the cheesecake came out perfectly smooth and crack-free!! It was incredible and we didn't even wait for it to cool completely before eating it because it looked so good!! Will definitely be making this again. One last note, make sure ALL your ingredients are at room temperature. Hope this helps and enjoy your cheesecake!!! :)"
