"reviewBody": "Exactly as expected. For those experiencing spreading issues, use room temp (not melted) butter and mix the butter for a couple of minutes until light and fluffy, add the sugar and, again, beat for 2 - 3 minutes until light and fluffy, mix in eggs and vanilla (I did double the vanilla, but that is personal taste) until fully incorporated. Now put away your mixer! Many measuring cups lie to you, so if at all possible weigh your flour - All Purpose Flour weighs 4.2 oz or 120g per cup ... or 270g for this recipe's call of 2 1/4 cups of AP flour. Add all of your dry ingredients and hand mix. Scoop with a #30 disher ( 1 oz, black handle) and bake in a well-preheated 375¬∞ oven for 11 minutes. I got 34 cookies."

"reviewBody": "Toll House is a great stand by for a basic cookie. I add 1/4 c. regular whole oats, (less 1/4 c. flour) chopped mixed nuts, raisins &amp; dried cranberries. I often add chop some crystalized ginger. I omitted 1/4c. regular white sugar and added 1/4 c. real maple sugar (for extra flavor). Always put cookie dough in the fridg. I like to make cookie dough rolls and cut/bake as needed. Do not thaw more than 1/2 hour on counter, cut while still very firm. Then I have fresh cookies anytime."

"reviewBody": "Absolutely fantastic recipe for a stunning first time 5 star success. I remember failing with this old recipe many years ago, but I've learned a few tricks in the past 50 years about consistency and quality in cooking. Firstly, I use a high quality all purpose flour with a proven track record. It costs more than 3 times ordinary all purpose flour (and doesn't retard or kill my pet sourdough starter--a good clue that it's better for you too!) I also weigh my flour to the gram, avoiding wide variations in the compaction and amount of flour that would occur by scooping it. These two simple tricks that I don't even think about yielded perfection in this recipe. Very high rise, thick and moist goodness! No alterations required! These were better than grandma's!"

"reviewBody": "I‚Äôve been making these for years and have a few tips for those who struggle with getting the cookies not to spread/flatten or who want a nice presentation. First use butter and eggs at room temperature. Second, do not over-mix the wet ingredients or when adding the dry ingredients. I usually add the dry in three parts, only mixing (with dough hooks) until it‚Äôs slightly incorporated. When I add chocolate chips at the end, I make sure it‚Äôs all incorporated. Third, do a test run. If the test cookies flatten regardless, use a cookie scoop to shape them and place on a cookie sheet in the freezer. Once they harden, place them in the oven frozen. It will help them maintain their shape. I also pull mine out about a minute before they are done since they will cook a bit on the tray. You can also freeze the dough into shape and place in an airtight container in the freezer for up to three months. Just pull a couple out when you want some cookies or bake when you have company."

"reviewBody": "I like a \"flat\" chewy chocolate chip cookie, and bars. When the bars come out of the oven the first thing I do is drop the pan from about a foot up onto a towel placed on my counter. This knocks them down. On the cookies I will leave out a egg if they are fluffy. I will add 2 table spoons of water to make up for moisture the egg would have added. and always add either walnuts or pecans. and split chips using half milk chocolate chips. I almost always go with making bars these days, easier to control texture and much faster with less heat in the kitchen from opening oven doors."

"reviewBody": "I disagree with allot of the reviews recommending a boat load of tweaks.....main thing to do differently is chill your dough fully. \n\nMake the dough atleast the day before baking so it will be properly chilled with fats solidified, that way the fat takes longer to melt and your cookie won't spread so much. I store mine flat and cut them into cubes. Easy. Also remember if you omit nuts the original recipe itself calls for more flour (I use chopped pecans).\n\nSometimes I put some extra chips on top the cookie before baking for looks but it's not necessary.... I follow the recipe, my eggs are still chilled, I use an electric hand mixer. I don't use bread flour or extra this and that. Cookies still come out great, classic and are always a crowd pleaser. Definitely if you want to alter it then go for it but it's not absolutely necessary."

I have only ever used the tollhouse recipe since I was a child, and when I was a child, I simply dumped the ingredients in one bowl without thinking about it. Now no matter what stove I use the dough cooks flat. Somewhere along the way, Tollhouse added sugar to their recipe to make it sweeter and for whatever reason took out the flour. Compare this recipe to other recipes on the web and you will see the same issue."

I grabbed a cake mix, shook the bag gently to make the heavier ingredients drop to the bottom and I scooped 1 cup from the top. \nSifted it down to some lumpy left in the bottom(dumped that).\nWorked great - hubby said they were \"really good\". \nI might run out of flour next time!"

They were good, but too flat and sugary. The second time, I used the high altitude version, with added flour and reduced sugar, same crisco/butter combo, same fresh-milled flour. (We are at 1700 ft.) These are sensational. I keep them in the freezer and my husband eats them cold. He and the neighbors rave about them."
