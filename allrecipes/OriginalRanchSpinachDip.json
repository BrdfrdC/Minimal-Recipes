"reviewBody": "2 disclaimers - I am not a huge fan of spinach dip and I can't stand mayo. But spinach dip is always a crowd pleaser so I hold my nose and make it. So, when I saw this receipe and realized it did not involve mayo, I had to try it and I am glad I did!! My grocery store was out of sourdough rounds so I served it in a bowl with cubed sourdough bread. It was a huge hit!! The bowl looked like it had been licked clean. This one is a keeper!!"

"reviewBody": "I first tried this recipe back in September 2012 for a Sunday dinner party and it was a big success. I have made it a couple more times since then for get togethers and myself. I do add a small amount of some strong, pungent flavored cheeses when I make it for myself because that is how I like it. The down side is I don't know the starting calorie count before I add the extra cheeses and I tend to eat more of this dip then I should. Yes it is that good."

"reviewBody": "I used my own homemade dry ranch dressing in this dip recipe and reduced fat sour cream. I did add a touch of Frank's Hot Sauce for a little kick. I wanted a more uniform dip. What I did was throw all the ingredients into my food processor and pulse until smooth. THEN, I chilled the dip for an hour before serving. I loved the combination of all the ingredients together but you know, I really think this dip could use some parmesan cheese. Not much, just a touch to give it a little bit of that flavor."
