,"description": "The legend goes that Tartare tribes when fighting in the past didn&#39;t even have time to stop and cook their food. They are said to have kept the meat underneath their saddles and mince it in this way. Today this dish is a gourmet classic. This dish is eaten like a pate, spread on a piece of warm toast with fresh tomato and onion rings on top. It is very important though to make sure that both the meat and the egg are very fresh because they are eaten raw."

"reviewBody": "Pretty good, but better if you add chopped onions.\n\nOn a side note, the word tartare means a chopped raw meat. It has nothing to do with the Tatar people of the Crimea and central Asia. The Mongols did cure their meat under the saddles of their horses when they rode, and perhaps the Tatars did as well, but that is most definitely NOT the etymology of this dish."

A++\n\nThe store's butcher (of one of the most celebrated chains in the business) advised me to select the vacuum-sealed fresh meat from a national distributor and not the store's beautiful cuts on display, as the meats are not mixed in slicing and the standards are always high."

I am allergic to eggs and don't care for onions. My husband had finely chopped onions on the side for his and we also had the hot sauce on the side to try. after mixing all the ingredients in, we put it back in the freezer for about 10 minutes to cool it and let it rest. we served it on lightly toasted baguettes and it was DIVINE!"

I will write-out and post the recipie on my kitchen wall, till I \"own\" the formula.\n\nI scaled back to a single, carnivore's meal.\nExcept; no hot pepper, and I drank the brandy.\nOh! I ground lean, well trimmed 1\" round steak, thru a 3/16 grinder screen. The rest was saved for beef stew. \n\nI raise and butcher my own Holstien Beef. The tenderloins were cut as Porterhouse Steaks."

"reviewBody": "Not sure where Steak Tartare originated, but what I do remember is how much I enjoyed it at the Russian Tea Room and Buzzy O'Keefe's Grand Central Cafe when I worked in midtown Manhattan back in the 70's. To my recollection, neither recipe included brandy. But both had tabasco, a couple of anchovies and capers....which I include whenever I make it. Even back then ordering raw beef with raw egg raised eyebrows, but it was delicious, especially with a cut of beef that had some marbelling (but not too much). I know some think you should stay away from supermarket eggs, but I think the whole raw egg fear is overkill. Yeah, you're taking risks, but you're also taking risks with raw beef."

"reviewBody": "1. Rather than grinding, I prefer to start with a whole fresh filet and separate the meat from the fascia by scraping it with the edge of a sharp knife. There is no comparison with respect to texture, presentation and flavour.\n2. I prefer Pikapeppa Sauce or Cholula to Tabasco; both have superior flavour and complexity. For a nicer presentation a food mold can be used.\n3. Adding brandy is an excellent idea, especially something interesting like Calvados.\n4. The quality and freshness of the ingredients cannot be overemphasized.\n5. The basic recipe can then be taken in a number of flavour and presentation directions with garnishes and condiments.\n6. Scallions, minced cucumber, bell pepper (any colour), capers, duxelles, chopped hard boiled egg (if you are leery about using raw eggs), etc. can be served on the side.\n7. An assortment of red, green and black cornichons (peppercorns) can add colour to the presentation.\n8. Greek Tzatziki (a mild dressing of yogurt and cucumber), or a light horseradish sauce will add additional zest if desired.\n9. As with Sushi, however, be careful not to overpower the basic delicate flavour of this dish.\n10. Flatbread, lightly oiled and pan-fried, makes a nice alternative to the usual toast points or crackers."

"reviewBody": "This is a once in a blue moon treat for my hubby and I. I'm not a meat eater, but this is the exception. I will only buy the meat from our German butcher and have him grind it. There were a couple of ingredients in this recipe that I normally don't use and I must say that they were nice additions. I don't care for egg in this so I skipped it and added finely minced onion. We served this on buttered Russian rye bread. Most German restaurants and Oktoberfests will no longer serve this, so it's nice to be able to make it at home. Delicious and thanks, Itsi."
