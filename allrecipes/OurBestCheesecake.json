I preheated my oven to 1 hour and it almost came out burnt but I stopped it at 40 minutes so I would recommend to put the timer at 40 minutes so it is not burnt and if you want you can change the crust to something that stays compact (you can but its still amazing) because it comes apart when eating but other than that it is absolutely amazing! Really enjoyed it as a beginner and I would definitely recommend to try it."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe. Very light and fluffy but you need more info than the recipe tells you. 1) gram cracker crust should go in the oven for 10 min prior to baking with batter. 2) use cooking spray or butter or shortening on the sides of your spring form pan before adding batter. 3) when you beat cream cheese and sugar together, beat until you no longer feel the sugar granules in the batter, this could take ten min. This also allows air to get into the batter that will make it light and fluffy. 4) if using a 8-9 inch spring form pan, fill the pan to the top leaving 1/8 inch for it to rise a bit. 5) allow your cheese cake to cool slowly, after an hour turn off your oven and open the door about two inches leaving the cake in the oven to cool, about 15 min. Then leave on the stove top or counter top to cool 1/2 hour. Then place in fridge for two - three hours. This will prevent from cracking and keep your cake fluffy. Hope this helps. Do be bothered by the dark top layer it’s normal."

After the hour, I turned off the oven and left the cake in with the door slightly ajar to cool gradually. Afterwards, I removed the springform ring and refrigerated it for 4 hours. It came out beautifully. A light crack on top, but perfect otherwise. You definitely need a springform pan to make this. Top it with strawberry compote, and this was the easiest cheesecake recipe!! I’ll definitely make it again."

"reviewBody": "I have made this 3 times. I read the comments and saw many pictures and to those giving this recipe a bad review... here's what you did wrong.. because I did the same thing.:\n1. You HAVE to let your cold ingredients come to room temp.\n2. A water bath isn't necessary (especially if you use a little cornstarch) but it bakes the cheesecake very delicately adding to the creamy smooth texture. All you need is a larger pan and fill with a few inches of water and set your springform pan inside.\n3. Do Not overcook. Actually, once the outside starts to puff up a little and the center is still a little giggly (like jello) you can stop baking, otherwise, you will burn/crack the top.\n3. Cool GRADUALLY! Otherwise you will crack the top. Leave sit in the oven for an hour with the oven turned off. Then remove from water bath (if you did this step) and let cool Completely on top of stove. Then refrigerate for 6 hours or ideally, overnight. If you try eating before it is completely set and cold... it will taste like quiche-cake... instead of delicious cheesecake. Anyway, after seeing and tasting it the first time... I had to see what I did wrong.. which was almost everything. With that being said, I now feel like I can open my own Cheesecake Factory. lol There is a science to it and you CANNOT rush the cheesecake process at all. Or any baking process for that matter. \n\nThis recipe is amazing and everyone I shared this with LOVED it. I even have interested buyers!"

Made the final product stable and able to stand up to the cheesecake! When I put the cake into the oven I baked it for 10 minutes at 350 and then dropped the temp to 300 and added a water bath! Hour later I had a jiggly cheesecake that hit the necessary temp and into the fridge it went! Pulled it out and it is AMAZING! Color is spot on and texture is light and airy!

I added more butter and sugar to the crumb mixer. \n\n-I pre set my crust by baking it for 10 mins at 300°\n\n-I reduced my heat throughout baking my cake. Started at 350°, half way mark 300°, then finally 200° at 20 mins left. I also allowed my cake to cool in the oven. I think reducing the heat and allowing ample cool time prevented cracks from forming."

The sour cream adds a little tartness that makes this recipe unique. Wonderful flavor with or without fruit! I’m getting ready to make it for the third time in 2 months."

I was a little reluctant to try a different one, but was extremely happy with this.....Try it, you will like it! I forgot to take a picture and it was eaten too swiftly. I did follow the recipe and I also used a water bath to bake it and followed another suggestion to bake at a lower temp then left it in oven to cool."

I had a water bath under the cake and baked it for 10 minutes at 350° and then lowered the temperature to 300° for 40 minutes. I cracked the oven door and turned the oven off for the next 15/20 minutes. It turned out perfect, creamy smooth just a little brown on the edge. We all thought it was as good as any restaurant."

"reviewBody": "This is a wonderful recipe! I've seen a few comments from others who are disappointed that the cheesecake sank after coming out of the oven. \n\nSome tips: be sure to not overmix when you add the eggs. It helps to whisk them a little before adding them to the batter. Overwhipped eggs will lead to a deflated cheesecake. Also, when your cheesecake is almost done baking, its a great idea to turn off your oven and crack the oven door open with a wooden spoon to allow the cheesecake to slowly stop cooking and eventually cool in the oven. This will prevent the cracking on top (which is usually caused by the drastic change of temperature from oven to countertop). I hope this helps!"

Turned out brown and cracked on top, rose up several inches during cooking and then went flat after being removed from the oven. The flavor was not good.

Maybe if the cream cheese was increased and the eggs were decreased it would taste better."
