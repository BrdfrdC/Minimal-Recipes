ALWAYS and I'll be honest I have never been a fan of vinaigrette's in general but I needed one so I chose this recipe based on the 5 star rating. I made it exactly as written and now it is hands down my very favorite salad dressing! It really must sit overnight to be able to taste the full flavor but once it has it is tangy, very slightly sweet, semi-thick and OH SO GOOD! I used whatever Balsamic vinegar that I had on hand which was Colavita brand and it worked perfectly. It is a tad bit spicy so that is something to keep in mind, I'm sure it came from the shallot but OMG is it good! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!"

The result was a rich, intense-tasting vinaigrette that emulsified beautifully. I think my son would drink this if I let him!! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!"

This was an easy recipe I could make with ingredients I had on hand, and I didn't have to pull out my blender. As I had read in one of the reviews, I upped the olive oil and prefer it that way. I swapped regular mustard for the Dijon and thinly sliced red onion for the shallot. I used pink himilayan salt."
