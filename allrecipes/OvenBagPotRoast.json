This created a kind of gravy that I could eat with a spoon. I added carrots, celery, potatoes, mushrooms and onions. Put the potatoes and larger carrot pieces in at the beginning. Then added the rest as the recipe suggests I cooked it just as they said, but left it in the oven at 200 for about 1 1/2 hours. I had been afraid the roast would need more time, so I put it in early. It was still perfect after staying in the warm oven."

"reviewBody": "Just made this and it's awesome. Side note - I went to the store to study the onion mix packet, and decided to skip adding the mix. Sodium in it is 600+ mg...and you're getting enough sodium in the beef consomme and Worcestershire sauce. SO, suggest adding more onion, garlic, paprika, pepper to the mix for taste. I also added about a teaspoon of natural raw sugar in with the Worcestershire/beef consomme/water mix (as it is the only thing I saw on the onion mix bag that was missing in this recipe). I also added red potatoes to the bag, and took the the cooking time (when veggies/potatoes added) to an hour, instead of 45 minutes.\n\nThe short of it is the family loved it. My wife said this tasted like her grandmother's roast. It came out GREAT!"

I've slow cooked and done on the stove top, neither can compare. The only thing I do different is add one cup of the drippings to 1 can of cream of mushroom soup for gravy. Whip up some mashed potatoes, poor gravy on them and meat. \nThis also inspired me to do my Thanksgiving turkey in an oven bag. My guests said they have never had such a moist delicious turkey."

Put in potatoes, carrots and another whole yellow onion with the vegies. I don't make pot roast because usually mine has come out dry and chewy in the past. Now it will be a go to recipe."
