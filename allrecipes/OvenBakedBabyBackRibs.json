The ribs always come out moist, tender, and super tasty Only thing I do slightly different is I don't just prick the back of the ribs, I make sure to peel off the whole (or as much as I reasonably can) membrane. I also find that the amount of rub you make is way more than you need for one rack, but I consider that more a feature than a bug and always make at least 2 racks anyway. Oh, and I tend to try and save the liquid. Great to mix into some white rice. This recipe is why I always pounce on baby backs when on sale and try to have at least a couple of racks in my freeze."

"reviewBody": "Great cooking method for ribs (slow cook wrapped in foil followed by higher temp cooking with sauce), but needs some tweaking- more initial cooking and less rub. I used 1/3 cup each of chili powder, white sugar, and brown sugar (to lessen the chili flavor), plus the other spices for the rub. I cut my ribs into pieces with 4-5 bones, used about 2-3 T per piece to thoroughly coat then wrapped each piece individually to bake. This made it more manageable. I cooked them for just over 2 hours and they were good but they would have been just perfect with a 2.5 hour low bake. Once sauced and further cooked, the rub was overpowering the sauce, so next time I will use less rub."

Next time, I will make only half the dry rub, and then half the chili powder for that amount. It was a little overpowering. Otherwise, very good!"

We finished them on the grill, they were not as good as my original method using a dry rub, put ribs in baking dish with a enough beer to cover the bottom of the pan, cover tightly with foil and bake at 275 for 4 hours, finish with BBQ sauce either on the grill or in the oven."

Be sure to add a comfortable amount of salt and pepper. Remove and pat dry.\nPut your own BBQ sauce recipe together easing up on the hot stuff and salt. Bake or BBQ.\nThe meat will have enormous flavor, you'll see! And by the way no chicken flavor!"
