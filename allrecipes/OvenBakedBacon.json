One went to the middle rack of the oven, the other to the lower rack. The lower rack came out perfect in 40 minutes (20 minutes to a side). The upper rack took 4 minutes longer. The bacon was perfect! I've used other baking bacon techniques. They work. So does this one, and it's easier that most."

There is more control over the cooking intensity and also the bacon doesn't come out dry and incinerated, but still has crispy edges. \nThis recipe told me what I needed to know in super simple terms."
