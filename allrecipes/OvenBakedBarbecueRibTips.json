I do not know if it makes a difference if the ribs tips are cut before you cook them but I followed the recipe exactly especially the times and they came out dry. I wasted meat and my favorite sauce. They look good and well sauced until you bite into them.... just dry. Do I need to adjust the time since they are pre cut? I just want to make juicy, tender rib tips!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe as it. I made my own homemade barbecue sauce from a recipe from this website. Also delish and easy. I nearly doubled the recipe as I had two 2.5lb bags of pork rib tips from Wild Fork. Great quality for $9.98 per bag. They were absolutely delicious. You do have to be very careful when broiling because they can burn quickly. When I told people they were baked in the oven, they didnâ€™t believe me because of the char (from the oven) on the meaty, succulent rib tips. They thought they were grilled! They were delicious. I highly recommend. I added sliced green onions for aesthetic appeal. The vibrant green of the green onion against the reddish brown barbecue sauce was the most appealing. I will I will be making more this weekend for Labor Day weekend for the family. The ones I made last weekend I took as my contribution to a family outdoor gathering. I had to put a few aside for the Hubster."
