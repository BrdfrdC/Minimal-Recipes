"reviewBody": "Fantastic way to streamline the traditional recipe. While it does lack the smokiness and char that normally accompanies restaurant fajitas, this is a wonderful way to have fajitas on the table, from initial prep work all the way through taking the dish from the oven, in an hour or less. Have made several times now and everyone has raved over them. (For those who want a semblance of smokiness, perhaps a bit of smoke flavoring could be added in with the rest of the liquid ingredients?)"

"reviewBody": "Very tasty. But putting it on the stove prior to baking in the oven caused it to cook through and therefore I had to cut the time, and cover the meat mixture before baking which didn't allow the vegetables to get as cooked as I would have liked. I cooked the chicken in an iron skillet so that may have caused the meat to cook too quickly. I guess I can skip the skillet next time."

A few changes: I used a combination of red and green bell peppers; I added a squeeze of lime when they came out of the oven; I baked them for only 20 minutes; and I used a foil-lined baking sheet, to spread everything out more. By pre-cooking the chicken, thirty minutes would be overdone. Even at 20 minutes, I had no bite to the vegetables."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe. I used green peppers instead of red ones (which I don't like much), homemade seasoning (https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/232967/fajita-seasoning/) instead of packaged, and a cast-iron skillet and a porcelain pie dish—this recipe is for 12 servings, and needed both—instead of the baking dish I thought I had but didn't. Otherwise I went by the book, and it was delicious. The cooking time is just right.\nAs said, the recipe is for 12 servings, so for a smaller family you might want to halve it or you'll have a lot of leftovers."

I sprinkled everything with Taco Seasoning I.\nI feel 20 to 25 minutes would be a better baking time as the vegetables were overcooked at 30 minutes.\nFast and easy dinner with a little tweaking.\n#AllrecipesAllstarsCanada\n#LetsTacoAboutIt"

I thought for sure that the onions would stay crunchy, the peppers would get mush, and the chicken would get overcooked but none of that happened. This was a good recipe and one I would definitely make again even if it wasn't raining."
