I used Sherry cooking wine instead of the mirin, because I had no idea what it is and didn't have it. The Sherry was suggested by another reviewer. I also used powdered ginger (didn't have fresh). Since I cut the recipe in half, I used about 3/4 tsp. Easy to prep and cooks in 30-35 minutes. Perfect! Thank you!"

"reviewBody": "This was delicious. I had already marinated my chicken overnight in a soy sauce/white wine/oil/ginger marinade, which probably helped. I like being able to bake this in the oven, since my stove top was occupied with other projects at the time! I omitted the red pepper since we are wimps, and used turbinado sugar instead of white because that's what I had. There was lovely caramelization around the edges of the pan, yes black in a few places but it didn't taste burnt. My only complaint was that I felt 2 TBS of cornstarch was too much. I like the sauce to cling to the chicken, but I also like to be able to pour it over my veggies and this was a bit thick. Thanks for sharing!"

I cut the chicken into large chunks and cooked them in the pan with the sauce for about 15-20 minutes stirring occasionally. I also covered the pan for a couple minutes. Oh and I added a package of sliced mushrooms. Delicious served with jasmine rice with peas and carrots cooked into the rice. Salad on the side.\nEdit: I made this again but with skinless, boneless legs and instead of cutting them into pieces I just sautéed them in a little olive oil first, then added the sauce to the pan and cooked for a few more minutes. I made the mistake of adding salt and pepper to the meat before sautéing and the dish was too salty. Despite that, it was really good over rice."

I also browned the chicken in an ovenproof skillet before adding the teriyaki sauce and then popped the whole thing in the oven - for about 10 minutes at 350°F. It was tender and flavourful. One thing I would suggest is to use a good quality soy sauce, it makes up the bulk of the sauce so the better the soy sauce, the better the result."

I remove those and then make the sauce in the same pan. I used a little less ginger and I used dried ginger. Also didn't have mirin so I used white wine mixed with a bit of sugar. After sauce had thickened I added back in the chicken and veggies. Served over white rice for my husband and riced cauliflower for me! Delicious!"

Most of the way through making the sauce, I realized I grabbed chicken thighs instead of breasts at the store! I cooked for 30 minutes with them completely covered by the sauce and I couldn't be happier. Going to try this on salmon sometime as someone else suggested."

I covered the casserole dish for the first 20 minutes and had it uncovered for the rest of the baking time. I will try leaving it uncovered next time. I agree with the previous reviewers, definitely use low-sodium ingredients."

"reviewBody": "I made the recipe exactly as directed except that I did not have LOW SODIUM soy sauce. So mine was VERY salty. Anyway, I still loved the recipe and served mine with white rice and chopped broccoli which I steamed with the rice as it cooked. It is so easy to do and gréât for a day when you don't really have time to cook. I would make this again and again. I think the leftover chicken will also be gréât on a salad with a bunch of crispy vegetables and maybe even some pineapple. By the way, the recipe makes a lot of sauce. (Oh, I iforgot I did not have any mirin so I used sherry. It was good anyway !!!) And one last thing. The sauce has a lot of sugar in it so keep an eye on it so that it does not burn in the 400 degree oven."

It was delish!! My family loved it also!!!\nI think it would be fine to cook in a covered skillet on top of the stove, but since I was making the baked rice, I went ahead and put it in the oven."

My husband went nuts. My 92 year old father who has no tastebuds left also loved it. My 25 year old son who is home temporarily between Army assignments referred to this sauce as liquid gold. It was perfect. Using the low sodium soy sauce gave it such flavor. My only change to the whole thing was using turbanadi sugar, I had no white. This one is a keeper folks. Serve it with rice and I made the Winter Fruit Salad from this site."

I usually prepare this dish on the stove top, with Sun-Bird General Tso's Chicken Seasoning Mix, which does not require baking. However, this (baking) method seems to coat the chicken better so that it tastes more like what you expect to get at a good Chinese restaurant. Serve it over white rice with a little butter and Garam Masala mixed in. Or, if you are adventurous, skip the Garam and go with crushed red pepper. Also, a little chopped up broccoli, peppers (mild or hot), or minced butternut squash (or all three!) added to the sauce will give it an extra oomph!"
