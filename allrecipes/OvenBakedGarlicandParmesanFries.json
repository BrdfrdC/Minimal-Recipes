"reviewBody": "These were the best oven fries I have ever made - before the addition of the parmesan and the extra baking at the end. They were still really good, and the extra flavor was fun. So try them both ways! Perfect directions for plain oven baked fries if you stop after 30 minutes. A nice flavor twist if you want to add the parmesan. I did bake mine for slightly less time both before and after adding the parm, but I had sliced them fairly thin."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is incredible. There's nothing wrong with experimenting with your own seasonings, but why? As written, this is perfect. I used foil to make clean up easier, but some of the fries stuck to the foil. Either it was the store brand foil I used or maybe parchment paper would work better. Doubling this recipe yields about a cookie sheet of fries. And if you don't double it, you will regret it, because they fries are so delicious. Be sure to spread the fries out. If they are crowded, it will be less likely that they will get brown and crispy."

I had to sub garlic powder and dried parsley for the fresh and I only had grated Romano cheese, no parm. Otherwise, I followed this as written. Even though I had to improvise a few of the ingredients, these came out tasting superb. I can't wait to make them again once I do have everything called for."

Only change I made was I used the Broiler a little to Brown the fries in the end and to help melt the cheese a little faster. I will make these again soon. Suggest a french fry cutter because you are going to want to make extra!"

"reviewBody": "Served these to a group of friends this weekend and everyone loved them. Followed the basic recipe with a few changes because of what I had on hand. Used garlic powder, dried parsley, and jarred Parmesan cheese instead of fresh products...it was quicker and the taste was still really good.\n\nDid not have a non-stick sheet pan, lined one with a Silpat and the other with parchment paper. Parchment is the quicker way to go...no clean up.\n\nThe main change I made was to NOT return the fries to the bowl and the olive oil after 15 min. They still had plenty of oil and were browning nicely. \n\nI also changed the cooking time/order a bit out of necessity. I wanted the potatoes to be ready when the burgers came off the grill. So I pulled the pans after the 30 min cook and sat them aside. Then just before I was ready to serve them I sprinkled with the seasoned salt and parmesan and put them back in the hot oven for the last 10 min."

I followed the recipe as written for the rest, except I only used 2 tbs of parmasean and 1/4 tsp of salt for the final step."

"reviewBody": "Make sure to soak the potatoes in salted water for an hour or so for a crispier potato. Soaking allows some of the starches leech out into the water. The starch in potatoes hinders moisture from escaping, which leaves more water in the potato. Make sure to rinse the potatoes well after soaking (to remove the starch) and pat them completely dry before cooking."

I waited until the very end to add the seasoning and cheese mixture, cuz I was afraid it would burn cooking it for over 30 minutes. Mine took a little longer to cook (about 40-45 min). I also used parchment paper so they could not stick to the pan. Then once the fries were good and crispy, I added the cheese and seasoning mixture, and cooked about another 7-8 minutes. They were perfect."

I also added a little garlic powder since I was out of fresh garlic. De-lish!"
