At half hour of cooking in a casserole dish, it was still soft in the middle, so I added the cheese, covered it with the casserole lid and cooked another 10 to 15 minutes. It was perfect. Will add to my guest breakfast arsenal."

I used Ranch buttermilk dressing instead of \"sour cream\" and Buttermilk instead of \"milk\". I also added 2 slices of chopped precooked bacon, 1 small diced tomato and diced 1/2 jalapeno seeds and all. I baked at 350 degrees in my 8\" cast iron skillet. This is absolutely delicious! Easy clean up also."

"reviewBody": "Note for if you add mushrooms and substitute more milk for the sour cream - you need to add 10-15 minutes (I did 13) to the cooking time to let the eggs finish setting. It's probably mostly because of the milk rather than the sour cream, but the mushrooms might play a bit of a role as well.\nAs you can guess, I added mushrooms to the recipe and substituted 1/2 cup more milk for the 1/2 cup of sour cream.\n\nEdit (March 15/20): No, it's my oven. I made it again on the 13th, this time with the sour cream (and with sautéed onions and spinach rather than green onions), and again I had to cook it for longer. But the sour cream did make a definite difference to the fluffiness, and it was a good way to finish off the container!"

"reviewBody": "This was so quick and easy to put together. Unfortunately, I had no green onions so I chopped up some onion. Also, I halved this recipe and I added some ham that I had that was leftover. Even halving it this had to bake for 30 minutes (at 325) before the center set up. I'm not the best at scrambling eggs but I've been adding a good Tbsp of sour cream to two eggs which makes them nice and fluffy. So be sure to add the sour cream. Will do this again! Thanks for posting."

I was at a loss because NixieKnox gave it a one star because she said, \"So basically a frittata. Let's just call a spade a spade here.\" Does that mean you didn't like the taste of the dish? Or maybe for you it was just a common dish. You see, I've never had a frittata before, and to make a comment like that is just unkind and ignorant. I made the dish as directed and it was delicious."
