"reviewBody": "They were very crisp and cooked all the way through. I just experimented with one potato. 400 degrees and 40 minutes, just about 5 minutes too long I think because of how thin they were. I actually got chips. I surprised myself by getting them sliced so thinly. But the larger pieces had soft and chewy centers, and I did enjoy them. I turned them twice to keep them from burning; by the second turn they were almost done. Next time I will do about 30 minutes, 400 and a bit less oil so they don't fry so much. Yummy snack though. gone in minutes."

I used the spice mix from the chicken recipe on these as well (which is nearly the same as spices used on this recipe). I cut the slices about 1/4\" thick..sprinkled olive oil on the taters and then put the seasoning on top of that. Baked for about an hour or so. Amazing!!!! Will make these again and again!!"

"reviewBody": "They were tasty, but I had lots of problems with this recipe: I first tried the shaker bag options and just wasn't getting a good coating and four potatoes requires doing this over and over again because that is a lot of potato for one food storage bag. So then I switched to laying them on the foiled baking sheet before sprinkling with seasoning and oil. Well the potatoes stuck something fierce - what a mess."

Maybe next time I try it I’ll need to put a little bit of water in the pan instead of oil. There was one ingredient that I didn’t have so I just used the others. Any suggestions for this would be great."

"reviewBody": "Made as written and at 45 minutes I ended up with oven baked potato chips that were crispy and full of flavor. While not a side dish as I had intended them to be, they were excellent actually. If you are looking for a side dish to go with a dinner I recommend reducing the cook time so that you don't end up with chips. For me, I will let them go 45 minutes and use this recipe to make potato chips because they were that good."
