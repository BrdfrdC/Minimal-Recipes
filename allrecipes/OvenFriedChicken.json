I also added plenty of garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, and pepper to the flour, and salt and peppered chicken before coating. I turned up oven temp to 375 for second half, and turned every 10 minutes for first half. I‚Äôm not sure that was necessary and think this base recipe is great for personal adaptation. Some of our pieces were skinless breasts, just as good!! All was exceptional, moist and flavorful. Thank you!"

We didn't have 12 chicken drumsticks, only 6, so I just cut everything's amount in half. I added garlic powder and extra paprika, plus other spices since Schar's bread crumbs had no seasoning. It was great because we had extra eggs and this uses 3 eggs! The time is a little long and the 350 ¬∞F is low. How do you convert the temperature into the time?"

I used the 1/2 cup of oil but I needed 2 9 x 13 inch pans for all the chicken and I split the 1/2 cup oil for both each pan had 1/4 cup of oil. The chicken came out crispy. It was good but me and family thought it could of used more seasoning which I‚Äôll do the next time I make it. I also floured the chicken and put in fridge for an hour before the egg and bread crumbs. Doing this kept the breading on better."

To the flour I added: seasoned salt, garlic powder, black and red pepper, and Italian seasoning. I cooked the chicken on 365 degrees for 45 minutes (turning the chicken about halfway through). This temperature and timing got the chicken nice a crisp. I will definitely make this again. I can finally fry chicken!! Woo hoo!"

I will never have to do fried chicken in oil ever again - hallelujah!!! I did follow some tips, did it on a sheet pan as I had several and didn't want to crowd them, sprayed the pan with pam (forgot about the butter trick, will try that next time) did spray the chicken with some olive oil spray after I flipped it for the top to brown a little more. Nice crunchy coating. Mixed some italian crumbs and panco together and double dipped one side since I had extra egg/crumb mix to be used....great!"

Overcooked, undercooked, breading sticks or falls off. Never again. This is simple with fantastic results. I followed directions to the letter. Didn't come out too greasy at all. This will now be go to for fried chicken."

Also next time I probably wont use an entire half cup of oil. Made it greasy. And I wanted baked to avoid just that."

Following others' tips, I did not use oil and used both parts of the broiler pan, the grill, and the pan. I did spray the grill. All else as the recipe called for. I did turn on the broiler at the end for 5 min to darken the chicken. Next time I will add some cajun seasoning to kick it up a notch! Yum!"

The only changes I made were putting the flour and bread crumb in ziploc bags and I put a piece of parchment on a baking sheet and rubbed olive oil over the sheet instead of using the 1/2 cup as shown. It turned out perfect."

It comes out with a nice, crispy coating outside and juicy chicken inside, and without the mess of fried chicken. Two of the tips in the comments/reviews that I use and find very helpful are to refrigerate the coated chicken for at least an hour before baking it and to put it in melted butter instead of oil in the pan. I use two pans so as to not crowd the pieces."

Then I used Bob's mills gluten free flour blend and I added a 1\\4 teaspoon paprika, 1\\4 teaspoon garlic, and 1\\4 teaspoon of salt. Then, I used gluten free breadcrumbs. I seasoned the breadcrumbs with McCormick 's Italian seasoning, 1 1\\2 tablespoons and I added a 1\\4 teaspoon garlic powder to the breadcrumbs. I followed other suggestions and put a few pats of smart balance butter in a pan lined with parchment paper. I cooked mine for longer, 1.5 hours, but everything was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Also flavorful because the seasoning was on the chicken and the coating. Great recipe??!"
