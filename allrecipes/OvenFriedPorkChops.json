Always use stuffing (I like the savory herb from stove top), and don't be afraid to beat it if you want the pieces smaller. Also, adding foil helps with cleanup afterwards (many of you already know this, but I thought I'd put it out there in case someone didn't). You can increase the temp the last five minutes if you like it extra crunchy. Hope this helps anyone who needs it☺️"

"reviewBody": "This is not a recipe I would make again. The cooking times were way off. Even though my pork chops were super thin (between 1/4\" and 1/2\" thin), it took more than 10 minutes per side; every time I took it out, it was still pink. I think I ended up cooking it more like 20-25 minutes per side because I kept having to put it back in the oven. When it was all said and done, I couldn't even eat it, as it tasted awful."

They were super simple and would make again, however I think I would take the advice of others on here who recommended Italian style breadcrumbs. Didn't love the stuffing mix. Also used thin sliced pork chops- definitely did not need 10 minutes per side. Did not turn out super dry, but not as tender as I had hoped. Would try again with the changes!"

I found with a 1.5 or 2 inch pan the chops never crisp\n\n5 I used half butter half olive oil\n\n6 I ended up having to let chops cook a couple minutes longer to crisp - depends on the oven.\n\nI hope this is helpful."

I used my hands to break down the stuffing mix, and this way left a lot of big pieces."
