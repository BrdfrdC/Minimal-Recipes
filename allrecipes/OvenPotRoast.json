I browned it in butter but the butter burned so I drained the pot after browning. I added the wine to the pot and then the onion soup mix, the mushroom soup, a cup of water with a tsp of beef Better than Bullion, a tsp each of Worcestershire and horseradish. Added the beef and spooned the sauce over the meat. I cooked it at 300* for 3 and a half hours. I added quartered Yukon gold potatoes and carrots at the 2 hour mark. I’ve been making pot roast for 50 years. This is number one!"

I used 2 roasts for a total of 5.5# and because I'm Gluten Free and Dairy Free I made a few changes. I subbed olive oil for the butter and made my own onion soup mix from this site. For the cream of mushroom soup, I sliced mushrooms and mixed that with the remaining flour/pepper mixture. Dumped that on top of the roast and poured 2 cups of beef broth around the sides and a heavy cup of red wine. I did add a big tablespoon of diced garlic on top of the meat. Cooked in a turkey roaster 350° for about 3-1/2 hours turning over once."

I can't tell you how grateful I am for this recipe, it was absolutely delicious and so easy! Not a ton of ingredients but the flavor was outstanding! The gravy that it made was unbelievable, doused it over my boiled red potatoes! The meat fell apart, and cooked perfectly! Thank you so much for a great recipe!"

I always make mashed potatoes as I don’t like everything to taste the same. And, that gravy on the roast and mashed potatoes is to die for. I mince garlic and sauté it in my Dutch Oven before I brown the roast. Stove to oven. Then back up to stove to make the gravy. Delicious."

Didn't have vermouth (which I REALLY wanted to try in the recipe but no time to get it). So I had to resort to white cooking wine - I know, I know BUT...it was fantastic. I've made the basics of this recipe before I found this one that inspired adding the wine (since no vermouth). Using it next time! I've used red wine in mine before but liked this better. I upped all gravy ingredients to have more and added a bit of garlic powder and sonoma pepper. Delicious. Thanks for sharing Becky!"

In order to salvage this I added a lot of beef stock as it cooked and added rosemary and parsley near the end. I also had to force it apart and cook it in chunks because there was no flavor in the meat - probably because it is a fairly lean cut. Because this recipe looked so easy and had great reviews I decided to try it. Problem is, too many people who've reviewed it gave it higher rating because of the changes they made to the recipe."

I used cream of chicken (I know, but it was all I had!), and white wine instead of vermouth. My roast was only two pounds and I was in a hurry so I cooked it in a Dutch oven at 375 degrees for 1 hour. I will cook it longer next time so it will be more tender. The gravy was to die for! Next time I will put more potatoes in the pot so I can eat more of the gravy!"

To my surprise, I found vermouth in the house! Hubby doesn't do mushrooms, so I doubled the sauce for 2 roasts - using one can of cream of chicken and one cream of celery. otherwise, I pretty much followed the recipe. Used a roaster on the burner to brown the roasts and popped them in the oven. I flipped them over every 45 minutes or so, to keep it all juicy. Amazing aroma! I kept them in the oven for 4 hours - just because there were 2 roasts. Everyone loved it and went back for seconds! And they wanted to know what I did differently! Thank you! This will be a repeat favorite for us!"
