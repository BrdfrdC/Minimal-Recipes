I had everything together in the oven before I watched the video so I mixed it a little different than what you showed and I think the cook time could be a little less as I was using a gas convect oven. Regardless, the potatoes were delicious as a side dish with a roasted chicken.... even my wife was impressed. Although it's really a very simple recipe, I can rely on this when one can't really think what to make..... 10/10 ??"

The second time I sliced red potatoes about 1” thick and dredged them in the oil/spice mixture and laid them flat in a pan. I used the convection oven the second time and cooked them about 12-15 minutes at 425 and then Turned the potatoes over and cooked them an additional 15 minutes. They were crispy on both sides. Very good good"

One is that after taking the potatoes out of the oven, if you put them on a cooling rack for about 5 minutes, they will not get soggy. Also, I like my potatoes crispy so will usually bake them a bit longer. Just watch for the amount of done ness that you prefer."

"reviewBody": "Been making it for years except I toss the cubed potatoes with the dry herbs first, let it stand for at least 20 minutes then add and toss with olive oil. On the side I saute yellow onions and green peppers and toss with the potatoes after they come out of the oven. I've also added diced ham chunks of Italian sweet sausage (hot is good too ) on occasion. Those wonderful, versatile potatoes! Yum."

Put the cubed RED potatoes into a bowl, drizzle with Olive Oil and seasonings, stir to cover the potatoes (and sometimes baby carrots), put into oven safe baking dish.\n\nWhile this is ‘Italian’ in seasoning, I also use Tex Mex or Greek seasonings, depending on what the main course is. \n\nOh, and Sea Salt and fresh Cracked Pepper is a must."

Next time, I will leave off make sure that each potato doesn't overlap with another one and leave off the red pepper flakes because it was too hot for my taste. Very few points on WW so it was a winner for me! I will make them again!"

"reviewBody": "Am having fun with this recipe. I'm an inexperienced foot-dragging sort of cook so recipe play is something new. Have made it four times, making slight changes each go-round.\n475 was too high in my oven, causing pieces on the sides of the pan to burn a bit, so I reduced it to 425 and increased the cooking time from 20/30 to 40 minutes.\nHave used all the spices with each attempt, subbing garlic powder for minced garlic a couple times, deciding the bottled minced garlic was as good, not better. \nThe red pepper flakes made it too spicy for husband so I left them out altogether and added ordinary ground pepper to my serving.\nThe fun part came from adding big pieces of one each green, yellow and orange bell peppers, one cabana pepper and a large sweet onion. The fourth time I reduced the potatoes to about three, thereby changing up the proportion of potatoes to veggies so reduce starch.\nOne time I added cherry tomatoes I had on hand.\nAt my cooking time/temp the peppers and onion are softer than some folks might prefer but the potatoes are cooked through. Really dislike half-cooked potatoes.\nDoubled the oil and spices to accommodate the veggies. There was too much bulk for a cookie sheet but my giant lasagna pan with 5\" sides worked perfectly. The potatoes wanted to stick and burn, despite interim stirring. Lining with foil, sprayed with cooking oil made cleanup easier.\nOn the 4th attempt I added a couple cups of large white mushrooms, just washed and halved. Didn't know"

"reviewBody": "I followed this recipe exactly except that the baking was done in a NuWave oven that has a max temperature of 425 degrees. At about 20 minutes, the potatoes were done and plenty browned, but did not at all have a crispy outside. One thing I did do differently was to add the oil and all of the seasonings to a gallon zip lock bag. When I got them mixed together, they were thick and paste-like. So I spread them out in the bag and coated both sides of the bag before adding the potatoes. This made it easier to coat all of the potatoes than trying to mix them in a bowl. The resulting potatoes were tasty, but the outside was leathery rather than crispy. Next time, I may try broiling them to crisp them, but if this is necessary, it should be included in the recipe. By the way, the insides of the potatoes were perfect. I just wasn't happy with the lack of crispness."

However, I didn't love the flavor, and I personally didn't love the way they were so crispy and really brown outside and still so soft inside. I have another favorite potato recipe that bakes for longer at 400. I think I'll stick with that combo for my potatoes. As far as the spices, I don't know if it was just too many different flavors going on or what, but the flavor was just really odd. I used a fraction of the red pepper and still thought they were randomly spicy without much flavor."
