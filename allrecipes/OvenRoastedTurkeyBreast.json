But I had most of the herbs that go into Italian seasoning and the minced garlic. I did a tsp each of all the herbs. The thyme and rosemary were fresh. Kerrygold butter. I didn't have a roasting pan, used baking dish. I didn't use any tin foil. It was still the juiciest, most delicious turkey ever! I didn't make the gravy, but I bet it would've be delicious if I had. My husband says its the best and he's excited to take some to work tomorrow. Thank you so much for sharing this! This will be how I cook turkey from here on out!"

I never did tent it, but would have if it seemed to need it (it didn't). Crisp, delicious skin! I didn't do the gravy, because the turkey came with a gravy packet, but I did put about 3 tablespoons of pan drippings into the simmering gravy. Really, really good! Definitely a keeper."

"reviewBody": "This was phenomenal. Increased seasonings by half for a 7 lb breast to keep the flavors “light” for the little ones. Used smoked paprika and a rotisserie chicken seasoning for the garlic herb blend because that’s what I had. Subbed a mix of garlic and onion for the shallot for the same reason. I can’t say enough about this recipe. Husband and daughter had seconds and the grandchildren cleaned their plates. Had to thin out the remaining gravy with some broth to extend the gravy to have with leftovers. Yes, it was that good. This is a new favorite!"

Made it exactly like the recipe (always have Mrs. Dash on hand, just added a little extra Italian seasoning for our personal tastes )...SO tasty and juicy...definitely not dry.

"reviewBody": "As I suspected, adding the flour to the gravy as described led to clumps of raw flour throughout. You are better off making a roux with the butter/turkey grease first then adding in wine (I was much more generous than a splash) followed by the broth or stock. The taste of the gravy was however very good. I boosted the flavor by adding in some of the baste mix (that had not touched the raw turkey) to deepen the color and make for a complex gravy taste. The turkey was quite delicious with these seasonings."

Not sure if my bird or my hands were too cold but all I succeeded in accomplishing was to get the seasoned butter all over every single finger, my mini spatula and numerous paper towels as well as my microwave door and controls when I finally decided to melt the butter slightly so I could brush it on. I made a second batch of the butter.. will \"baste\" with it in 20 mins. This is a trial run for our Thanksgiving dinner. in two weeks so I really want to get this right. I am using a 7.4 lbs breast and doubled ingredients (for each batch of butter spread I made) THANKS for any TIPs anyone can provide. jgcorpex4@yahoo.com"

I forgot the wine for the gravy so I drank it with the meal. I did not have shallot so used onions. Gravy was better on baked potatoes than on turkey. It seemed like a lot of work. Possibly because of all the pans, bowls, dishes, utensils I used. Turkey is always work for me but tastes good. If it had been a whole bird I would have used a Reynolds turkey bag."

"reviewBody": "De-lish! I made a 4#11oz turkey breast (1/2 breast) with wing on. While I did not measure the exact ingredients, the flavour was incredibly good. I did rub the seasoned butter under the skin and over the entire top and loosely covered with foil. After 30 minutes, I added a couple of spoonfuls of the season butter over the top and then poured over 1/4 cup straight orange juice, retented with the foil and back into the oven. After the second 30 minutes, I did the same thing but left the the turkey breast UNcovered for the rest of the cooking time. I repeated the butter mixture followed by 1/4-1/2 cup of orange juice one last time. Total time roasting was 90 minutes which was perfect. As for the gravy, I prefer 'au jus', no thickening agents at all, adjusted the seasoning and reduced slightly on the stove top.\nI loved the flavour of the seasoned butter with the orange juice, which was a very slight flavour and did not overwhelm at all."

I used turkey fat instead of butter for the gravy and I added the 3 tbspns of flour directly to the pan once the onions were translucent, creating a roux before adding in the turkey broth (which is subbed for the chicken broth). I added some salt to taste after the gravy was off the pan, which turned out just fine. Next time I'll add the salt and pepper to the pan after I add the broth. Overall an excellent recipe!"
