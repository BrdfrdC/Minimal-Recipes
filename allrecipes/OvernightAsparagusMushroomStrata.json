I prefer a has brown crust rather than the muffins, and I add parsley into the egg mix, but other than that I make as is with just whatever veggies/meat I have about. This morning I enjoyed a mushroom, broccoli, artichoke, bacon and ham version. My best version yet though I might leave the artichoke next time (I only had marinated artichokes and the marinade gave a strange taste so think I would prefer it without them). I’ve made the full recipe and also half recipes - for half I usually add an extra egg so my veggies are covered. A nice go to breakfast when I have things to use up and hash browns in the freezer ... bound to make again and again."

I followed some suggestions made by other reviews to increase the vegetables and add spices. I used 9 eggs instead of 8. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. It makes a lot so I might halve the recipe in future unless I'm cooking for a crowd. Since there were only four of us, I sent half the leftovers home with my daughter and son-in-law. We all really liked it!"

I think that I sautéed them for a bit too long. My sister didn't saute the onions or red pepper, and her casserole was delicious.\n\nI made a second casserole without the veggies. I just added sautéed onions and sweet Italian sausage. My hungry nephews devoured this casserole! \n\nBoth casseroles were delicious! I had just a little bit of leftovers which were perfect for breakfast and lunch for the next few days!"

But anything with Asparagus and Eggs is tops with me!! Just picked my first 10 \"ditch\" asparagus here in Waldo,Wisconsin, 12 miles west of Lake Michigan. A good 20 or more nubbies I need to check on tomorrow to pick. I omitted the peppers only due to my allergy to cooked bell pepper (acid)."

As other reviewers suggested, I softened up the asparagus and peppers by tossing them in the saute pan with the onions in mushrooms for a few minutes before transferring the veggie mixture to the baking dish. Super tasty. I might experiment with a sharp Cheddar or a Gruyere next time in place of the co-jack cheese."

Made a double recipe and had a couple of squares left over so I had them heated in the microwave next morning and it was even better! Great, easy, no fuss recipe to feed the hungry morning group. Take some to work for a super treat. Easy to change out cheese choice, veggies or add ham or bacon, etc. A keeper."

It was perfect with the suggested veggies - asparagus, mushrooms (I used baby bellas), onions and red sweet pepper. I did saute the onions and peppers with the mushrooms. It doesnt need the addition of meat. I made this recipe instead of the standard sausage egg and cheddar breakfast casserole i have made for years. Family said they thought they preferred this one."

The only change I would make next time is that I would also sauté the onions and red pepper (maybe at the halfway point of the mushrooms) to soften them a little. They were a bit raw and crunchy for my taste but would be perfect with a little pre-cooking. I will definitely make this again."

Leftovers better.\" Put this strata together on Christmas Eve, with the only difference being that I sauteed the bell pepper and the onion with the mushrooms, and otherwise followed everything exactly as written. It made Christmas morning sooooo much easier, but as far as the taste goes, we all agreed that we would've 1. preferred spinach to asparagus, 2. added a couple drops of hot sauce, and 3. included a meat, such as diced ham or chopped bacon. I was; however, more blown away by how good it tasted as leftovers 2 days later. I would definitely make this again, but with some small adjustments, and I guess that's the nice thing about this recipe is that the vegetables can be swapped in and out."

"reviewBody": "At first the husband said 'english muffins, in a casserole?? I should half faith, right?' This was good and filling. The mushrooms disappeared to nothing - I would use the whole basket of mushrooms next time (8 oz). I think this needed seasoning and would carmelize the mushrooms with balsamic vinegar and/or add 1-2 teaspoons of Cavendar's Greek seasoning. There are overnight casserole recipes that don't really need to sit overnight, but this really did - at first the egg disappeared and I was worried it wasn't enough (the veggies were just hanging out on top), but in the oven, the casserole puffed up and beautifully, and the english muffins turned into a bread pudding of sorts. My husband's new favorite breakfast he said! I made this for work and it made 5 days worth for each of us. I bet this is also good with pepperjack cheese."
