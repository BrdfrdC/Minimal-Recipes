"reviewBody": "Since we are empty nesters, LOVE recipes written for smaller families but also love the ability to double - which I did here. Doubled but I was heavy handed with the Dijon (maybe close to 3 TBLS) and had to use Swiss vs Gruyere as I didnâ€™t want to make another run to the store. I also minced 1/2c sweet onion and sprinkled amongst the ham. When I pulled from the oven (1 hr, 15 min) I topped with 1/2 c shredded Colby (and the green onions per recipe). Brought to a brunch and got rave reviews! Shock and nods learning croissants, Swiss and/or Dijon were in the ingredient list. Eaten! Bye! Gone! Next time I will added some diced/sliced mushrooms. I meant to take a picture but it was gone before I could! Thanks Bibi!"
