I have made a similar recipe many times and like other reviews I prepared several at a time and kept them in the refrigerator for a quick and satisfying breakfast. Also, for a change have switched the fruit or added either nuts or coconut instead of chia seeds, used regular milk instead of almond milk and garnished with toasted slivered almond or whatever I had on hand and always turned out just as good. This recipe is very forgiving and fabulous!"

I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out great. The only modification was that I added 1/4 cup of raisins to each jar. This is a game changer. The raisins rehydrate and become plump and juicy, with a nice crispness to them, like when you bite into a fresh grape. Definitely one of my favorite new items to make."
