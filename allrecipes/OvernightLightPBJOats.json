The almond milk lasts forever in the fridge, so I can buy the ingredients and not have to worry about anything getting wasted because I waited too long to make it. This is so easy to make - just add ingredients and then forget about it. I just made 3 servings and am looking forward to breakfast tomorrow!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe isn’t a winner for me. I did finish eating it but I had to force myself to. Maybe I’m just not a chia seed person? I did substitute frozen blackberries for the fresh raspberries and I accidentally used Splenda in place of the sugar. I think the texture of chia seeds just puts me off. It was very easy to make and I loved the calorie count. Maybe if I happen to have fresh raspberries I would try it again, but I won’t rush out to buy some."

That peanut butter powder really tastes like the real deal, and it's the perfect partner for the fresh raspberries. Have tried a number of similar recipes, but hands down. this has been my favorite."
