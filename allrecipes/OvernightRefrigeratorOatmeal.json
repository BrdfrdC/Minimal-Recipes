"reviewBody": "First time trying overnight oatmeal, it was already past my bedtime when I made it so the ease of this recipe was fantastic! A cup of yogurt is more like 3/4 cup so instead of wasting the rest I just upped the oats and (unsweetened oat) milk to match. I used vanilla cinnamon yogurt, added a bit more cinnamon and a squirt of agave. It tasted good cold out of the fridge this morning but after adding some dried berries and a minute in the microwave, it was scrummy!"

"reviewBody": "Great recipe. The recipe doesn't specify what flavour of Greek yogurt, but I use non-fat vanilla. Plain is too bland. It's great with banana and fresh berries. It's very filling, so I would say this actually makes 2 servings. I've subsequently tried to make this with regular vanilla yogurt, but found it too runny...I definitely think it tastes better with Greek yogurt."

I used plain oat milk (to cut back on sugar), added half a banana and about a tablespoon of chopped pecans along with generous dashes of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Incredibly flavorful and so much healthier; didn't miss the sweeteners that most instant oatmeal brands have. I've had this breakfast cold and hot, both are good and a minute in the microwave doesn't overly thicken the oat milk."

However, I ate this for dinner tonight, and I liked how thick it was. I guess I just wasn't in the mood for it the first day. I made a double batch and had enough for 4 servings. I added cinnamon and dried cranberries when I made it, and then added pecans and some cinnamon and sugar on top when I ate it. I definitely liked having the crunch of nuts, because it is kind of gooey when not cooked."

So I tweaked it up, and now, I use this recipe all the time as a baseline with vanilla yogurt instead of Greek. This is an amazingly versatile recipe to any taste (even used it to add 1tsb grape jelly and 1tsb peanut butter for some weekend fun breakfast). Thank you!"

Another way to accomplish the same goal is (the night before) bring water to a boil, stir in oatmeal, turn down heat to a simmer and simmer for 2-3 minutes. Turn off heat and let sit overnight and your oatmeal is done in the morning. Add milk, yogurt and fruit and voila!"

"reviewBody": "So easy! I searched for the simplest overnight oatmeal recipe and this did the trick. After a few tries, I've modified the following: I use half a container of greek yogurt instead of measuring a half cup. I use 1% milk instead of almond milk. I really want grab &amp; go, so I added the fruit when I made it, not the next morning. Sliced bananas and frozen strawberries are a winner. Frozen blueberries didn't translate. I make them two at a time and so far the jar that sat an extra day was better. I might try extending the times to see if I could make four in a batch."

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe exactly as specified, using almond milk and peach flavored greek yogurt. I personally didn't care for it. I think I was expecting more of a muesli texture. This had a much richer, almost slimy texture and the oatmeal was chewy in a stale-sort-of way. Maybe if I switched to a regular yogurt instead of a greek yogurt I would like it better, but I think I will look for a different recipe instead."

It's easy enough to change out the type of milk, yogurt, or fruit. I used unsweetened almond milk, non-fat vanilla Greek yogurt, and bananas in one small jar and blueberries in the other. I also needed some Truvia to sweeten it up a bit. Half the recipe was plenty for my breakfast."
