Add onion, garlic, and Rotel to the pot, then oxtails. Add chicken broth ( Chicken con pollo) and cook until oxtails are almost tender. Add potatoes, eventually adding chosen veggies near the last moments. I intend to try your recipe as well. Thank you."

"reviewBody": "I made the recipe almost exactly except I had to adapt as I had almost 5lbs of oxtails. I couldnâ€™t find my Greek seasoning so I googled the substitute and used a healthy amount of oregano. When it came time To make the gravy, instead of garlic powder I had roasted garlic cloves in the oven so I squeezed several cloves in and then used an immersion blender. Gravy was thick so I added in oxtails and a lot of the onion pieces from the broth. Also added/finished with an inordinate amount of finely chopped parsley and green onions. It was absolutely perfect. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever make another way ever again. Thanks so much for this recipe!"

It was still good but def overcooked or over processed. So it didn't look as pretty."

I added a tablespoon of butter to the rice along with salt, pepper and a touch of garlic powder. I simmered the oxtails 3.5 hours on low, and then took several cups of liquid (I had a lot of oxtail) and seasoned to taste for gravy. Once thickened, I made a bed of rice, placed oxtails on top and then carefully spooned the gravy to cover. Added some thinly sliced green onions for garnish and it was perfect!!"

"reviewBody": "I made a giant improvement and a small one.\n\nSMALL:trim fat as much as possible. Brown it with the oxtails, put in cheesecloth, cook with tails, remove and discard. That way you get all the flavor, but you donâ€™t have to start pulling out fat.\n\nGIANT: Pour all the cooking liquid into a fat separator and remove all the fat. you can use this fat for the gravy, thatâ€™s what I did and threw the rest out. Then, reduce the cooking liquid to two or 4 cups depending on how much gravy you want to make. Itâ€™s wasteful to throw away that good cooking just because you donâ€™t need it all. BE CERTAIN Not to add a bunch of salt to the cooking liquid initially. 1 teaspoon will be fine you can always add more later. This was absolutely fantastic and three people pleaded it for the recipe. I would plan on this recipe serving 3 to 4 people, definitely not six. But youâ€™ve never had a better dinner!"

He would always order them from a Jamaican place we occasionally go to. This is a very good recipe, however, I could not find the Greek seasoning or the browning sauce, especially since many items are not available due to the coronavirus pandemic . I used an all purpose Jamaican seasoning and it still came out delicious. My son loved them. I will be making them again."

My only modifications are I reduce the salt to 1/2 TB of salt unless I'm using more oxtails than suggested. Also, I don't have browning stuff so I add a dash of Worcestershire sauce instead. I have made it with the gravy as instructed, and it's great, but sometimes I cheat and use a jar gravy which is also good. I also add green peppers during the last 30min-hour. \nI take the suggestion of one of the comments and skim off the scum before adding the onions and other seasonings."

I browned them and sautÃ©ed the onions, garlic and bell pepper before the boiling process. Finally, once the oxtails were in the gravy, I added a little sugar to the sauce to help cut the tartness of the Worcestershire sauce."

No onions because my boyfriend hates them (his loss) and instead of Greek seasoning I used my own combo of seasonings. When it was done boiling I used all of the juice from the oxtail to make gravy. I wanted it thicker. So I mixed more flour in with the beef broth &amp; worcestershire sauce and a little bit more seasoning till it was thick enough for me. I made this with white rice and red kidney beans. Very filling!"

Once I tried to use canned beef broth to boil them in, instead of water, and it turned out too salty, so just follow this recipe as is, it works out great. I found a tip that I used, and it was after washing the oxtails give them a bath in cold water with a little vinegar. Not sure what this was supposed to do, but I really enjoyed them."

If you cook it long enough (I find that about 3 1/2 hours is perfect for me), it comes out tender and unctious. The meat is rich and delicious. The gravy is easy and yummy. I add the broth a little at a time, whisking constantly, until most of the liquid is used up. I have made the gravy with regular flour and/or gluten-free flour and it comes out fine. This recipe is no-fail if you follow instructions. I also eat this with rice, to sop up all that yummy gravy. I'd say I make this at least 4 or 5 times a year, or whenever oxtails are on sale at the market."

Cooked in slow cooker for 5 1/2 hours with ingredients (minus season salt). Added sauteed onions and carrots (don't saute in bacon grease next time--flavour too overpowering). Served over rice. Will try with potatoes next time. If planning on doubling gravy, double oxtails for more meat."

The grease is a lot but I remove the oxtails from the broth and put broth in refrigerator. grease hardens into a thick layer on top and then just lift off. I then use the broth to cook rice in and add oxtails back into rice. People who don't know what these are, all can't get enough and are shocked to find out it is oxtails and that they love them. OH, also I do NOT make the gravy of this recipe as I use the broth strictly for the rice flavoring."

As I'm typing this, it feels like my arteries are clogging. I am ok with some greasy meals. But even boiling for 3 hours, there is still too much fat. And the broth you use for the gravy has the fat you just boiled off (and I skimmed off 1/2 cup of grease before making the gravy. How this meat is so expensive, is beyond me. If I was starving and had nothing else to eat, would be the only way I'd make this again. This is similar to pot roast, which is what I'll make next time. So if you know what oxtail tastes like and are ok with the grease, you'll like this. If you've been thinking of buying oxtail and trying it for the first time, just get a pot roast."
