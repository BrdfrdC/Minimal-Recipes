Definitely used a water bath after wrapping the springform pan in aluminum foil too. And then when it was done cooking I cooled it slowly, first in the oven with the heat off and the door cracked, and then later on just on the counter. No cracks, and smooth as silk. Top this sucker with a little chocolate ganache and some sliced strawberries and it'll get gobbled up like it's got the antidote."

Hearty! and yes my jiggled when i took it out, the next morning it was firm. and yes i had a brown top, maybe i should have covered mid way with tin foil? Anyway this makes a large cheese cake. i had to move to a bigger pan. halfway through cooking it had risen so much i thought it would overflow in oven, but it did not. it went down while cooling. needed more crust though. i'd make again, and add in some filling. i dont like super sweet, so this worked for me."

I had never tried to bake a real cheesecake before but have done a bunch of the no bake style cheesecakes thhat were great so I wanted to try to make a real one just like Mom used to make. My wife was a fantastic cook but I remember that she had troubles trying to make cheesecakes before, so I wanted to see how hard it really was, lol. \n\nI followed the recipe exactly in all aspects and they both turned out fantastic! I couldn't believe it! And how easy it really was to make. I do not understand why my wife had trouble with cheesecakes, mine on my first try was like mom used to make. Better than store bought and has that mmm cheesecake flavor like it really is supposed to be. This is a great recipe for a classic cheesecake and I will make them again now that I know how easy it is and how good they are!!!\n\nYou avoid the brownish top (and cracking!) in the cheesecake by reducing the cooking temperature, and extending the cooking time. ;)"
