I have been trying to minimize my gluten intake, due to thyroid issues. I stumbled upon this recipe, and decided to give it a try. I've never eaten or made Thai food before. I made this recipe, omitting cabbage, doubled the chicken, and used all frozen veggies and it WAS DELICIOUS! So much protein, and low in gluten! Thanks so much for sharing! I even posted the recipe to my Facebook page."

I didn't have edamame so I used extra broccoli. I backed off a little on the fresh ginger (personal preference) about a 1/2 tablespoon; it had enough ginger flavor without it for me. The next time I make it, though, I may 1-1/2 times the peanut sauce as it was a little dry for us with all the quinoa."

"reviewBody": "It was close! The flavors are all there, but the proportions were a bit off for our preferences. We cut the quinoa in half, tripled the veggies, and doubled the sauce. We used napa cabbage for this recipe and added in the broccoli florets as well. Red bell pepper would've been great with it as well. If you don't like the sauce tangy, add just a tsp or so of agave nectar. But it's still a great sauce without it. We didn't have salted peanuts, but instead added in some sweet chili pistachios because that's what was in the pantry. Think it would've been similar without them though. Overall, this is a must-keep and make over and over again recipe, but again, for us, the proportions were a bit off, so we'd make it our way. Thanks for the great recipe!"

I would have liked it better with more peanut butter and less soy sauce. My husband thought the soy sauce was fine but agreed it needed more peanut butter. We also didn't have chili garlic sauce so that was omitted. We're not tolerant of a lot of spice anyway so we didn't add anything in it's place."

We put extra scallions on top with the peanuts. I may try a little more peanut butter next time too"

"reviewBody": "This was a nice solid recipe. Loved the level of spice/heat, liked that it is healthy. I made it as called for, but next time think I would make double the sauce so it is a little more saucy (or use a little less quinoa). \n\nI will likely make this again even though it felt like I was doing quite a bit of chopping. However, that actually makes it a great \"prep-ahead\" type recipe though...just cut everything the day or weekend in advance and then toss everything together as called for. I would think it would come together pretty quickly that way and make it an easy-ish weeknight recipe. \n\nThe edamame I bought was still in the shell...somehow missed that when i purchased it. (Oops!) So, that took extra time shelling them. But, oh well. \n\nIt does make A LOT so be prepared to feed a crowd, or cut the recipe in half."

I sprung for the shrimp because it was on sale, sauteed them off real quick and followed the rest of the recipe to the letter.....BIG. FAMILY. HIT.

Next time I made it with shrimps instaed of chicken and as it happenned that I had no water chestnuts can in my pantry, I replaced it by hearts of palms and it was as good as the first time."

Instead of the chile sauce I used approximately 3 tablespoons of Sriracha Sauce, 4 cloves of minced garlic, 3 tablespoons of fresh ginger, red pepper flakes (to taste) and just about a 1/2 fresh squeezed lime. As for the veggies you can use whatever you have in your fridge. Before serving squeeze the remaining lime, stir and add 3 chopped scallions. I also did not use the cilantro and peanuts because I did not have any; and used smooth peanut butter because that is what I had on hand."

"reviewBody": "Omg, I'm blown away!! And so was everyone else who ate it! I think it might be the best Pad Thai I've had.\nI did make a few changes. I wanted to double the recipe, and based on reviews, I doubled everything but the quinoa, which was a good call. So much quinoa! (also, I quadrupled the broccoli.) \nI also added a red pepper, and an onion. I didn't feel like edamame, and I hate cilantro, so I didn't add those ingredients. I also just served it on a bed of quinoa, rather than mixing it all together, just my preference. \nI absolutely LOVED this dish, and I'm definitely going to make this on a regular basis. Big thanks to the user who shared it!: :)"

"reviewBody": "I used shrimp instead of chicken, but, since that was given as an option at the top of the recipe, I do not believe that is against the \"rules\" of following instructions exactly to do a rating. I also had to omit the garlic because of an allergy, but I try not to base my ratings on that omission because I've gotten used to the lack of garlic. This is a REALLY good recipe but there is WAY too much quinoa. Half of the quinoa would be plenty. This is why I went with four stars instead of five. It is a little bit spicy for my taste, but I'm a wimp."

"reviewBody": "This was amazing. I am a vegetarian and substituted the chicken for smoked tofu - turned out awesome. I also ran out of sesame oil so substituted peanut oil instead, shelled the edamame from the frozen steamer packs from Costco, used crunchy peanut butter in the sauce, and dry roasted peanuts instead if blanched on top after it was warmed up (gotta use what ya got!) I portioned it out into 6 whole bowls and kept in fridge for up to 4 days. Took this for lunch and it was so so so good. Healthy, filling, flavourful and packed with protein."

It was easy to substitute the hot ginger sauce with fresh ginger and spiracha sauce. I also used amino acid as substitute for soy sauce. I also loved it with quinoa!"
