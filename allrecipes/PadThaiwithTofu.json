"reviewBody": "I really liked this dish. 1/4 cup of sriracha is a lot. I used about half that and it was still very spicy for us. I couldn't find tamarind, so a quick internet search said to substitute lime juice and brown sugar ( I left out the white sugar). I will make this again, next time with bean sprouts, which I like in my Pad Thai. Thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Great recipe. I was a little skeptical about the amount of sauce, thinking it might make the noodles soggy but somehow this worked. I didn't end up adding as much of the sauce at the end but rather went by taste. Also I accidently cooked my noodles in the hot water step longer than 3 min so this would probably account for less sauce being needed. Overall great taste! I will make this again for sure."
