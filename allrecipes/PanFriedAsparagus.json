Four stars simply because the ingredients should call for coarse salt and ground pepper TO TASTE. Someone in comments thought it called for a TABLESPOON of salt. That would be insane. Anyway, I can always count on Allrecipes to get it right. Thank you."

Then I added the asparagus (~2\" pieces). Sauteed that for about 8 min, for tender-crisp. About 1 minute before it was done, I added two cloves of minced garlic. Nothing worse than burnt garlic, and this would prevent it. Great topped with parmesan cheese, but I also tried with store-bought crisp fried onions."

"reviewBody": "Super easy and pretty dang delish. A lot of people seemed to be all turned off with the amount of butter listed, but the fact is you don’t have to eat it all. It did help that I had more than a pound in the pan - they were pretty long so I cut them in half and then there seemed to be so much! But I had a lot of butter to move it around in, and in the end a bunch of butter in the pan (I removed to another bowl after cooking ). I didn’t find it too salty and the garlic didn’t burn either - it was quite delicious! I did consider topping off with some red wine, but decided to go with the recipe as written the first time. So glad I did - yum! Will try tweaks some other time. As is, it was a fabulous side to birthday steaks!"

"reviewBody": "I have been making this for years. I don't use olive oil, less butter and use more garlic but we love garlic. I don't add the garlic until the asparagus is almost cooked because it will get over cooked. Also, I use low to med low heat. Once the aspargus is cooked tender crisp, take it off the heat, plate and serve immediately or put in a dish and serve immediately. The hot pan will continue to cook the asparagus and it will get overcooked, Yuk."
