"reviewBody": "I went with smoked ham and Swiss cheese and thought these were pretty good. I loved the sundried tomato mayo. If you use dry-packed tomatoes (instead of oil-packed), you will want to rehydrate them in boiling water for 5-10 minutes. The only thing I would change next time is the bread. I wasn't a big fan of the Sister Schubert's rolls - they have an odd sweetness to them. These are small sandwiches due to the size of the rolls, about slider size, so take that into consideration. I made them a second time with a sriracha mayo instead of sundried tomato, and they were just as tasty."

"reviewBody": "I made this vegan by using vegan mayo &amp; Daiya-brand provolone &amp; Tofurkey-brand cheese &amp; meat. The bread I used was La Brea “French dinner rolls” found in our grocery bakery. I set the sandwiches in a large cast iron skillet heated to medium &amp; placed a second (slightly smaller) cast iron skillet in top of them. They got 3 1/2 minutes each side. Even tho the tops of the rolls were round, this worked well &amp; they were delicious."

I added garlic salt and Cavenders no salt to the mayo mix, and combined with everything else it rocked. I give it 4 stars because standing alone I don't think it would have been as good."

I didn't try the sun dried tomato mayonnaise but I will on my next shot. My eleven year old said this is a keeper and told me to save it to the favorites."
