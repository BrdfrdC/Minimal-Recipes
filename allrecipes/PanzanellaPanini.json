If you'd like to save a few calories try using an olive oil spray on the outside of the bread. If you want to save even more you don't have to use any. Most of the makers are non-stick today. What a perfect time of year for this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Good sandwich! A US-based chain, Corner Bakery Cafe serves a sandwich similiar to this. It's called tomato mozzarella on ciabatta ficelle. Although I prefer their sandwich a little better, it's only because CB serves theirs cold. I guess I am not a fan of warm tomatoes / basil / mozzarella (but I like margherita pizza, so go figure!). I think the flavors are more pronounced and fresh-tasting when served cold, but that's just me.... Having said this, I am glad to have followed Mrs. William's directions since it gave me an excuse to use my new panini press! :) I only slightly altered Mrs. W's recipe. Instead of sprinkling my bread with vinegar (I used ciabatta rolls), I spread a little basil pesto on each slice. I then layered everything in this order: DOUBLE the amount of fresh mozzarella called for (I LOVE cheese!), thinly sliced tomatoes, a sprinkling of fresh cracked black pepper / coarse sea salt (the latter really brings out the flavor of the tomatoes), balsamic, basil and another slice of mozzarella (cut in half). My hubby gave this a thumbs-up, but didn't like my additon of pesto (he thought it was bitter tasting and that there was too much of it). :( I thought the balsamic was a little strong lol! Thanks for sharing your idea, Mrs. Williams. I will definitely try this again (COLD), sans the pesto to appease my hubby! :-)"

Finished it by pressing it with another skillet until cheese was melted. This was awesome!"

I didn't over stuff my sandwich on purpose, because I actually love the taste of the bread, too! :) Wouldn't change a thing, but a lil Parmesan would be good freshly grated over the olive oil just before grilling, I think. I grilled these as I do all my \"panini\" style sammiches...on my cast iron grill pan, with my bacon press. :) Thanks, Mrs W, for a nice light, but full of flavor, dish! :)"

I would recommond coarsely chopping the basil. I left the leaves whole and when I bit into the sandwich they came all out at once. I also seasoned the tomatoes with a little salt and pepper which I would definately recommend."

I used a whole loaf of ciabatta bread (I think I confused two recipes) and spit it, built one big sandwich and cooked in olive oil sprinkles with parmesan cheese. We sliced it and ate wedges of it with tomato basil soup for a delicious easy dinner. Will try onions when hubby is not home, he is not a fan. My sons loved this too."

I do make the following modifications on this recipe...Instead of using olive oil I lightly spray the bread with olive oil flavored cooking spray (tastes just the same but without the fat), add sliced red and green peppers to the sandwich along with yellow onion, and crushed red pepper flakes. You can even add sliced mushrooms as well. Thanks for sharing the recipe, delicious!"

I used Trader Joe's Marinated Mozzarella for the cheese which has olive oil, garlic, red peppers,and salt. I did not add salt or pepper to the recipe, but did brush the outside of the bread with olive oil before grilling on the George Foreman. What a wonderful sandwich!!"

I also added two slices of proscuitto and thinly sliced red onion to the rest of the ingredients. I used my Georgie Foreman grill and it worked great! The combo of tastes and textures were just unbelievably good!!! The fresh basil leaves and the balsamic vinegar really make the sandwich though...I think it would not be as good without these two ingredients!"

I followed the recipe exactly right up until I was about to put it on the grill.. then, being the meat-eater that I am, I decided that and it needed some proscuitto. I added 2 super thin slices to the sandwich and then grilled it.. WOW! a flavour sensation! I'll be taking one to work at least once a week for a nice easy lunch!"

Didn't have red onion so I used vidalia sweet onion. I think this would be good with fresh baby spinach instead of fresh basil with a sprinkeling of dried basil over the tomato layer. Will try that next time. Was very good as is."

I held the grill down for a minute, and after that just let it be. The bread toasted better than I expected, and had better color/texture where ever I had put the olive oil. Added the balsamic to the tomatoes instead of the bread (was afraid the bread would get soggy), and added S&amp;P to the fresh mozzarella. Super fast &amp; easy &amp; tasty = 5 stars."
