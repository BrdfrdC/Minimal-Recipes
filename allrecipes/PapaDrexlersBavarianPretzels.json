After shaped, let them rise on counter about 20 minutes, place in the refrigerator uncovered and allow them to form a skin for about 45 minutes and have your water bath ready. To get a better pretzel flavor try baking your baking soda on a foil lined sheet in the oven at 300F for 1 hour; this will make it more alkaline and more like the traditional lye that is used and not as caustic. I prep a whole tray of baking soda and store in the pantry for pretzels and bagels. I use about 1/3 cup per 6 cups water."

I didn’t change a thing in the ingredients. Kneeded the dough by hand for around 8 mins. With the baking soda bath, I boiled the water and added the soda, I then poured it into a shallow bowl, just enough to fully submerge the prezel. I dunked them only a few seconds at a time. That way no flipping needed. \nBaked them for around 12 minutes, lovely crisp to the crust and soft centre."

To me it just tasted like bread. I would make them again but seems like they needed more of a sourdough feeling to the dough and to be tougher. My daughter made a couple of much smaller ones which actually seemed closer to real pretzels then the large ones I made. Yes, I did knead the dough for at least 8 minutes. I made these for a party and everyone enjoyed them, so they were good. \nI am not much of a baker, so not sure what I would change next time."

I let them reat about 15 min after splitting the dough and before shaping. This was probably too long as they nearly fell apart in the water - they probably need to remain a bit denser. I will make them again with this small adjustment."

"reviewBody": "This was my first pretzel recipe I ever tried (I am very much a novice when it comes to baking anything involving yeast), and I'm pleased to say that even I couldn't ruin these. I followed the recipe with one small adjustment: I read in another comment that reducing the water bath from 3 cups to 2.5 strengthens the effect of the baking soda, so I followed that advice. I will say that the dough was VERY sticky, and while I was kneading I was having some trouble keeping everything together. I ended up adding quite a bit of flour (gradually, during kneading), and thankfully it all turned out fine. \n\nMy only real advice is to Google how to twist a pretzel before you go about making these. You might think \"who doesn't know how to twist a pretzel?\" but I promise you, if your only preparation for twisting a pretzel is that you've *seen pretzels before,* you're gonna have a hard time. \n\nOh, and double the recipe, because everyone is going to want seconds."

Couple of notes: 1) I used to Kitchen Aid to knead the entire time and used at least 3/4 cup more flour; 2) note the 1 Tbsp of yeast! This is more than 1 small packet but less than 2; and 3) my baking time was closer to 16-18 min. Thanks so much Papa D!!! \n\nps. Mustard/cheese sauce is great compliment.\n."

When it comes to shaping the pretzel, I saw a video that suggested rolling the dough into a log shape that's shorter than what you need, waiting a couple of minutes for the gluten to relax, and then rolling out to the right length &amp; twisting into the shape. This made it a lot easier!"

Actually I baked them two different ways- done in the oven and some in an electronic pretzel press. The ones in the press actually were crispier. The outside did not come out with a smooth outside. Real-deal German pretzels have an outer crust that almost looks like skin- very smooth with s split along the bottom. The European style pretzels are tough to make. our kind of flour is so different."

"reviewBody": "These were good in that any homemade bread is good. I'm making and comparing a few soft pretzel recipes in preparation for an Oktoberfest party, so I suggest1 - Use bread flour, not AP flour. The dough was really soft and sticky, I had to knead in some more flour just to handle it, and the first few I rolled did not develop good surface tension and absorbed water during the alkaline bath. Once I got the right amount of flour incorporated, they rolled better. I find that recipes made with AP flour tend to have this issue where ones made with bread flour don't. 2 - Use a full teaspoon of salt. The dough was a bit bland, and more salt would have helped.\n\nUltimately the texture of these is like a soft mall pretzel -- delicious in their own right. -- not so much a crusty pub pretzel which is what I'm after. \n\nFinally, I used a trick for the alkaline bath where I baked 1c of baking soda for 2 hours at 250 to dehydrate it and raise the Ph, which gives better browning. Then I used 3T of this baking soda with the water, and dipped each pretzel for 30 seconds on each side. This yielded the best pretzel crust I've made to date!"

Made these about 10 times so far since they are SO good.\nI found if I do not added butter on top they get more of a golden brown, or maybe just be sure to add a little butter not too much. Just experiment with one or two with the butter since it could depend on your oven. Also I made a water/baking soda bath so you don't need to flip the pretzels, and a spatula to scoop them out.\nIf you do not dip them in the water/baking soda bath, you can make them dessert pretzels by adding sugar and cinnamon on top.\nDo use a flat baking sheet without ridges as these things tend to stick."
