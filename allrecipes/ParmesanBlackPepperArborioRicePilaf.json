I am sure fresh parmesan would be much better, but overall, it was tasty!"

But I found this recipe and it was so easy to put together &amp; tasted delicious! I easily halved the recipe because there are just two of us. The only thing I did differently was adding a couple cloves of fresh minced garlic and two diced jalapeños along with the chopped onion when I sautéed in the olive oil &amp; butter. The jalapeño added a fantastic bite to the finished dish, and contrasted nicely with the creamy arborio rice. I especially loved that I could let the rice sit for quite a while before adding the broth for the final cooking step. It all came together very nicely after simmering for about 15 minutes. I did use fresh grated parmesan. We reheated the leftovers tonight and it was just as delicious. : )"

I used fresh parmesan and garlic as reviewers suggested and also some hot sauce because we like our food spicy, and other than the pepper, it was fantastic. I served it with sauteed red bell peppers.

I've made risotto tons of times using the regular method (add stock, stir, add stock, stir, repeat for 45 minutes) and was a little nervous about attempting to cheat. I don't know how I managed it but this came out even creamier than my usual risotto. **Delicious** I'll be making risotto far more often than I used to. Please note, it took much longer than 12 minutes... more like 35. But as long as I didn't have to stand there and stir, and it came out better than my traditional risotto it's a keeper."

I sauteed some crimini mushrooms and threw them in just as the onion was done; didn't have low-sodium broth but used 2/3 chicken boullion cubes + 1 vegetable cube, leaving out any additional salt. Also added a bit more water (maybe 1/4 cup), as I like rice a bit moist. As others have said, FRESHly grated parmesan is a must...we love parmesano-reggiano though I probably haven't spelled it properly :) A very easy and enjoyable recipe...will definitely make again!

I added 1T instead of 1t pepper and couldn't eat it (it seemed like a lot, but I thought I was following the recipe! :))\nSo if you add the right amt. of black pepper, it's great! I also have made it with minute rice (cooked in beef broth instead of water) with carrots and peas added, and it is delish - not as creamy but a quick and easy alternative (and good if you don't have arborio rice :))\nOverall definitely a 5-star recipe, and something I'll make again and again!"

I reccomend adding garlic and mushrooms like one other reviewer suggested. Also, you don't need to add the salt as most broths already have quite the salt content."
