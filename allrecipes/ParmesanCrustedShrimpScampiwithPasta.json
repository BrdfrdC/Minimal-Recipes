I substituted spaghetti squash for the angel hair (Stabbed the squash a few times with a knife and microwaved it for 15-20 mins turning it halfway). Delicious! I think it's best to cook this meal in a cast iron skillet if possible."

Mixed messages in these reviews re how to measure the dry pasta, so I just went with a 16 oz package (per the package, it's 8 servings, but it worked). Doubled everything except sauce, which I increased. I used sauvignon blanc wine. I have a nice big broiler pan and put the entire batch in that when it was set to go, leaving lots of room to top with the bread crumb mixture. Rave reviews!"
