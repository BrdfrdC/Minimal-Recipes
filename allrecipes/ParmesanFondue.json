"reviewBody": "This fondue is delicious, cheap to make (since it does not use very expensive cheeses), and super fast &amp; easy to make! I followed the recipes written, except that based on reviews I read, I omitted adding any extra salt. Instead of garlic salt, i simply used 1 tsp of garlic powder (that had no salt in it). It was perfect, and i definitely would not want to add any extra salt flavor--- the natural salts in the cheese are enough. I was worried about it being lumpy, based on reviews i read--- but all you need to do, is use a WISK and the lumps dissolve quickly! I really feel like the wisk should've been mentioned in the directions, to help people handle the lumps. Note-- i cooked this all on the stove, and then transferred it to the fondue (and only used my fondue maker to keep it warm on a low setting), and that worked out great for me."

"reviewBody": "I've been making traditional Swiss fondue for almost 30 years. This is not as good, but then it never claimed to be. I was looking for an inexpensive fondue alternative and I found a keeper. Because Parmesan cheese is high in salt to begin with, I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I also used regular cream cheese as that's what I had on hand. This turned out creamy and delicious. I served it with homemade bread and granny smith apples to dip. Both were delicious in this fondue. I will be making this again."

Was a little skeptical that so few ingredients would taste good and I kept double checking that I didn't miss an ingredient, but it was my favorite at a fondue party that had 7 cheese dips to choose from. I used a focassia and a kalamata bread to dip. Super good. We also dipped meatballs, sausages, tortellini, veggies, bagels . . . You name it. Completely recommend."
