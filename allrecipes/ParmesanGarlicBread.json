I also omitted the garlic salt, using only garlic powder. I eyeballed the herbs, used freshly grated parm and added grated pecorino romano to the butter. Spread the mixture on fresh Italian bread, and heated in the oven on 350F until toasted. YUM! I served it along with the \"World's Best Lasagne\" recipe on this site. Next time I'll try using minced garlic instead of garlic powder."

Be aware that not all garlic salts are equal - some are saltier than others. My preference is to use salted butter and no garlic salt at all - just increase the garlic powder to taste. Like other reviewers I only softened the butter, much easier to spread. Although I have also melted the butter and added minced fresh garlic to it. This actually worked very well. Use a pastry brush to get it on the bread."

Next time I would either use unsalted butter or swap out at least half the garlic salt for plain garlic powder. Other than the saltiness though, the flavors of this bread were really good."

"reviewBody": "I looked up this recipe as a last minute thing, so was forced to use what I had on hand. I don't buy garlic salt, so I used garlic powder. My dried rosemary is like dried twigs, I need to see if they sell it in a more ground up form. I tried smooshing it with my fingers, which only broke them in half maybe. I'd like them more finely ground, but I liked the flavor. I happened to have a completely softened stick of butter on the counter, so I used that. At the last minute I realized it was my husband's no salt butter (I use salted butter for everything, he uses his own for buttering toast and such). So I did add salt to this mixture, but I don't think it was enough. Maybe had I used salted butter AND garlic salt, it would have had more flavor. I didn't melt the butter, didn't think it was necessary. I just mixed it all together and buttered slices of whole grain sandwich bread. I put it under the broiler until it was browned. It takes a thick layer of this butter mixture to make it moist and not too dry. I also want to try leaving out the cheese the next time. I don't think it really adds anything special, and have a feeling it just dries it out as well."

The butter should be softened, but not melted, it spreads much easier that way. If your family likes \"meat and cheese\" then this recipe with the addition of the prosciutto will make them very happy!"

"reviewBody": "I was so pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I thought it was going to be your standard \"herbed butter\", but it was so much better! The addition of parmesan cheese (I used freshly grated) really punches up the flavor. I did tweak it slightly, based on what I had on hand. I didn't have any rosemary or garlic salt, so I substituted oregano and just used a total of 1 1/2 Tbls. garlic powder. Oh, and I didn't melt the butter, I just softened it and mixed everything in with a fork. This is now my new \"go to\" toasted garlic bread recipe!!"

My family loves garlic so i'm pretty sure i used double if not more garlic powder and i also added about 2 tablespoons of freshly minced garlic. The rosemary has such a great flavor. It almost tasted like the spiced oil you would get to dip your bread in at an Italian restaurant. This recipe is definitely worth making over and over agin. Thank you for sharing:]"

I took a taste after mixing it and and thought it tasted a whole lot like regular butter. Not nearly enough seasoning for me! I added a tablespoon of italian seasoning, a teaspoon of crushed dried rosemary, and a 1/4 cup of parmesan. Now we were on to something. I spread the mixture on fresh french bread, and baked it at 350 until it reached the desired crispness. It turned out more than great."

My boys thought this was the best garlic bread they've ever eaten!! I'm not a fan of rosemary but thought it was very good also. After the 10 min in the oven at 300, I pulled the bread out &amp; cranked it up to 450 to \"toast\" the buttered side."
