My mom is allergic so I was specifically trying to find a punch that was pineapple-free. This was it!\n\nI also want to add that the taste of this punch largely depends on the orange juice you use. If you buy a cheap or not so top of the line orange juice, you probably aren't going to like the recipe. I used Tropicana which I think has the best taste. I bet you anything that the people that gave this a low rating used a bad tasting orange juice."

I also added a few dollops of rainbow sherbert (any flavor would do) to the top and a dollop in each glass with a orange wedge. It was simple, tasty, &amp; festive for about five minutes of work!"

We served this to to a party of 12 people and it was a hit, just not sloshed down the way people do on an extremely hot summer's day. We followed the recipe with a few adjustments. We added a container of frozen pineapple juice to make this more of a fruit punch. We used frozen fruit punch and made our own by adding the water to the juice which gave it a fresher taste. We also added a can of pineapple in its own juices. We used a very large container to serve it in and topped with sliced oranges and strawberries. The gingerale needs to be increased in the recipe, but not doubled, maybe by about a third."

"reviewBody": "I was looking for a punch for an all day open house that would be easy and delicious and this one hit the spot! All who came by complimented on the punch!\r\nSince I did not have access to a fridge/freezer all day, the night before I filled 2 icecube trays (one with punch, the other with OJ) and kept them in a cooler the first half of the day. I also froze orange slices in a baggie and had them floating on top with the ice cubes to keep the punch cool. It was very colorful! Then I froze a cool whip size container with punch and orange slices.\r\nThis acted as a huge ice cube and kept the punch chilled all day. But it turns out this punch tastes great even when at room temperature."
