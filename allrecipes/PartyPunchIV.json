My friends mostly liked it (although a little on the sweet side) but everyone agreed that it still didn't pack much of a punch. The high rating is for a simple yet decent punch that can be thrown together in a pinch w/a few inexpensive ingredients. Lots of potential for it to be doctored up w/different fun ingredients."

It's now a standard at my bar set-up, along with other pop &amp; mixers, beer and wine. I split it into two batches -- one spiked and one virgin, and don't bother with the punch bowl, I just use large pitchers. My only warning is to pour the pop in small batches and don't stir it too much, as the carbonation seems to react with the juice concentrate and really fizzes up a lot. I had a sticky mess to clean up the first time -- learned my lesson after that. Great punch - definitely recommend!"
