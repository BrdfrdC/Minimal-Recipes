For 40 guests I doubled the 24 servings and it was just the right amount with no left overs, since some drank coffee, others drank water. I also used diet ginger ale since this is so sweet and already full of calories from the fruit juices."

I chose this recipe because it looked very easy to make on location and I wasn't sure how much we'd need, even with the serving size suggestion. It ended up being about 6 oz. per person (half again of what the recipe suggests). I saw several people ladeling extra water into thier cups of punch; it is pretty rich. But I liked it and will make it again!"

I brought it to a baby shower and had several people ask for the recipe. Just for fun, I like to make ice cubes out of muffin tins and freeze a slice of strawberry and a mint leaf inside. If you make a dozen of these they float really nicely in a punch bowl."
