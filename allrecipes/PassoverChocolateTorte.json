"reviewBody": "I had to make this totally diary free for a family member and semisweet chocolate has dairy fat in it. So I used 5 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon cocoa powder and 8 tablespoons coconut oil and 9 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon sugar, mixed that with the dairy free margarine and put them in the micro for 10 seconds, instead of step 2. It turned out perfectly. To make a pretty presentation I made a coulis of 1 cup frozen pineapple, 2 big slices mango, 1 banana and 1 cup almond milk (buzzed in the blender)and poured some on each plate before placing a piece of cake on it. Then I sprinkled toasted sliced almonds and coconut on top. For those who could eat dairy I added a squirt of ready whip on top. It was a huge hit."

"reviewBody": "I just made this the other day for the first time in a long time, so I thought I would review again. This time I decided to upgrade to 5 stars because it turned out better and some of that was because of technique (as in I realized the poorer result before was my fault) rather than the recipe. This time I was sure to grind the almonds very fine in small batches in my coffee grinder, which made for a nicer texture, and I baked the torte until a toothpick inserted into the middle came out nearly clean (about 55 minutes), which eliminated the too-raw centre but still remained moist and slightly fudgey. I forgot to cover with foil for the last 20 minutes but I actually really liked the crust that developed as a result, and kept it as the top since it looked appealing. I used coconut oil instead of margarine to make it dairy free. I added 2 1/2 tsp instant decaf coffee to the chocolate mixture while it melted which made for a lovely, deeper chocolate, slightly mocha flavour. I topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze again, this time with 2 tsp instant coffee added while melting which was such a lovely combination. The torte received raves and disappeared quickly; I will definitely be making it again, sooner this time.\n\nOld review: I would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could, but went with 4. It was quite tasty. I baked 45 minutes and it should have been more because it was runny in the middle, but it still tasted good. I ground slivered almonds in my coffee grinder, which worked pr"

Once i finally did get it out it was so moist that i could actually take a knife and spread the cake over the cracks to fix it. Hoping to get the pretty top it origionally had (which is now on the bottom after flipping it out) I stuck it on a cookie sheet and put it in the oven for 20 more minutes. It seems to have sortof worked. I'm bringing it to my family tomorrow, hope it tastes as good as people say it is!"

I put it in for 45 minutes and the outside of the cake was good but the inside/middle part of the cake didn't have the desired consistency or taste that I was looking for. Another tip is to make sure you grind the almonds to a flour consistency. My almonds weren't ground good enough and you could taste them in the cake. I served them with fresh strawberries but I think itwould go well with a rasberry sauce. I think the tartness in the rasberries would compliment the chocolate very well."

"reviewBody": "I should preface this by saying I am NOT an experience baker, so my problems with this recipe could very well be due to my own lack of skill. I thought the torte was fine, but not anything special. I could have made brownies from a box and they would have been a lot easier and possibly tastier. I threw away the leftovers after the party. Here is what I had problems with:\n The torte ended up being pretty flat and fell apart when I released it from the pan(Not enough grease on the foil? Didn't let cool for full 10 minutes? Why the tin foil anyway?)\n It took a lot longer to bake than stated to get the center to be \"set\" and not gooey (maybe too long? Edges seemed a bit crispy, but the center was just no longer gooey when I took it out)\n The ground almonds did not grind very fine in my chopper, so it looked like it had bits of cous cous in it (I do not own a coffee grinder)\nI tried to follow the recipe pretty closely, except I did use real butter instead of pareve margarine (yes, I know it defeats the purpose of it being a \"passover\" torte). Also, I don't know if it matters, but I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of squares. The torte just didn't have the density and rich taste I was expecting. I will probaby not make this one again."

I made it last night and I got scared towards the end of the baking time because the top looked dried out, so I took it out about 7 minutes shy of what the recipe called for. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter. It turns out I should have trusted the recipe, because the center was more than gooey, it was undercooked. However... that is not the end of the story. My husband and I both had a piece while it was still warm, we couldn't resist after smelling it baking! As described above, the center was hot and very gooey, too gooey, actually, but towards the outer edge it became incredible... dense and moist and chocolatey.... perfect, in fact. I put it in the refrigerator overnight and today it is FABULOUS... even the undercooked inside is now more like the inside of a truffle, and then it gets cakier towards the outside. I am baking another one tonight and will follow the recommended baking time religiously... otherwise, I won't change a thing. I used my coffee grinder to grind the sliced almonds my husband brought home from the store, so, if you're wondering how to grind your almonds, that worked perfectly for me. Turned the almonds into a fine-textured meal, almost like flour.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a rich, decadent and VERY chocolatey dessert. It will not disappoint."

"reviewBody": "I made this cake for one of the Sedars. I was worried about making a cake without flour but i had no choice there dessert, my family forgot to get one. It was a hit. My mother who is a very critical cook loved it and that she would rather eat this than any store bought cake. The Glaze that was suggested in an earlier review was fabulous. I have to admit though that when the cake was done in the oven, it looked odd. However since it was flipped over it didn't matter. It was great. This will definitaly be a dessert used on occassions other than Passover."

"reviewBody": "What an awesome dessert! I made it in an 11\" torte pan and glazed it with a chocolate glaze that I found on this site (\"Satiny Chocolate Glaze\"). After glazing, I cut the torte into 12 slices (next time I will make 16 slices) and put half a large strawberry, cut side down, on each slice by the outer edge. My book club gals loved it and everyone wanted the recipe!!! This is an easy winner!"
