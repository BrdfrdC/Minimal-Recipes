After I mixed in the milk and eggs and butter to the frying pan, with the fettuccine, it was kinda like cooking eggs and got eggy a bit. I added chicken, mushrooms, bacon and parsley as well. The outcome was kind of disappointing. Too much egg and not a taste of the cream sauce. It's kind of like eating just plain pasta with chicken, bacon, mushrooms, and parsley. I must of cooked it wrong or something."

"reviewBody": "If you're finding that your sauce comes out lumpy or doesn't come together, before you post a negative review, make sure you're using the right cheese; don't use the powdered stuff obviously, but also make sure that your cheese is VERY finely grated (not shredded... It should be basically pulverized). If yours is shredded, pulse it in the food processor for a few seconds and you're good to go!\n\nAnyway, this recipe was awesome, although I don't use cream (it's more traditional that way) and thin it out with some of the pasta water. I also brown up some garlic in a touch of butter and mix that in. Perfect!"

Changes: I sub skim milk for the cream and more than double it (1/2-2/3 c), I sauté onion (1/2 onion) and garlic (2 cloves) in about 1/3 of the bacon grease and use the bacon grease in place of the butter, I use dried parsley and always add peas! I stir the pasta/sauce over low heat for about 5 minutes and it comes out very creamy but the noodles do get a little mangled! This is one of our go to recipes because you can make sure to have all the ingredients in the house and they don't really go bad!!!!"

I think it is important to go a little bit over the ingredients. I made this twice since I didn't want to waste the cream or parmesan (two things I don't normally use). The second time I went a little more than what the instructions asked for all the cream, cheese, and butter and it was even better. \n\nI agree to save the bacon drippings and put some in the mixture at the end."

I used more then a half a pound of bacon and I did like the texture it gave by cutting up the bacon first instead of just crumbling whole pieces into it. I cooked some sliced baby ports. and diced onions in the bacon fat. I whisked in about 3 TBL of butter into the drippings. I whipped about 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup grated parm into the 1 egg and 3 egg yolks. Tossed the pasta into that and then threw it into the pan for a minute or two and kept it moving. I did not get this creamy like sauce but the taste was out of this world. I could not stop eating it."

"reviewBody": "I decided to make this because I thought I had everything needed for this recipe and since we're in the middle of a move we needed something quick, easy and filling. \n\nI started out this recipe incredibly sceptical and once I realized I was short on bacon I only became more sceptical. During cooking it looked so odd to me (with my substitute left over rotiserrie chicken and mushroom sauted in the bacon grease) that I really stopped trying to make it good. I just wanted to finish it and call it a day and perhaps call in a pizza. BUT, even with the substitutions and my complete lack of effort it was a DELICIOUS recipe!\n\nHonestly, if I can't mess it up (as a novice) with a ton of substitutions and with out even trying to measure or do it right, then I doubt that there's a way to really mess it up.\n\nTotally worth trying!!!"

My pasta was ready before I was, so I left it to sit in the water to retain its heat. Unfortunately this added \"cooking\" time made it overdone."

I made it in haste a few days later and it was not all perfectly room temparature and it was grity as the sauce did not melt together. So, if you follow the instructions, it will be perfect!"

A few changes I made: skim milk instead of heavy cream, less pasta (about 3/4 of the package), and added some steamed diced carrots to make it a bit healthier ;) I cooked the bacon in strips in the microwave oven and then cut them in small pieces. I heated the cheese-egg mixture for ~15 seconds in the microwave before pouring it with the noodles, because I was not quick enough and I had let my noodles cool down a bit. Even with the skim milk this was a very heavy dish."

I left a box of frozen peas on the counter while I was cooking to let them thaw out a little and then just sprinkled some in at the end of the recipe. I doubled the amount of heavy cream but kept the amount of cheese and eggs the same. I left the eggs and cream on the counter for about an hour and they were still a little chilled so the pasta wasn't very hot. Make sure you leave enough time to let the eggs and cream sit out for a while. I used cheese tortellini instead of linguine."
