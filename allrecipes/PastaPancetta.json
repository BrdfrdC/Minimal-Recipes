I seasoned to taste with salt and garlic powder in addition to the pepper and oregano overall not a bad recipe I will try again with the panchetta !! Happy cooking oh and I added spinach just because I like spinach .. very good addition"

As a preference, since this recipe calls for mushrooms, I added a bit of white wine while I sauteed them with the rest of ingredients to enhance the flavor. It was very good. I garnished it with fresh Italian parsley which I also added during cooking. This recipe is all about the pancetta and the mushroom therefore, try to get the best mushrooms and pancetta you can. I also would undercook the pasta and finish it when putting the rest of the ingredients to simmer so the liquid starts sticking to the pasta sooner"

It didn't specify what type of mushrooms...I am assuming they meant white(?)ones, but I had a package of baby bellas (portobellas), so that is what I used.\n\nThe only change I made was to use 8 ounces of pancetta instead of 6 ounces. That is because the already cubed (yes, i am lazy)pancetta is sold in packages of 4 ounces and what was I going to do with the left over 2? \n\nIt came out DELICIOUS. My husband, when I ask how something is, particularly a new recipe, will give me an \"alright\". So annoying. \n\nWell - He gave me a \"really good\". Simple, easy and delicious."

Think this turned out better because I also mixed the pancetta mixture in with the pasta; along with two chopped Campari tomatoes. Absolutely delish! The fusilli holds in the flavour better and I’m getting mushrooms, pancetta and tomato in the curls, with each bite! Yummy!"

Then I added 1-2 cups of pasta water to enhance the sauce. Remaining drained pasta should be added to the sauce. Mix and cook to coat pasta. I then added a tbsp of butter to finish the sauce. Plated and topped with grated Romano cheese. Nowvitsvyummy."

Then added 16 oz can of fire roasted tomatoes and about 1/8 cup of white wine along with the broth. I also used prosciutto instead of pancetta, because I had it on hand. I cooked it covered as directed, then uncovered to let some of the liquid reduce, It had a great taste, but next time, I think I would add some tomatoe paste to make the sauce stick to the pasta better. I thought about cornstarch, but that seems \"wrong\" when talking pasta. I used it as a side dish with pesto stuffed chicken thighs wrapped in prosciutto. \"Pesto Chicken\" also on Allrecipes."

We have also added shredded zucchini to the pan at the same time as the mushrooms to sneak some more veggies in there."

"reviewBody": "I made it with tiny modifications and it was AMAZING, but I can see why some people found it a bit bland. I added a generous pinch of spicy pepper powder. The spice brought out the proper flavors very wonderfully without making the dish actually spicy. I also used fussilli pasta; vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and a different kind of bacon. I sprinkled some red pepper powder on top, as another reviewer suggested (okay, the reviewer suggested red pepper flakes, but I didn't have those). And I put the cooked pasta into the pan with the mushrooms and everything and left it there for the liquid to be soaked by the pasta, and the rest of it to evaporate. It was SO GOOD. So you should treat this recipe as a base to which you add things that you think are worthwhile - some suggested tomatoes, but for me spicy pepper does the trick."

The third bite was better, and there was hardly any left by the end of it. I think it could be easily jazzed up a bit if you added a few thinly sliced brussels sprouts, peas, or red peppers to it but that doesn't take from it being very tasty as it is. Thank you for the addition to our \"Must Make Again\" recipe folder."

I used the rest of the ingredients \"to taste\" as well, rather than adhering to strict measurements. I have to say it was the pancetta itself that was the only thing I disliked, but that is neither the fault of the recipe nor of the pancetta, just my own taste buds! I was to make this again, I'd use just a little bacon for flavor or maybe even none at all."

"reviewBody": "After reading reviews, I still wanted to try this one. I rate it 4 of 5 because I , too, altered it but not as much as a lot of people did. I could not find Pancetta and did not want to travel across town to get it, nor did I want to use bacon (bacon makes everything taste like bacon). I did use a MILD, sweeter, thin-sliced country ham and that worked perfectly for the recipe. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly until the end. I didn't think the sauce would adequately cover 12 oz. of pasta so I added a tad more olive oil to the noodles and just before tossing the pasta and sauce, I added a can of Hunt's Diced Fire Roasted tomatoes, drained and straight from the can and mixed the parmesan with the pasta, too. I topped each portion with a little grated parmesan and crushed red pepper flakes. The pepper &amp; tomatoes added more color and the oomph it was missing. I served it with a spinach salad and fried goat cheese and it was a great meal. I will make it again. I do have more advice--cook the noodles less than you would for al dente--do not overcook. This allows the sauce to mix well. Return the mix to the pasta pot (off the heat, of course) to let it rest before serving. Over cooking the pasta may be the reason many of the people are underwhelmed with the results."

To pep it up all it needed was a few hot pepper flakes (or to taste) and also a few chopped black olives. This, for us, is the answer so maybe someone else will try these additions. Otherwise it is a healthy pasta dish and a good submission. Thanks."

The flavor combination of the pancetta, mushrooms, and shallots is really good."
