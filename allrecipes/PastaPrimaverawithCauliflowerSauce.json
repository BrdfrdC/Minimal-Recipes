I had to add more liquid to it because it was so dry! I don't like dry food. And the seasoning it was just okay. I had to try to fix this dish to where I could eat it because I don't like wasting food! Also it became very bland so I really had to fix it up a lot and it took me longer then I expected. Even after all of trying to fix it to where i could eat it, it just became mushy. I mean it was already mushy before i tried to fix it . But once I left it overnight in the refrigerator the flavors and everything that I had added it helped us some by the next day as far as taste. But the look was still freaking mushy! Very irritating, very! I don't think I would make this again if I do I was just come up with my own."

OK, I added more garlic, salt, and pepper. I also used chicken stock. I may have added carrots and tomato to the mix, too. Other than that I followed the recipe quite faithfully. It was delicious. The reason for four stars instead of five is that it NEEDED extra garlic and salt. Without them the dish would be bland. But this is going to be my new go-to Alfredo sauce."

With that said, this dish is very good; I adjusted the servings to 9 and the ingredient amounts were right on the mark. It's filling, it's healthy, and there was plenty of the sauce without having to add water. I did use plenty of salt, that's probably the only downside. I would make this again. My husband enjoyed it also."

"reviewBody": "The sauce turned out silky smooth which was impressive but we found it a little bland, as in it needed salt, or something. Maybe more cheese? I panfried some mushrooms in butter and also cooked the peppers that way. The broccoli was boiled as the recipe suggested. I added some cooked chicken to the pot at the end along with the sauce and veggies and we topped it with more Parmesan. My teenage son did have a second helping, so maybe it was only me that found it bland. I would make this again but would play with the salt, pepper and cheese for more flavour."
