Two cans diced tomatoes, drained, instead of fresh Roma. Lots of dried instead of fresh basil. Chickpea pasta, and chicken instead of sausage, though I’m sure it would be even better with sausage. This is a yummy one! Add less red pepper flakes if you’re not a fan of heat."

Combined the pasta with meat, vegetables, a touch of chile powder, and pasta water and shredded parm. I needed to use a few more vegetables. \nLots of flexibility"

"reviewBody": "I did make some slight changes. I used Italian sausage out of the casing. Broccoli florets in place of squash since my husband doesn't like squash and broccoli is borderline ok for him. Also, 15 leaves of basil chopped. I added 2 tablespoons of flour to thicken the juices. I don't like green bell pepper, the flavor is too strong for me, so I used an orange bell pepper. I will stick to yellow, orange or red. The flavor of this recipe was great! Didn't add any salt or pepper cause this recipe didn't need it. The veggies, basil and little bit of red pepper flakes make this very yummy! My husband like it enough to have 3 helpings! I will be making this again for sure! Oh, I made the 6 serving size and my 4 qt dutch oven handled it with ease."

The only change I made was to add some steamed green beans red instead of green bell peppers and instead of bouillon granules, I use \"better than bouillon\". I also added a few dollops of cream cheese because I had some I needed to use and it made it creamier. I also used rigatoni because that is what I had. The family loved and it is very economical as well! Thanks for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "I used mild Italian sausage and Rainbow Rotini instead of the Farfalla pasta recommended in the recipe. I also used a whole Valdalia onion and six cloves of garlic. I used only three Roma plum tomatoes but replaced them with 1/2 sweet red bell pepper and 1/2 orange bell pepper. This made it super colorful. Also only used about 1/8 cup olive oil and that was plenty! This was so fresh and well seasoned it needed no extra salt or pepper and we served the shaved paramasean cheese on the side to sprinkle on top at the table. I think this adds to the color and don't recommend heating the cheese in the pasta as the last step of the published recipe instructs. It turned out brilliantly colorful with fantastic flavor! I made this dish that serves eight and fed four of us....it was nearly gone!! I will definitely repeat this!"

"reviewBody": "Made tonight for hubby and myself. This is a keeper! I really appreciate the suggestions of others and incorporated some of them. Used a 14.5 oz can of stewed tomatoes w/Italian herbs (undrained), broccoli, bell pepper, carrots and celery (cuz that's what I had on hand) in addition to the onions and garlic. Added some 4-cheese Italian blend and grated Asiago cheese, then freshly ground pepper. I also kept the pasta separate as I knew we'd have leftovers. To serve, I put some pasta in first, then spooned the veggie/meat /cheese mixture on top. Then I microwaved on high for 1 minute. Give it a stir. Absolutely yummy!"

I wanted to use the turkey sausage, but the regular Italian was half the price, so I went with that. I also used chick pea pasta, as that was what I had on hand. It was easy to freeze in single serve ziplock bags. I made half a recipe and it made 4 bags. I will definitely do this one again."

I ended up cooking everything up earlier but had extra time before dinner time so I put it in a casserole pan and sprinkled some cheese on top and kept it in the oven on 100 degrees for the remaining time while I got ready and it tasted so good! Loved the squash in it as well."

Its easy to substitute ingredients that you like or don't. Its hard to find turkey sausage, so I use Mild Italian Sausage. I also use more peppers and less of the harder to find vegetables.

Didn't need to add any to saute onion &amp; garlic, and sliced baby bella mushrooms. Didn't have yellow squash. Used zucchini, carrots, red bell pepper. Don't used bullion cubes. Added a little bit (maybe 1/4 - 1/3 cup) low sod. chicken broth. Added a little cornstarch to thicken sauce before adding cheese, pasta and sausage back in. Used whole wheat pasta. Threw in some toasted pine nuts too."

I'm not a fan of sausage so I used chicken and seasoned that with salt, pepper, and Cajun. Sooo good! I love this recipe it's a nice base and then you can get fancy with it if you wish."

Also used chicken buillion paste (as I don't have granuals) and substituted asparagus for the yellow squash as it wasn't available at my store. I deglazed the pan with a little no-salt chicken broth after sautéing the sausages, onion and garlic (to get up all those yummy bits). Added the basil at the very end (otherwise it gets mushy) and mixed everything together for maybe 3 min over medium heat. Served it with the Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top - what a hit! Hubby absolutely loved it and I did too. Definitely company worthy!"

I had intended to include fresh mushrooms too, but forgot. I had to substitute dried for fresh basil also. No doubt, fresh basil would have made a huge difference, but as it was, even with dried basil and the other modifications (I didn't have time to get to the store), it was still excellent. Careful to taste before adding any salt. Maybe it's the salt in the Parmesan cheese, but the dish was plenty salty without adding any. Enjoy!"
