Each bite is full of flavor, balanced pretty well with ingredients, and just sits nicely as a healthy Diet Staple. I Carb Load with this and it is a tasty, easy recipe. Highly suggest."

"reviewBody": "Be careful when shopping for the tri-color pasta. Most brands come in 12 ounce packages, not full pounds (but are sold in boxes that resemble all of the one-pound regular pasta varieties that surround them on the shelves). So either buy a second box (and use a third of it), or reduce the other ingredients by one-fourth. For me, though, bottled dressings and commercial salad seasoning mixes add too much sodium, especially in combination with the olives. Better to make your own dressing from scratch and maybe add some Italian seasoning, which is just herbs without any salt. A little diced red or sweet onion, and tiny broccoli florets couldn't hurt, either."

I can assemble t he pasta and ingredients before we leave then just toss with dressing before we head out to the potluck. I didn't have green peppers so used peas for color. Worked great. I think you could put almost any vegetable in it but the crunch and color is important."

I made a few substitutions: 1 oven roasted and chilled spaghetti squash for the pasta, 1/2 c up dressing and 3tbsp ranch dressing mix, added carrots asking with all the veggies requested and a leftover half of an English cucumber cubed. Tasted it and it is pretty delicious. I probably could have used even less dressing, as the squash is pretty watery on its own and I hate mushy salads. Happy cooking!"

Also, it looked like my salad was sitting in a pool of dressing despite thoroughly mixing. So after a couple hours of it sitting I removed the ingredients into another bowl and got rid of the excess dressing. That seemed to help and everyone loved it . So the next time I only did half a bottle and 2 1/2 Tbsp of the seasoning and it was perfect. I had omitted the yellow pepper and added cucumbers."

I used chopped zucchini instead of green bell pepper and omitted the cayenne pepper as my crowd doesn't \"do hot\". I added some chopped red onion and diced cheddar cheese. I didn't have celery seed so I used only 1 tsp salt and added 1/2 teaspoon celery salt. I loved it and so did everyone else! Thanks Cyndie!"

My dressing is a combo of lime juice, wine vinegar, mayo, sugar and sun dried tomato dressing, salt and pepper, with a dash of Italian seasoning. OH and I added a tablespoon of finely chopped sweet pickle relish."

I use either Robusto or Zesty Italian Dressing and a little cracked pepper. It makes it super good.\nGive it a try I'm sure you will like it."
