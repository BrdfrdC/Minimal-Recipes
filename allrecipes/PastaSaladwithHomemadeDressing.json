"reviewBody": "Gotta confess that I was just after the dressing part of this. After all, I know I am not the only one who usually just looks for pasta salad recipes for ideas and to make sure I am not forgetting some cool ingredient. \nAnyway, I was never a big fan of pasta salads until a year ago when I got one as a side at Coco's Italian Restaurant in Nashville. Their pasta side salad was so exquisitely delicious that I had to figure out what was going on. It was obvious that it had NOT been marinaded in the dressing as is the usual habit, but just what kind of dressing WAS it? The waiter assured me that it was their own recipe of sun-dried tomato vinaigrette and that I could purchase some at the deli counter of the attached store. Did I neglect to mention that the attached store is replete with interesting Italian kitsch and ingredients? And that they do multiple tours of Italy every year in search of more cool stuff? Yes, you can go along, too. Needless to say, I brought home some of the dressing and then tried several commercial varieties when that ran out, since it is an 8-hour drive to Nashville. So for Thanksgiving this year we were cooking home-made everything (with help from AllRecipes.com of course!) and I went in search of a dressing recipe. This one sounded promising, despite a glaring absence of dried tomatoes, so I ran off to Eurofresh and grabbed some dried tomatoes and fresh basil leaves and minced them up. I made the dressing a day before Thanksgiving so it could blend a"

I omitted the black olives because I’m the only one who likes them. I followed another reviewer’s advice and quartered sliced pepperoni and used slices of provolone that I cut into strips. I took it to a 4th of July picnic today and I got so many compliments. Usually pasta salad tastes sour because of the Italian dressing, but not this. This homemade dressing is so good. You could add any ingredients you want to this salad and it would be delicious as long as you use this dressing recipe."

When I made the dressing, I didn't have red wine vinegar or ground mustard - two items I typically have! I used a raspberry balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine. Left out the mustard and added a package of ranch dressing. I'm not a ranch addict but so many people are. It was a hit - I even got a text a few days later requesting the recipe... I sent the original and my variation. I never look at a recipe as 'the only way to make it.' My favorite recipes are solid to start and can be varied as desired (or needed!)."

If your review is based on how it tastes right after you’ve mixed it up, you’ll be disappointed. I find pasta salad a good side kick to so many things, have made quite a few recipes, and I will say that I particularly liked the addition of the pepperoni. As with many pasta salad dressings, this was has a red wine vinaigrette, but I think it was calling out for more tang, maybe to complement that pepperoni, not sure? It was good, we liked it, but I wouldn’t say it was my favorite, and there’s a lot more prep time chopping and cubing than with many other recipes."

I substituted with blanched broccoli and raw chopped baby carrots. For the dressing, I didn't have fresh garlic so I substituted with garlic powder and used a dash of cayenne pepper and agave nectar to give a sweet tang because the vinegar was a bit overwhelming. I used Gluten-Free brown rice rotini pasta. I also love using adobo and ground white pepper. It turned out delicious."

The dressing is terrific, I agree. I only used 1/2 the dressing to lighten it up. Only problem is not eating all the leftovers tomorrow when no one is looking..."

About 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard instead of ground mustard seed. Followed the suggestion of other raters and saved a little of the dressing to moisten the pasta right before serving. It did take me one and a half CSI reruns to prepare though, a lot of chopping involved."

"reviewBody": "Lots of prep is the only bad thing about this recipe. Would love to know how BonnieS did it in 30 minutes. This salad is colorful and delicious. I could eat it everyday. I followed almost exactly. I cut my cucs and olives in half, used parsley flakes and only used about 1/2-3/4 of the red onion and chopped it because red onion is strong and I didn't want it to overpower the salad. As someone else wrote, make a double batch of the dressing. Pour half over before chilling and save the other for after as it dries up a little in the frig and you will need more. I may use a different cheese next time, something with more flavor, otherwise, this is my new dish to bring to outings."

I never added pepperoni as it overpowers the other flavors (I think), but rather, cubed ham. I also find that red wine vinegar doesn't add enough flavor to justify the weird color. A pre-made, balsamic dressing is fine. I also leave out the parsley (don't like the bitterness) and use fresh or dried basil. I like Rebecca's idea of adding crabmeat or tuna--nice and light!"

I'd bet it's great as written and I will do it that way in the wintertime, but since I had fresh basil, I used that instead of the parsley, oregano, and dried basil as another reviewer suggested. I also chopped the red onion and included it in the dressing jar to let it \"pickle\" before mixing with the salad - I don't like raw onions much. I'm sure you could use any veggies you wanted to -I used 1/2 red pepper, 1/2 green pepper, and small crown of broccoli. I didn't have provolone and didn't want to add pepperoni so I used caraway cheddar we had on hand - fantastic!!!!"

The dressing I increased all by about 50%. This was the best pasta salad I've ever eaten, by far. Hearty, rustic, super flavorful and really colorful! I served it about 4 hours after making it, it was great! Today it's even better! And here's the bonus...today I made another batch of the dressing (with chopped parsley) as a marinade for pork chops....they were awesome! So yeah, thanks for this recipe, I'm a fan!"
