They bought a brand of sardines, imported from Italy, that had fennel leaves in the sauce. Since I couldn't find a stalk of fennel in the grocery store, I crushed a few fennel seeds and included them in my sauce to preserve the original flavor that I recall. I also added a small can (8 oz) of tomato sauce. The recipe was excellent!"

"reviewBody": "So happy and surprised with this recipe. Am low on food...had old whole wheat pasta, canned sardines not much else yet wanted a healthy satisfying dinner. This fit the bill. (and it is so cheap!). The only changes I made is that the sardines I had were in water so I added a bit (few TBS) of canned diced tomatoes and a few Tbs of leftover tom sauce to make up for that. I also didn't have much parma left so I probably shaved only 2Tbs onto my serving.\nThis was fresh tasting, and delicious. I think the sardines I buy (at Trader Joes) are high quality. It didn't taste like a canned meat to be honest this was restaurant-tasty. It must be about the quality of the sardines, as others seem to have a different experience. I am happy and full of healthy food...sardines are so good for you!"

You are better off paying a bit more for bristling sardines that don't smell and taste terrible. I made this recipe in an effort to use up some of my left over low quality sardines. While it was still smelly, the flavor was pretty good. Added tomato sauce, and a lot more pepper flakes. Will make it again with better sardines and more spice next time."

First of all I did have to make a fair amount of alterations - I added tomato sauce as other reviewers had since my sardines were in oil, I had to add more olive oil and a few tablespoons of vegetable broth just to get my sardine and onion goop to resemble something like a sauce, and I only had about half the required amount of lemon juice. I also used rather more garlic and red pepper than called for. However, when I was done, the dish was bland, didn't taste particularly like sardines or tomato, and I had to add a generous sprinkling of parsley and more red pepper before I could enjoy eating it. Perhaps this is a case of my slap-dash cooking methods getting the best of me (measuring? who measures?) but I felt that even had I followed it to a T this recipe probably would not have been worthy of the 5 star rating it currently totes."

Also, when the sardines are in the pan, you can either stir them a lot as they heat and they can turn into a mushier sauce, or just gently turn them for more large chunks of fish in your dish. Either way- delicious! I didn't have any onion, but I added half a cup of chopped fresh parsley and the parmesan straight into the pan when the flavors \"absorb.\" SO tasty!!"

We used sardines in cayenne olive oil - next time I would use the tomato sauce ones. \n\nMy bf loved it. I just can't get past the potent sardine smell. But I ate it - and the flavor was not bad. I added some garlic salt and lots of red pepper flakes."

"reviewBody": "If you're looking for an easy,cheap, but unusual meal, this is it!(...if you like sardines) I altered the recipe to use what I had on hand. Instead of the sardines in tomato sauce, I added sardines in olive oil ,one small tomato, 2 t of tomato sauce, and a splash of red wine.I cooked less pasta to serve two, so it was probably a lot more \"sardiney\" than the original recipe. I'll definately make it again!"
