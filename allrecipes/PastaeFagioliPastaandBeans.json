"reviewBody": "It was just ok. I like adding the beans to the veggie simmer and letting them pick up flavor from the veggies (and the spices and herbs) as they break down during the simmer. I use the Pressure Cooker to hurry this up quite a bit. I find that 10 minutes of High Pressure and then 20 more minutes of natural release, can give you a great stew viscosity, with many of the beans naturally mashed into the stew! This step will save you 2 hours of slow simmering on the stovetop. I wait to add the pasta, and I pre-boil the pasta in chicken stock and the brine from the can of beans (BTW, Goya's black beans also work great in this recipe), and then I add the pasta to the veggie and bean stew to finish cooking in the stew. Thanks for sharing this version of this ultra popular recipe with us! Happy New Year!"

I used my food processor to chop all the veggies which was a HUGE timesaver plus it gave it something other than a \"stew\" look. Kind of classy I thought. Other than that, I don't have much different than the other commitments. Very nutritious and delicious. Will make again."

The only changes I made was using Vegetable broth because my daughter is Vegetarian, and I used small shell pasta. Everything else was exactly as written. This soup is amazing. So easy to make and so full of flavor. If you don't like your foods too spicy, cut down on the red pepper, It was perfect for us as is. We liked the spice. I am going to make double batches of this next time, so I can freeze some. If you do freeze, don't add the pasta. Add that after you thaw and reheat. \nFinal rating: Method 4 stars, Flavor 5+ stars"

Our 1, 3, and 7-year-olds finished their servings and asked for more. This recipe is a keeper!"

It all amounted to a soup that will certainly grace our dinner table for many Fall and Winter seasons to come. Served with a homemade French Baguette made the meal savory and satisfying. We also cook the pasta separately, adding some to the bowl and ladling the soup over it to keep the pasta from absorbing too much liquid and retaining its al dente texture."

Also, subbed fresh parsley for the dried because I have a bunch from my garden and used ditallini pasta as I didn't have spinach pasta. Very good and I'll make it again!"

Many different pastas are appropriate; I used elbows or mini farfalle that I had in the pantry. Also substituted a 14.5 oz. can of petite diced tomatoes for the fresh tomatoes; quicker, easier, and again, keep them in your pantry for use anytime. This is a great winter time meal to make on a snow day for lunch or dinner."

My family loved it, just the right amount of spice, even for my 14 month old granddaughter!"

It was the best pasta fagioli soup we ever had and we both come from Italian American backgrounds.\nI doubled the recipe with the exception of the onion and made plastic containers filled with it and froze it. It freezes well with Ditalini (didnt use spinach pasta and used 3 stalks of celery) in it too, this way we just \"grab and go\" and take a container to work for lunch! Made 8 plastic containers for the freezer.\nThank you Star Pooley for a great recipe!"
