I followed the suggestions of a few other reviewers - swapped out the garbanzo beans for Great Northern, reduced the molasses and the brown sugar - to accommodate my family's tastes. Kept all the seasonings. I drained all the beans except for two cans, which came in flavored sauces. Make it with the beans you like! This wasn't too soupy as some baked bean dishes are. No running all over the plate! Absolutely delicious, and the various bean textures and colors make the dish attractive and interesting. It's nice to have a good baked bean recipe that doesn't require soaking beans."

Because so many different types of beans are used, some are mushy and some are hard (the garbanzo and kidney beans). My husband even asked if it was finished cooking after the hour and 15 minutes I put it in for. Also, I don't think there is a super deep flavor. I would recommend putting this in a crock pot for several hours instead of baking for an hour."

It tasted amazing with the perfect blend of sweet and tangy. I took it to a Labor Day party and everyone though they were great! Definitely a keeper. I did follow another persons suggestion and took the foil off and kept in oven for another 15 mins or so to thicken it up and make sure all the beans were cooked. I suggest that as it helped get the consistency just right."

Make this! You won’t regret it. I’ve been making it for years. I cook the bacon and onions in a Dutch oven, then mix all the ingredients in and pop it in the oven - less dishes! Tonight I threw in some leftover shredded rib meat and served with cornbread. Yum!"

Found this one and it was close enough to the original (might have been the same one).\nI use more bacon (half pound), a dash of cayenne and a quarter cup of dark rum. This one is a good recipe on its own or start before adding your own special ingredients. I cook it in a cast iron chicken fryer (a skillet with higher sides) and server it right from the skillet."

"reviewBody": "I didn't have some of the varieties of beans listed, so I improvised with what I had -- 2 cans kidney beans, 2 cans great northern, 1 can black beans. The rest of the recipe I followed exactly. I thought there was too much molasses as it was the most prominent flavor I noticed when tasting the beans. I think if I were to make this again, I would cut back on the molasses since the recipe also calls for brown sugar, which already contains molasses. I was able to salvage this recipe by adding some onion powder, garlic powder, a little bit of salt, and a bit more Worcestershire. This made a 9 x 13 size casserole dish, which is more than enough for 2 of us for dinner, so I'm hoping that the leftovers will taste better for lunch tomorrow."

"reviewBody": "These beans were so great we had them for breakfast :o) The trick to using different types of beans (I used dried black and pinto beans) is that the ENTIRE RECIPE is not done until the bean needing the longest-cooking time is tender. And use a crock pot. Period. I cooked these for 24-30 hours (longer time because they were dried to start) and they came out fabulous! Other changes for healthier (read: less sugar) and tangier/more savory beans: substitute stevia in the raw (20 packets) for the white sugar, chop a huge Costco yellow onion vs 1 cup, 3 heaping tsp. Grandma's molasses, 6 oz tomato paste, 3/4 c. tomato sauce, 3 heaping Tbsp. minced garlic vs 1 clove. *The mustard makes this dish* - use Dijon (with white wine) - 4 heaping Tbsp. to start and then to taste. Omit white sugar and brown sugar, as well as the ketchup. Kept the Worcester sauce and black pepper the same. Meat is optional - I didn't use bacon or turkey because I didn't' have any in the fridge at the time - they were still super good and I'll DEFINITELY be making them again!"

I trimmed the fat off of a package of low sodium bacon and sautéed it with onion and garlic, then added approx 3 c diced low sodium ham. For the sauce, I started in a 2 cup measure so I could adjust accordingly: 3 T each ketchup, molasses and BBQ sauce. 2 T maple syrup, yellow mustard, 1 T Worcester, 1 tsp each Smokey Paprika (excellent) and cayenne. (No brown sugar needed.) I cooked it on the stove top and kept adding sauce and lost track of the proportions. It tasted soo good, even before baking in the oven. Due to time I had to finish in the oven, 275*, 2 hrs, but hope to cook this in the crock pot next time. Thank you for a great motivation!"
