"reviewBody": "Fantastic recipe. I omitted the nutmeg as I used the Land O Lakes apple pie crust recipe which has that in it. Used 2T cornstarch instead of the flour and added 1 t. vanilla. Put in a deep dish pie pan. I always put a handful of sugar on the bottom crust before adding the filling because my mom always did that. It took 55 minutes total to bake. My husband took it to work this morning and everyone raved about it. He told me \"Write that recipe down\". The secret to a great pie crust is to not overwork it. I use real butter cold and grate it into the dry mix, use a fork to incorporate, then add the cold water. This always turns out flaky and light. It definitely beats store bought!"

I'm assuming the fresh peaches cooked out more juice than canned and I don't want to add an off taste by increasing the flour. As for the lemon juice, necessary, but 2 tablespoons adds too much tang. Next time I'm going to cut it in half and see how it tastes. Definitely going to do this again!"

These peaches are juicy. I cooked as directed 10 mins @450 then 35 @350. The pie was not baking correctly. I increased the heat to 375 for 25 mins. If your peaches are thickening cook it at a higher temperature. You want those beautiful bubbles from the peaches.. The pie thickened beautifully with more heat. I added sugar to the egg wash for the top crust."

I made my own 2 crust recipe but since I didn’t have the amount of peaches the recipe called for (I just used an 8” pie pan), I cut the ingredients in half. I didn’t use the egg but instead baked it on my quarry tiles I keep in my oven. It was DELISH and got RAVE REVIEWS from the recipients!!! Thank you for this recipe!!!! You made me look GOOD!!!"

There's something to be said about a peach pie recipe when it lets the fresh flavor of late summer peaches really shine through; and this recipe nailed it. It was delicious, and so 'peachy'. I did lessen the lemon juice to 1 tbsp, and used 3/4 cup sugar as my peaches were very ripe. Very nice recipe, thank you for sharing it."

I could have left it in a bit longer, and now that I read the comments I will lessen the lemon and nutmeg next time. Also I did not brush the bottom crust with egg, I just poked it with a fork a few times, it baked beautifully. I will definitely be making again, just with a few tweaks!"

Spouse really liked the nutmeg but I thought it overpowered the peaches. Now that I know what the end result is by following the recipe AS WRITTEN*, i think I might try using 1/8 rather than 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Another note I’m filing in my brain is to use hard peaches as ripe ones give out too much juice despite draining. I was pleased with this recipe."

Also added a cup of fresh blueberries to the peaches 'cause I was a half cup short of peaches. Yummy combo!"

After squeezing fresh lemon juice over the sliced peaches, I zested some of the peel. This added a welcomed tartness. Also added 1/2 teaspoon almond extract. Made my own crust too. This recipe is good as is."

I cooked it anyway. It was very soupy. Next time, I will use at least 3/4 cup flour, to make sure my peach filling is not watery. The pie slices wouldn't hold shape. Taste was a bit too sweet for me. Maybe use less sugar, or combine brown sugar and white sugar might yield a better pie, for me. But, Thank you!"

They all work with this recipe."

I used fresh peaches that were not over ripe and they held up perfectly. Also, I did bake it about 10 minutes longer than suggested. It was delicious!"
