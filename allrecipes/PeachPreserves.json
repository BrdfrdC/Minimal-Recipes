I used 12 gorgeous, Georgia cling peaches, (purchased from The Peach Truck Tour, which came to Michigan, where I picked them up) that were just ripe, and came out to exactly 6 cups and one teaspoon (for a sample taste!üòã) of peaches, to work with. I did cut the sugar down to roughly half of what the recipe called for, so about 2 to 2-1/4 cups, as my family prefers a slightly tangier-sweet flavor, and after reading some reviews, I thought it might be just a bit too sweet with 4-1/2 cups sugar added. I also had a box of pectin that was only 1.75 ounces, but it did fine. I LOVE the flavor and consistency of these preserves! SOME of the 8 jars I made, will be gifted. (Do I hafta share!?üòÅ)"

In the 2nd and 3rd batches, I didn't measure the peaches out and just poured the sugar into the peaches and it made 5 pints each time. In total I made 3 batches and I cooked the first batch the longest and they set. The 2nd and 3rd batch were not cooked as long and were not as set. Those haven't been opened yet, but my mother opened her jar and said it was good. I used South Carolina ripe peaches and peeled by hand because I had to cut out some bad places. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it does need to cook longer to make it thicker. This was my first time at making peach preserves. Also, the pectin only comes as 1.75 oz and I also used a 2nd package to add 1 tablespoon extra to each batch. However, my sister said one box would have been sufficient."

I've been canning for a few years but still consider myself a novice so to find a simple recipe that works every year is wonderful. \n\nI use fresh lemon juice (squeezed through a sieve) instead of pectin to keep the peaches from turning brown as I'm dicing them, I think it gives it a brighter color. \n\nI start with 2 cups of sugar and then gradually add it... we don't like it overly sweet. From about 15 large sized peaches I get 9 half pint jars. Great gifts, everyone truly loves it. \n\n2020 was the third year using this recipe."

This was even after doing 30 peaches. In the end it made 2 cups of liquid so I cut the rest of the ingredients to a little less than half. The end result was 4 eight oz. jelly jars, which is really all I needed anyway! So 5 stars on the flavor, but 1 star on the ratio equals 3 stars and yes I will make it again!"

I've just finished batch 1 of 4. This is the best preserves ever. The color is beautiful from yellow peaches and you can't see the skin at all. I would recommend:\n1. For multiple batches, just freeze all your peaches after cutting up and putting fruit fresh on them.\n2. Make sure you have all equipment ready and organized.\n3. DO NOT use as much sugar as the recipe calls for - I used 2 1/2 cups of sugar as many suggested.\n\nI'm making these for Christmas presents. Thank you so much for this fabulous recipe. It takes a lot of work out of an otherwise much more laborious task."

We made this recipe as a family 2 years ago, and made 65 jars of this peach preserve. It is excellent! We gave it away to teachers, coaches, friends and family members for Christmas (and kept some for ourselves- which we are still eating, but it's almost gone), and we still get compliments. Definitely recommend, and will be making it again from our peach harvest."

I left the skin on the peaches and they really do disappear. I used twelve cups of finely diced peaches. The product looks lovely and set nicely. It thickened well but is not as thick as jam, more like homemade cranberry sauce. The peaches have stayed evenly distributed throughout the product. It made 13 cups of preserves. This turned out very well. It is delicious! It is great on toast and would be excellent with pork or turkey as well. Looks just like in the photo."

I used about 5 cups of fresh peaches and substituted 2 cups of Splenda sugar blend for the sugar. It reduced a lot and ended up making a little over two pints, which is fine because we aren't big jam eaters. The 20 minute boil seemed to be the key in getting it to set. By the time the sugar blend and the pectin went in, it was nice and gooey. And it tasted just like peach cobbler filling! The next day, it was solid like real jam. Success!! I will definitely try this one again, maybe adding some spices. Thanks!"

For people who think it's too sweet what I found was initially tasting from the pot it just seemed like sugar no peach flavour but after I jarred it and it had mellowed for a week or two and I opened a jar the sweetness of it had mellowed and the peach flavour had bloomed and it was just lovely so just keep that in mind if you decide to follow the advice of reviewers saying to taste your jam and add sugar to your taste as its cooking. Also and someone else may have already said this but sugar quantities affect set and safety in the canning process so if you're going to adjust your sugar make sure you understand the canning process so that you won't end up unintentionally cooking up a batch of botulism."

But I made some modifications. 1) Added 1 large lemon, in order to guarantee mixture will be acidic and prevent botulism. 2) Only used 3 cups - 3.5 cups of sugar as the recipe is too sweet. 3) Pureed half of the peaches, not 1/4 of them. 4) 2 oz of powdered pectin was IMPOSSIBLE to find in NYC. So I used 1/4 cup of \"apple pectin tablets\", crushed into a powder. I found this in a vitamin store. 5) Once the peaches are boiling, you can add the lemon, then sugar, then pectin directly into the pot and cook until 1 min after boiling. 6) Recipe wasn't clear on this but you should be stirring non-stop the mixture. You must achieve boiling bubbles while stirring. Also, always add the hot mixture, to heated empty jars or they will crack."

"reviewBody": "I'm glad I read the reviews prior to making this recipe. While I love sweet things, I cannot imagine the flavor of this if I would have used 4.5 cups of sugar. Maybe it's because my peaches were Palisade peaches and they were nice and ripe and already sweet. I used 2.5 cups of sugar to the 6 cups of peach liquid. I cut up 24 cups total of peaches, cooked them down with the juice of two small lemons (about 3 ounces), then measured out the 6 cups of peach liquid prior to adding sugar. I got 3 batches of preserves out of this, with the last batch producing 7.5 cups of peach liquid, and then I adjusted the rest of the ingredients to account for the additional liquid. Because I'm in Colorado and at an elevation of almost 4800 feet above sea level, I did cook the preserves for two minutes after adding the pectin, rather than one minute, to account for the higher altitude. I also added one finely chopped, seeded habanero pepper to the last batch at the same time I added the sugar. I got a total of 24 half-pint jars from my peaches. The taste is very good and not too sweet, although my husband thinks it's too sweet. The batch with the habanero came out perfectly. You can taste the heat but it's not too hot."

"reviewBody": "Very simple, and tasty. If you end up with more, or less peaches than 6 cups, the ratio is:\n1 cup cooked peaches: 3/4 sugar: 1 tablespoon pectin.\n\nWe used mostly under-ripe, hard peaches as instructed in the tips (about 2/3 of all of the peaches were still hard) and it turned out beautifully. Sweet, with just a touch of tart. Set, it reached a thick consistency halfway between cold honey and firm, cuttable jello.\nThe only changes we made were:\n 1) blending the peach chunks since we prefer smooth (I am not sure where some people in the comments are getting \"leave the skin on,\" but we peeled them first)\n2) adding Fruit Fresh Produce Protector (1 tsp per cup of cooked peaches, don't include sugar in that measurement, added at the same time as the pectin) It helps prevent the peach mixture from going brown and the extra acid helps the jam set.\nTips:\n-The cooking times are from the onset of a boil (meaning the bubbles don't stop or go away when you stir). Don't start the timer at the first sight of a bubble or things will be underdone and not set. This is especially important if you're making a double batch.\n-Stir this a lot to prevent the bottom scorching, but stop and do not stir after the sugar+peaches begins to boil.\n-Do not increase the temperature to reduce the cook time. It's tempting with large, slow to heat, batches, but don't. You'll get burnt, caramel-y peach jam.\n-If you're the specific type, you need to cook the peaches and sugar together to 220 degrees F.

"reviewBody": "I've made this twice now - both times with great results. Like others, I add some cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves, and I cut down a bit on the sugar. Love not having to peel peaches. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think the amount of peaches should be more precise. Peaches come in lots of sizes, so \"12\" is a bit vague. Today I used 15 because I wasn't sure mine were large enough. Also, step 2 has us pour cooked peaches from their pan into a bowl, then put 6 cups back into the pan and add sugar, etc., but there's no mention of what to do with the remaining peaches from which you took the 6 cups. As it happened for me, I only had about 7 cups of cooked fruit, so I didn't worry about separating 6 cups. All these little discrepancies aside, though, I LOVE the taste, look, and consistency of these preserves and will no doubt make them again."

"reviewBody": "This recipe fills approximately 24-26 4oz Ball jam jars. Used this recipe to make 4oz jam jars as the guest favor at my wedding. Remove RIPE peach skin with the following process: Make a small X at the base of the peach with a paring knife. Dip in boiling water for about 30 seconds to a minute. Dunk hot peaches into a bowl of ice water. Slip off the skins, but be careful now, the naked peaches are slippery. Once all measured peaches are back in the pot along with the sugar, the chunks need to be smashed up according to the consistency of jam you prefer. This is easily done with a potato masher. \nI put a round white sticker on top of the jar lid after sterilizing the jars in a water bath (used my All American Canner, a marvelous canning accessory!) and wrote each guests' name on it. That doubled my guest favor as a place marker for the seating arrangement. My wedding guests loved the gift, got fantastic reviews. One guest used it as an ice cream topping. Others just spread it on toast. \nI made several batches and they varied in consistency, not sure if this was due to not keeping the jam in the hot pot long enough to thicken more or if the ripeness of the peaches (or rather, lack of) influenced the overall result. The only \"complaint\" I got was that (and mostly only the men said this), \"It's too sweet.\" Otherwise, very good, simple recipe, will use again and again."

"reviewBody": "This is my first time making any sort of fruit spread, but certainly not my first time cooking. Thank goodness for that--my preserves were turning into nothing like the recipe or the video. They weren't very juicy, and even on low heat, they were trying to burn and caramelize at the bottom before they became liquid. I ended up with a mushy mess (like the consistency of slop) instead of a liquid. And it was a darker brown, which indicated caramelization. 12 peaches yielded 4 1/2 cups of \"liquid\" peach. 2 cups sugar sweetened it up plenty, and the final yield was 5 1/2-8 ounce jars. Much less than expected, but I'll forgive the recipe because it tasted ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. Just be mindful of your peaches as you cook--not all peaches will cook up exactly the same, and no two batches will be alike. Happy canning! EDIT: I made this same recipe and tried to do the exact same thing again. WAY too sweet, because the peaches actually were a bit overripe. How to save preserves that are too sweet? Lemon juice!"
