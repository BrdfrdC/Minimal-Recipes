Two, Added 1t Almond extract, 1t Vanilla extract, 1/2 t Cinnamon In the doubled recipe for a 9x 13 pan. Use your own judgement on how much brown sugar you want on the top as you add it to the pan. I used a little less. I also used a little less white sugar in the cake. I read you can use brown sugar here if you prefer. I did not, I was afraid it would be too much of a brown sugar taste. The peaches, I cut into thick slices. Main advice (as others have noted) LINE THE PAN WITH PARCHMENT PAPER. My family loved the cake, even those that don’t like peach cake. It’s full of moist flavors. The added extracts really make a difference."

I was out of milk and butter so I used buttermilk and oil which I had on hand. I added almond favoring to the peaches and vanilla to the batter. Because of the buttermilk, I added a touch of baking soda as well. Not sure how it will work out. If it doesn't work it will be because I altered it too much but what can you do? Ok- it is out of the oven and cooled. Absolutely delicious. The cake is tender and moist. Tons of fruit. Yummy."

My main problem was that in the round pan, by 25 minutes at 375 the outside of the cake was burning, while underneath it was totally raw. I lowered the temperate to 350 and cooked in awhile longer, which worked (although the outside layer was too overdone) but if I try it again I'm definitely cooking it at 350 instead. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp almond extract as others suggested. It tasted good, but was definitely a heavier coffee cake type cake."

The only thing preventing five stars was having the mixture or sugar and butter over the cake tin created a glue that the peaches stayed stuck to when I turned the cake upside down! Quickly fixed but meant presentation was a bit iffy....... Definitely make again!"

I added cinnamon and vanilla to the batter as other reviewers suggested and, surprise, all my eggs had been hard boiled to make easter eggs with! LOL So I used peach flavored apple sauce, 1/4 cup. The cake came out nicely risen and browned and I turned it out onto a platter - when it came down to dessert, it had kind of \"settled\" and was more like a pound cake with peaches. It actually tasted lovely, just not the right texture. I don't think that the egg would have made a difference. Try it this way if you like a denser texture."

UPDATE: I found that it needed less baking time for me @ 30 mins. plus I think a little more milk. It was a tiny bit dry but that couldve been from baking too long. A true favorite! Even my mother loved it!"

I also used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white in place of the 1/2 cup white called for. My peaches were pretty juicy, so once the cake was browned, I reduced the heat to about 250 and let it cook until the liquid had reduced. This came out delicious! I served it with vanilla ice cream - this is a great way to use up peaches."

"reviewBody": "Loved this cake! Two friends who claim to not like peaches both tried it and said it was delicious! It is best eaten warm, so I put one piece in the microwave for about 25 seconds and it was good to go. I spiced my batter up with vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg, and added just a light sprinkle of ground ginger over the peaches before I added the batter. I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan and the batter was very thick. I thought I had messed something up, as I actually had to spoon and spread the batter over the peaches and throughout the pan, but it turned out fine. Its taste and texture reminds me of eating Peach Cobbler. Awesome! Thanks Judy!"

"reviewBody": "This is my favorite dessert recipe. Since finding it last week I have made it 3x's. First with fresh peaches, second with fresh peaches and pineapple and the last time w/2 peaches, 3 pears and 1 pineapple slice (using up ripe fruit). I always cook it longer (23 year old oven) so after 40 minutes I put a foil tent over it to prevent top from over browning and cook until it passes the toothpick test (about 15-20 min's. longer). I let it set ten minutes before I flip it and it comes out perfect. Also, it absorbs some of the extra juices when it sits. My husband eats a slice everyday and is the reason I bake it so often. Thank you Judy Wilson."

Since I did not have nutmeg I substituted it with 1/4ts of cinnamon. I poured most of the liquid from the peaches in the bottom of the pan. To the batter I included 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract, and a tablespoon of the peach juice. My oven cooks quickly, so it was done in 30minutes. It came out just wonderfully. My husband and I loved this cake."

Where there was a thick peach the cake in that one spot was a little under done."

After I mixed the melted butter &amp; brwn sgr mxtr, I added 1 1/2 tsp of granadine sauce by dropping a little in each area where the peachs would be (instead of marachino cherries). I added 1 tsp vanilla extract to egg/sugar mixture. I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and used fat free milk. the wheat cake had a neat texture and yummy taste.
