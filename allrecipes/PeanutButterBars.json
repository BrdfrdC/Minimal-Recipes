"reviewBody": "I have made these for years and they are known in my circles as “Tracey’s Bars”, as in: “have Tracey bring her peanut butter bars.” Made as is, they are divine. However, over the years I have tweaked the recipe to take them next level. I add approximately 1.5 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 tsp salt, and I reduce the powdered sugar to between 1.5 and 1 3/4 cup powdered sugar. All of these measurements are approximate as I don’t measure anything anymore. I just toss it in. Also, I use only crunchy Jif peanut butter. If you haven’t made these before, do yourself a favor and make them."

"reviewBody": "I have made these bars for decades, calling them Stompers Delights, after a recipe in Vogue. I don't use a mixer, but get in there with my hands - much easier. I smooth the peanut butter/graham cracker/10X sugar mixture very carefully, particularly along the edges and in the corners, to make it absolutely even, often using a small fondant rolling pin. After pouring on the chocolate, let the whole thing cool at room temperature - much easier to cut - or keep checking the chocolate if you do use the fridge. It can be very difficult to cut when completely hardened. Sometimes I drizzle melted peanut butter chips across the top for decoration before cutting. And sometimes I use chunky peanut butter instead of smooth, for added texture."

"reviewBody": "These are super easy to make &amp; best eaten out of the freezer, just like Reese's. To make cutting them easier, score the chocolate layer with a thin, sharp paring knife cleaned carefully with a paper towel between cuts. I do this with Nanaimo bars, too. The best timing to score the chocolate is about 1h at room temp, or 15m in the fridge, after assembly. The chocolate has set up slightly but is still easy to cut then &amp; will retain the cuts so when you slice the bars fully later (best is after overnight in the fridge), the chocolate won't crack too much, if at all."

"reviewBody": "I got the recipe for these from my 1st grade teacher from 1980 after I was an adult with my own kids. • If your peanut butter base is too soft, then add more Graham crackers and powdered sugar until it’s VERY stiff. It SHOULD be tough to knead! • Use parchment paper on the bottom of the pan. • For the chocolate topping, melt some butter in a non stick skillet on med-low heat and add the chocolate chips to it until melted. DON’T overcook the chocolate chips! Pour it onto the base AS SOON AS the chips are melted and spread evenly. They are the best home made Reese’s Peanut Butter cups ever! 👍"

I made that mistake twice won't do it again. They don't firm up in that \"bars\" shape as well as just using the 2 sticks of butter. But, I highly recommend this recipe to everyone!"

I hate working with sticky peanut butter, melting butter, melting chocolate, but this recipe is amazing and tastes perfect as written. It is surprisingly good! I’ve tried it with a 1/2 stick less of butter and that’s fine too. I would suggest lining the pan with parchment paper, which I didn’t do the first time and it was rough. I have to let people know I’ve made it so I don’t eat it all myself. Amazing! Just for reference, 4 Tablespoons is a quarter cup ??"

The next time, I added about an extra 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to the peanut butter mix, and that solved the problem. Others may have done this, but I didn't have time to read all 2256 reviews. I also cut through the chocolate topping before they were set, scoring them, and had no problems with the topping chipping off. I put the bottom layer in the fridge for about 20 minutes while I was cooking up the topping, and it worked really well. Personally, I could do without the chocolate, because the bottom layer is so incredibly good. \n\nJust as an aside, if you don't have a food processor and just a blender, I had no trouble getting the graham crumbs. First I broke them into smaller pieces, then dropped them one by one into the spinning blades until I had about a cup of crumbs. Then they started to not blend well. I put them in a clean bowl and sifted through with my fingers to pick out pieces. I did another batch, then tossed them back in the blender and kept hitting my blender to make the crumbs fall back into the blade. I had no pieces afterwards."

Like corn meal consistency. Otherwise it doesn't stay together easy and isn't as smooth. \n\nI also one and halfed the peanut butter for the base layer and would probably reduce the amount of powdered sugar if I made these again. \n\nYou could also dress these up by adding heath topping or reeses pieces. Delicious!"

However, I made one small change the last two times I made it, and it worked out nicely, so I thought I'd share. \n\nI've been trying to add flax seed and other fibers to my diet, so I replaced 1/2 cup of crushed graham crackers with 1/2 cup of ground flax seed (ground flax seed tastes like unsweetened graham crackers to me). I mixed the hot melted butter and graham/flax mixture and let it sit for about 20 minutes, until the butter was cool, to let it soak into and soften the flax seed and graham crackers before adding the rest of the ingredients, but that's it. I can't even tell! So if you're wanting to add a little more fiber to an otherwise deliciously indulgent recipe, I recommend trying some ground flax seed. The ones in the photo have been kept refrigerated because it's very hot here right now, but it tastes and feels just like the original recipe. As someone with sensory issues, I wouldn't eat it if it weren't."

I just added more sugar to make a dough that looked similar to the video. Many other reviewers said theirs was too thin as well, so there has to be a mistake somewhere.

I am a professional baker, and this is my Pro tip: if you use margarine, don’t use the stuff from the tub, use the hard stuff that comes wrapped like butter. The higher fat content is what will make it set properly. \nI lined my 9x13 with parchment paper so the bars would easily lift out of the pan. I also used plastic wrap over the peanut butter layer to press it down and smooth out. The plastic then peels right off and gives a nice even surface for coating with the chocolate layer. \nI thought they were great, my husband said they resembled fudge too much for his liking. \nThese took about 10 minutes to make, I chilled them about 30 minutes, cut, and then chilled about an hour longer. \nI will definitely make them again, and will try reducing the butter a little bit and upping the peanut butter in the first layer. A sprinkle of coarse salt on top would be a nice addition too!"
