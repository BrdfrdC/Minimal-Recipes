"reviewBody": "I think this recipe is worth trying because when you first take out the cookies from the oven and put the peanut butter cups on them it looks so good. One thing is making sure you add everything because it does taste a little dry for me but that may be because I forgot to add the brown sugar or something like that. Overall this is one of the best cookies for a beginner cook to try. I love these cookies almost as much as my Grandma's cookies."

I lined the mini cupcake pan with mini cupcake paper liners, which made for super easy removal from pan and cleanup. Also folded in 1/2 C. mini M7M's to dough, rolling the balls in turbinado sugar before baking. My oven temperature is quite accurate, and I baked for 9 minutes for complete bake. Used the Mini Reese cups, turning them bottom side up, which looked prettier."

I don't have a mini muffin pan, but after reading some reviews that said they turn out just fine, I gave it a go. Turns out, the dough is stiff enough that the cookies come out tall enough to push the peanut butter cups into them. I baked them for 8 minutes, but thought maybe I should have baked them an extra minute because the interior on some looked a little undercooked (I wonder if this is because I wasn't using the mini muffin tin?). However, I was worried about not being able to fit the cups into the cookies if I did that, so I didn't try it."

He's a tough critic of my cooking, and he doesn't sugar coat anything. He raved about these cookies, enough that it prompted me to make an account here just so I could save the recipe!!"

"reviewBody": "These were delicious and very easy to make. I used gluten free flour and smart balance for the butter due to allergies and turned out awesome. I would highly recommend placing the unwrapped PB cups in the freezer as you make the dough and bake cookies as that made it so much easier to insert after taking out of oven (i was one frozen cup off in counting and placing the non-frozen cup was not as successful-it didn‚Äôt want to push in and melted very quickly. Used Trader Joe dark choc cups...SOOOOOO GOOD!! This recipe is a keeper!!"

I don't always put the candy but when I do I change it up each time by using Rolo's or Dark Chocolate chips or even miniature mixed candies. My daughter loves to use this recipe to make Secret Center Cookies for the holidays too. Just hide the miniatures in the center, bake, and drizzle with melted chocolate. Perfect for parties or gifts! Thanks for this recipe!"
