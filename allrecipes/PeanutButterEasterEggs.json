"reviewBody": "I used softened butter instead of shortening, added more crispy rice cereal (maybe another cup), and used about 2.5 cups of confectioner's sugar. The result was that they were definitely sweet enough, crunchier/less sticky, and not quite so rich -- delicious! The second time I made it, I pressed the dough into a 9\" square cake pan and spread the melted chocolate over the top. Cutting in 1.5\" x 3\" sticks yielded 18 servings. They were just the right size, and my crew gobbled them up -- of course, my \"disassembler daughter\" ate the chocolate off the top first, then went after the PB/crisp bottom. (-: It's fun to watch her consume a submarine sandwich by disassembly: from top to bread bottom, though it's a bit messy; we did stop her from eating PB&amp;J sandwiches that way when she was 3! :-) Great recipe, thanks!"

Note: candy melt is very sweet so you will want to cut the amount of any other sugars you use or they will be too sweet."

The only thing.... they were SUPER rich! (not a bad thing, though!) the next time I make them, I will make smaller eggs as the richness makes it impossible for me to eat an entire egg. :-)"

I did not add the shortening to the chocolate so it was a little thicker and harder to dip the eggs in but that's ok with me, they were still very yummy and the kids ate them up. I am definitely going to make these again for Easter."
