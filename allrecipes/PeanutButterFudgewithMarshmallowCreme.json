I turn the burner down to the lowest temperature possible. I then add Peanut Butter and Marshmallow. Stir till it's all blended then turn off stove and pour into dish. If you turn it off right away it cools down too fast and it breaks while cutting it. I use a glass dish instead of metal. I spray the whole inside with cooking spray. The sliced pieces are prettier &amp; fudge cools more evenly. After pouring in dish. I put plastic wrap over it set it in refrigerator till it's cold. Take out &amp; let it warm to room temp. Turn over onto cutting board then give it a good thump and it pops right out. Gently turn over, cut and store in cool place. I like my fudge firm yet soft like fudge is suppose to be. My dad has no teeth and he has no problem eatting it because it breaks off easily &amp; melts in your mouth. Enjoy."

When I read ingredients I thought that maybe there might just be a little too much sugar so I only put 3 1/3 c of sugar and then I added a little coffee cream, about 3 tbsp. Boiled it for 10 minutes but kept a close eye on it and tested it in cold water to see if it was forming a soft ball. Did not find it grainy, it was smooth and I also drizzled some 85% cocoa lindt chocolate on top. Sprayed a glass baking pan with cooking spray and was able to cut fudge out of it with ease. Thank you Teresa for the recipe and my famiy thanks you as well. Totally delicious!!!"

I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and I added the marshmallow along with the sugar, butter and milk to cook together. I think it makes the fudge smoother. Also, I always cook to the soft ball stage when making fudge like my Nana taught me. Time and candy thermometers aren't as reliable. Delicious flavor!!! I will make it again!"

When I served the fudge for dessert one day everyone had 5 servings, Woah! Everyone said that it tastes exactly like the inside of a Reeses peanut butter cup. Anyway, thanks so much."

"reviewBody": "Definitely edible--a little too sweet. I followed the directions &amp; cooked it for about 7 1/2 minutes. It was not as \"smooth\" as I expected and was a little sugary &amp; almost grainy. I did use 1/2 c. organic PB &amp; 1/2 c. skippy PB. I think it would have been fine with less sugar &amp; maybe even less butter. My kids really like it, though. I am used to making regular chocolate fudge with sweetened condensed milk &amp; semi-sweet dark chocolate chips (the micro-wave kind)--like the eagle brand recipe."
