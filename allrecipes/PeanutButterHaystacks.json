"reviewBody": "I didn't want to give a lower star rating and lower the overall rating because I think it's a good start but I had some issues. My haystacks only lost their stickiness and set up when they are cold (right out of the fridge). At room temperature they were sticky and fell apart so instead of using butterscotch chips next time I am going to experiment with making it with a sugar syrup cooked to soft-crack or hard-crack stage and a vanilla or butterscotch extract. \n\nI didn't have salted peanuts so I used chunky peanut butter and added a light sprinkling of coarse salt over assembled stacks and I loved them but my husband needed a little chocolate so I melted a few Reese's pb cups and drizzled that on half of the batch. \n\nAlso, having experience with making a chocolate version of these for decades I know that too much peanut butter mixture could make loose stacks or waste a lot if it drips off as it sets so instead of dumping all of my noodles into my peanut butter mix I put some noodles in a pie plate and spooned some pb mixture over them and tossed and assembled them on Silpat mats in small batches. Also, some of my noodles were quite long so I had to break them in order to make bite sized stacks.\n\nLast note on versatility of this mix, I ended up only using 1/2 of the PB mixture for haystacks so I used the rest as a sort of PB Ganache over a peanut butter pie and it was delish (though if I do it again I'll cut down on the sugar in my regular PB Pie recipe b/c it kicked up t"

"reviewBody": "Made this as is and it's great. I did add a few more peanuts. I have a similar recipe and this one is good too. Great for those of us who like butterscotch. My kitchen was warm so I stuck the wax paper lined sheet with them on it, in the fridge for a while to harden. In the winter room temp would probably be fine."

So yummy!!! \n\nTip: I was such a novice and bought the wrong kind of chow mein. I bought the uncooked kind. You need to by the already cooked crispy kind that are brown in color."

"reviewBody": "I've made these in the past, but that recipe was nowhere to be found in my archive so I looked to All Recipes for a replacement one. While these were easy and very tasty, they did not \"set up\" well and need to be refrigerated after about a half hour on the serving table or they get wet and loose, which was not the case with ones I've made in the past. I did not alter the recipe; in fact, purchased non-reduced fat peanut butter just for this (we usually use reduced fat kind). I was disappointed as I made them to give as gifts for my co-workers didn't like having to ask them to put their gifts in the fridge until they left for the day... If any one has a solution as to what I may have done wrong or how to correct this, I'd love to know! Thanks!"

They didn't set up as well as I was hoping they would though-even after an hour in the freezer, they were still sticky to the touch. I think it's the real peanut butter. I read some different recipes for this online and found some that just use peanut butter chips along with the chocolate chips and I think that might work out a bit better. These were still quite tasty though, both my husband and I enjoyed the flavor and texture. We might make these again, but probably with modifications so they are less gooey."
