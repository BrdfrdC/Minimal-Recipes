Also followed others advice and used half white and half brown sugar. I used half chunky and haLF smooth PB cause I like a bit of crunch but either would work. Also added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Kisses definitely need to be chilled before pressing them into warm cookie otherwise it is just a puddle of chocolate. Overall easy, very quick, and kid approved!"

"reviewBody": "There are some missing steps that really would have helped. First this was way too sweet. Next time Iâ€™d cut the sugar down to at least 3/4 or maybe even 1/3 c. The dough was so sticky so I had to add extra 1/8-1/4 c flour. It was so soft that I chilled it in the fridge. The 350 in my oven is a bit high but thatâ€™s no fault of the recipe. The bottoms were getting done way to fast so I had to turn it down to 325. I also chilled the Hershey Kisses so they did not completely melt. Simple recipe but need some tweaks to make it better!"

I used half brown and half white and put little Hershey squares in them, not kisses. I expected an oogie mess but got perfectly round plump slightly browned cookies, soft enough to plant the square of chocolate. Very rich and a bit too sweet but YUM."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was definitely quick and easy and thatâ€™s what I was looking for. I hate baking because of all the measuring and ingredients needed so this was right up my alley. I took the advice from all the others with using sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar and even adding just a little bit of flour and then rolling them in sugar before baking. I cooked them for about 12 minutes and they came out perfectly. I put the kisses in the fridge prior to help prevent them from melting which seemed to work great. As for the taste, I have 3 stars because it just tasted overwhelmingly of peanut butter. Like I was eating a warm peanut butter mush. Good, but just overwhelming and a little too sweet. I will wait for them to completely cool and try again. I like my cookies when they are completely cooled rather than fresh hot out of the oven."

So, my review for THIS recipe is definitely 5 stars. \n\nAs for how long to bake them, that will always depend on YOUR oven. Know your oven. Do a test batch with 4 cookies at the suggested time to see if you need to increase or decrease baking time."

The Splenda version is ok, but definitely not as good!\nWhen I did it this time, I used another reviewerâ€™s suggestion and did 1/3 c white sugar, 1/3 c brown sugar and 1/3 c confectioners sugar. \nThey were perfect. My mom has had her original recipe (with flour and Crisco, etc) for decades and said she might do them this way now!\nI may try adding a little vanilla next time, but overall, itâ€™s a solid, easy gluten-free recipe! Two thumbs up!"

I made these exactly as the recipe states because what good would my review be of THIS recipe if\nI changed things up?\n\nComments:\n\nWe wrapped dough and placed in freezer for 20 min. This made rolling easier as the dough gets crumbly as it warms so roll quickly.\n\nUnwrap kisses and set them in freezer while cookies bake. Took this idea from another comment and it is brilliant! \n\nThese look raw after 10 min but take them out and press the kiss on them. They finish cooking on the \nCookie sheet with no melting issues at all!\n\nThey are rich but I expected this based on the ingredients. One cookie satisfies a sweet tooth."

So simple, in fact, that my 8 year old made them all by herself. I was going to help, but when I saw all the steps and ingredients needed, I knew she could do them herself. The only thing we did differently was to add caramel filled kisses to the top. I would highly recommend this. It added a new texture and flavor to the whole thing that really enhanced it."

Thank you for Sharing! -- Also, I paired these with a raspberry jelly filled butter cookie and told everyone over the holidays that i made \"peanut butter &amp; jelly cookies\" ;) ( really, it is fruit preserve in the cookies. It's just funner to say jelly.)"
