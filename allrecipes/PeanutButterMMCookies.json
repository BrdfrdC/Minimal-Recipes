"reviewBody": "I wasn't sure what to expect, but these turned out really good. I only had dark brown sugar and regular sized M&amp;Ms but it seemed to work just fine. Did not adjust ingredients, but threw in a couple handfuls of chocolate chips, too. It really is important to let these cool for several minutes before removing from the baking sheet or eating. They will totally fall apart if you don't give them time to set up!"

"reviewBody": "I read this recipe 4 times to see if I had left something out or done something wrong. It was really hard to incorporate all the ingredients. I finally just formed the balls as best I could, squeezing tightly, and then mashing slightly on the cookie sheet. I used Kroger all natural creamy peanut butter (only peanuts and salt). I agree with another reviewer who had trouble incorporating all the M&amp;Ms (yes, I used only 1/2 cup). On my 5th read through, I realized I had used the mixer. The submitter said none was needed so perhaps that’s the difference in my cookies, which broke easily but tasted FANTASTIC. I’m extremely interested in perfecting this recipe since my granddaughter is gluten free and this would make a perfect dessert for her."

"reviewBody": "Wow! The recipe submitter is right! It's almost unbelievable how good and easy these cookies are with no flour, no butter either. I was skeptical but forged ahead anyway. The taste and texture were great. I made these for a super bowl party and used all the red and yellow m&amp;m's to represent my Kansas City Chief's. If your looking for a delicious, fast, easy, no flour cookie recipe you should really give these a try! (I used dark brown sugar, as that's what I had on hand, with no issues)"

"reviewBody": "I was surprised that there was no flour in this recipe, but once all the ingredients were mixed together it did form a dough. I used dark brown sugar so my cookies turned out a bit darker than expected. I also baked them for the full 10 minutes, but next time would try 9 minutes since they were a bit too browned on the bottoms. Mini M&amp;Ms make it so you can pack a lot of chocolate in each cookie with fun pops of color. I didn't really notice the nutmeg flavor since so little was added but I'm sure it adds to the overall tasty flavor."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was amazing! It tasted awesome, it didn't take as long as the recipe called for, and just overall amazing! The only thing I would change is to add just a little less than a cup of M&amp;M's because with all of the M&amp;M's, it is a little bit hard to form. Overall, 10/10, will be making again!"
