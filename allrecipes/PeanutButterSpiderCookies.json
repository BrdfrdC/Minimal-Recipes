Next time I'll try whoppers malted milk balls and just make smaller cookies to accomodate the smaller \"bodies\" for 3 reasons - the truffles are hard to cut in half without crumbling , some of the truffles \"leaked\" at both ends overnight on the table (much to his delight as they only leaked at the front and back, not the sides for some reason, and it looked exactly like an organic mess if you get my meaning, lol) and the truffles are really sweet. But for the first time ever I made a new holiday cute recipe and mine turned out looking like the picture, not \"sort of\" like the picture!"

"reviewBody": "I have an impatient 4 year old, so I did these semi-homemade style. Used premade peanut butter cookies (Recee's break apart cookies from Publix). Put two of the cookies together and rolled into a ball, and dredged in sugar. Baked 12 minutes on 350, took out, made a dent with the back of a tablespoon, and put back in for 3 more minutes. Waited for them to cool, and used premade chocolate decorating frosting, and pipped a circle blob to make the truffle stick (tried adding tuffle while cookies were hot, and they just melted). Used same store bought frosting (the kind in a bag with a tip attached), to attach eyes and make legs.\n\nTurned out good enough for family and friends, although dont think they'd be good enough for a bake sale. \n\n4 year old had a blast, and didnt ruin the kitchen. Also, was super speedy."

Not sure whether these are always available, but they worked perfect. Also put the eyes in when the cookies were out of the oven after about 7 minutes. The chocolate was nice and soft, and the eyes went on perfectly. Used a tube of pre-made chocolate cookie frosting by Betty Crocker for spidey legs."

Got 1 tub of white frosting, put about 1/4 of it in a piping bag for the eyes, the other 3/4 of the frosting, I added cocoa powder and about 1 Tbl milk and put that in a piping bag for legs and eye dots.
