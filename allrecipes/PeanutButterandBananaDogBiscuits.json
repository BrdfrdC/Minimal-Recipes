Lola, my 8 year old is not a fan of Bananas but she couldn't stop smelling the sheet pan on the counter. Ziggy, 11 months wasn't sure at first because it was harder than his normal treats however, he soon realized these were the best combination of flavors!!"

(probably from the extra banana).\nI used a pizza cutter to cut diamond shapes (long cuts one way, long cuts the other way).\nI didn't grease the baking sheet (it's an old non-stick sheet).\n\nI'll definitely make these again.

Use a rolling pin to smooth it out. My rolling pin and the sides of the pan work perfectly for keeping the dough uniform in depth. Cut the dough with a pizza cutter (roller), slather on the egg wash, and bake. This is SO much easier! :-)"

"reviewBody": "I made these for a pet rescue fundraiser so I multiplied the recipe by 10! I wanted at least 100 cookies, but ended up with 73. \n\nAfter making all that dough, I dreaded the thought of rolling it out, even though I had bought a personalized cookie cutter. So, I used a cookie scoop to measure the dough, rolled it in a ball and then used my cookie cutter to press the image into the bal. They turned out great! They are a bit big, but I still think the 30 minute bake time was fine. They are chewy, not crunchy. The important thing was that our two Dobermans liked them. I was so glad they did after all that- lol! I can see myself making this on a much smaller basis in the future. The only substitute I made was to use oatmeal instead of wheat germ. And, I think the egg wash does help to make them prettier. I will now try to post a picture :-)"

When I first started making these several years ago - and I follow the recipe as is, I actually used a collection of puppy cookie cutter shapes (Bone, fire hydrant, dog house etc). My pom is only 4 pounds and found that we were still breaking them at least in half when giving to her. Now we roll them out on the parchment paper lined cookie sheet and use the pizza cutter and make them into little squares."

The first time I made these it did take a lot longer than 30 mins with my oven set on 300 degrees, I may have cut them thicker than 1/4\" but it was over an hour before they had a \"crunchy\" texture. What seems to work for me is baking at 350 degrees for 45 mins. Even if some are thicker than others they all come out perfect!"

I like my dogs to have crunchy bits to clean their teeth better so left them in the over after turning the heat off...

I made a few changes like, skipped out on the wheat germ (due to one or two of our 3 dogs is allergic to wheat), no substitutions for it. I also used a different flour, instead of the whole wheat, I used a self rising. This made the treat moist, almost like a bread. But next time I am going to cut back on the amount of bannana I use because it over powers the peanut butter. Either way, great recipe and should be used frequently. :)"
