I might experiment with the amount of mustard (less, not more)."

Since the extra pears we put 2 1/2 cups of both sugar and apple cider vinegar. I read other reviews about the mustard, so we left it out completely. It was so delicious as it was cooking and I was stirring it I couldn't help but keep sampling it. She is already planning for us to do it again, she also wants to try apples and see how it turns out."

I did not chop them up in the food processor. I gave it as gifts and everyone is begging for more. We used it on pork chops and my husband kept eating more after the chop was gone. It is great on any meats, as a dip for pretzels, on cream cheese as a spread for crackers. This is the best recipe of all pear recipes I have made. I will be making it every year when the pears are ready."

The only differences are that we peel, core and grind the pears raw before cooking. Cooking first might be less time consuming because they would be easier to peel. Also we do not use onions but extra red bell peppers. (They are very attractive in the jars.) For variety, the last batch I made, I added chipoltle peppers. This went over well with this family that usually wants it \"just like grandma made.\""
