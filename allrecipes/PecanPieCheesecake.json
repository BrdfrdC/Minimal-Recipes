But the silky texture was what sold all of us. The crust was amazing. There were no leftovers after eating a huge dinner. People who refused dessert saw other's reaction to this and then asked for a small slice. Incredible."

"reviewBody": "Really good, big hit with guests. I did make some changes: 1. TWO cups of brown sugar seemed like too much. I tasted the batter with just one cup, and it was plenty sweet. Any more and you wouldn't be able to taste the cream cheese. Might drop back a bit more next time. 2. Not a fan of graham crackers, so I used chocolate wafers. Big improvement IMHO. Next time I'll try pecan candies. 3. Added some mini chocolate chips to the topping, cuz, well, chocolate. Oh, and I had dark brown sugar and salted butter on hand, so that's what I used. Eliminated salt in crust."
