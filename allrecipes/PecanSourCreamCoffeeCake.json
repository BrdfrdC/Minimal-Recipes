I put it into the oven for 5 minutes. This allowed the batter to spread out. I then smoothed it out to the edges and topped it with the remaining pecan crumbles. That was so much easier than trying to spread the layers as instructed. This is my new go to coffee cake recipe. It is so much moister than most coffee cakes."

I added a little more butter and sugar into topping mix...layering the topping over the two layers...was easily spreadable and I mixed some into the batter in swirls too...I ate mine warm...so good is all I can say...I used a smaller pan, made bottom layer thicker and swirled in some topping too into it...just scrumptious is all I can say, and I am going for a second piece too?"

Used 9 x 13 pan for this double recipe put probably a little more than half in bottom, added 1/2 topping mixture. Then tried to gently spread out the kind of sparse amount of batter I had left-- but it rose so much you never would have known these was more in the bottom layer! It was sooo delicious!!

I doubled the recipe and put in a 9x12 pan and of course it took longer to bake (I don't set timer, just keep checking to see if middle is cooked all the way through). I did add 2 Tbs flour to the topping so it was more crumbly but I think either way the topping would be yummy. Just watch the video and it gives you a good idea of what the recipe should look like."

First, it required much more time to cook; that was not a big deal. Second, and more problematic, there were too many pecans for the surface area of the loaf pan. When I took the cake out of the pan, the top and bottom halves came apart at the interior line of the nuts/sugar mixture. I put it back together and enjoyed every bite, but next time will use a different pan or will use fewer pecans."

I made the following adjustments due to dietary choices- I used 3/4 oat flour (I processed rolled oats until fine in my food processor) and substituted the refined white sugar with Monk Fruit Sweetener. I forgot how sweet it can be, so I should have cut back the amount in the cake to two-thirds cup (maybe even a half cup for my taste). My boyfriend has a sweet tooth, so he is fine with it however! I also took the suggestion from one of the other comments and used the extra two tablespoons in the crumb praline. The praline is delicious and the cake is moist and buttery. I will definitely make it again! It's a great way to use up extra sour cream when you buy it for another recipe but don't otherwise use it often like me."

"reviewBody": "I used my stand mixer to cream the butter, sugar and all the wet ingredients. I mixed the dry ingredients separately as the recipe suggested and then incorporated quickly into the wet ingredients with the paddle attachment. For the filling/topping I left the nuts probably a bit chunkier than the recipe suggested. It took at least 40 minutes to bake and wasn’t in the least dry with a nice texture and flavor. The next time I make it I’ll try to put more batter on the bottom than I did. All in all a great recipe and I’ll make it again."

I left out 1/8 cup flour because 1 7/8 cups flour is just weird and using 1 3/4 cups worked totally fine. I also changed to 1 TBSP cinnamon (as per some other recipes I read) and used an 8x8 dish. Come on now Chef John... who other than a chef has an 8 x 10 size dish??!! I did need to cook it longer as others said but came out great!"

I watched Chef John’s video last night and set my stick of butter out before going to bed so I didn’t have any issues with stiffness (he cracks me up!) I followed the directions, with minor exceptions. Used walnuts instead of pecans since that is what I had on hand, then did a heaping cup of them. Also used a heaping cup of sour cream in the batter. Baked for 30 minutes then let cool for 45 minutes. This is the best coffee cake I’ve ever had."

I do think it would have been better in the bigger size. Still good tho. Saved recipe."

Also, I didn't have quite enough sour cream so used a bit of vanilla yogurt and melted butter to supplement, and it still turned out delicious. A definite keeper!"

"reviewBody": "So first let me say this was a very good, moist Crumb Cake. I can see how some people were confused by the instructions and the 8th measurements, in my experience, they are not super common unless you are a “chef” or advanced baker. In Step 4 the ½ cup butter in the cake needs to be “softened” the instructions do not say that. It’s a given for most but not novice/intermediate bakers. The batter mixes up thick and is difficult to continue mixing with a Wisk when the flour is added, I used a wooden spoon. Once the thick 2nd layer needs to be added to the pan, I placed the mix into a gallon baggie, cut a bottom corner off and squeezed it like a snake onto the middle crumb layer, this helped it spread a little easier. Don’t be afraid to just quickly spread it with a spatula, the middle crumb layer will not get completely mixed up and for the most part stays put. I also doubled the Crumb mixture &amp; left out the nuts since I had none at the time. I used a clear 8x11 glass pan and it took about 50 mins to bake."

But I started monitoring from 25 mins and went up to 35 mins and it was perfect.\nChanges I made:\n1. I used a different pan. Since I didn’t have an 8x10, I used two 9x5 loads pans which were a bit deeper.\n2. In one of the pans, I used the recipe as is. In the second one, I used the batter but instead of the crumble, I used fresh strawberries in the middle layer and on the top. I also used Meyer lemon zest from 1 lemon and 3 tea spoon lemon juice to create a lemon and strawberry cake. I took this one out of the oven at 32 mins and let the crumble stay on till 36 mins."

"reviewBody": "Wow! The flavor of the cake and crumb topping is amazing. The cake is moist, topping is crunchy and not too overpowering. Just the right amount of cinnamon and right quantity of crumb for middle and top. \n\nThis is the first time I have made it and I followed directions except I added slightly less than 2 cups flour and substituted slivered almonds for pecans. I also cooked it in an 8 X 11 glass dish.\n\nThe reason for one less star is the cake is very slightly overdone on the edges and corners. It may be due to my convection oven but it took a while for the cake to be done in the center so the edges are over done. Total time was 39 minutes which I thought would be less using convection and a slightly larger pan. Also, the batter is thick so spreading it can be tricky.\n\nOverall great coffee cake and I will be making it again!"
