I split the sugar mixture into two bowls and put 2/3 cup pecans and 2/3 cup raisins/currant mixture in the separate bowls and made half butter pecan and half butter tarts so that everyone gets something they love. They are a big hit! Will make again :)"

"reviewBody": "Amazing! Thanks to other reviewers I used brown sugar in place of white, and only 1/2c instead of a whole cup. I still have a sugar headache - I can't even imagine you'd seen a whole cup! Lol. I also used real maple syrup instead of dark corn syrup. This time I was making them to bring to a party so I used Pillsberry piecrust but next time I will make my own vegan ones. I love that the core elements were easily substitutable for better quality ingredients. I top with Coco whip topping and it's absolutely delicious. One Pillsberry piecrust rolled out to make 24 mini tarts. I only have one mini tart pan so I use the second crust in a normal 12muffin pan. For me the filling made it through one and a half pans so I had to make up a small batch to finish filling the tarts."

I think the only way to cut the sweetness (look at the ingredients!) is to add some raisins, which I did. \n\nI used the Tenderflake tart shells, twelve in a box, and filled not quite to the top. I did a test baking of two in advance to see if they would overflow. They didn't, and shrunk a bit after cooking. I would make again. Great for a dinner party where people do not want to eat a whole slice of pecan pie. The raisins were a hit too!"

It only takes a few minutes to throw to getter and if you are using ready made shells its pretty hard to screw up. Will never buy butter tarts again. So easy to it make these.

This recipe didn't say how thin to roll the dough - I did about a 1/4 inch and thought it was a too thick, next time I'll roll it out to 1/8 inch or less. I should mention that I made these in the mini muffin pans. I decided to make a quick caramel sauce (melted caramels and cream) to top these since mine were a little on the dry side. I still think I need to play with the proportions to get these exactly the way I want them to come out. Great start, though!"

(by the way, i don't roll the dough. i divide it by 2. take one and divide it by 4, then divide those by 3s. repeat for the other one, and ask help from my 5 year old daughter to mold the doughs :D)."

A super quick, fuss-free preparation when paired with pre-made pie/tart shells that is perfect for surprise company. Added extra pecans as previously recommended...very regal results! Made it to one of my favorite recipes!"

"reviewBody": "This was a great recipe - I used the frozen, pre-made tarts since I'm really not a pastry person, and they turned out wonderfully! Using the regular-sized frozen shells, this recipe made 13 tarts. I served them with a dollop of unsweetened whipped cream on top to counter the uber-sugaryness of the tarts."
