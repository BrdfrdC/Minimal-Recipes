I was worried it would be bland, so rather than taking the garlic out when frying the broccoli and carrots, I kept it in (used butter instead of oil) and added the penne when it was a few mins shy of al dente. I also added some pasta water to it and cooked with the lid on but should have added a bit more water as this turned out a bit drier than I preferred. Was surprisingly tasty! I’ve never had pasta primavera before so this was nice and quick. My two young kids loved it."

I did actually use a whole carton of chicken broth, not 2 cups. But everything did cook and come together without everything turning to mush! I used broccoli and red pepper as well as some onion, extra garlic and jarred artichoke. I added some shrimp when I combined the pasta with the veggies. I also added some lemon juice and lemon zest at the end... Tasty!"

I also added crumbled bacon and a splash of lemon juice.

Had to alter it a bit b/c I don't usually cook with broth so I just used plain salted water to boil the penne and substituted the carrots with green and red peppers. I also added a dash of red pepper flakes for a little kick! Although it's more expensive, I always use real Parmigiano-Reggiano (grated when I need it). I find it adds just the right amount of flavor to dishes without adding more salt b/c it's a salty,nutty cheese already."

It's so easy, flavorful, and it's a good way to get my toddler son to eat his vegetables (yes, even he likes this dish!).\n\n\nI do a few changes. First, I increase the garlic to about four cloves. I mince the garlic and don't discard it. We love garlic! Second, I use at least three cups of vegetable broth. When the dish is almost done, I remove the lid and let the broth reduce for a few minutes until it starts to thicken and is more sauce-like. It adds creaminess and more flavor. Finally, I double the cheese. The cheese is the best part!"

My veggies of choice were carrots, red pepper, mushrooms and broccolil. I sauteed these (with about 4 garlic cloves) in olive oil while the pasta cooked in the broth. I made sure the veggies still had some crispness, then added them to the pasta once it was done. I cooked a minute or two longer, adding the frozen peas and cheese. Cooking it this way left the veggies with still ome firmness. I used all organic ingredients....yummy!"

"reviewBody": "This was a good recipe. I'm only giving it 4 stars, because I had to do a fair bit of tweaking by taste to make it a tasty dish. A great base, but a little off. Good thing it is open for tweaking in any direction. I had to add 2x the vegetable broth, and simmered the complete dish for twice the amount of time at the end for the pasta to be edible. I used whole wheat penne, used TWO big garlic cloves, and left out the cheese, making it a delicious vegan dinner, with a bit of tweaking on the flavor."

I really like that everything is used (no water to dump out), and next time I think I might just mince the garlic and keep it in."

"reviewBody": "I left out the peas in this recipe and will give 4 stars on account of my children liking this. I found the original recipe bland and had to add something to give it flavor. That something was more garlic. I used a great homemade vegetable broth that was very flavorful, but it was soaked up by the pasta and was left bland. A little tinkering and a lot of parmesean cheese would inch this up to a 5 star recipe. Thanks for a good base."

I generally followed the recipe, except that I also added 1/2 peel red pepper, 1/2 Japanese eggplant, and 1/2 small yellow squash for additional color/flavor, and a sprinkle of fresh chopped parsley for garnish. I look forward to making (and eating) this recipe again."

A brilliant way of getting kids to eat their vegetables too.\n\nI made the adaption of using about double the broccoli and carrots, and cooking the veggies for an extra 5 minutes.

"reviewBody": "I liked this recipe a lot because it was simple (with few ingredients) and relatively fast to prepare. I made it two days in a row, once with vegetable bouillon and another with organic vegetable broth. Both times I felt the sauce came out too salty, and it had kind of a weird aftertaste. Maybe it was from the broccoli? I also had to tweak the cooking times for the veggies a little bit so they didn't end up too mushy at the end. I would make this again with some variations, and would try adding different veggies and low sodium vegetable broth. Thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I made this last night and really liked it - I used one pound of ziti, so I increased the broth to 4 cups (or 2 cans). I was a little nervous that it was too much pasta with not enough liquid, but it all worked out. I used frozen broccoli that I cooked in the microwave while I sauteed the garlic and carrots. I think next time to skip a step I might just cook it all in one pot - saute the garlic &amp; carrots and then add the broth and bring to a boil. Then add the pasta, peas and broccoli. Just a thought - also, was a bit bland without the cheese, so you do not want to skimp on the parm!"
