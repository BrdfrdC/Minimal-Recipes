I’m not so good without suggestions and measurements so I think that truthfully I will look for a similar recipe with extra flavour enhancers listed."

I took a few suggestions from the reviews and added crushed red pepper , basil, and oregano to the garlic and onions and that really set it off. I also added fresh diced tomatoes , simply because I had them cut up and needed to use them , and that gave it an even fresher summer taste. Delicious. Good with chicken pieces as well. Just cook them in the oven with olive oil, salt and pepper, dice the chicken pieces and add. Thanks so much! I've used this recipe several times."

After reading the comments I decided to use just one can of chopped tomatoes, 1/4 cup tomato sauce and 1/4 cup of wine. I like the Italian taste so I increased the minced garlic to three heaping tablespoons and added basil to onion and garlic mixture as it was cooking and Italian seasoning in the tomato mixture as it was cooking in a small pot.. Before serving I added a small amount of butter and garlic salt to the penne so it wouldn't stick together and negated the need to have sauce on every noodle. I thought about adding the crushed red pepper but my husband like simple and not spicy. He loved this dish and told me would definitely eat it again."

I just splashed the wine...didn't measure...used a little less shrimp and only one can of petite diced tomatoes. Chopped a little fresh parsley and added it. I thought it was pretty excellent but it did need a little more of something.....a little bland. Will make again...quick and easy and would be restaurant quality with a little more salt, pepper and maybe a tich of cayenne. Will do it again soon"

I added a tiny bit of tomato paste as I noticed that it was too watery. Maybe try Italian style diced tomatoes for added flavor and more garlic. The recipe is not WOW! but is not bad either."

I made 1/2 recipe, albeit with the full amounts of onion and garlic (since I love both), and added Italian herbs, as other reviewers suggested. As the sauce was cooking it looked somewhat dry, so I added a bit of pasta water &amp; another splash of wine. The result was much tastier than I had expected--nice tomato flavor with plump, juicy shrimp. Yum!"

The upside is that the recipe is simple and fast and sauted chicken could replace shrimp."
