"reviewBody": "To make pitas puff, you need the outside to cook before the water on the inside turns to steam. If you followed the recipe and your pitas didn't puff, they probably didn't get hot fast enough or didn't form a solid crust. Personally, I like them better that way. To make them puff you can add extra water to the dough after the first rise, or add a bowl of water to the oven while baking. To make them hotter, you can use a preheated pizza stone or baking sheet, the broil button or cook them in a skillet on the stove top. To make them smoother with a more even thickness, you can let them rise the second time on cookie sheets and put those into the oven to avoid overhandling the pitas, or you can roll them back into a ball after the second rise and roll them out again just before you bake them. They'll get smaller, but somehow not noticeably denser."

I made them without a bread maker, just proofed the yeast with the sugar and water then added that to the flour, kneaded with my kitchen aid. They did become slightly misshapen when I transferred the rounds from the second rise to the cake racks. I think next time I'll let them rise right on the racks. 5 minutes in the oven was perfect! I used the paper bag to soften but honestly I was hungry and ate one immediately and it split and opened easily. Now I'm excited to use them to make Sabich, Arabic eggplant sandwiches I just learned about in my Senior college class.!"

If this is what your looking for brush only the top side with milk, if you do both sides it will stick (I have tried)"

The key here is to follow the directions that CAME WITH YOUR MACHINE!! Some manufacturers say to put all the liquids in first and then the dry. Others say to do the opposite. I'm not sure how the machine knows what to do with them, but my Oster dictates wet items first, so that's what I do. I've never had a bad loaf yet, and I've been using it for over two years now."

This batch I added a tsp of dried dill, 1/2 tsp of cumin seed and 1 tsp of reconstituted onions (think McD's burger onions). Turned out great! Thanks for this awesome recipe."

I don't have a bread machine, so as others have stated, made the dough by hand. \n\nTo soften the bread, I tried two methods, both of which worked. First, I put a slightly damp kitchen towel in a tortilla warmer. I put the hot pita bread in the warmer, wrapping the towel around the bread, and put the lid on. The second method I used was to put a paper towel in the bottom of a gallon-sized Ziploc bag, put the hot pita bread in, and placed a paper towel on top. I then zipped up the bag. This allowed me to \"steam\" the bread without it getting soggy. \n\nBy the way, I did have one bread that didn't puff up, but since the rest did so perfectly, I'm assuming that's user error on my part, not a problem with the recipe. Since I wasn't able to open it up properly, I just spread a bit of butter on it and ate it while it was still hot. Yum!"

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe several times before the pittas came out the way we liked them. If you use a cooling rack to cook the pitas, pre-heat the rack. Also I baked them using the convection feature and it made a huge difference. I don't use a paper bag. I place the cooked pitas between two damp dish towels. Make sure the temp of your oven is exact. A good oven thermometer is a great investment. I let mine rise an hour as 30 minutes doesn't do the trick. And - handle with care. Make sure you have enough flour on the surface when they are rising so they don't stick. The less handled the better. I can't make enough of these!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe makes beautiful and perfectly puffed pita breads with perfect pockets! I don't own a bread machine and only have instant yeast on hand, so I had to deviate from the instructions. I used a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook in order to mix all of the ingredients together (note: I used 2 teaspoons of instant yeast in place of the 1 1/2 teaspoons of active dry yeast). I kneaded the dough on the mixer for approximately five minutes, until smooth. I then formed the dough into a ball and transfered into a lightly oiled bowl and covered with plastic cling wrap. I placed the bowl in a warm place to allow the dough to rest and to double in size, approximately 30 minutes. I then followed step 2; however, instead of placing the rolled pitas on the countertop, I placed them on a parchment-covered jelly roll pans -- I was able to fit 4 pitas in one half-sheet jelly roll pan. I covered the pitas with plastic cling wrap and allowed them to rest for about 30 minutes, until they were slightly puffy. When they were ready for baking, I simply removed and discarded the plastic covers and popped the jelly roll pans containing the pitas straight into the 500 °F pre-heated oven and baked until the pitas were slightly browned, about 5 minutes. After removing from the oven, I immediately placed the pitas in a large (tall) towel-lined tortilla warmer and closed the lid to allow the steam to soften them a bit. Contrary to some reviews, these pitas are soft and pliable."

"reviewBody": "INCREDIBLE! I missed pita bread so much and now I have a recipe that works and satisfies! Thank you! I'm gluten-free (health-necessity) so using this recipe with a few tweaks allowed me so much happiness that I've missed! Here are my tweaks, thanks to users and my own gf experience: I substituted gluten-free bread flour (has xanthum in it already) for the all-purpose flour. I don't have a bread maker so I proofed dry yeast in warm water with a pinch of sugar until foamy, then added all the ingredients, let it rise for ~1.5 hours, and then followed the rest of the directions. Be extra patient with rolling out: I put each ball onto a floured (same flour) square piece of wax paper to roll it then transferred the rolled out bread to a baking sheet with wax paper on it. I transferred it by picking up the small square after rolling it out and flipping it onto he big sheet with the rest (fit about 4 per a sheet). I was so impressed that a few even got the pocket even though they were gluten-free! This is a miracle recipe! Wish I could give it more stars! Thank you for this life changing recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This is a fantastic recipe! I followed\"sixkyej\" review and advice and it was so helpful! \nI do not have a bread machine, so I proofed yeast and sugar in a separate bowl, covered with a dishtowel for 15 minutes, while I put flour, salt and vegetable oil in KitchenAid mixer. Once yeast was proofed, I added to KitchenAid and turned on speed 2 for a couple minutes. I then kneaded the dough for a few minutes on a floured surface, and transferred to a bowl which was coated in olive oil, covered with plastic wrap and a dish towel, and transferred to the oven, which I had preheated to 200 degrees while I made the dough, and turned off right before I put the bowl in. After allowing dough to rise for 45 minutes, I rolled dough into a log, divided into 8 pieces and rolled out pitas with rolling pin. I placed on baking sheet which were coated with cooking spray, and covered with plastic wrap and dish towel and allowed to rest for 30 minutes before baking in 500 degree oven for 5 minutes or so (I like my pitas a little more browned.) After removing them from oven, I immediately transferred to paper bag to soften. These didn't last long at all! I've made them twice in one week!"

I don't have a bread machine, so I let the yeast sit in warm water for 10 minutes, then added the yeast water and oil to the dry ingredients and let that sit while I mixed the ground beef for the gyros. About 30 minutes after mixing, I separated the dough into equal portions and flattened into 6\" circles. I let them sit for another half an hour while I heated a cast iron pan, and immediately before pulling the gyros from the oven I added a little olive oil to the pan and started cooking them over medium heat. I cooked them 30 seconds on the first side, flipped them and cooked for about a minute to a minute and a half. They were easy to make and a lot more delicious and soft than store bought pitas! Thank you for posting this recipe!"

I bake them on my pizza stone instead of a cake rack and turned the oven to 450 instead of 500. I've made it twice so far with good results. The second batch I forgot to roll the balls out before letting them rise. After the rising time I realized my mistake, rolled them out, and let them rise again. I was afraid they wouldn't puff up in the oven after all that, but they still puffed and came out okay! They're great with Greek salad and for sandwiches. for lunches or snacking we wrap them individually in a paper towel and microwave for 10-15 seconds. Very good!"

Then I put it in a greased bowl to rise about an hour and a half. After that I followed the directions, except I don't have a wire cake rack so I baked them on a cookie sheet dusted generously with flour. That worked fine and they didn't stick to the cookie sheet. I just dusted off the extra flour when they were done. We ate them with homemade hummus, veggies and goat cheese. Yum!"
