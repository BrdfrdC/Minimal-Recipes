The other reviews say their is too much topping or not enough butter in the topping well the topping is the best part and there's not too much and you do not need to add butter I don't know what they did wrong but my topping turned out perfect only thing I did different wadsadd a little cinnamon to it. The pie is delicious"

"reviewBody": "The first version I made didn’t seem to have the right consistency in the topping for the crumble. For the second pie I made I added more melted butter to the topping before stirring it and adding the topping onto the apple mixture in the pie. It seemed to need more butter to crumble the amount of topping in the recipe. I also found the recipe makes more topping than is needed for the pie, so I ended up with a lot of left over topping, which is why I ended up making 2 pies instead of 1. It tasted great though."
