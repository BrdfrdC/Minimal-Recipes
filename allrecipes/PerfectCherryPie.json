The only change I make to the crust is to use 4 tablespoons of cream cheese instead of 8. I use 2 jars of Trader Joe's Morello Cherries which are so full of flavor. This pie wins rave reviews every time! Be sure to put the oven rack on the lowest position in the oven and use a pizza stone or tile if you have one. This is an easy recipe which results in an outstanding dessert."

I found your recipe in 2008 and I've been making it practically every year for Thanksgiving. He absolutely LOVES this one - best one he has ever had - EVER. All of our friends and family also love it. The crust is delicious and the filling is just superb. I used Morello cherries packed in their juice (they come in jars) for the filling, Vegetable shortening made with coconut oil called Copha, Phylly cream cheese for the crust.... Yummmmm! Recipe is easy to follow, I had no trouble at all. Thank you Allrecipes."

Glad I did because it was very good. Easy to make. I only could find 14.5 oz cans of cherries so that is what I used. Also subbed cornstarch for the potato starch. I also used a deep dish pie crust and almost couldn't fit all the cherries into it. The filling overflowed a little bit but not to much. Great pie!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe was delicious! I did do a few things differently when I made it for a second/third time, but that was just for me. The first time, when I followed it down to the wire, it was perfect, but I like other berries more than cherries so I'm not going to lower the rating for personal taste haha. The only big thing I did differently was leaving out the stone tiles, I don't have any and can't afford to buy them right now, and honestly it didn't make a difference. I recommend using real cherries though, if you have a juicer anyway. The last time I made this, I used the Magic Bullet to make a juice out of fresh cherries(pitted of course), strawberries, and black berries. Then I used the starch and sugar to make the paste. The paste did take a while to form and I noticed myself needing to add a bit more of the cornstarch to help it thicken. All in all, this was a great recipe and I loved the crust, although, I heavily blended all my ingredients, it helped to make it thicker and crunchy, but there is certainly nothing wrong with the fluffier original version!"

"reviewBody": "I tried this recipe, thinking that the cream cheese in the crust may prove interesting. I wasn't impressed at all. If you like a standard flaky pie crust, chances are that you wont like this recipe. The cream cheese makes this a very heavy crust with very little flavor. And I wasnt really a fan of having to \"freeze\" the butter and shortening ahead of time. The flavor was good, however I wouldnt consider this recipe very easy.....not that it was hard, just a few too many steps for my taste.....My lesson learned.....stick to your standard pie dough recipe. As for the cherry pie filliing, I didnt find the instructions very explicit. I had to cook the cherry juice forever before it became a \"paste\"..this in turn left the cherry pie very thick and dry.\nMy advice: Use a different recipe...this one strikes out."

I made this out of my grandparent's cherries from their cherry tree, so I suggest to ANYONE USING FRESH CHERRIES to add about a half cup to a full cup more sugar, and another 1/4 of corn starch because they are much more tart than canned cherries. My grandma (YES! grandma! as in my mothers mom...) actually asked ME for my recipe. This recipe is a beat your grandma's best recipe type of pie.. 5 stars, all the way."

The only change that I made was that I had an extra Granny Smith apple left over from making apple pies so I sliced it up and added it to the cherries. It gave it that little something extra. And the crust was so good! I put it in the fridge for 1 hour then in the freezer for one hour. It was rich but a little flakey. And instead of just brushing on egg white I used an egg wash (1 part egg white and 1 part water). The crust goldened up so nicely!"
