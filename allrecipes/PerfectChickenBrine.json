Thank you for the recipe!"

Make sure you simmer the brine per the instructions prior to use. That is really important. Also, while it seems like the recipe calls for an awful lot of dried herbs, do not skimp on them. The quantities are necessary (it seems) to get the flavor you will want from the brine."

A new evolution in chicken at my house. The kids asked for THIRD helpings (which is rare to never). The baby screamed for it. Cooked this as a whole chicken - Rotisserie (Brined for 10 hours, rested in fridge [out of brine] for 6 hours - didn't rinse). Look forward to trying it as FRIED CHICKEN. Well worth the effort."

"reviewBody": "I had never brined a bird before and selected this recipe for a chicken that I rotisserized. Rotissary chicken is extremely tender so I wasn't able to notice a huge difference right away but when I ate the chicken as leftovers...Holy Moly....it was so very tender....not dry after having been refrigerated overnight. Additionally, I thought the brine was too salty but that was because I salted the bird additionally as part of my seasonings. I'm about do make another bird, but this time I will not add additional salt when I season my bird. I don't have another point of reference since, like I said before, I've never brined a bird before but why mess with perfection? Many thanks for sharing this recipe!"

This is, hands down, the best brine. The meat comes our super moist and full of flavor. This doesn't saw how long to brine your meat.... we were in a time crunch and didn't plan well the first time we tried this, but three hours was fine. We have done more, but never less."

After looking up measurement conversions I ended up using 1 Tablespoon and it was Spot On for taste!\nI have family members who as a rule do not eat breast meat because it is too dry.
