Bloom for 30 seconds. Add the wine. I'm not a big fan of Pinot Grigio so I bump up the flavor profile with a nice fruity riesling instead. Then add the stock after the alcohol burns off. Reduce and return chicken to pan. Cover with capers, as the chicken reheats. Add the lemon and zest for that bright tangy flavor at the end. Stir to combine. Serve."

I would go with a real hot skillet in the beginning one min on each side and flip one two max minute to ge that nice brown char, then lower flame. Follow recipe pretty much to T and all worked out, i did at the end add some asparagus tips and short stalks which came 9out good."
