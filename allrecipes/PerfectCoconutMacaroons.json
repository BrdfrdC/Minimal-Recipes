This is also the first time I am using my homemade vanilla. I double the amount because I did not have almond extra. The cookies were so good chewy and very attractive so overall a home run. In addition so very easy to make. I do not have a food processor so I used my Vita mix and only blended a bit. Next time I will blend a bit more to get a tighter rolled cookie."

It worked well, this made around 40 1\"x2\"pieces about a quarter inch thick. I didn't process the dough, just mixed as is by hand. I dipped each piece in the chocolate but will just drizzle next time for a faster and easy final. Really tasty if you love coconut and not too sweet."

I used small cookie scoop and packed tightly- then used fingers to shape into triangles and circles. I liked the triangles better as there was more crispiness- I also baked until quite golden as I like the carmelization. I followed the recipe as written (how unusual) and used a bag of coconut that was slightly stale (had been opened for a while.) I will make again!"

Unfortunately I ran out after 4 so for the last one I used unsweetened.\n2) We like a little extra coconut texture, so I only wizzed half the coconut with the rest, then mixed the remaining 2.5 cups of coconut in with a fork afterward before adding it to the egg whites. \nI *really* squished them into 1tbsp sized balls, and they did take about 22 min to get a nice toasted brown. I ended up with 43 unbelievably delicious cookies that I can't keep my husband's hands off! This will be a holiday staple from now on!"

It's simple, easy, and, with or without the chocolate, these cookies are amazing! I followed the recipe exactly. The only change I made was that they did not look done after 15 minutes so I added probably 15 minutes to the cooking time.

I made my egg white stiff and added the vanilla to the egg whites. I found out the baking for 15 minutes did not work so I baked for 18 to 20 minutes. I only got 15 macaroons."

I wouldn't increase the flour as some have done. \nThe recipe calls for processing the coconut/sugar/flour/extracts/salt mixture for 30 seconds. I found that they came out best with about 15 seconds of processing. Any more and they lost some texture. Any less, and they had a tendency to fall apart a bit. The 15 seconds in the processor worked perfect and they held together nicely. \n\nFor the chocolate I dipped the bottoms in as well as the sides. I had to use a bit more than the recipe called for. \n\nThey are chocolatey, chewy, coconuty, and not at all fake tasting or overly sweet. Will definitely be making these again!"

I did not use my food processor so my macaroons have larger pieces of coconut - next time I will use the processor but I think either way these are a winner! Used melted bittersweet chocolate to drizzle. I only made five cookie recipes this year for Christmas, and these are my favorite."

My food processor was broken, and I prefer bigger shreds of coconut anyway, so I mixed the dry ingredients the old fashioned way in a bowl with a spoon. I also added an extra tablespoon of flour (any more and they would start to dry), and for the chocolate I did half semi-sweet and half dark. All in all, a truly fantastic recipe!"

Perfect amount of sweetness! I followed the recipe to the T except the processor part; I like to chew on the texture of shredded coconut. I used mini muffin pans and got 40 small pieces(about 31 calories each) and baked at 325F for 18minutes. Will definitely make again!"

"reviewBody": "I'll preface my review by saying that I don't like coconut macaroons. I hate coconut. I have a hard time stomaching anything that calls for egg whites beaten until they form soft, foamy-looking peaks. But when I found myself in possession of a fresh coconut, I had to come up with SOMETHING to do with it. I found this recipe, thought \"Well, Dad likes macaroons...\" and got baking. They came out a little drippier than I expected, but I assume that's due to the fresh (and therefore containing more liquid than dried) coconut I used and not any fault with the recipe. They were a huge hit with my Dad (he ate about half the batch). Even I liked them enough to eat a whole one! Dad brought the remainder to my grandparents' house and my grandpa, who has never sneaked any food ever in his life, ate 4 (out of 6) while no one was looking. He liked them so much that I made a batch just for him for his 89th birthday party. These truly are the perfect macaroons! I'd highly recommend using fresh coconut if you can find one - they'll be a bit runnier until they bake and they won't turn slightly golden, but the flavor is fantastic."

One thing you have to do is squeeze the \"dough\" balls to get them to stay together better. Don't add more flour. Some liquid will ooze out but it keeps them intact. After baking, I let them cool, then dipped in the heated chocolate, put on waxed paper and refrigerated. OMG! Can't stop eating these yummies."

Increased the time by 5-7min and reduced the heat to 325 after initial 12 min at 350. And super easy to make. Someone said here the amount doesn't fix in a regular size food processor, I say don't be lazy and do it twice, doesn't take that much time"

I made mine Gluten free by just substituting \none tablespoon corn starch for the flower. Used the processor and used a heaping Tablespoon packing it in to shape it. They held together. Did the chocolate too, but microwaved the chocolate chips 1 minute with 1/4 teaspoon butter, stir, microwave more if necessary. Great! Thanks!"

I made the recipe exactly as written except for dipping them in chocolate (I may try that later). These were absolutely fabulous! Sweet enough without being too sweet. I would NOT recommend adding extra flour as some reviews suggest - it would likely make them too dry. If you have a hard time with them holding together just \"squeeze\" the balls hard, packing the dough together. This is what I did and it worked beautifully!!! This will be my go to recipe for sure!"

I just stirred in bowl, not in food processor, cause I like the taste of coconut flakes and baked at 325 for 17-19 minutes or a bit crispy brown on top. I made for a family party and were gone in minutes! Tks for this great recipe-it's a definite keeper for macaroons!"
