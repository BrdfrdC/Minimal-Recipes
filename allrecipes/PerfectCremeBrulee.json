Fortunately it did but a layer of butter rose to top that I caramelized to toffee using just one tsp brown sugar and heating under broiler.( I tried my torch but found it too easy to burn them.) The result was delicious and slightly different from what I set out to make but everyone liked them. I will make this again when I have the ingredients."

I mixed the egg yolks and sugar and vanilla together, heated the cream, added it a little at a time to the egg yolks. Worked fine. I didn't put it through a sieve, and cooked it in ramekins- but it only fit into 3 6oz ramekins. Loved the taste. It was quite thick. I used a torch for the sugar- still getting the hang of that, but overall it was very good."

"reviewBody": "The directions are sketchy at best. I had good results only b/c I know how to make creme brulee. I chose a different method entirely to make this. I blended the egg yolks &amp; sugar together and placed this in a double boiler, and added the vanilla and cream. I continually stirred this mixture until it had thickened. I then poured it into ramekins and refrigerated it. After it cooled I used a finally ground turbinado sugar (raw sugar) and carmelised it w/ my butane torch. Simple recipe but given the instructions wouldn't recommend this to a beginner."
