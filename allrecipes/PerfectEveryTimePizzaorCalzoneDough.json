I only used 1 tbsp of honey because I added 1/2 tbsp of sugar to the yeast and water. I make this crust a couple times a month and would gladly pass it on to someone if they were looking for an awesome pizza crust recipe!"

Their whole wheat was the BEST, I'm trying this recipe next with whole wheat flour.\nI put cilantro and garlic salt IN the crust, and then made bbq chicken pizza.\nAlso, sprinkling just a little cornmeal on the pizza stone or pizza pan under the dough gives it that extra salty zing."

I'm not sure if it was as soft as a horse's nose, but the finished result was beautiful! I rolled it out with a rolling pin a little larger than the round pan, placed in to the pan, and rolled the edges to match the pan. It turned out just like a delivery pizza! I brushed it with olive oil and pre-cooked it for 5 minutes, added toppings, and cooked for another 20 min. Perfect! Loved this!"
