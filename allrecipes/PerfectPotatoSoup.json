I left it chunky though. If you go this route, the pureed potatoes will thicken the soup as well. I thinned it with a little half and half and it was perfect again. If you want to load it up, you can definitely add, shredded cheddar, bacon bits, scallions and/or sour cream when serving, or have it available for picky eaters to add if they want, but the soup doesn't need it."

It doesnt say what size potatoes to use so you may have to adjust amount of half n half and broth to achieve desired consistency, definitely if using larger potatoes.. or maybe use 1 less. Also I use 6 thicker cut bacon and sweet yellow onion. Best served in \nlil sourdough rounds!"

But I really can't afford to throw out a whole pot of soup. So I stuck it in the fridge overnight and thought about what I could do to fix it. After some research, it appeared I could recover it with more chicken broth and maybe I could cure the blandness with a few herbs and a bit more salt and pepper. It worked and became a pretty good potato soup. But I added enough broth to double the amount in the recipe. Not a keeper for me."

I did let it simmer for about 15 min which helped soften the potatoes since I was being careful not to overcook them early on. I did add about a 1/2 cup of sour cream which really gave it that extra kick ! I put it in containers to let it cool which kept the potatoes from getting too mushy as they seem to keep cooking. Topped with crispy bacon, cheese, a dollop of sour cream and sprinkled scallions ! Mmm it was good !"

"reviewBody": "This is a great basic recipe. I added additional chicken broth and milk to thin it as I added some corn and red bell pepper and it was too thick. I also only had a pint of cream. I adjusted spices to my taste. \nI have made variations of this a few times now. Today I used the potato water, chicken broth and less than a pint of cream. With the roux to thicken, I don’t feel the need to use as much cream. I don’t drink milk so none on hand. I also use the bacon grease to sauté the veg instead of tossing it, and 4 leeks instead of onion. These spices are good, use the nutmeg! I like about a teaspoon and a half red pepper, 2 tsp smoked paprika. Fresh thyme is better than dried in this, but today I used dried. I reserve the bacon for garnish, and add grated cheddar, green onion, and sour cream or yogurt. It’s a good backbone recipe. Feel free to add whatever you need to use up!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe is awesome. My main difference was to make the soup in the potato pot (instead of the veggie saucepan) with just a little bit of the starchy potato water to help the soup base. For the base, this was another change: I used about 3 parts chicken broth to 2 parts half and half (with a splash of whole milk to perfect the consistency since I used a whole lot of dying veggies), which I think comes close to flipping the recipe ratios. That was mainly to be calorie conscious but also because I didn’t have enough half and half! This one turned out great but I’m sure you can do the base however you want."

"reviewBody": "It's not often that I stick to the recipe as written. In this case, I substituted one of the Russet potatoes for a sweet potato. I only peeled about half of each potato. That way it gave the soup the added bonus of bits of potato skins. The potatoes we had might have been rather large, because it was turning out to be too thick (IMO). I added another 1/2 cup of chicken broth and 1/2 cup of half and half to thin it out. Even with the extra cup of liquid it was still thicker than most potato soups. Since we were eating the soup immediately after cooking, I wanted the flavors to blend faster, so for about half of the amount of thyme the recipe called for I used ground rather than dried flakes.\n\nOther than that, I probably used around 20% less salt than the recipe called for and unfortunately I didn't have any green onion.\n\nThe end result was very tasty. My wife liked it and said that it reminded her of chicken pot pie. Ah HA! At least with how I made it, that is basically what it tastes like. Except for being without chicken meat, it tastes a lot like the chicken pot pies from KFC. The next time I make it I'm thinking that I should search for a flaky crust recipe and use this (modified) recipe to make vegetarian pot pies."

"reviewBody": "10.2.16 Starting to think of Fall (I can dream, even though it’s still in the 90’s in Florida) and even more of soup. This is a very nice potato soup, but I would recommend if you’re “spice-sensitive,” start with a little less cayenne, and then add more to suit your taste. We’re about middle-of-the-road on spiciness, and this just was just a tad too much cayenne for us (personal taste). I used fat-free half-and-half to lighten the soup, and didn’t feel there was any sacrifice in flavor, otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter. The texture slightly thickened (perfectly), there was just a tiny bit of a crunch from the carrots and the celery (just the way we like it), and I did set aside some of the bacon for a garnish. The recipe indicates preparation time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, but this will be on the table in about 35-40 minutes. Marilee Wilson Mack, thanks for a really tasty new soup!"
