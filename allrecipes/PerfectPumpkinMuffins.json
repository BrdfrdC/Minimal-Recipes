I could have baked them another minute or so, but the color was great and the toothpick came out clean. You don't have to do anything to this recipe. But you don't have to use cooking spray if using paper liners. If you let the muffins cool enough the papers should come off easily."

And now I've reduced the butter to just 1/2 cup. Next time I might try leaving out the white sugar. (Always trying to get things healthier without the family complaining!) I've made them with leftover squash in place of the pumpkin and they were just as good."

I substituted half the flour with wholewheat flour for nuttiness, added raisins, and decreased the butter by a 1/4 cup and used one stick of butter for the recipe which is usually standard for 12 large muffins. They were moist and delicious. Batter made 12 generous muffins with puffed tops. Oh and I sprinkled turbinado sugar on top just because I had some."
