Holidays were usually celebrated at my house with me doing all the cooking, I would only ask that family/guests bring the pies. I made this recipe before Easter using fresh pumpkin puree that I made and tried it out on my friends, 6 out of 6 said it was the BEST they have had! The best part is that it was so EASY!! Thank you for this recipe, I no longer fear the Great Pumpkin Pie üëç"

I added amchur, lemon peel and 2 T lime juice. A more sophisticated pie."

Make sure you use the right ingredients a lot of those ingredients could easily be confused with similar looking ones. It will ballon out of the oven, then sink back down to a beautiful smooth finish while cooling. The condensed milk is very sweet so you don't have to add sugar, since condensed milk is made from cooking down milk with sugar all the sugar is there."

The second time the only thing I used different was the brand of condensed milk (first pie was Trader Joe‚Äôs, this one is Whole Foods) and it came out looking more the consistency of a pumpkin bread? Does anyone know why that might happen? It still tastes great so we are planning on eating it anyways."

For the commenters that didn't think it was sweet enough, my guess would be the long-running confusion between evaporated milk and sweetened condensed milk. Believe me, this pie is plenty sweet."

"reviewBody": "Easiest recipe, great with a store bought graham cracker crust or homemade, you can easily adapt it- I add from a half to a whole block of room temp cream cheese whisked into the pumpkin first and add vanilla and I add a fair amount of extra spices but you can easily play around with the recipe. It cooked really fast- faster than most pumpkin pie recipes I‚Äôve tried and I found my oven at times over cooks the top some so cooking it lightly covered with foil helps it not get dark but still fully cook. It will look jiggly fresh out the oven and continue cooking at set as it cools. 10 stars if I could üëèüèª"

All I had was cinnamon, ginger, and cloves and that was perfect. I read through the other reviews amd decided to add a splash of vanilla and about a tablespoon of brown sugar. I also pre-baked my crust for about 15 minutes with foil and rice holding it down. And then about 7 minutes with just the crust. 40 minutes was perfect for my oven. Like the recipe says, a knife should come out clean about an inch away from the crust, but the middle is pretty wiggly looking. After letting it cool it was the perfect consistency throughout. I'm definitely saving this recipe!"

Sugar and evaporated milk=sweetened condensed milk. And if you want to avoid the Shar pei effect/ top bubbles, watch your freakin pie. All ovens are NOT created equally therefore time and temperature MAY NEED TO BE ADJUSTED, FOR ANY AND ALL RECIPES. ... NOT just this one. Are any of y'all bakers?"

"reviewBody": "Edit: I have been making this recipe for over 20 years now. It doubles easily for those big 29 oz cans of pumpkin. I‚Äôve also roasted and used pie pumpkins many times with great results. I have never needed to tweak the filling, and every time I have made it people have loved it. My husband doesn‚Äôt even like to try other pumpkin pies anymore! One thing I do now: rather than make my own crust (which I used to do) or buy a regular crust, I get a graham cracker crust! If I use a 29oz can of pumpkin, I can get one 9‚Äù and one 10‚Äù graham cracker crust and it‚Äôs perfect! One more tip: I always make my own whipped cream! So simple, can be done with heavy whipping cream, whipping cream, or coconut cream. I mix about a Tbsp sugar with a Tbsp cream, then pour in 1 1/2-2 cups heavy whipping cream and either whisk or use a mixer until nice peaks form. üëçüèº Chilling the bowl and the whisks beforehand speeds up the process, especially helpful if you are whisking by hand. Original 2006 review after I had been using this recipe for 6 years: I've used this recipe countless times with a homemade crust, and every time it's amazing! Thanks so much!"

"reviewBody": "I followed this recipe to a T and it turned out really good! I had never made pumpkin pie but I do bake a lot of other things, and I can still definitely say this recipe was incrediblyyyy easy to make; my mom even questioned me as I was making it because it seemed too simple lol. Definitely fool proof. I followed recipe and cooking instructions 100% and here‚Äôs what I‚Äôll say; personally I used a store bought pie crust and did not bake it ahead of time, and it worked totally fine. Also, after I had reduced the temp down to 350¬∞, I let it cook for 35 mins and when testing with a knife, it came out completely clean. I read that some other people had soggy crust, and while I didn‚Äôt have that happen, I could see how it would be an issue for homemade crust, so watch out for that. All in all the cooking instructions worked great for me and I wouldn‚Äôt change them if I made it again. The pie also has an incredible, smooth texture, even days later. The only thing, however, that I WOULD change, is instead of adding the ginger, I would add allspice. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of ginger, and it definitely is a flavour that comes through quite strong, so if you like that, I would leave the recipe as is or you could even add more potentially, but if not, I would substitute for allspice, Chinese five spice or forget it all together. Nonetheless, I still really enjoyed this pie and it wasn‚Äôt too incredibly overwhelming, just a note that I noticed and didn‚Äôt love. Definitely serve her up with loads of whipped cream and I‚Äôm sure all your guests will love it!"

It cooked perfectly, but it was rather bland, not because of the lack of spices, but it severely lacked in sweetness. I definitely used sweetened condensed milk, and the same amount as described in the recipe. Because it technically came out so well, I might try this again, but with an added quarter cup of brown sugar and maybe even an additional quarter cup of granulated sugar to taste. I don't even love overly sweet dishes, but it truly was that bland imo. The sweetened condensed milk simply didn't give it enough of a push."
