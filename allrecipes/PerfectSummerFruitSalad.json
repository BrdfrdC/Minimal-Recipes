Not sure why you need to wait 2-3 hours before serving. The bananas did get a little mushy after a couple hours out on the counter. Still had great flavor. The sauce never did thicken though I cooked it for 10+ minutes, but still tasted good. I liked the way all the fruits tasted like they belonged."

"reviewBody": "We prepared this fruit salad for a small party that we held this week. It was a huge hit and better than even we thought that it would be. Definitely worth the 5*. I tried to stick very much to the recipe for this time, with the only exception being that I added 5 kiwi fruits since that was what the container I purchased held and I didn't want to waste the other 2. I actually thought that the 5 fruits was a perfect quantity and, after looking at it, that 3 might be a little light, to be honest. I wouldn't change a thing, to be honest, and plan on making this again when future activities call for it. The only negative was that the blueberries that I purchased were a little more sour than I would have liked but that is no fault of the salad. Overall, two thumbs up from ourselves and everyone that we served it to."

I was worried about making the dish the night before as I was concerned the fruit would brown or get mushy. Instead, I made the sauce the night before(delicious) and let simmer longer than the prescribed time to thicken up and refrigerated. While simmering, I cut up all of the fruit (except for the bananas) and put in individual baggies. Instead of oranges, I used cuties. It thought they looked pretty and we love those little oranges. In the morning, I cut up the bananas and layered everything just as shown in a truffle bowl, drizzled the sauce on top, and covered with saran wrap. Perfect! I will definitely make this again. Thank you for the recipe!"

I should have checked it before I left the house.

Don’t bring this anywhere without a trial run first."

"reviewBody": "I made the recipe exactly as written. I gave it a 5 star because it deserves one. I made a couple mistakes so it wasn’t a 5 star but only a 4 because of my mistakes. First I made it the night before. I layered all the fruit and I should not have put in the bananas because they weren’t as fresh as they should have been. Second, I forgot the vanilla so I decided to just put the vanilla in and stir it up in hopes it mixed with the sauce. So I had to stir it the night before which didn’t help my bananas or kiwi which started to fall apart. Third, my fruit was not ripe enough or in season so we all know there taste was not up to par. I will definitely make this again and again! I will remember my mistakes and correct those. If I have to cut up the fruit again the night before, I will put each fruit in a plastic bag and not cut my bananas. I will also make my slices a little thicker. I might also use tangerines instead of oranges. My oranges came from California but I didn’t like how thick the rinds where and the taste was off. I think my salad will be perfect next time. Thank you for such a clean food salad!"

"reviewBody": "My first reaction was... why do I need a recipe to cut up fruit in a bowl? Then I saw the “dressing” and gave it a try. It’s not bad. Sometimes you try to pick out the sweet fruit and there is a stinker in the bunch that just is not sweet. The dressing would help that. I was fortunate to get a great batch of fruit and berries. The dressing seemed to take away from the individual flavors. Each piece tasted the same. Good for off season but a good summer bowl of fruit is yummy without the added sugar and vanilla. IMHO"

I used it anyway and, instead of layering the fruit, mixed it all up. It was a HUGE hit and (much to my dismay) there was nothing left from the double recipe I made. This will definitely play a role in future get togethers."

I also only used 1 TBS of sugar in the raw and the juice of one lemon. I didn't want to use that much sugar, but also didn't want it to be too tart. My salad received great reviews. I think adding 1/3 a cup of sugar to a fruit salad would make it taste like a pie filling."

"reviewBody": "Made almost exactly as written, except I only used one orange, not two. I didn't have the time to let it set for more than a couple of hours, but it was still really good. Definitely on the sweeter side, so if you prefer your fruit more in their natural state, you could probably half the amount of sugar and it would still be good. I ended up with quite a bit of liquid at the bottom of the bowl since the fruit created extra juices on top of the syrup you pour over it. Got lots of compliments from my family on this one. Thanks for sharing!"
