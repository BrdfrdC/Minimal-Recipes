You'll need to let these cool before you remove them. This recipe was so easy and yes, melt in your mouth. I did skip the mixer and less dishes."

As for the sweetness, it isn’t mild, it’s entirely absent. They melt in your mouth, alright… into a dry mess of buttery flour with a hint of jam. This is the first time a Chef John recipe has let me down, but it’s let me down really hard."

"reviewBody": "We used to have a British daughter-in-law (who was kinda mean, so thankfully it didn’t last!) But I learned something very valuable from her: always use “confectioners” sugar if a soft cookie is desired — not granulated! We use far too much granulated sugar in our American baking! So when I read through this recipe, I knew these cookies would be scrumptious, and they turned out PERFECTLY!! I doubled the recipe, and since I live in the very arid “high desert” of NM, I added two whole eggs for extra moisture. I also kicked my heat up to 350-degrees for high-altitude, and 15 mins. was perfect. I filled them with the apricot jam I just made last weekend from our backyard-fresh apricots. Also used a full tsp. of almond extract and no vanilla, plus salted butter (and then cut way down on the salt). I found that the 1”-circumference round handle of the knife-sharpening-tool in our butcher-block knife-holder made the most wonderful round indentations in this very soft dough! Just superb!! Thanks for this recipe!!"

I didn't change a thing, but my oven runs on the cool side so I baked them for 19 minutes, used 4 different flavors of organic preserves (apricot, seedless Raspberry and blackberry and tart cherry), used a Volrath #60 (.54 oz) disher, tripled the recipe and got just 4-1/2 dozen. Making most of these for cookie care packages for Christmas and I am going to make another triple batch using salted butter and omitting the added salt. They taste pretty good without the powdered sugar dusting, but I will be dusting this batch, but adding more powdered sugar to the batter, probably another cup.\nI usually enjoy Chef John's recipes, but this one is kind of a disappointment. Couldn't make them any smaller! That would make them \"wish\" cookies. Next year I will be looking for a different one or just make Kolaches."

My mother used to use Crisco or margarine for her thumbprint cookies. Forget that! It's butter all the way baby. For me there's no need for the icing. My only regret is that I ate the whole batch in 2 days."

"reviewBody": "Possibly the best thumbprint...ever. The dough is to die for. It's tender and melts in your mouth. I have tried many others over the 20+ years of baking and giving special holiday bakes as gifts. In fact, I had all but abandoned the prospect of finding a good thumbprint dough recipe. After 5 years of experimenting, I stopped trying because of the irritation with the waste of home made jams and jellies in the trial process. This recipe has changed my attitude toward these beautiful and colorful cookies. I even went out and purchased some high-end jelly for a second batch!! Love it!! Thanks for sharing."

Eventually, I just gave up and tried to press the cookie back together so the cracks were not showing...I followed the recipe exactly so I’m at a loss as to why I had this issue. At least they tasted good!"

If you live at a high altitude or have an older oven you should expect to bake them for a little longer--ours took about 22 minutes to fully cook through."

Perfect shortbread, tastes fantastic, and looks beautiful! The texture of the shortbread is perfection, and the buttery not-too-sweet flavor compliments the jam wonderfully. Can't say enough good things about these cookies! I used apricot and blackberry jams, and skipped the icing. I got 16 cookies out of this recipe, and they took about 17 minutes to bake. Thank you Chef John!"
