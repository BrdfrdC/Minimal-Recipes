I think if you used 1/2 tsp of baking powder instead of the teaspoon of baking soda, it’d fix the problem. Two teaspoons of cornstarch could help also, but then add a little extra liquid, maybe 2 tablespoons."

I added lemon zest and juice to enhance the flavor, but the flavor was just kind of meh. I did cook them about 2 minutes longer to brown and crisp them up... but the flavor isn't anything to write home about. Still, they are not bad and I will probably tweak this recipe a bit!"

I had to make some vegan royal icing to go on top because I didn’t think the cookies were sweet enough; my father liked them as they were - he said they weren’t overly sweet, and he liked that. I think you can use different flavored vegan creamers to alter the flavor of the batter. I used a almond milk-based vanilla-flavored creamer instead of the coconut milk. I think it would be fun to try different flavors like gingerbread, peppermint, etc. All in all, this is a great recipe!"

I used Silk Almond Creamer (vanilla) because I didn't have coconut milk and didn't want to use the pea protein milk I had for fear that it would change the taste for the worst. I halved everything to avoid making too many. I made 5 and still was able to refrigerate a wad for another day. I'll definitely make these as a go-to sugar cookie when I want something sweet."

"reviewBody": "I made them and used sodium free, sugar free soy milk instead, and I used a little less sugar than recommended, because I prefer a mild sweetness. They were a huge hit. Half of them got eaten by the family before I managed to decorate them!\n\nThey did come out a bit thick though, almost like biscuits. I don't mind, actually. It made them mildly crunchy, but soft in the middle, and I can decorate the sides like little cakes now, which is fun. Let's call it a happy accident."

I also did not roll them out. Just flattened the dough with my hand as I didn’t want to put the effort into them if they turned out not tasty. I will try them again when I’m able to eat them and roll them out and cut with cutters next time."
