They used tortillas at the bottom of the pan instead of potatoes. \n\nMy mom is Panamanian, my sister in law, Japanese. It amazes me how different and the same we all make our rice dishes. \n\nThis rice seemed so complicated when described it, but this recipe is actually is very easy. \n\nWe use Azafran (the Spanish word for Saffron) to make our rice yellow. It comes from the stamen of the Safflower while Iranians use the very expensive Saffron……the stamen of the Crocus. \n\nAzafran is very easy to grow in the SW. the plant is like a yellow thistle with thorns. I use a tweezer to remove the flower tems. \n\nHappy T. Day."

Heads up, though, when you take the dishtowel off the pan be sure to set it somewhere besides the stovetop next to the vegetables cooking on the other burner. Yeah, I should have known better but I was excited to see how the rice had come out. Fortunately only a dishtowel was lost, but learn from my mistake, and keep safety first. UPDATE I made this again and got the crispy bottom layer it was great!"

"reviewBody": "Married to a Persian for many years, this recipe sounds about right. However, I suggest you boil the rice for only 6 minutes, tops. I sometimes boil for only 5, depending on the rice I use. Cumin is not used in most Persian recipes, however, saffron is. For variety, you can make a pilaf after boiling the rice. Add baby Lima beans and dill weed for one. For another really yummy one, pre cook some lentils and steam them along with raisins and some dates and I like to add cinnamon, with the white rice. Then you will have addas pollo, a Persian favorite. There are many combinations which are wonderful. Rice with Shredded, sautéed sweetened carrots combined with shredded, candied orange peel with a dash of rose water is divine. So many! There is a great Persian cookbook called New Food For Life. If you like this most simple of recipes, I'd invest in it. Full of pictures too and detailed recipes."

(Tadig the delicious, crispy golden layer of rice found at the bottom of the pot when you heat plenty of butter and oil before steaming the rice.) I use this method for all my rice. Yes it takes longer than a box, but it is so much better. (I don't know if cumin is traditional for Persian Rice, so if you don't like it, leave it out.)"

"reviewBody": "using saffron and potato under rice shows that it's a really Persian style of our rice, but in Iran ladies love the lots of oil and use extra measure of oil however it makes the rice more delicious especially when the oil was not vegetable oil it must be the oil that extract from butter of milk. also in Iran ladies use potato under spaghetti and we sometimes use leaf lettuce and oil or thin naan and oil instead of potato under rice."

"reviewBody": "I grew up with Persian rice and it's my favorite! I must strongly suggest rinsing your rice several times before cooking it. To make it easy, I put the rice in a fine-mesh colander and drop it into a pot of water. I gently swish it around for a bit, and repeat four more times with clean water. The rice will not come out very well if you don't rinse the starch off first. This recipe is foolproof for those who are uncertain how long to boil the rice before steaming it. It comes out perfectly every time. A kitchen towel or paper towels are absolutely necessary during steaming to prevent mush and to keep the rice beautiful and fluffy. I use lavash or pita for the tadig (crispy bottom layer), but one of these days I'm going to try the potatoes."

This recipe was fantastic and it came out great and i followed it exactly with portions and times. I am so proud of myself and if you make this correctly, your friends and family will have a lot of respect for you! The potatoes help make it awesome!"

"reviewBody": "THIS is how rice should be made!! I have always been disappointed when I have made rice in the past, gummy or undercooked or just plain tasteless. This rice came out perfectly and was very tasty. The potato slices were a wonderful added bonus. My husband commented on how attractively the rice was presented (with a splash of yellow on top and a circle of golden potatoes). Then he proceeded to have two servings and one by one ate all of the potatoes. I will never make rice any other way! Thanks for a wonderful addition to my repetoire. Even after 50 years in the kitchen I can still learn new and exciting things"

"reviewBody": "This rice was wonderful! My whole family loved it, which doesn't happen real often. The spices and herbs give this dish a very flavorful and fresh taste. It's labeled as Persian Rice, but the flavor is mellow enough that it could be a side dish to pretty much any entree, and not just Mediterranean food. It sounds like I contradicted myself by saying that it's flavorful and mellow, but somehow, both of those words describe it perfectly. I will make this rice again very soon. Thank you for the recipe, Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "This \"Persian Rice\" recipe is how rice is prepared in Iran. I will add the following notes: (i) rinsing the starch out of the rice is of paramount importance and is usually done by swishing the rice around in a bowl of water and draining several times until the rinse water is clear (described as \"rinsed rice\" in this recipe, and shown as water running over rice in a sieve in the video); (ii) cumin in the potato crust (\"tahdig\") may be a regional variation but it is not common (at least not in Tehran) (sounds good though); (iii) sometimes the pot of steamed rice is just inverted over a plate with the potato crust left in place. If you want to do this, you need to have a few tricks up your sleeve to stop the potatoes and rice from sticking to the pot. For the potatoes, rinse the starch off the slices, dry them, and slide them around in the hot oil (so they are not sticking) before adding the rice on top of them. For the rice, use a wide spatula or egg lifter to mound the rice in the center of the pot (away from the sides) before steaming it. Before inverting the pot of steamed rice over a plate, put the bottom of the hot pot of rice (after steaming) in a sink of cold water to loosen the potato crust; (iv) always put a towel under the pot lid (as described in the recipe) or you will have soggy rice; (v) it is not necessary to add butter when steaming the rice (common but optional). Kudos to Chef John for very clearly explaining this method of preparing rice (video)! Nice work!"
