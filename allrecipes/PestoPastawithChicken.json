The only edit I may suggest would be adding less pesto. It'd make this lighter and it really doesn't need as much as it calls for, unless you're a real big pesto lover. To me personally, it was bordering on too much at 1/3 cup."

I think a lot of the negative reviews are from people that lack the knowledge that seasoning is up to the person cooking the dish and because they don't know, it should be mentioned. Homemade pesto is pretty much a must unless you have found something approaching a decent pesto in a jar."

Easy to make and extra for leftovers. Personally I would love the recipe with the pesto and sun dried tomatoes separately. I would love bites of their sweet flavor. This was an extremely easy recipe to make. My husband asked for me to make again. It’s a keeper"

"reviewBody": "This recipe has a lot of good ideas, but the execution is a little lacking. For one, I halved the amount of pasta and I still thought the recipe was a little on the bland side. Adding some spices (salt,pepper,oregano) to the chicken before and/or while cooking makes a big difference. Also, the recipe calls for cooking the garlic and then cooking the chicken with the garlic still in the pan. In my opinion, that will lead directly to overcooked garlic. Cooking the chicken and then the garlic leads to a much tastier dish."

I used oil from the tomatoes to cook the chicken, a generous seasoning of red pepper flakes (they add the perfect spice but it’s not overpowering at all) and a whole jar of Classico pesto (218ml) and we loved it! I do think the recipe is better is better with more pesto than called for, however it does state to adjust to your liking so it worked out perfectly with the jar size I bought-I used the called for amount of sun dried tomatoes because I’m not a huge fan of them but they’re easy to eat around my husband loved them in this dish! You could use more or less to taste. We served with some fresh grated Parmesan cheese on top and loved it! I think the type of pesto you use will greatly influence the flavour of this dish, and I’m sure it’s even better with fresh, but for a quick and easy weekday meal we enjoyed it with Classico basil pesto, and it didn’t turn out oily like some other reviewers found. Will be a regular recipe in our house!"

I added chopped yellow onion and garlic to the pan with the red pepper flakes for a couple minutes before I added the chicken to sauté. I sprinkled the chicken with Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. After the chicken breasts were cooked through, I removed them to a plate and tented. Then I added asparagus (cut in 3 piieces), a few tablespoons of sun dried tomato bruschetta (so they were already chopped up) to the onion garlic mixture, sautéed that all together and added a bit more red pepper flakes. When the asparagus was al dente, I removed the pan from the heat. I cut up the chicken and mixed everything (including accumulated juice from chicken) with the pasta and homemade pesto (used an easy NYT pesto recipe). Added fresh parm, salt and pepper and voila! A fine restaurant quality dinner. Will make again and again!"

My granddaughters (5&amp;7) both liked it really well. I will make the dish again, but will use more red pepper flakes (w/o the grandkids) and probably drizzle EVOO and parmesan over the dish before serving. Good, easy, quick dish with good flavor."

After reading the other reviews, I doubled both the chicken and pesto sauce. My husband, two teenage boys, and preschooler all said it was good (when asked by me) but nobody went back for seconds. (When they love a recipe I make, they go back for seconds and compliment the dish without me asking.)"

Crusty bread is a must to balance the textures and compliment the tastes (but I love bread anyway)!"

Then cut it crosswise into strips and sauteed the strips in the oil for a couple of minutes to give them a nice golden look. Then I plated it with the pasta first, a sprinkle of pine nuts, the chicken strips, and shaved parmesan on top. I served it to people from Brazil and Chile and everybody loved it! I plan to make it again for a large gathering at Christmas. It is so quick and easy."

So I did it past the 8-12 minutes mentioned here on the recipe. It tasted great. As for the sun-dried tomatoes, I didn't have any oil-packed, and used regular sun-dried tomatoes to cut into strips. It worked out well. I would make this again in a heartbeat."
