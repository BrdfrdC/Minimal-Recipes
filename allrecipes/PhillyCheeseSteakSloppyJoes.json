"reviewBody": "Wow! These are delicious! I hate regular sloppy joes, but I LOVE Philly Cheese Steak and these were spot on! Definitely drain your meat after browning. I’m sure that was implied, just not stated. I diced my veggies just so they’d distribute more evenly. The only thing I might change when I make these again (Oh, yeah! I’ll make them again) is to use regular white buns, only to make them more philly-like. But that’s just a preference. They’re fantastic as written. Thank you for sharing!!!!"
