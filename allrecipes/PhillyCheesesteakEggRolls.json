"reviewBody": "Great recipe. I added Serrano peppers and used cut up leftover Prime Rib. I also shredded cheddar cheese and mixed while cold. Still added American cheese but on top not the bottom of the wrapper. The peppers were for the GIARDINIERA usually on a great PCS. Fried at a 10 degree lower temp and the came out AMAZING, cheese was flowing . (Make sure you wrap tight but not over stuff). Glue wrappers with a corn starch and water mixture. Yes, I scrambled this re Iâ€™ve up but the original was the inspiration."

I use a little more cheese, peppers and onions. I cook mine in ghee. I usually get about 15 of these from one pound of beef. The kids love them too....5 stars with my family."

"reviewBody": "Made exactly as written and plan on only getting 12 eggrolls instead of 24. These turned out good but the would have been better if I would have used the entire slice of cheese. You expect a cheesesteak to be oozing with melty cheese and these were not. I'm still giving this 4 stars but I do recommend the one change. Lay half of the cheese down first and then the meat mixture as the recipe instructs but then take the other half of the cheese slice and lay it on top of the meat mixture before rolling."
