Instead of chez whiz and provolone, I used swiss and mozzarella cheese sticks and diced them up and added to the steak, onions and peppers. And for us budget minded and rib eye steak is not an option. I used flank steak cut into strips,mixed the seasonings in and let sit in fridge to tenderize the meat. Came out really good. I also used hamburger buns to cut carbs."

That said, I absolutely love this spice blend and will save for future use! Just no additional/less added salt to the veggies."

I sauteed everything in butter instead of oil, because I like the flavor better. I also buttered the top bun a little before throwing them in the oven to broil. Next time I will make a roasted garlic butter spread to put on the top bun. Sooooo good!"

However, I have never been a huge fan of thyme but in my opinion and the opinion of my family, the thyme overwhelmed the entire flavor of this dish. I did follow the recipe EXACTLY too! The meat came out nice and tender so that was a plus! Would make again but absolutely no thyme next time!! LOL"

Put in the veggies and saute'd them till tender and made an au jus out of the drippings .I used Muenster cheese just for a try and it worked for us . I'll make this for him again but don't think I'll have it . Maybe with chicken breast ? I'm ashamed to admit I'm a very picky eater I read too much how food is made"

I also added mushrooms (just a preference). I also didn't have marjoram on hand, but the seasoning was still wonderful. I have a son who is a picky eater and He loved this (with the steak and cheese only). I will definitely be making this again."

Using top sirloin sliced into 1/4 in slices I marinate in the paste for a hour or two. Saute the meat until med rare, remove and saute veges then assemble and broil :)"

I also didn't broil the buns, just toasted on the griddle. Lay the cheese on your cooked meat on the griddle and it will melt, use the spatula to slop it all on your bun, that way the cheese mixes in with the meat."

Used provolone instead of Swiss because I just couldn't see it any other way. Next time I'll hang onto the spice mix, but I prefer steak sandwiches a tad sloppier. And juicier. This was a little dry. So next time I'll probably just mix everything together and let it all cook together then throw cheese on top and cover it to melt everything together before scooping it into a bun. But there will definitely be a next time, so thank you!"
