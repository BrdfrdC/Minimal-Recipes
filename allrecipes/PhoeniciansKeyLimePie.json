I did add food coloring to give it some color. I’ll try this again"

Having never made one before I searched around for a recipe and found that most used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk which I didn't have. I came across this recipe and it was perfection! It was the perfect combination of sweet and tart and I think the other recipes I was looking at would have been way too sweet. I sprinkled the lime zest on top of the cooled and set pie before serving rather than mixing it in. I used regular limes and added in some meyers lemon juice as many reviews recommended. This pie is \"company\" worthy."

Packed 1/4 cup of crust mixture in each ramekin &amp; baked for 10-15 min @ 350°. I then filled each ramekin with equal amounts of custard mixture and baked for an additional 15min @ 350°. Pulled them, let cool for a few min then covered and refrigerated. Garnished with whipped cream and lime zest or curls."

I don't usually do almonds in the crust (just being lazy I guess) and just increase the graham crackers. I also don't do lime zest and it is still a phenomenal pie!!! Perfect creamy texture and a lime taste that isn't too sweet, too sour or overpowering. 5 starts for sure!!!! Thank you for sharing this recipe!"

I usually make two at a time. I double the recipe but start with store-bought graham cracker crusts. I use the left over egg whites and brush the crusts and bake at 375 for 5-8 min. I know you're asking about the almond flavor, but hold on...\nI use the zest from a whole lime. Be sure it is ripe/dark green all the way around. I then drop a cup (+/-) of sliced almonds in the mix since the flavor is not in the crust. This method allows for all the flavors of the original with an easier clean up."

I toasted almond slivers in butter myself before grinding them and adding crust mixture and they added a supurb nutty flavor to the crust that is perfect with the tart key lime flavor. I could not get fresh key limes so used bottled and it was still delicious! I definitely would not sub anything for the heavy cream which balances the tart key lime juice."

"reviewBody": "I followed the recipe except didn't have time to make the almond crust. I used a ready made graham cracker crust and after baking for 10 min. placed approx. 1/4 cup roasted chopped almonds in bottom of crust before adding filling. I used heavy whipping cream and increased the lime zest to 1 tsp. I only had time to refrigerate for an hour before serving---and it was perfect. Everyone enjoyed the pie. It is a keeper."

I decided to put my own spin on it by crushing Lorna Doone cookies and macadamia nuts. I also made the recipe 50% bigger, because I had an extra large pie pan. I baked the pie for 25 minutes instead of 15 to make up for the size difference. This pie was exceptional! I will be making it again."

The pie was literally the best I’ve ever eaten, even in Key West. Even though it said to refrigerate overnight, we couldn’t wait, and after 5 hours we cut it up and it was phenomenal! We both had two servings. Keeping this recipe to make for my mother-in-law!"

I would recommend this recipe go in your “go to” list of favorites."

My only hitch was I required more butter in the crust as it wasn’t staying together. But with the extra 1/4 cup butter it was perfect and the crust was amazing and worth toasting the almonds for for sure."

I made a couple of substitutions for my own palette - I generally find recipes from the US and Canada too sweet, so I took out the sugar in the base entirely, and replaced it with a little over 1/2 cup of coconut shavings instead. I used creme fraiche instead of \"heavy\" cream (which I took to read double cream). The cake set well and tasted delicious."

Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until whites form stiff peaks. add few drops of ppepermint extract and keep beating. Spread meringue over pie covering completely.\nhope you like it!!!!"

The toasted almonds were a delicious addition, but the crust was so crumbly it feel apart, and I had to rebake it. Then, the custard was absorbed into the crust, and some of the crust floated upwards, and baked on top. The final result did taste good, but there was too much crust for too little filling. If I'd make this again, I'd add more butter to the crust and double the filling."

I used a 1/2 cup more butter for the crust than the recipe called for as I used 14 graham crackers instead of the almonds I probably won't look for another key lime pie recipe. It's a Keeper."
