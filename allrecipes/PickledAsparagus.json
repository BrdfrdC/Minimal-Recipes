First batch, followed recipe and didn't have enough brine for 2 jars. So next time, with enough asparagus to fill 4 jars, I tripled the brine recipe. Perfect! These are so tasty. Crispy and full of flavor. Definitely a keeper! Hint.....if you have thick spears, especially at the bottom, best to peel the stalks about 2-3\". It really helps to make those tough ends tender."

I used to pickle a lot in the late summer in days gone by. I knew I wanted a little white onion in each little jar, and mustard seed and both dill weed and seed be cause fresh are out of season. I put the spices in the individual jars. I didn't use sugar. I don't remember the pickling liquid to be straight white vinegar, but so it is.One of the jars did not seal and I was too tired to reprocess KT. Three days later we tried it and it is perfect!??"

I thought the originally was too sweet and not spicy enough, and I wasn't crazy about the pickled onion in there. So I cut the sugar in half, doubled the chili flakes, and left out the onion, but put in some garlic cloves instead - and it was OUTSTANDING! I made and gifted a bunch of these for xmas last year and they were a huge hit!! I have friends that regularly ask me to make these for them! I will sit down and eat an entire jar in 1 sitting!!"

I had just a bunch of skinny asparagus and found that the asparagus and half an onion, sliced, fit into a quart jar snugly. The liquid was barely enough. I poured the boiling vinegar over the drained asparagus in the jar and, after cooling it, stuck it into the refrigerator. A few hours later it was delicious and VERY crisp...suitable for drink garnish or (as we used it) a combo with pickled eggs as an appetizer."

It was my first time canning and they turned out beautifully. I put two sprigs of dill in each jar along with a clove of minced garlic, the mustard seed and red pepper flakes. I sterilized the jars in the dishwasher and pulled the jars out while they were still warm to fill them with the speers and brine to reduce chance of breakage. Every two bunches of asparagus makes 3 jars. The most exciting part is when the jars begn to seal as they cool off. Success!"

"reviewBody": "This may be common canning knowledge...but I didn't know this: Be sure to pack the asparagus tightly in the jars. If you don't, you run the risk of the asparagus overcooking during the 10-minute processing time.\n\nI added a crushed garlic clove to the bottom of each jar. Otherwise, no changes to the recipe. The pickling juice had a great flavor!"

Mom loved them.\nMy Mom turned 92 this year and if she wants something I try to get it for her.\nThe whole family loved them. Very easy to do."

"reviewBody": "turned out great. I had 5 lbs of asparagus from the farmer's market and no idea what to do with any of it. I pickled half (the skinnier ones) using this recipe. I used fresh dill from teh garden in place of dill seed and I also doubled the recipe. So good! Especially in out bloody mary's."

I also put several crushed cloves of garlic and more red pepper flakes in the bottom of the jars. Makes a wonderful item to tuck into a gift basket, or to give away at the holidays, long after asparagus season is gone."
