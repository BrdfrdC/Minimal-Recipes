I made the following changes: six whole cloves of garlic, about 18 peppercorns and the same Number of allspice berries (I was shooting for three of each in the half pint jars I was making). I do a lot of canning and wasn’t sure if I was going to process this in a hot bath or not but just to be on the safe side I added the appropriate amount of pickle crisp from ball products. These turned out wonderfully and I’m asked my friends and family to make them some next time I’m buying red onions in bulk."

Add them to your preferred container with sliced jarred or cannned beets along with the beet juice and apple cider vinegar to taste and refrigerate. That's it. The beets give the onions a beautiful pink color and a little sweetness. *No* salt. I love to use these on my homemade hummus. A little sumac oil on top."

I decided to try and make some pickled onions so I can add them to burgers and tacos too. I used this recipe but changed the red wine vinegar to apple cider vinegar as other reviewers recommended and because I love ACV. I tasted after a few hours and they were no where near sweet enough so I added a couple heaping tablespoons of sugar. I continued tasting over the next couple of days and while the flavor was better, they were a lot crunchier than I wanted. I found some other recipes where the onions are blanched first, so I’ll try doing that next time."

"reviewBody": "TOO SALTY! I wish I had read reviews before I made this. I love pickled onions, I've made them before but couldn't find my recipe. I tried this and only after I dumped the 1T of salt did I think, \"That seemed like a LOT\". Too late, I tried to get some of it out but it was just too salty. I did increase the sugar too, thought it might balance it out, but in the end I had to throw this away. I'm disappointed people rate recipes highly and then comment that they made huge changes to the recipe, that rating is deceptive! I trust the star ratings to believe a recipe will be good. This recipe, as it is written, is not good."

I split the 1/2 cup of red wine vinegar up and used 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar and 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar, and 2. I increased the sugar to 1 tablespoon. With both of these changes, they were absolutely perfect. My friends and family were eating the onions by themselves and trying to come up with ideas of other foods that they could put them on."

I used apple cider vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar, and sherry wine vinegar in place of white (I was out of white). I did cut the salt a little and added about 1.5T of honey. I also only steeped for about 10-12 min. They are perfect! Not too soft, not too much pucker. I'm not an onion person but was making these to pair with a roasted corn relish for tacos, and I could just eat it as is! Who needs the taco ;)"

A nice variation is to use a combination of orange and lime juice on the blanched onion instead of vinegar (with salt and sugar to taste) - or better yet Seville/bitter orange juice, which is what is used for the original version in Yucatan. believe it or not, it is available in bottles at Walmart in Hispanic areas - usually Badia brand."
