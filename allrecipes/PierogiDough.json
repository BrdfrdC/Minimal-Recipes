I followed this recipe exactly and will never buy commercial bun again! So delish... perfect density... plain.. with sesame seeds or Trader Joe’s seasoning! For those of you with negative reviews... you need to read the entire recipe and instructions before beginning... then follow exactly. “Dusting with flour”. .... means dusting! Don’t just sprinkle....spread that little bit of flour over the whole top.... just “drape” the plastic wrap over the buns.... it will NOT stick.....be gentle in brushing the egg wash! Seriously..... this I\nNO FAIL......thank you to the contributor!!"

This makes them slightly crispy, and not soggy. This is helpful if you are cooking for kids, like I was (actually, I was cooking for my parents and siblings). Also, these are very tiny, so think twice before reducing the serving size. Thanks, LINDAYURKIW."

To cook: place butter in skillet and melt. Place frozen perogis in pan and fry till golden brown."

"reviewBody": "I had read Teufel Frau reviews and laughed about the stress relieve from using this recipe. I too cook often and do pies and bread so I am very use to working with dough. This one seemed to be off with the portions - only 1 cup water to four cups flour but I worked with it - finally got it kneaded let it rest. I too had trouble cutting it with my biscuit cutter and rolling it out was a challenge - however it never stuck and I never had to add flour to the rolling surface - just had to roll as thin as I like it. However once you fight with it and get it rolled, cut, (I also re-rolled it out again) and filled and cooked, the taste is great! I will definitely use again although next time I think I will pull out my kitchen-aide with the pasta roller attachment instead of fighting with it. I would give it five stars if I didn't have almost every issue quoted in the earlier review by Teufel Frau. If anyone has any helpful hints, I would love to hear them. The recipe says you will get 25 to 30 perogies I do mine with a 3 inch cutter and got closer to 4 dozen so maybe I like mine too thin - thus the problem rolling."

"reviewBody": "This was my first experience with pierogis. I used my Kitchen Aide mixer, bread hook, for about 5 minutes, rather than hand-kneading. The dough was very easy to roll out, so those that had problems might have overworked the dough. Handling it as little as possible helps. My husband is part Russian and his father makes pierogis all the time. My husband liked these better than his Dad's!! I made them a little too thin and ran out of filling, but when cooked, they were soft and tender. Very good recipe and I will definitely use this again."

"reviewBody": "I'm not much of a recipe reviewer, but this one has to be reviewed... If you're looking for stress relief, this recipe is awesome. After having to add more water, oil, AND egg, i was able to sort of knead this dough. 2 hours later, I found myself in a fist fight with the dough. Literally... I had to physically beat it into submission to get it down to 1\" thick. I'm not weak or feeble by any means, but rolling this dough out was like trying to roll a live mammal out with a rolling pin. After an hour of vigorous rolling and about a pint of sweat, I grabbed my trusty 9,000 year old, dangerously sharp biscuit cutter. It wouldn't cut this dough... at all... So I grabbed a sharp knife and CUT the circles out. Now I'm a cook... Really, seriously, I own my own catering business, so it's not as if I'm new to cooking. So why continue with this recipe? If a little pillow of potatoes didn't hit my tongue after all of this trouble, there would be bloodshed. Anyway, once the circles were cut, I re-rolled them. Yes, it seems as though the dough actually unflattened during the cutting process. The good news: the rest of the directions were perfect, leaving me with FANTASTIC tasting pierogies. Incidentally, I really needed the stress relief that came with beating the daylights out of the dough. If I EVER make this again, I will include some extra ingredients, a sledge hammer, and a bottle of rum (for my consumption, of course)."

"reviewBody": "This recipe rocked! I was skeptical about the ingredients (oil) but the dough turned out soft and tender. I used the roller attachment for the Kitchen Aid Mixer (at settings 1 and/or 2) and had all of the dough rolled out perfectly in less than five minutes. My Polish great Aunties would have been proud! This definately will be in my recipe box and passed around to family and friends."

"reviewBody": "My live-in boyfriend is Ukranian and I made pierogies using this dough recipe for his family and served them at their Pysanky holiday. Rave reviews!...they usually just make lazy pierogi so they were quite impressed. I am Irish so I made Irish Champ as the filling to combine the two cultures. I did make one change to the dough: I made it vegan by using egg-replacer (a mixture of baking powder and baking soda) and the dough still came out wonderful and easy to work with. Great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Great dough recipe. I used a manual pasta roller to get the dough even thinner and it was very strong and didn't crack or break in the pot when I boiled them. THey even tasted great if you fry up the cooked perogi in a fry pan with butter after. Would probably make great posticker dough too. (you might need to add more liquid while you knead)"

Followed the directions explicitly including waiting the 2 hours before I rolled it out. I filled it with a homemade recipe of ravioli filling made with fat free cottage cheese and both my wife and myself were very impressed with the whole thing. \r\n\r\nThank you so much."
