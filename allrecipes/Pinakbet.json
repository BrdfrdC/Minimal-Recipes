"reviewBody": "This was a pretty good recipe of Pinakbet. I was always so fond of this dish growing up, being that it was always available at family parties and my grandma's was hands down, the best! Some changes I made: I sauteed the onion, garlic, and tomatoes with patis(fish sauce) then added the pork. I added 1 cup of water with 1 tbs of bagoong alamang(no shrimp or prawns). I used butternut squash, because bitter melon is just not for me or my family. And I added zuchinni cubes. Brought everything to a medium boil for 15mins. But these are just my preferences, thanks for sharing :)"

I had to slightly alter a few details due to lacking a few ingredients. Lacked the bitter melon so I decided to substitute extra eggplant in its place. Didn’t have prawns on hand so we used shrimp instead. This was a really good recipe, thanks for sharing."
