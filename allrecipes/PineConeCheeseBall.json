When eaten on a cracker with an almond or two AND a bit of smoked salmon-- it's amazing! I HIGHLY recommend serving with smoked salmon. It is not in my photo as I took the photo prior to placing the crackers &amp; smoked salmon on the plate. This was a hit at the holiday party!"

Took to a party of about 12 &amp; there was a lot left over, so you might want to half it. Also, I mixed the ingredients and refrigerated overnight; instead of forming the cone on the plate, as shown in video, I put the refrigerated spread on a piece of plastic wrap to form the cone, placed on platter. And I used smoked almonds...I think honey roasted would be pretty too!"

Couldn't find fresh tarragon, so used probably about 1/4 tsp. dried, and I think that worked just fine. Also used about twice as much garlic as the recipe called for, and used garlic salt instead of plain salt. I love garlic. Used saran sprayed with cooking spray to help mold the pinecones shape. It did make a lot! Everyone loved it and took pictures."

For the outside, I used raspberry-glazed almonds and also served it alongside pepper-jelly. The savory cheese, fruit-glazed almonds, and sweet-spicy pepper jelly was a great combination to spread on party crackers!"
