No need to have worried...the pie set perfectly. Well enough that It sliced and held form while still warm.\nI will definitely make it again"

"reviewBody": "This was a great recipe and if I'd had all the exact ingredients, I'd not have changed anything. I didn't have crushed pineapple, but a 20 oz can of pineapple rings. I crushed these in a blender and cut the sugar to 1 cup only since I used more pineapple than called for. Baked in a deep dish and covered for the last 10 min. to keep from over browning. Cooled and placed in fridge for a few hours. Texture was great and pie was perfectly sweetened. Thanks!"

I added 1tsp apple cider vinegar, 1.5 quarts of strawberries(sliced,crushed, drained) I added about half cup confectioners sugar to berries and chilled for about 6 hours. I also added juice and zest from 1 lemon. I made a homemade all butter flaky crust and waited for the oven timer to okay my taste test. 50minutes at 350, cover and 35-40minuted to complete. AMAZING"

"reviewBody": "I have made this pie several times before, but lost my original recipe. I thought that the pineapples were left undrained and I used less cornmeal and flour, but I followed this recipe, with the exception of using 20 Oz can of pineapple and extra coconut. I found it to be too dry once removing from the oven. So, I took the reserved pineapple juice and cooked it with a pat of butter in saucepan and then brush it onto the pies. This made them much moisturer. Hope they will taste like my old recipe. Rosa"

I made homemade crust, though, so it was a little thicker. May be why it didn't over brown. Thanks a lot for this recipe!"

So if I were to use extra pineapple and coconut next time I would cut back on the sugar... honestly it is probably better just as written. It was also too much filling for a regular crust, I should have used a deep dish. I think the mixture would be good on top of a sweetened cream cheese base to make tropical bar cookies too, yum!"
