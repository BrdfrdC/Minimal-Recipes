Everything else was the same. The kids really dug it, would absolutely make again. I really liked the texture of the crust"

I already had everything In my cupboards to make this which made it so simple. Well except an egg but what crazy person doesn’t have eggs. I was actually at the store yesterday and thought to myself “hmm I should get eggs” but decided I would wait since we don’t eat eggs very often. But I did get me a pineapple because, well you know, I said it at the beginning of my review. I guess not getting eggs was a mistake because as I was checking out allrecipes.com I found this gem of a recipe. Luckily I have a non crazy neighbor that was able to provide the one measly egg needed for this recipe. No running to the store which was nice. Although running the store would have been a good idea so I could burn some of the calories I consumed eating this delicious dessert. Honestly though I’m not sure the egg was needed. Im thinking I could have just cut the butter in the flour/sugar mixture and it would have worked out. Eh regardless it was still good and I would make it as written again. Well Except maybe less butter. I think the butter could probably be reduced without anyone knowing the difference. I don’t know about you but I could do with fewer calories. I think this would be great with apples or peaches as well. Now I’m off to provide my lovely neighbor with a bowl of this deliciousness for making it possibly for me to enjoy this delightful dessert on my lunch break."

My family larger ignored the final product, so I have consumed all but one piece. The success of this recipe is the mixing of the top crust as the gooey pineapple underneath. This is a great dessert to make if you are looking for something a little off the beaten path, particularly if your family are guests have an adventuresome bone in their body."

I’ll use this recipe as a base for other fruits too. Thank you!"

Consistency is a cross between a crisp and a cobbler which I think was intended as crisps don't typically have egg in them. I will likely add coconut flakes next time too cause I love the flavor together. Fun recipe and a great way to have a pineapple dessert that's not as sweet as upside down cake. ??"

It was So good, not overly sweet at all !!!"

Some reviewers left a neg review but the instructions do say to use canned....so if you are not going to do that, it's up to you to add sugar! I think I would do the same if using a \"no sugar added\" can of pineapple."

Fear not! This turned out wonderfully. The butter soaked into my dry grainy crumbles and the oven did its magic and what came out was essentially pineapple upside down cake without the cake or cherries. Ends up that's exactly what I was looking for. So this gets 4 stars from me, losing one for not accurately presenting how the dry ingredients will come together. Full marks for deliciousness."

So easy to put together that I got it in the oven while dinner was cooking on the stove. It smelled so good during baking! Turned out just as I'd hoped. Kids and I loved it!! Definitely saving the recipe."

However, when you view the directions on the video, it shows that when you mix the ingredients together it becomes granular. Mine was not smooth (it was granular) so I added another egg to make it smooth. Consequently, the crisp became \"cakey\". I didn't check the video until after it was done baking."

I do cut back on the butter in topping but otherwise make as directed. I like to serve with cinnamon ice-cream. If you can't find it at local supermarket just buy a good quality vanilla, let soften at room temperature, then add a couple TBLS cinnamon or to taste and mix well. Then refreeze. Yummy dessert and simple to make."

I used half pineapple and half strawberry and used a simple icing drizzled on top made out of powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla. I plan on using this as a basic recipe for other fruit \"cobblers\" as well. I was going to use peach and blackberry this time but only have peach and blueberry. Goes great with whatever I throw on the grill for dinner."

Personal preference. \r\n\r\nAs well, this crisp is ridiculously tasty and if you like pineapple at all you will be hooked. As in, \"I ate the whole pan by myself...Oops!\" kinda hooked.
