Next time making this drink I'll substitute gold tequila for silver. I believe it would be a better pairing. Also, a bit of yellow sanding sugar added to the salt rim would be fun and yummy!"

This was a happy accident for my house and we will be making these on a regular basis. It was a very balanced cocktail and so fun with a side of chips and salsa."
