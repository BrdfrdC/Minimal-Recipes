If this is the case just decrease sugar amount. It's also best to use bread that's a few days old (it's easier to cut in). When I make it, I always make a double batch regardless of how many people as most go back for more."

Once the egg and sugar mixture is well beaten, stir in the drained pineapple and then gently fold in the bread cubes. If using a glass baking dish, remember to lower the oven temperature by 25 degrees. Enjoy!"

Drying them left the dish a tad dry, but held its shape nicely. I think when I make it again, I will cut sugar to 1/2 cup (maybe try brown sugar) and add some reserved pineapple juice to help moisten the stuffing as well as bump up that zing that pineapple leaves in your mouth."

I used 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar. It was a HUGE hit especially with my grandkids, who can be picky eaters. I will definitely make this again!"

Make sure that when you cream the butter and sugar that you mix until the mixture gets lighter in color and almost doubles in size. I use a stand mixer on 4 setting for about 5 mins to get the correct consistency. Properly creaming the butter and sugar will give a better taste, texture and coverage."

"reviewBody": "This makes a small amount so to make it 9x13 for 10-12 people with the right amount of sweetness I do this: 2 sticks butter at room temp, 3/4 cup white sugar, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 8 eggs, 2 20oz can crushed pineapple in juice drained, 1 20oz can chunky pineapple in juice drained, 10 slices thick/hearty white bread cubed. Follow directions. Sprinkle cinnamon on top. Bake 30 min covered, 30 min uncovered. Let sit 20 min to firm up. Watch it ALL disappear."

Definitely crushed was better because it permeated the dish more completely. Will only use crushed in the future. Lots of raves and compliments from the extended fam on Christmas Eve."

Had a can of pineapple chunks so I rough chopped them and they were fine. I used egg whites too. Covered it for the first half of bake and then uncovered to brown it a bit on top. I'll absolutely make it again. Everyone loved it with their Christmas ham."

I kept the sugar at 1 cup. My family raved about the dish! This will be my go-to side dish with ham. The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because it would have been way too sweet with the full amount of sugar as directed in the recipe. I may even reduce the sugar content even further the next time I make it. I also used a 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple and a 20 oz. can of pineapple tidbits as suggested by another reviewer. That gave it a good texture."

I cut the sugar in half, as other reviewers recommended, and it was the perfect sweetness for most of us (one child thought it too sweet----but she doesn't like chocolate, so that throws her credibility out the window here...) I also used a bakery bread loaf which made for a thicker, more substantial bread bite. I kept thinking about what a fun and delicious bread pudding could be made from this recipe! We will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing, BBHealy."
