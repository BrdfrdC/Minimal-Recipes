Second batch I rolled them up the edges to make room aesthetics great. First batch used yellow cake mix. Second white. Second batch really fluffed up looked like a souffle. Second batch only 1 cup brown sugar. Second batch added some almond and banana extract for aroma and a hand full of shredded coconut to the cake mix. OMG original was awesome, second little touches explosion to the senses. 5 star to original traditional recipe, and right behind it the little tweeks . BTW first time I ever bought/used a cast iron skillet to cook/bake with ever. Anything I can do, you can do TOOOO."

Subbing other fruits like peaches or apples works out well with this recipe. Using the Splenda brown sugar blend with no sugar added fruit makes it a little lighter on the calories and tastes good. An important part is getting it out of the pan when warm but not hot."

"reviewBody": "Made 24 cupcakes and a cake from a 2nd batch. Delicious! My husband wanted 8 cupcakes \"now\", and a whole batch made \"just for him\" later! My skinny daughter ate at least 3 servings! Marinated pineapple in 1/4 c spiced rum for about 2 hours. Drained the rum, added pineapple juice to make 1 cup, and used in place of water in batter. Used half dark and half light brown sugar. Used FOIL liners for cupcakes, but lined 10-12\" cast iron pan with parchment paper on bottom and then sprayed it all. Both worked perfectly. Added 1 tsp. cinnamon and dash of nutmeg to brown sugar. Used 1 heaping TBS each of butter and brown sugar to each cupcake liner. Added 1 tsp. each vanilla and coconut extract to Pineapple cake batter. Baked cupcakes about 5 minutes longer; cooked cake about 10 min. longer. Cut off tops of muffins with serrated knife to make flat bottoms. Cooled 5 min. The addition of pecans in the extra spaces would have enhanced the appearance, but it was beautiful anyway. I made my first PU cake around 1963, but this is the BEST recipe (with mods). Thanks!"

The pineapples stuck, even in a nonstick oven safe pan! My opinion way too much cake for the pan, excessive amount of butter and sugar.. I will be going back to the traditional way of baking these. This was a disaster. If you enjoy wet soggy cake that is saturated in fat this is your recipe. No thank you!"

I'll give this another go but use a larger pan. All that goo on top was a keeper!"
