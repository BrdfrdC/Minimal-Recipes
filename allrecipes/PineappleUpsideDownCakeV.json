"reviewBody": "Caution: An 8oz. can of sliced pineapple is only FOUR SLICES! If you want more than four slices to work with, use a larger can. I made this using two 9 inch round cake pans, and still had more than enough room for more pineapple slices/could have cut some in half to really have good coverage. As is, four slices cut in half would have only made a nice border. I literally LOL'd at the person who said the cake was dry, and that using the pineapple juice from the can left you almost a cup short on liquid! You do know that you drain BOTH cans of pineapple, right? The 8oz. can only gives like ¼ cup of juice. You have to drain the crushed pineapple too! A sieve works great, and you might have to do some pressing, but I assure you, you'll get the amount of liquid the cake mix box says you need (1 cup). You could have also topped it up with water to make the required amount of liquid, or just used straight pineapple juice from the store. Great recipe, a huge hit! Have made several times!"

I couldn’t spread it over the brown sugar so I put it in the micro and melted it, then poured it over the brown sugar and put the pineapple rings on top of that.\nOh yes. I lined the bottoms and sides of two springform pans with parchment paper and brushed the paper with the melted butter."

"reviewBody": "I followed the recipe (except for cooking time thank goodness) and it needs some work. The top wasn’t pretty. All of the brown sugar and butter covered the pineapple and cherries. Next time, I think I will put the pineapple and cherries down first, then the coconut (probably a bit less of it), and then the brown sugar and melted butter. I didn’t have enough juice, or as many pineapple rings as I wanted for decorating (an 8oz can is only four rings?!), so next time I’ll get a bigger can of rings and that should give enough juice. I cooked it for 30 minutes at 350 which was still too much. I like the idea of a layered pineapple upside down cake, but I’m not happy with this one just yet. Thinking I might also add an extra 8oz can of crushed pineapple into the cake batter."

"reviewBody": "This was the easiest Pineapple Upside-Down Cake I have ever made. I worked in bakeries for years, and am super picky when it comes to baked goods. Normally, I hate anything made with a box mix, but had to whip up something fast. Made just as directed, no changes. Turned out great. Moist, delicious, easy. Thought there was no way it was going to come out of pan, but did! Ok...one change....used regular size 20 oz can of sliced pineapples. Used rings for top of one cake, and just diced up others to cover other side in place of crushed pineapple. Worked great. My hubby likes sweet stuff, and thought may need icing....but plenty sweet without."

I made mine in a 9x13 and just used a can of chunk pineapple since that's what I happened to have (not 2 cans as in recipe). I added my melted butter, brown sugar, coconut, then threw in my pineapple chunks and cherries and tried to spread them out evenly. Topped with the yellow cake mix made with pineapple juice, and baked as per recipe instructions. It came out delish! I'm definitely be making it again."

Been years since I’d made this type of cake and it appealed to me as my husband loves coconut. I’m not a fan of it so I just put it on half. I used a 1/2 cup of melted butter on the bottom as suggested and it was perfect. As for the 8 oz of pineapple I mixed it into the cake batter and poured it over the pineapples and cherries. It turned out incredibly fluffy and moist. What a hit! I’ll be sure to make it again. Snuck a bite and almost ate 1/4 of the cake. I’m also 9 months pregnant. Make it, you won’t be disappointed."

I used the Betty Crocker Super Moist Yellow Cake Mix and it was not good. I thought that the pineapple would soak through the cake and overwhelm its store bought, fake vanilla taste but no. It still persisted. It was still amazing though. \n\nChanges for next time: make a pineapple jam to put in between the two layers, squeeze more juice out of the pineapple before putting down in pan, more butter and brown sugar on the edges (the crispy sugar on the edges were phenomenal).\n\nAlso, despite what some reviewers said, I found the cake even more delicious the next day! The refrigeration really made the pineapple really delicious and gave the cake time to soak in the flavors without going mushy. 10/10"

"reviewBody": "This cake turned out great. I use the Bundt cake pan to make it. I cut the pineapples in half and layered it in the bottom of the Bundt cake with half a pineapple and a cherry in between around the entire Pan. I doubled the butter and sugar for the bottom of the pan. And I omitted the coconut just because I don’t have any available in my pantry.I did as other uses suggested and poured half of the cake mix then a layer of the crushed pineapples and then the other half of the cake mix.And I did add a Full of Rum to the cake mix batter for good luck. I only let it cool 10 minutes before I inverted it. This cake was delicious warm."

Then Cherries in the middle of the pineapples. Then mixing the cake mix I use the Pineapple juice for the water and add a can of crushed Pineapple right in the mix. Add to the pan and bake for about 40 minutes. Cool. Transfer to a plate."

Tip for cake cracking.: I learned this at a decorating class. Wrap the sides of the pan with damp cotton cloth. Wilton makes wraps for cake pans, but I made my own. I cut old cotton towel double the hight of the pan. Folded it in half, dampened it, wrapped it around pan, and secured wth safety pin. Your cake will cook evenly. No hump in the middle and no dark sides.."

Topped that with a yellow butter cake mix using the 1 c of the drained juice. I did not add any crushed pineapple nor cherries because I found they made the cake way too sweet. Baked at 350 for 35 min. Remove from pan after 15 min to prevent sticking. It was fantastic and everyone loved it. I would give it more stars, but I had to make too many changes."

I won't make this again without a lot of tweaking."

So I spooned cherry juice into the middle of the pineapple ring The juice managed to spread a little which gave it a mixed glow. Only cooked for 32 min. No problem stacking the layers. Only let it cool for 10 min. Came out beautiful for someone that never gets it perfect."

The top didn't harden like otter reviewers did. I omitted the coconut because I don't care much for coconut and I used a bundt pan instead of making it a layer cake. Other than that I followed directions verbatim. I would like to find a homemade version of this recipe and try that! Half of the cake was gone the first night I made it and only 5 people got some and one doesn't even care for pineapple, so, needless to say I will be making this again, and again and again!"

"reviewBody": "Pineapple!!!Who would have ever thought this fruit could be come a head turner!!! I LOVE LOVE this pineapple upside down cake! To make it yummier I used 1 (8oz) cream cheese, using with about 1/4 cup of some of the left over flaked coconut and 1 tsp of vanilla extract, using a hand mixer to incorporate it together for 2 minutes. I reserved enough of it to use on the sides of the cake and stuck more coconut on the sides and I used the rest between the top and bottom layer which was very tasty and kept them to stick together. Look for the pictures I submitted so you can see what I actually mean. I didn't want any of the taste of the cherry since cherry isn't the best tasting fruit especially after being in the preservatives in the liquid it comes in, I just used it as a garnish, putting one in the ring of each pineapple after it was baked. I also sprayed butter flavored spray oil ONLY in the bottom cake pan then used wax paper (or you can use parchment paper)on top of that and sprayed the top of the wax paper with a little more of the spray so that the bottom cake would not stick or be dry. It is the moistest yummiest cake ever!! This cake is absolutely fail proof and people will think you got it from a bakery; it's that good!!!"
