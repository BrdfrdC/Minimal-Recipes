"reviewBody": "I don't use ice cubes unless one of the ingredients is very sweet- I substituted the 4 ice cubes with 4 chunks frozen banana, approximately the same size.\n*I always use frozen banana chunks (1\") instead of ice when I can; they don't water down the flavor and when they warm up the smoothie retains its thickness because of the fruit. I got the tip from my brother's runner's guide- the basic smoothie recipe suggested the switch and I love it!\n*2Tbsp. Honey Crunch wheat germ is the only other ingredient that goes in all of my smoothies. Even though my Ninja Pro pulverized everything before 30 seconds are up, it still adds a subtle crunch to the texture and even though very low in sugar, I still have to reduce the sweetest ingredient accordingly.\n\nThese two are my favorite in the Peanut Butter-Banana Smoothie I make.\n*will go over changes when I rate that one! Yum!"

My wife works in a grocery store and brings home fresh fruit left over from fruit trays. Yesterday it was pineapple so this is how I did it. I whole pineapple cored and cubed in the blender. Blend this up it will make it's own juice, add a few tablespoons of vanilla yogurt to get it mixing well, throw in a couple of bananas, the riper the better, continue adding yogurt to fill the blender or get the consistency you want. I make a blender full at a time because this is my breakfast every morning so it last a couple of mornings. I usually add oatmeal to all my smoothies for the extra fiber but I did not add to this because it is pretty thick already. Thanks."

"reviewBody": "This was one delicious smoothie! My banana was frozen so I chose not to add the ice cubes; I think it came out more creamy (as opposed to frosty) by doing that. Like I usually do with smoothies, I also added a few tblsps each of ground flaxseed and vanilla protein powder. Here, I also added 1 tblsp of melted coconut oil. It was also a nice change not adding the usual yogurt. Great tropical tasting smoothie that I know I will make again! Thanks VERITY78!"

I used the juice that came with the pineapple and what I didn't have I opened a juice. I always have frozen bananas in the house for smoothies so I used a frozen one. They make for frothier smoothies anyway. The two alone are a great combination together. I got about 2 servings out of mine. Thank you!"
