Since it was for an office event, I subbed peach nectar for the schnapps and it had a wonderful peaches and cream flavor.\n\nI will definitely only use this recipe for \"brains\" in the future. If the situation allows, I will use the alcohol instead of the nectar."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is excellent as is, however to make it really realistic I added drops of red and blue color to the main mix until it looked gray. I not only painted it (using a q-tip) with the food color mixture afterward, but also drizzled grenadine on top to look like blood. Served on a cutting board with a small cleaver. Unfortunately it was barely touched, since it looked *too* real. The few people who dared said it was delicious though. I also made a \"pig aorta\" in a shot glass using the same method - grossed out a lot of folks on social media! (see in photos above) You could use this recipe for all kinds of different molds - I'm thinking severed fingers."

A LOT of sugar, but that goes with the holiday!"

I tinted the peach jello with a couple drops of blue food colouring to tone the peach colour down. Don't use too much blue in the tint mix when painting the finishing touches on."
