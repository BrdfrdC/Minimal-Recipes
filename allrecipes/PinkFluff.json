This will keep it from being like its not dissolved. Cool &amp; add frozen topping &amp; cottage cheese &amp; stir...I then add pecans &amp; refrigerate overnight. Its amazing. I make every week."

It is sweet, but it is the holidays. I really enjoy this desert salad!"

I noticed the \"grit\" some were speaking of, when it was freshly prepared but after a few minutes the gelatin dissolved and there was not any noticeable grit. I have made it again with strawberry pie filling this week and it is just as delicious! I will be making this again and again. So, nice to have in the fridge for after school snacks."

"reviewBody": "Love this recipe. I didn't add the pie filling but I'm sure I'd really like it that way. It couldn't get too sweet for my liking. I ran frozen cherries through the food processor for a quick chop &amp; added a little sugar. Let it sit till the sugar dissolved &amp; used that instead of the pie filling. It was great. You can use any flavor jello and fruit combination. It's fine to leave out the extra fruit and just add the pineapple only. I always use small curd cottage cheese. Everyone that ran it thru the blender should try it omitting that step at least once. It is excellent without creaming the cottage cheese. No one ever knows it's made with cottage cheese unless they have made it themselves."

This is a family favorite and we made a huge bowl of it for my parents golden wedding anniversary party. It was pretty and very popular! We don't add the cherry pie filling, but I've got some extra fresh cherries today and will cut them up and add."

However, to make this less sweet and not at all gritty, double the amount of cottage cheese (blended or not, according to your taste - personallyI like the texture of cottage cheese in dishes like this) or add an equivalent amount of plain Greek yogurt. Also add an envelope of unflavored gelatin when you add the Jell-O but do not sprinkle it in; dissolve the Jell-O and gelatin in 1/2 cup of cold water (it will dissolve reasonably well with a little stirring) and then stir that solution into the other ingredients."

"reviewBody": "I also enjoy this recipe and have a way to reduce the calories/sugar. Drain the pineapple well. reserve liquid, use regular cherries with light syrup. Drain the syrup, heat and thicken with cornstarch to pie filling consistency, sweeten with your favorite no sugar sweetener-I like utrisweet. Put back together and cool overnight. I also might drain the fat free cottage cheese if it has a lot of fluid. I put the cottage cheese through the blender and add 1 small package of vanilla or cheesecake flavored sugar free pudding, add back pineapple juice a spoon at a time IF the beaten cottage cheese is too thick, and use the no sugar jello at this point. Then fold all together well. I use the pudding to make sure it all thickens well, since sugar usually helps thickening and we are leaving it out of this. No one really notices the differences and everyone likes it."

The only problem with this is the cherry pie filling, and maybe the pineapple. I am a disbetic and it tends to raise my blood sugar, and so if I can find a way to use something sugarfree instead I will give it another go. The reviews were very helpful. Thanks!"

REVIEWS: Noted sweetness and fact that the jello was to be used straight from the box and not prepared. Recipe used term \"pour\" which is misleading.\n7. Needed 6-12 servings and adjusted the recipe as follows:\n * 1 24 oz. Low Fat Cottage Cheese\n * 2 8 oz. Lite Frozen Whipped Topping\n * 1 20 oz. Can Crushed Pineapple, Drained\n * 2 3 ox. Packages Raspberry Jello\n8. Tasted it...very good...will serve it tomorrow.\n9. Very easy to prepare, ingredients are usually on-hand.\n10. Used some multi-colored sprinkles for the top; would have saved some of the jello had I thought of it.\n11. A great basic recipe; will consider several variations including, but not limited to: Fresh fruit slices on top; kiwi, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, etc. Variety of jello flavors &amp; fruit; nuts/granola, etc. See possibilities as endless. THANKS"

I did make some slight changes from the original recipe though: added a can of mandarin oranges (next time I'll add 2 cans), blended the cottage cheese until smooth then gradually blended in the gelatin mix (used mixed fruit flavor b/c its what I had), used a 20 oz can of crushed pineapple, used a 21 oz can of cherry pie filling (couldn't find the other size). Make sure you really like the gelatin flavor you use because it gives the dish major flavor. Next time I think I'll use cherry flavored gelatin. Only 1 person complained about this dish tasting \"odd\" everyone else enjoyed it. BTW used low-fat cottage cheese."
