I think ill just stick to my family recipe because this one uses more vinegar than I would use. I am half white and half Filipino, so I know how this is supposed to taste. But my grandma makes this with a special recipe and I beg her to give me the recipe but she wont budge. You can really taste the bayleaf and soy sauce. Honestly my family just mixes ingredients together and goes by taste. I am usually the designated guinea pig. Haha. But this is an amazing dish if done right and make to serve with a bunch of jasmine white rice!! This is ultimately my favorite dish and whenever I go to my Lola’s house, she has it prepared and waiting !"

I love Adobo and my friend's Lola (grandmother in Tagalog) makes the BEST kind! So luckily I had that flavor memory to go off of. This recipe yields a very vinegary Adobo when following the recipe exactly and takes longer to make than stated. I added an extra 1/4c soy sauce, 2t sugar and 1 clove garlic to the recipe. I let the chicken simmer, turning occasionally, for an additional two hours to soak up the new flavor of the sauce. I just made this last night and after the adjustments it tastes pretty close to what Lola makes. But the original recipe as it stands doesn't measure up."
