"reviewBody": "I gave this 5 stars because it had all the ingredients I already had on hand. I did cut back the tequila (Jose Cuervo Tradicional) to 1 1/4 cup. I used the slightly higher end orange liquor by DeKuyper 3/4 cup, Rose lime syrup because I wanted to get rid of it (will probably use agave nectar or simple syrup next time) and a three part mixture of freshly squeezed lime, lemon and orange juices 3/4 cup. Very, very good! For myself I could probably handle the full booze amount, but this is for a family gathering and double recipe with lesser booze amounts made two 750 ml bottles so perfect. Glad I found this recipe. Thank you!"

"reviewBody": "It‚Äôs likely those that are complaining it tastes too strong of tequila are probably using cheap tequila (like Jose Cuervo) which will burn your throat and taste like lighter fluid going down. Good tequila should be 100% agave so if you see that on the bottle then you are good to go. Tequila only needs to be 51% agave to be called tequila so the cheap still will fill the rest of tequila with a ‚Äúmixto‚Äù aka cheap alcohol, which is why you feel like garbage the next day after taking shots of Cuervo. You should be able to get a decent bottle for around $25-$30. The only thing I did different to this recipe was use Cointreau instead of Triple Sec and it tasted great!"

I am always an advocate for fresh squeezed limes, but I couldn't bring myself to pay $.89 a lime when I would need 20! So I used lime juice in a bottle and they still tasted SO much better than the bottled margarita mix! I will definitely use this recipe again and make sure to use fresh lime juice!"

All in all, they were good. My guest called it top restaurant quality strength margaritas. I had to give only 4 stars because I have no idea why the recipe calls for 2 cups of tequila when it only needs one."
