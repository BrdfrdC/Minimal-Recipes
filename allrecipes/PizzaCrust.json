Dough came out great, spread out very easily with a rolling pin and most importantly, tasted really good (even cold the next day!) I saw someone commented that it came out really wet &amp; sticky and they had to add more flour - I watched the video - when it's removed from the bowl, it's put on a surface with lots of flour on it. I did just that and folded the dough into the flour a bit and it was perfect when I went to spread it out with the rolling pin."

"reviewBody": "This is my pizza dough recipe. That's not to say I wrote it or can in any way take credit for its creation. Rather, this is the recipe I use to make pizza any time I make it. It is simple, tasty, and reliable. It is one of the very first recipes I got from this site and, if my stained and crumpled printout is to believed, I have been using it since 2013.\n\nOf course, I have my own little tweaks and adjustments (don't we always):\n\n- I follow the ingredients list and measurements as written but usually make 1.5 the default volume to get two decent sized pizzas. \n\n- I also make the dough in a stand mixer and knead with the kneading hook for about 10 minutes minimum to get the dough nice and springy before rising. I add quite a bit of extra bread flour as it kneads (1/2 cup to over a whole cup depending) because the dough is quite wet and sticky as written and I want to be able to handle it.\n\n- I use a pizza stone and peel rather than a pan and start the oven heating to 500Â°F while the dough is rising. Use lots of cornmeal on the peel to keep the dough from sticking and bake for 8 minutes directly on the stone in the middle of the oven."

"reviewBody": "Made this for the first time last weekend (and it was my first time ever making any sort of dough from scratch, so it was quite the learning experience). It came out really good in the end. I used a Kitchenaid mixer with a dough hook to mix the dough initially. The dough was quite sticky and wet after adding the called-for amount of flour, so I added about another quarter to half cup in 1-2 Tbsp increments until it wasn't so sticky. Rolled it up and placed it in a lightly oiled bowl and let it sit for about 2 hours at room temperature. Punched it down and let it rise another hour. Cut it in half, and stretched it out into two roughly 12\" (average) sized crusts. This was the difficult part for me, as it was like trying to stretch out a rubber band. The crusts didn't really want to stay put much, but after letting them sit for several minutes between stretchings they were about the size I wanted. The crust got very thin in places, and tore in a few more, but after pinching the tears back together and baking, the crust was a perfect thickness throughout. I baked the pizzas in a Kamado charcoal grill at about 800 degrees at the top of the dome, and around 550 at the pizza stone, using a few chunks of apple wood to give them a bit more of a wood-fired flavor. They came out excellent. Crispy throughout with a bit of chewiness at the very center. The outside of the crusts were light and airy, with just the right amount of crispiness."

I was skeptical but moved forward, rolled it out and pre baked it for 5 min at 425. Then, I added my ingredients and cooked an additional 20 min at 425. The dough came out crispy and my husband said it's one of the best pizzas I've made. So, even though it didn't rise, it was still a success. \nNote, the only change to this recipe was the oven time. Otherwise, followed everything else exact. It was very good and I would make again."

It was my very first attempt at ever making my own pizza dough and it turned out perfect every time - including the very first time! I have made it substituting the olive oil with coconut oil, simply because I didn't have olive oil on hand the first time. Still turned out great! I have used bread flour and also unbleached all purpose flour - both ways turned out great! I have never added the sugar. I do tend to use more flour than the recipe calls for, probably 1/4-1/2 cup - I haven't actually measured, I just add till I get a nice consistancy that isn't sticky. Our typically takes closer to 30 min to bake to our liking."

Dough is very wet and hard to manipulate so you will need grease your hands and dust dough often to be able to manipulate it onto the pizza pan and form. But itâ€™s was fun making it with my son."

"reviewBody": "This was good. It has been a long time since Iâ€™ve last made pizza dough so Iâ€™m basically a newbie. I read some reviews first so I knew the dough was going to be pretty sticky. I threw a bit more flour in as I was hand kneading and it was better. Still sticky but I didnâ€™t know what to really expect. I let it rise near a heat vent for around 45 min and then had it in the fridge for about 3 hours (was planning on making tomorrow) It really rose beautifully and I decided to have it for lunch. The reason I didnâ€™t give it 5 stars Is because I followed a reviewer and changed my temp to 400 as opposed to the instructionsâ€™ 350. 400 was good, the middle wasnâ€™t soggy but it was still softer than I would have liked. The rest of the dough was fluffy and chewy and delicious. I also added 1/2 tsp each of garlic powder and Italian seasoning."

"reviewBody": "Good pizza doesn't exist in Guatemala, but it does in my house, thanks to this crust. My hubby and I struggle because he likes his crust thick, and I like it thin. He likes lots of veggies and I like sausages, pepperoni and spicy. For a fraction of the cost of chain store pizzas here, we can have both. \n\nI just follow the recipe. I do add Italian seasoning to it, because I like it, but otherwise, and unusual for me, I just use the recipe. I have tried others that are either too soft or too stiff, but this one raised perfectly, went into a cookie sheet on parchment paper very well, and cooked up beautifully. I topped it with good ham, fresh pineapple, onions and peppers. I was feeding hungry men, and luckily I got one piece. Thank you for this terrific recipe!! I will be making this much more often."

"reviewBody": "I've been on a quest to find the \"perfect\" pizza dough (for us.) If you're short on time, this is it. I used my KitchenAid stand mixer and yes, it's a very wet, sticky dough. I added one more tablespoon of (bread) flour and decided to just see how it would turn out. A dough this hydrated can be incredibly intimidating if you're not used to working with it (dough.) I let mine rise covered, on the stovetop and it rose beautifully. I turned it out onto a fairly heavily floured surface and gave it a few folds. I did it both by hand and with a bench scraper. Next time, I'm going to forgo the floured surface and use a lightly oiled surface. I divided in half and cooked in 2, preheated, screaming-hot, cast iron skillets (500 degrees for preheat and 475 for cooking.) I cooked about 12 minutes and both were excellent. Brown and fry-crisp on the bottom but fluffy on the inside. To make the rounds I, cut in half and then used my fingertips (like making a focaccia) to get it into shape. Light stretches on the outer edges and it was perfect. I let it rest about 15 minutes and it developed a lot of nice bubbles. When transferring to the hot skillet, you have to commit to the move!!! (I used 10 inch skillets) or use a HEAVILY floured peel/parchment sheet. I added about 1 TPBS to the hot pan and added my toppings quickly. \nWe'll be using this recipe for weeknights or last minutes pizza decisions when I haven't planned ahead. \n*NOTE* I've tested Bobby Flay's pizza dough, ATK 2 day pizza dough"

Iâ€™ve never had trouble with the dough getting done, but just realized in rereading this that Iâ€™ve always baked it on 400! It works great for some nice Italian rolls to go with pasta also. Just pinch off pieces, roll them in butter and bake them in a muffin tin. Or shape them, let them rise about 15 min. and brush with butter after baking."

I let rise for about 45 minutes to allow it to double and baked it (no prebake) at 400 for 20-25 minutes on a vented pizza pan. I brushed garlic butter on the edge of crust during the last 5.
