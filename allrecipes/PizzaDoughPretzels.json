I’m terrible at making shapes but finally settled on tie knots. Stored in plastic container but added paper towel to soak up moisture. Hot honey mustard for dipping was perfect complement."

"reviewBody": "The recipe as it is works perfectly! Flavor is classic even without adding the mustard.\n\nThe pretzel makes an excellent bagel substitution for a smoked whitefish, lime, onion, cream cheese, tomato sandwich. Seriously....this is food of the gods.\n\nHeck, cut the pretzels into rounds and top with cream cheese and lox and fresh dill and black pepper and watch your brunch guests swarm the table.\n\nI have since moved on from this with confidence to making sourdough based bagels, but using the same oven and boiling systems.\n\nThank you CJ!"

They turned out great. I do recommend always watching CJ's videos at least twice for all his recipes before attempting them. So much more can be learned from them beyond what is written on the recipe page. Thanks, Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "These pretzels are great. I like to make pizza dough into pretzel dogs. Put the pizza dough on floured board (wood or cookie sheet) and slice the dough so you get long, 1\"-2\" pieces of dough. Just roll the hot dogs, sausages, polish sausages, or whatever in long sliced up pizza dough and wrap them around each hot dog or sausage spiraling from top to bottom. Boil in 4 c. boiling water water with 2 T baking soda for 1 minute, put on an oiled cookie sheet with a few grains of uncooked oatmeal, or uncooked cream of wheat on the sheet to prevent sticking and bake at 375 until they are done and browned on the top (slightly less brown than John's) like a pretzel - about 20-25 minutes. Even if you accidentally cook them as brown as John's, they will probably be fine. I've made 50 batches of these and none of them have ever failed. Dip them in mustard and ketchup if you'd like. They get rave reviews from my kids, their friends, and, even, adults."
