I used Bob's Red Mill gluten free 1 to 1 baking flour. I added the melted butter to the dry ingredients. I then put the topping over the fruit. I had to cook it 20 min longer and it turned out like a cobbler. I was delightful. I have never used plums in a cobbler but after making this I will now. Thank you."

I used white sugar in the flour mixture and added 1/8 tsp cardamom and 1/4 tsp cinnamon. It was wonderful! It took a lot longer than 45 min to bake, though. The topping wasn't browned for 1 1/2 hours."

"reviewBody": "Had an abundance of plums from our tree this year, so I was looking for a way to utilize them and came across this recipe. I made it according to the directions, except I did sprinkle the top with brown sugar before baking, as a few suggested. Overall it was good, but if your plums have tart skin, I would strongly recommend you peel the majority of the fruit. I did not do this and the crisp was very tart, almost bitter, because of it; even ice cream was only a marginal improvement. I think this recipe would also work well with other fruits such as peaches or blackberries. I will try it again with plums too, but I will definitely peel the fruit first. (Photos are before and after baking)"

So, adding a teaspoon of salt to the recipe also made it too salty. It was also too buttery. It was not nice eating the plums and seeing them in a little pool of butter. I didn't like anything about this, except the plums. Will never make it again."

I also put in 9x13 pan to have more of the crisp topping, my favorite part!"

As they’re small I used 6 extra plums to cover the 8x8 baking dish. I also added a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the sugar sprinkled on the plums and the same to the crumble topping. Basically, I found this recipe to be perfect. We enjoyed it chilled as it is a rich dessert. Now on to the other 699, 982 plums!"

I swapped 1/2 the flour for quick-cooking oats. I also added about 1/4 cup of roughly chopped pecans to the topping for a little texture. This was a great recipe to make use of the plums I had on hand! I will definitely make again when I have peaches or plums around."

I couldn’t taste the cinnamon, not sure about the vanilla as I ate with vanilla ice cream. Next time I’ll add cinnamon into the crust/topping. People are calling it batter, but it’s crumbly. Good recipe."

Used half flour, half oats and mixed the butter in with the dry before spreading it on top. Then I sprinkled the top with cinnamon and brown sugar as per others' suggestions. Turned out sweeter than I expected without modifying the sugar. Had it for dessert and breakfast the next morning! yum!"

After reading other reviews, I let my chopped plums sit in a mix of vanilla an cinnamon before using them in the recipe. It came out delicious both times that I have made it now and this recipe will probably become a tradition for my family every autumn when our plums are ripe and ready to pick."

I added about a teaspoon of allspice to the flour and sugar and two teaspoons of vanilla to the eggs of my double batch. I did not double the butter, instead used only the original 1/2 cup. We all loved it and will gladly make again. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!"

"reviewBody": "It’s not bad. It’s true about what another reviewer said, that you need more sugar/sweetener if you’re using particularly tart plums. I added some oatmeal to the topping, which didn’t make it really crispy, but it was still nice. The texture was kind of like a cobbler biscuit topping but a little firmer. If I could give this recipe 3 1/2 stars, I would. I’d make it again, but it wouldn’t be my first choice of recipe."

Thank you for giving me a basis. \nI did not have enough plums and followed some of the other reviewers and left the egg out. I added 3/4 tsp. cinnamon, dash of freshly grated nutmeg, dash of salt and 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice and 1/4 tsp. of almond extract with the 1/4 cup white sugar and mixed this in with 3 large plums, 2 large peaches and 1 large nectarine. I have a crisp recipe I have used forever- 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, dash of salt 1/2 tsp baking soda. Mix this well and add 1/4 cup melted butter and sprinkle over top fruit."

I had to increase the baking time an additional 15 minutes in order for the center of the crisp to be thoroughly cooked. I didn't want the cooked plums to be too dark so I peeled them. I used 12 plums since my plums were large. The crisp was good. Pairing it with ice cream or whipped cream is definitely a must to offset the tartness of the crisp."

That may have to do with the variety of plum I used. The plum tree was here when we moved in, so I don't know what kind of is."
