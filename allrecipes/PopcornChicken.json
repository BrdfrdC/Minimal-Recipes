I saw that some of the reviews said it needed more seasonings, so I salted the chicken a night before and let it sit in the fridge for a night. It made it much more flavorful and amazing. Thank you!"

So I customized the recipe, added more Salt, Black &amp; Cayanne Pepper, Red Chilli Powder, some more Garlic Powder in the flour and added some more Lemon Juice in the egg. Then did the second batch, which tasted much better."

"reviewBody": "Used the recipe as a guide and adjusted the flavours to what I had and like ( maple bacon rub, seasoning salt, garlic powder, paprika and black pepper) I adjusted the flour ratio to the chicken I had on hand. I subbed a couple dashes of Frankâ€™s Red Hot instead of lemon with the egg mixture. \nMy husband loved these. They turned out very tasty and a wonderful crispy batter."

"reviewBody": "READ THIS BEFORE YOU MAKE IT:\nLike the others said, this needs a ton more of seasoning and salt. (I'd say at least 3 tablespoons salt, double the garlic powder) On top of that, 2 cups of flour is more than enough as there was a huge amount of it wasted at the end. \nAlso I recommend 10+ minutes in the fryer to get that golden crusty goodness."
