Recipe makes a LOT - a full pint mason jar’s worth. I’ve read that vinaigrettes can stay in the fridge for 2 weeks, but I would be hard pressed to use it all up even then. I would make a much smaller amount next time."

I make other salad dressings but had never made this as I don't use it very often. That has changed! I use apple cider vinegar. Drizzle the oil (canola) very slowly and it is perfect texture and taste. I love it over lightly steamed asparagus or spinach salad. Great dip for strawberries or apples."

You may even want to try a rice vinegar to help keep the taste more mellow. I also used Grapeseed oil again, to keep the feel very light but did have to add a bit more than the recipe called for. Using the recipe as written, I found it needed twice the sugar hence my recommendation on a smoother vinegar.\nI served it on an orange, Mango and Jicama salad. Wonderful and everyone loved it."

I also added a pinch of cardamom for another dimension of flavor although I tasted it before the addition and it was still quite yummy."

We have also made the original recipe and it was also really good. Some variations were using onion powder in place of grated onion, olive oil in place of vegetable oil, half the oil, stevia in place of sugar, regular mustard in place of dry mustard, and omitted poppyseeds, added pepper. It's great no matter what. It seems like every time we go to make it we don't have everything and hand and have to substitute something."

Overall a good starting point and I recommend trying this one."
