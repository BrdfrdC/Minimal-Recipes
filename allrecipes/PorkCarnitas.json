This is AMAZING! And the aromas over the 3 hour cook time were mouthwatering torture! The photo is taken immediately after removed from the oven. Did I say this was amazing??!! It was!! Already pinned to make again for Cinco de Mayo and I also plan to make sure I make the full recipe because right now, I wish we had leftovers! Top notch recipe Nette!!"

Rather than shredding with two forks, I use one of those ground beef masher thingys. It works much faster and you don't wind up with the fork tines stuck between each other. The only other thing I'd say is to give yourself an extra half hour above the total prep/cook time. Unless you're a 3rd-degree blackbelt kitchen ninja, there's no way you're getting all the prep and the meat browned in 30-45 minutes."

I halved the recipe based upon the amount of port I had available. I did add one can of mild diced green chilis and a couple tablespoons of chopped jalapeno. Since I used pork that was already cooked, I made the sauce and brought it to a boil and tasted to ensure the flavor was there before adding the pork. I simmered on low heat for 45 minutes before transferring to the sheet pan. I finished the recipe as printed. This was very tasty and will be making again."

Took just under 10 min., keep an eye out for it.\nFull of flavor, and delicious on a plate with beans and rice or in a burrito or quesadilla. I’ve tried them all, served for family, kid and husband approved. Good recipe for parties and potluck."

The consistency of the meat was mostly the issue, it was tender and shredded easily but was not unctuous, which is what I was after. I used a Dutch oven, followed all steps to the letter. I was afraid to leave them in the oven too long for fear of drying them out. Meat not fatty enough? Did they need to cook longer on a lower temp? Happy for any tips!"

I had to bring a couple of spices from my last trip to California before the world turned upside down. I finally made this today and it is heaven in my mouth. Carnitas was always my favorite Mexican food. Even though cuts of meat are different I used a pork roast with a huge bone in it, which my dog will enjoy tomorrow. The only thing I did differently was cut down amount of salt to 1 tablespoon. It cooked on top of the stove for a couple of hours and then transferred to the oven where it was basted periodically. It was so delicious and I will be making some black beans tomorrow to make burritos. Absolutely easy and delicious"

Then put it in foil lined pan and on the grill for just a few minutes each side for slight crispiness!! I also wrapped the street corn tortillas in foil and put on the upper shelf of the grill to warm. Chopped onion and cilantro and taco perfection!!! I didn’t even add hot sauce because the pork is so flavorful on its own!!! Thank you Nette!"

"reviewBody": "I will definitely make this again. I made it exactly as the recipe states w/ 2 exceptions. I used a pork loin roast because that is what I had in the freezer. I also forgot to cut it into chunks before browning it. I browned all sides whole. Because the roast was whole it took a little longer to cook on the stove, about 30 more minutes. We ate it on toasted corn tortillas w/ mild onion, cilantro and lime juice. It was so delicious. Next time I will make marinated red onions to go on top."

I omitted the cinnamon and Chinese 5 spice, and added 2 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp cumin and 1 tsp oregano as per Chef John's suggestion. I also added 1 yellow onion chunked just because we love onion. It was flavored perfectly and had the richness we've been searching for that has been missing in other recipes. I did a chunky shred before broiling and it was easy to make the tacos. Served with pico de gallo, lime and sour cream, this is a fabulous recipe and will be my go-to from now on. Bravo Chef John!"

It is gobbled up by my picky kids and discerning foodie taco party guests alike. I love that no one spice or flavor tries to steal the spotlight - they all just work together to create this masterpiece of juicy, crisp-edged, porky bliss. As some reviewers note (and I believe the original author), the garlic amount should be a full head of garlic, i.e. all the cloves peeled and smashed with the side of a knife. Simply amazing."
