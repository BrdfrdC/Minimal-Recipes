"reviewBody": "I made this today. I used 6 bone in pork chops. Cooking the chops 1hr at 400* was way too long and they were overcooked and dry. Next time I would brush some of the cream of mushroom/milk sauce on the chops and then add the chops the last half hour when you add the shredded cheese. I would put some of the shredded cheese on top of potatoes then put pork chops on top of potato mixture, then more shredded cheese on top of chops. I did try someone's comments about frying the sliced onions with garlic which added a nice taste to casserole. I also pre-seasoned pork and potatoes. Casserole tasted good, just chops too done... Definitely needed applesauce on the side."

Instead of slicing the potatoes, I quartered them like I do for a pot roast. My family loves the gravy, so I use 2 cans of soup and 2 cups of milk so there will be plenty of the gravy. I've sometimes also add green beans in with the casserole to make it a complete meal. Note: I also use this basic recipe substituting the pork chops with round steak."

Honestly the people in the comments helped more than the person submitting the recipe."

Absolutely NO flavor and the pork chops as predicted were so dry we went through a gallon of apple sauce to choke them down."

Browned the meat , using sliced thin fingerling potatoes and small cubed eggplant and onions diced. Used the cream of mushroom soup with a 1/2 of cup of water and poured it over the mixture and spread it out (it is thick because your eggplant will provide the liquid needed) cook as directed. Turned out great, but next time I would season the veggies tp add a nicer flavor to the dish."

For a rainy day, it hit the spot. I also caramelized the onion. Than you so much for this recipe"

I avoid recipes that rely on cans of soup as one of the ingredients, I would rather make my own roux, sauce, gravy, etc. I sliced the potatoes thin, covered the dish for the full hour and still the potatoes were slightly underdone. I used the full cup of milk because I knew the dish would need the liquid to cook the potatoes. I seasoned the chops and dredged them in a light coating of flour before searing them. Over all...the dish was okay. I may make it again, but it didn't knock my socks off."

I used an whole onion and sauteed it with garlic and added pepper only and paprika. I used a whole cup of mile and not a half. I did not add any salt and it was fine. And I like my salt. I mixed the cheese in with the soup which is something we always do as we don't like toppings. And I used extra potatoes an d could have used even more. It was terrific. I will make this many times."

However, the recipe does not call for seasoning the chops before you sear them and you should always season meat when searing it, especially in a recipe like this where there isn't a lot of flavor in the other ingredients. My husband used a blended seasoning for pork on the pork steak we used instead of chops. Also, added french fried onions on top when added the cheese. Yum!!"

When I seared the meat, I seasoned it with seasoning salt, pepper and paprika and added a 1/2 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce to the mushroom soup. The paprika gave it a nice golden hue when it was done. We lapped up the leftover gravy with bread after all the spuds and meat were gone. Thank you, I am a little too full now."

"reviewBody": "Loved it! I even used soy milk and dairy free cheddar. My pork got a little dry but I probably overcooked them on the stove. The second time I cooked it in the slow cooker and then baked it with the cheese to look pretty. The third time I put everything in the crock pot (chops still frozen) and it cooked all day- don't do that. It was way too liquidy. The pork chops should have been browned or at least thawed before going in the crockpot. My daughter's dairy free cheese doesn't melt nicely in the oven so I like to stir it in as things bake. Next time I'll stir in the cheese an hour before serving (using crock pot)."
