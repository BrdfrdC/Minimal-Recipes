I made a half recipe and this was more than enough for dinner for my husband and I - great heated for leftovers the next day for lunch! My wonton wrappers didn't always stick together when folded but the taste was great. I don't have a steam pot so I fried them to a crisp in the skillet, then added water to steam them. Excellent and they look impressive but I'm not likely to make these often due to the work involved. - Jan '23"

I then moved the mixture to a bowl and added the egg. They turned out amazing!! Soooo flavourful wowzers."

For some spice, I have added a cayenne to the meat mixture and saute post steaming in sriracha, soy, and sesame.

I added some grated carrot to the mixture. The only change I would make would be to reduce the amount of ginger a little as it seemed a tad too strong for me and I'd like to add a little more garlic next time, but my husband thought they were perfect. My recommendation to others would be to fill 1 wonton, boil, and taste first so you can adjust the seasonings as you want, or cook 1 tsp in a small pan to taste test. Great recipe that is simple and easy to make! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "The pork and chicken sausage turned into a greasy mess. Next time not going to add the sesame oil. Needed more salt. You really need to let the dumplings steam the full time and then some. Don't be tempted to open the lid. I still had to pan fry at the end. Even though I put a tiny amount per dumpling the pork still didn't cook all the au. Next time I'm thinking of frying the meat first and then putting it in the wonton wrapper. My kids love dumplings so I'll muster up the courage to try again."

Recipe yielded 12. Didn't take long as others have suggested. Browned pork w ginger root first, then baked. Used kale based cabbage. Nice change from my \"regular\" meals...will definitely make again, also as appetizers. Thank you!"

I made one modification and that was doing one tablespoon regular soy sauce and one reduced sodium however I will do it the ordinal way next time just to compare. I was genuinely surprised at how easy these were and dumplings are one of my favorite foods. seriously try this recipie!! Had a problem with folding them so I just did the wonton fold and it was perfect"

"reviewBody": "I omit soy sauce and egg, and use a tablespoon of kosher salt split. Cut cabbage and sprinkle two teaspoons of kosher salt on it and toss. Set aside and work on the filling while moisture is drawn out of cabbage. Once filling is complete, wring out cabbage and add to the filling. Two teaspoons of salt seems like a lot, but most will leave with the squeezed out moisture. Add last teaspoon of salt directly to the filling, or use less if you think it is too much salt. I use a piping bag and spray bottle of water to fill and wet the wrappers. I do 9 to 12 wontons at a time. I moisten them all at once with the spray bottle, and then fill and seal. Once sealed, I moisten the outside with the spray bottle, and give each 3 to 6 pleats. I mist finished ones every so often until they make it to the freezer. I cook them directly from frozen. I use a nonstick pan with lid. Place 3/4 to 1 cup of water in the bottom of the pan, and drizzle a tablespoon or two of oil in as well. Put frozen dumplings in the pan and place the lid on tightly. Cook on med-high heat until all the water has boiled off (it will boil off even if lid is tight). Once the water has almost all boiled off, remove the lid and turn down to med-low or low heat until bottom of dumpling are brown and crisp. If you want more sides crisp (mine have 3 sides), flip them. With my assembly line method I can do a whole batch in about an hour, and it makes a BIG bag for freezer."

They came out very nicely (I added chopped cilantro and minced carrots to the mix to up the nutrient value and flavor). This was my first time making dumplings at home so I followed the recipe closely. I'm pleased with the outcome and thought they tasted just like Chinese takeout. \n\nFor added flavor, I also made a dipping sauce of reduced sodium soy sauce, a teaspoon of toasted sesame oil, red pepper flakes, and a squeeze or two of honey. I let that settle while I made the dumplings. It was a perfect match!"

I used Shanghai Bok Choy, they were really tiny &amp; very tender. I cut off the stems &amp; discarded them, as I only wanted the leaves for this one. I kept the folded dumplings under a damp paper towel as well as the wrappers that were waiting for folding. Apparently, it's important to keep them from drying out. For a first time effort, I was very pleased."

Also, if I have a little more time, I make the mixture the night before, mix well and leave it covered overnight in the frig. FABULOUS!!!!!"

I made them for a party of about 30 people. I made them ahead of time. And thank God I did. The. I made the mixture and let it sit for a few hours to let the cabbage soften. Then stuffed them. I put them on a sheet pan and froze them. When frozen I moved them to a zip lock bag in the freezer. They are very time consuming. But so worth it! The day of the party I would put about 8 in a pot of boiling salted water. Then cook till they floated and a little extra. I couldn't make them fast enough. My husband and brother took over cooking so that I could do other things. But we had two pots going and still not fast enough. I wish I had another way to make them faster or ahead of time. But you don't want them to dry out. They should be moist."
