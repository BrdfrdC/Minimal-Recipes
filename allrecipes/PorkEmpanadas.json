"reviewBody": "I've made this recipe several times now. My only adjustments are scaling up and using a slow cooker. I usually get big pork shoulder from Costco so I double or triple the recipe. I get the best flavor if I mix together the seasonings and then rub it around the outside of the roast before placing in the crock pot. I bag the finished shredded meat into smaller portions to freeze for future use. I weigh my balls of dough to get uniform sizes then use my cast iron tortilla press lined with plastic bag to get perfect circles every time. I agree that the empanadas turn out dry when baked but when I deep fry they turn out perfectly moist (pan-frying produced uneven doneness). I prefer to make lots of empanadas at once and then bag and freeze meal sized portions. I don't thaw before frying. The meat also works well for green enchiladas and tacos."

I made wet burritos once and another time diced the pork instead and used it as a pasta sauce. I used extra onion, reduced the sauce, and used my immersion blender. The extra onion (well carmelized) once blended thickens the sauce without tasting like onions or needing flour, cornstarch, etc. My friends didn't know it was the same recipe used in a different way."

They were, however, very dry. I tried doubling the salsa..but still found them to be rather dry. I will make them again, but next time I'll brown the roast and cook it in a crock pot. I also doubled the dough ingredients and made the balls a little bigger. That way, when I rolled them out to about 4\", I could trim the edges before rolling them the rest of the way. This helped keep them from tearing and made nice even circles."

Next time I'll probably double the pastry dough recipe since I got 16 balls that ended up much too thin and tended to tear when the empanadas were shaped. DH also wants to try them with the meat filling from the Puerto Rican Meat Patties recipe on this site."
