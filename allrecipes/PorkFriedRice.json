I did make several changes however - I used 1 package of omnipork (plant-based product) instead of pork, added about 1/2 cup of veggies instead of 1/4 cup, and used sesame oil instead of butter to the wok to start. I didn't have any powdered ginger, so used fresh grated ginger (about 3/4 tsp). It tasted amazing. It was a bit salty however due to the soy sauce. If you are looking for less salty, change the soy to light soy."

Still came out really good. So simple to make."

BTW the cooked rice I used was cooked in Veg. broth which gave it an extra zing. Thanks"

"reviewBody": "I make this all the time! It is a five star recipe exactly as is, but I will share some things I do sometimes to change it up/make it easier. I always use at least day old rice. I also always use frozen mixed veggies (corn, green beans, carrots, peas). Soooo easy. I use whatever protein I have on hand (chicken, pork, sausage, steak, sometimes just extra eggs). For the addition of eggs, I make an omelette into which I grate fresh ginger (kept in the freezer) and garlic. Like I said, I have made it many times just as stated and it is superb. I thank this recipe for helping me to realize that I can successfully make delicious fried rice at home!"

"reviewBody": "Flawless recipe for those who like the original recipe, but I had to adjust it for three leftover barbecue pork chops and nearly half a saucepan of leftover rice. We had frozen peas and broccoli in the freezer. It needed much more than the suggested garlic and ginger powder. I threw in nearly as much fish sauce, and a tablespoon of szechuan peppercorn powder and, seriously, 4 tablespoons of Chinese Hot Oil. It wasn't very spicy at all, but seriously umami. It was so easy that I will continue to buy pork chops in bulk and, three days later, make this. Next time I will toss in Hunan chilis."

Maybe my family has weak taste buds, but I always double the quantity of the flavor-adding elements (onions, garlic powder, soy sauce etc. ). This is a great base recipe though and I can see how you can add a whole host of different proteins and vegetables in (I used shrimp). I will definitely make it again."

I also seasoned the pork before cooking. I used fresh minced onion, which totally worked, because I wasn't running to the store for a few green onions. I could see that being a nice addition to the dish. Finally, wasn't going wait for the rice to chill - it went in hot. Still good!"

Scrambled 2 eggs &amp; cooked flat, then cut into thin strips. Sauteed diced carrots, onion, garlic, broccoli &amp; 1/2 tsp ginger powder in 1 T butter + 1 T veg oil + 1/2 tsp. sesame oil until veggies were tender crisp. Added diced pork tenderloin + 1/2 cup frozen peas, stirred until heated thru. Added pre-cooked eggs, , 3 T soy sauce + 1 T hoisin sauce &amp; stirred until heated thru. Delish! Hubby and I both loved it! Will definitely make again!"

The other addition was a shot of oyster sauce which gave a sweet background flavor to what could have been a bit of a bland recipe. Oh, and frozen precooked shrimp topped off the meal. I fried them with the veggies and my wife asked for seconds, the real indication of success."
