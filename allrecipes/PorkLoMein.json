It all went quickly, first empty dish. I brought sriracha, oyster sauce and teriyaki in separate containments for garnish. Turned out silky smooth. I used spaghetti noodles, all i had. It doesn't seem at first there will be enough sauce but it is perfect! This is my new go to, I choke easily while eating because of a condition so i chopped everything very small on purpose, didn't have snap peas either."

Makes a large amount, more like 6 servings. Served over whole wheat spaghetti to up the health factor. Need to start early because it takes some time to do all the chopping. Will definitely make again!"

Didn't have mushrooms on hand, but used pea pods, sweet onion and red pepper.\nI will make it again with changes noted."

To sweeten it up, I used a sweet chili sauce lightly over the top, maybe 3 or 4 tablespoons, and mixed it up. Turned out okay. I think I am just going to stick with the stir fry sauce from the Asian food section."

Additionally, I added tofu and eggs into the lo mein along with the pork and other ingredients. End result was a dinner that tasted so much better than anything out of a restaurant!"

I skipped the snap peas &amp; sweet onion bc I did not have any on hand. The sauce mixture is a definite keeper! Even with all these ingredients, I did not have to double the sauce. I did add a 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes to the sauce. One key is to keep the veg slices about the same size so they cook uniformly, and you get many flavors on a fork full.\nI usually discourage my husband from going back for seconds, but this one is so full of nutrition, I encouraged him to go back for thirds! AND we still have enough for lunch tomorrow. I would definitely make this again and again."

I stir-fried the thinly sliced pork first in the canola oil (you don't need 2 Tbs of oil; use about 2 tsps.) and took it from the wok and kept it warm in foil. I also removed any extra liquid from the wok after removing the pork.\n\nThen stir-fry the snap peas, onions and red pepper for a few minutes. Then add the garlic mushrooms and ginger so the mushrooms don't cook as long and get over done. When the veggies are crisp tender, add the pork back in and then add the sauce. \n\nMy husband and son really liked it, too,"

Slightly varied the order...cooked onion and mushroom first, then added snap peas, then broccoli and red pepper, and pork, as I was using leftover pork tenderloin, already cooked. I thought the amount of sauce was adequate, but I did use less pasta. Next time I will try honey in place of sugar and add a sprinkle of Cajun seasoning. Yum."

"reviewBody": "If anyone in the US knows great Chinese food, it's New Yorkers, of which I proudly count myself. And this native New Yorker can tell you, this is hands-down the best lo mein I ever put in my mouth! The only changes I made are very minor. No red bell pepper because I'm allergic, and used pork, chicken, and shrimp in place of only pork (making this my own version of \"house lo mein\".) The flavor lingers pleasantly on the palate, and the sauce enrobes the linguine gently with no trace of gloopiness. Just the right hint of sweetness, not overpowering as so many are. It really doesn't matter what protein you use. The sauce is a symphony of taste, which elevates anything you choose to feature. In my case, said choice was dictated by what was in my fridge. For the pork, I diced up 2 small boneless chops. Loved the liberal use of mushrooms. Bamboo shoots and/or water chestnuts could be successfully added, as well. This recipe needs no tinkering, however, to ensure a virtuosic blend of flavors. Phenomenal!"

That being said, it was good and the only real complaint I have is that this is a lot of food for even my largest skillet. The meat took longer than 2 minutes even though I added it to the peas and onions prior to the rest of the veggies. The peas got overdone trying to finish the meat and not only lost that nice fresh green color, they started to fall apart. I would make this again but I would cook the meat first until no longer pink and then add the rest. My only change was that I used white wine vinegar since I didn't have rice vinegar and ground ginger instead of fresh."
