I was a little worried about the amount of soy sauce, thinking it would be too salty. I was proven wrong! So tender, so delicious - even my picky eater ate it! Thanks so much! For the photo: I covered one in the sautéed onions and the other I tried to clean off (again, picky eaters!)"

After I placed in the pork steaks as big as they were, I cooked them 10 minutes on each side , then I place them in the oven on 350 for a few minutes. Boy did they come out tender and delicious. I served them with spinach, macaroni and cheese with dinner rolls. This recipe will be made again. I love it."

"reviewBody": "I really enjoyed this!! Thank you. I didn't have soy sauce and I looked at a few other people's things they did to change it. I melted butter put in 1 clove of minced garlic and added the pork steaks, I put a little worchestershire sauce on the steaks then added some yellow, green and red peppers on the sides as well as the green onion and inused yellow onion as well. When I flipped them I added some Worcestershire sauce on that side too. Then I added some salt and pepper and some Mrs dash garlic and herb seasoning around the sides on the veggies. When it came time to take off the lid and cook another 10 min. I flipped the steaks again. (In a separate pan I made my fresh green beans with onions and then added the rest of the peppers I had cut up (just in case they didn't taste good on the pork steak side) I do not eat much pork and I definitely don't like cooking it because I get scared I will under cook it. My parents gave me two huge porksteaks they got from my grandpa's butcher so I had to try it out. This is gonna be a great meal to keep my blood sugar low! I loved your directions, Thebtimes plus the temperature directions. I found a thermometer that worked ...pulled it off at lime 150 degrees f....and I can't believe it came out so delicious. I wish I had soy sauce but I loved it how I made it anyway, so, its versatile. thank you so much for your recipe!!! My husband doesn't really like pork and he ate all of his too!!"

I followed the exact recipe except I dredged the steaks in flour as suggested by the other reviewers. I think I used a too high temperature since the green onions looked a bit dark, and the steaks were done in less time than suggested. I had two large steaks and did not alter the other ingredients. I will cut back on the butter next time. I think one ounce would be enough. And, I'll cook at a less than medium temperature."

Worcestershire sauce, 1/4 c. red wine in ziplock bag &amp; added the steaks &amp; but in fridge overnight. Next evening, I sliced a med. large onion thinly &amp; lightly browned in 1/2 cube butter. Then I removed the onions, put the other 1/2 cube of butter in skillet, added the floured steaks to the butter to begin browning, adding the onions on top of steaks, then pouring the liquid the steaks had marinated in overnight, adding a bit more amino acids, a little water rinsing out the smallest amount of sweet chili sauce left in a bottle. Covered &amp; cooked over med. heat for about 10 min. Uncovered, turned steaks over &amp; covered, cooked additional 10 min. Took temp. &amp; well done steaks were served with baked potatoes, skillet juices over the potatoes, applesauce, corn. Very delicious!"

It was delicious and even my two young kids and hard to please husband gobbled it up without complaint. I only had two steaks instead of the 6 recommended, but kept the other ingredients the same. This gave us a good amount for gravy/sauce. Since I didn’t have green onions I substituted half a sweet onion, diced, and I did add a splash of Worcestershire sauce. Served with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. This recipe is definitely a keeper."

I basically used it as a base having seasoned my chops with seasoned salt and black pepper first, then I prepared the sauce pretty much as it is written only eye balling it and adding more garlic, yellow onions, and fresh ginger. My family of six loved the recipe! No complaints at all and it was a simple dish! Will be adding it to our menu."

I dredged them it flour that was seasoned with paprika and seasoned salt. I think that helped it have a gravy like consistency. I also marinated them in buttermilk for an hour then dredged it directly in the flour, no drying off. This is definitely my go to recipe!"

This last time I made it though, I realized a little too late that I did not have soy sauce :( so I cooked the pork the same way except with double the butter and I coated the pork in flour with seasoning (as another commenter mentioned). I took out the pork steaks once done and added 1/4 cup of marsala wine (the only thing I had) to the same pan with 1/2 cup of heavy cream. It came out tasting like an onion sauce so it was good alternative."

I made the following changes: 1) I did not have green onions so used a regular white onion. 2) I used low sodium soy sauce, and 3) I used half butter, half olive oil. I used 1 whole onion for 2 steaks and wished I had double the onions, they tasted wonderful having caramelized in the oil. The recipe is easy, quick, and the pork came out tender and with good flavors , it may be a bit too salty for me if I used regular soy sauce but that's just personal taste. Thanks for sharing the recipe."

Cooked these in a heavy stainless steel pan. Watch closely as heat needs to be adjusted so pork cooks through and doesn't burn."

I think this would work much better if the soy was diluted, at least by a third, with water and also to add a bit of sweetness to it, like a couple table spoons full of agave. Had too much of a none note flavor (soy) to where I didn't even taste the onions. The steak was pretty tender though - I was surprised."

"reviewBody": "I bought some pork shoulder blade steak on sale the other day and was looking for a recipe when I came across this. After reading all the reviews, I decided to try it out with a few adjustments: I doubled the butter and soy sauce, substituted a small purple onion for the green onion because that’s what I had at the house, plus I added 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce, 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar, and about a tablespoon of sugar. After sautéing the onion and garlic in the butter, I added the remaining ingredients (minus the pork) and let simmer for about two minutes. Then I poured the sauce over the pork in a baking dish and baked for 45 minuets at 350. When the pork was done I poured the remaining liquid back into the sauce pan and let it reduce before adding some cornstarch and making it a gravy that I topped each pork shoulder blade steak with before serving. I paired it with rice (which everyone chose to top with gravy) and sweet corn. It was a big hit at my dinner table and I will definitely be making it again."
