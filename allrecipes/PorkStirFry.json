I didn't have a hot red pepper so I just sprinkled some red pepper flakes in when the ingredient was called for and it worked fine. Those were the only changes I made and it's definitely a keeper. Served over brown rice which made it a heartier meal, have plenty of leftovers."

A stir fry without oyster sauce ...is simply not Asian! \n2. Up the ginger to a tablespoon! You can‚Äôt go wrong with more ginger. \n3. Add shallots...also a key part of Asian cooking"

The steps were easy to follow, and we're all looking forward to when I make it again - even the one person in the house who doesn't like peppers!"

Then I scooped out the shrimp so it didn‚Äôt over cook and threw carrots, green beans, and cauliflower in the buttery garlic goodness and let them cooked all together for like 20 minutes. Then I cooked sticky rice in another pan. (Which is super easy.) And our the soy sauce and white rice vinegar in the vegetable mix. It went great!"
