"reviewBody": "Here's what I did. I added all the ingredients to a crock pot (minus the oil). I cut up chicken and pork in larger than bite size pieces and cooked on low for 6 hours. 20 minutes before serving, I made a delicious veggie Pancit and using a strainer spoon, dished the protein on top of the pancit. You can add the sauce to the pancit but because my pancit is so good, I didn't need to. Anyway, the chicken and pork turned out amazing. And maybe because I cooked it this way, it wasn't as salty as everyone else's review."

"reviewBody": "Too salty really. I am Filipino and this is something that might help everyone... dont knock it till you taste it because it will be good... \n-- same amounts of pork and chicken\n-- mix the ratio of vinegar and soy with 1:1 meaning one cup soy one cup vinegar\n-- do not crack the bay leaf... just put two whole bay leaves with pepper corn in it...\n-- now here's the kicker... with all the ingredients together with 2 cloves of smashed garlic, soy, vinegar, the pepper and the bay leaf, add a tea spoon of Worcestershire on it... then shove it all into a pressure cooker\n-- cook for 20 minutes and take it out... drain the meat from the sauce.. pick up the oil residue and put in a frying pan. Fry all the meats (Pork and Chicken) till tender and dry... Serve in a deep sauce pan and pour all the Sauce... This will taste great"

"reviewBody": "I'm part Filipino and this recipe needs several changes. It's an easy dish to prepare and cooks in under an hour. For pork adobo, I usually use pork loin steaks, sliced or not. Brown pork in a skillet on medium high heat til nearly done. I've never needed oil to brown the meat. In a small bowl, mix 1/3 cup soy sauce, 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar and 1 2/3 cups water. Pour over browned meat. Season generously with garlic powder or granulated garlic. Add 2 bay leaves to the sauce. Cook uncovered on medium to medium high heat. The sauce will cook at a slow steady boil, and the flavor will absorb into the meat. You can save a little sauce or let the sauce evaporate. I usually save a little sauce for the meat and steamed white rice. No need to use rub on meat. Do not add salt or pepper - it will be TOO salty! And no need to marinate. Chicken adobo is another recipe. Prepared correctly, adobo is a 5 star recipe! Family and friends devour it!"
