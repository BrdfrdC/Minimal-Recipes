"reviewBody": "This recipe is awesome! Call it my “work time pancit.” I’ve started working out again, and I was very hungry! While working from home, I was able to make the sauce, soak the noodles and chop the veggies on various visits to my kitchen for tea. I love the way the noodles are lightly cooked in the pan before the meat and vegetables. It kept them white and al dente in the finished dish. They also took up a delicious taste of the sesame and almond oil I used (I think peanut sauce is recommended; in any case, it gives the noodles great flavor to lightly fry them in a little oil and separate them at the same time). I used ground pork, frozen shrimp, green beans (fresh string beans, cut into 1” lengths), carrots, green onions and bean sprouts. Fabulous! This will be my new go-to meal, and I finally get to use the four packs of Super Q Golden Bihon noodles I bought. You only need one stick of noodles for a huge, delicious bowl that would serve a hungry family of four. I’m just one person; I’m looking forward to the left overs, soaking in that delicious sauce! Note: I broke up the noodles before soaking them in water, and also cut them with clean kitchen shears as I took them out of the pan. I also used an electric skillet for the whole thing. I put a little lemon juice in my serving, as recommended. Thanks so much for this recipe! Happy happy."

"reviewBody": "Wow! Pancit is an excellent fit into our diet. Bok choy, the small white stem kind, is often found in our fridge. We thin sliced it. I need to be gluten free so rice noodles, Asian sauces, and spices are common items in our pantry. We found the sauce to be perfectly balanced as listed. We doubled it like most everyone else. We thought the stir fry and set aside on the noodles a good idea and will try it out on several other recipes. We have found rice noodle cooking time can vary so checking after 10 minutes steep could save you from a sticky mess. Meat and veggies will reflect stock on hand in the future, but pork and shrimp was excellent. Pancit dishes will easily become a two or three times a month meal at our house. Wow!"

I don't know if those 2 ingredients would be used in Philippine cuisine, buying think they would make the dish even better. I was okay with the texture of the noodles but my husband thought they were too mushy. Next time we might try less soaking and more sautéing to get a crunchier or firmer texture. Still an enjoyable meal as is!"

"reviewBody": "This is a fantastic recipe for pancit. I have been using it for about 4 years now. The oyster sauce gives it a really nice flavor, and this dish tastes just like my favorite rice noodle dish at the local Asian buffet. I have tried the pancit recipes that just use soy sauce when I had run out of oyster sauce and they are not good at all, not even close to restaurant quality as this one is. I have fed this to a well-rounded group from rural Texan and Los Angeles Californian to Korean and it apparently appeals to popular taste. Regarding comments on whether its authentic, no two people cook exactly alike even if they are from the same country, and who cares anyway! It tastes good!"

I also added a few diced carrots; I used frozen carrots; giving the dish a little more contrast in color.

Also had no chicken so did all shrimp. My husband stirred some peanut butter into his bowl and added some peanuts on the top. Excellent recipe! Thanks!"

For the pork ingredient, I used some of a pork butt that I cooked yesterday. The shrimp were added last and brought up to temperature. I will be making this one again. Lucky for me I have plenty of the necessaries on hand!"

Granted, the Filipino women I work with make it so much better but I was really pleased with the results the first time cooking it! I didn't use pork, only shrimp. I also used cabbage instead of bok choy.. I'm not a big fan of bok choy. I think cabbage tastes much better. Id recommend breaking the noodles in half before soaking (they have the tendency to stick together) and it needed a little soy sauce in my opinion but otherwise it was great!"

"reviewBody": "Really great recipe -- my boyfriend's favorite. I use rice vermicelli, fresh ginger, and chicken instead of pork, and I like snow pea pods for the crunch. I've also started stir-frying the meats in one TBSP chili paste, 1/2 TBSP soy sauce, and 1 TBSP canola oil first. Then, I nix the crushed red pepper flakes because the spicy meats make the entire dish much hotter. Sometimes I use bok choy but I've also used a half head of regular cabbage and it turns out fine. This is one of those recipes you cannot screw up, I promise! I even stopped measuring out my ingredients and we just add to-taste, particularly with the oyster sauce. We love the rich flavor of this simple dish!"

Didn't have already-cooked chicken, so I marinated the chicken in 2 TBSP soy sauce, 2 TBS Fish Sauce and a pinch of brown sugar about an hour ahead of time. Didn't have oyster sauce, so used the chicken marinade instead, and added about a TBSP more soy to the dish at the end. Used cabbage instead of Bok Choy, as that is what I had on hand. Left out the red pepper to see if my kid would eat it, and she LOVED it (9 years old). Hubs and I added red pepper to our own bowls. Superb!"

Also, if you are going to serve the meat ect with rice don't call it pancit....pancit literally means noodles."

Also added more garlic, and a little bit of honey, fish sauce, hot sauce, white pepper, and rice wine vinegar at the end to punch up the flavor of the sauce. I also just stirred the noodles in with everything else. That way they absorb the flavors better. I couldn't believe I had made something so tasty. It tastes like something from a restaurant.

"reviewBody": "After having tried this at a friends home I was in love. Her father-in-law is from panama and makes pancit (prounounced ponsit by them) regularly. I have always wanted to try it but never seemed to be able to get the recipe from them. After seeing this I was elated. The five star rating is for the recipe and idea however I did make changes after talking with my friend. I used chopped pork and small shrimp which I sauted in oil with a shallot and chopped garlic. I added the oyster sauce, some soy sauce and the chicken broth and ginger into the pan as well. Then instead of Bok Choy I bought a bag of cole slaw mix (chopped cabbage and carrot) and added 1/2 of that. I had soaked the rice noodles for ten minutes per package directions then drained and added to the pan as well. Everthing then simmered together for about 15-20 min. and served. This was delicious. I'm afraid my noodles wernt as soft as I would have liked which may be because the package said soak for 10 min and the recipe for 20 min. I will soak for the longer time next time I make it and hope they get a little softer upon sitting in the mix. This made alot and I will have enough for another meal easily. I did double the liquid ingrediants and used a whole can of the chicken broth (as well as several Tsp of soy sauce) to keep the moistness in and it still was not soupy or wet but had great flavor. Thanks for a great base Rayna!"

I did add snow peas and matchstick carrots, and I doubled the oyster sauce and broth. Despite the noodle problem, this was absolutely delicious! My husband had 3 servings. THREE!
