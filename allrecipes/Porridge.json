I was freaking out that it wouldn’t work without bananas because I realized I didn’t have them, but any fruit works just fine (I used apples). It was warm and ooey-gooey and just altogether delicious! My mom, sister and me ate it gladly. 10/10 would recommend, I’ll be making it again soon!!!"

I used a whole teaspoon of cinnamon. I added the golden raisins/sultanas as the submitter suggested, and they were a nice addition. I topped with almond milk."

"reviewBody": "I used brown instead of white sugar and apples instead of bananas for an apple cinnamon flavoured porridge. It turned out pretty well but I have to say this: do NOT put salt in this!!! Nix the salt completely unless you're going for a savoury dish. The salt very nearly RUINED my porridge but I managed to make it palatable by adding heaps more sugar. In short, this recipe should be: 1 part oats to 2.5 parts water plus any flavouring you want. Heat and mix."

I did not care for the texture of the bananas cooked into the porridge. They were a little too mushy for my personal preference. I would make this again, but, add some dried fruit and nuts instead next time."

I added some brown sugar and that made a bit of difference but it still needed something. I dont think it tasted like porridge just bananas. Over all this recipe would be good for people that like the hot banana taste."

I found I needed to add more cinnamon to this and poured honey over it too or it would have been bland. I also used sultanas instead of bananas as the one I had previously had sultanas. Not a very exciting recipe but not bad either"
