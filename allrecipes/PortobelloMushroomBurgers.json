I lead with that because I want the reader to understand that the point of view here is not a vegan. I am looking for recipes to fill those gaps where I would normally eat meat. So someone who is more removed from eating meat may enjoy this more. Also I followed the recipe (stop reviewing recipes after you change the recipe!!!) So there is no tips for changes. I found the texture of the mushroom very off putting on a sandwich. Keep in mind that the caps I used were stupidly huge. The marinade was ok but too vinegary for my taste. It kind of overwhelmed the flavor. I did make it with all the traditional toppings like tomato, onion, pickle, mustard, and light mayo. This gave it a \"traditional\" feel but it just wasn't enough to cover the mushroom. I'm still giving 4 stars because my opinion may differ from everyone else. Just be warned if you are use to eating big juicy hand made thick burgers, this will not be a replacement."

Carmelized vidalia onion and topped off the burger with smoked applewood gouda. \n\nAlso used some lobster claw meat which, after cleaning, dropped into drawn butter with fresh tarragon, which I then topped the burger with for an open face burger.\n\nA bit more intensive, but worth the effort. Effort is always rewarded."

I wouldn't call it a burger because it didn't have to imitate anything - It stood alone on it's own merit! I'm eating the left over for lunch."

Concerned that the garlic might be too much, so added just a little less, but barely tasted it (the minced garlic stays on top of the gills, so adding the cheese smoothed out the flavor). Grilled with gill side down first, then after turning, added blue cheese during last two minutes - very good."

I loved it. Made just as directed and assemble as I would a beef burger. I wouldn't change a thing. I would have this rather than beef."

Unfortunately that didn’t cross my mind until after we were eating, seeing as it wasn’t a meat patty. So the thickest mushroom wasn’t totally tender through. Delicious regardless! Wonderful marinade that perfectly complemented the mushroom!"

I have fallen in love with this recipe! What really caught my eyes is the calories, so I slimmed down the vinegar, oil, and spices. Still perfect though! I would recommend this and will definitely try again! I got more Portobella Mushrooms and ready! Frying pans work just as well! What to remember is that they SHRINK, which is upsetting. When I was first starting, I cut it in half, I didn't want them to shrink! Also, minutes way too long for the flat slide, that's where I stored the garlic. They started to burn, so-. All in all, five stars!"

Enter this fantastic mushroom burger...it's the messiness and dripping!!!! I have had many portobello burgers before, but this one was the best. Great texture, taste and perfect amount of juiciness. \n\nI used a grill pan and a cover, it worded perfectly. I used cheddar as the cheese and followed another reviewer and grilled onion slices to go along with it. My mushroom caps were very large, so I split it in half for my daughter and myself. Now we have the other one for tonight! I will try to find smaller ones next time, though. \n\nThank you for this fantastic recipe! I will make it quite often."

Once that prep was done, everything else toòk no time.\n\nPerhaps my ratios were off, but I just didn't like the marinade. The vinegar was too strong, and even the next day for lunch I was vomiting from the strong taste.\n\nOtherwise, I loved it &amp; plan to make it again."

Used fresh herbs and broiled for 5 minutes on each side (along with some sliced red onion marinated in the same sauce). The only critique is on myself: don't make/assemble the burger until the last minute. The mushroom is so juicy that the burger will fall apart and need to be eaten with a fork and knife. Thanks for an excellent recipe!"

It's absolutely delicious, although I do find that my burger ends up being a tiny bit watery from the marinade. I don't know if anyone else has found a solution to this. However, this is the best veggie burger recipe that I've found yet. I highly recommend it."
