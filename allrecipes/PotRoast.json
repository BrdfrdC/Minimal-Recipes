I seasoned with salt, pepper, lots of garlic powder and onion powder on both sides. I also sprinkled on a little bit of rosemary. I did not add carrots and potatoes until the last hour, otherwise they are too soft and mushy. I cooked a 2.75 lb chuck roast at 325 for 3 1/2 hrs. The meat shredded perfectly. Will definitely make again."

I also browned the whole roast before cooking. Absolutely perfect! Moist, tender, and flavorful.\nThe gravy was delightful with lots of flavor, very smooth, and I didn't have to adjust the seasonings for the roast. A new family favorite!"

Next time I will doctor it up a bit with a pinch of this and a dash of that to add a bit more flavor. I think maybe dusting the meat with flour and searing all sides prior to putting it in the oven would benefit both the meat and the gravy."

I highly recommend this recipe. My boyfriend said it's one of the best meals he's ever eaten."

Cooked for about 1.5 hours at 350. Came out delicious. Definitely will make again. Appreciated all of the helpful comments from others!"

I roasted my chuck roast seasoned with pepper only without a cover for the first hour, turning the roast at the half hour mark; this browned the meat nicely. (no salt..beef has plenty of natural salt in the muscle) Then I add the onion, celery and double the carrots with broth and wine to finish for the remaining 2 hours. We like mashed potatoes so I don't use potatoes in the roast. I also roast a whole bulb of garlic separately in foil drizzled with EVOO to add to the potatoes (and a few in the gravy!) the last hour. WoW..what a meal."

"reviewBody": "I agree with some other raters that the roast has to be browned first. This was definitely lacking in flavor and the large amount of corn starch made the gravy a really funky consistency. Would also use beef or chicken broth instead of water. My 1 3/4 pound roast was into the 180 degree range at 2:45. I would start the gravy with a flour/fat roux browned in the sauce pan before adding the de-fatted cooking liquid. That way you can do away with the corn starch altogether."

Also, I increased the amount of vegetables and spices. The juice/broth was so tasty I didn't feel the need to add cornstarch or flour to make gravy. This is a great versatile recipe. Thank you!"

I only had potatoes so that was it! I seasoned it with garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper. After 2hrs and 10 minutes in the oven at 300 it was well done but still so tender! I made the gravy by just pouring the beef broth in a sauce pan and using 4 tbs of corn starch and a 1/2 cup of cold water. We served it with broccoli. It was amazing! Every one loved it."

"reviewBody": "Good recipe. I usually make my pot roasts in my slow cooker, but I grew up with it always being made in the oven, and sometimes I miss the crustier roast beef that you get in the oven, so I tried this last night. We are a family of five, two of whom are teenage boys, who very much love their meat and potatoes. So I doubled the weight of the roast beef, as well as doubled the amount of potatoes and carrots used. I kept the onion, celery, and water the same, and eyeballed the seasonings, adding some to the veggies as well as the meat. I also added a bit more of the seasoning to the gravy, as well as added some bouillon. We enjoyed this very much, but there are a few things I will change next time: I will season and braise the meat before adding to the roasting pan. This helps get the flavor into the meat, as well as produce that crust I love. I will triple the amount of carrots (we love carrots!) I will use beef broth instead of water, and reduce the amount to two cups, adding an additional cup when I make the gravy, if needed. The veggies got a bit too mushy for my taste, and I think it was because there was too much liquid. I will make my gravy with flour rather than cornstarch. This is just a personal preference. I was raised on flour gravy, and I just like it better."
