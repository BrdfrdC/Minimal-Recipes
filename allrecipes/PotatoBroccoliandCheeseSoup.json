I also cooked the broccoli with the potatoes because it was quicker and saved an extra step. I wanted to add more protein, so I cooked a cut up chicken breast in a pan and added it just before the cheese was melted. I'm sure the recipe would be great the way it was posted, I was just going to utilize things I already had in the house so I didn't have to go to the store."

I also just cooked all the stuff together since I had defrosted some broccoli and it was already soft. I used an immersion blender to blend part of it. Also added some sour cream to make it a bit creamier. It was definitely a hot in our home and my twins loved it, they're 1 year 8 months and asked for more."

I sautéed garlic and 1 cube of chicken bouillon in butter with a dash of pepper added the potatoes to cook for a few minutes then added the water. After cooking the potatoes halfway I added the cauliflower and broccoli and brought to a boil. Lowered burner to simmer for 25 mins until potatoes soften. I put all the potatoes and cauliflower in a blender and puréed. I separated the leftover broth and broccoli. I added the puréed potatoes and cauliflower in with broccoli and slowly added the broth to the soup consistency I wanted. It came out really good!! Next time I will use less bouillon to reduce sodium or chicken broth."

"reviewBody": "This soup was amazing! I did it a little differently though so I guess hard to say for sure this soup recipe was perfect. I melted the margarine/butter and then added 3 stalks of chopped celery, the onion, the broccoli, and potatoes and cooked for about 3 minutes. Then I added about 2 tbsp of flour to coat. Then I added the water and bouillon cubes and I added 2 tsp turmeric and cooked for another 2 minutes and I scooped out the broccoli florets. After about 15 minutes I used a hand blender to blend the soup to a smooth texture and added 1 cup of milk. I let the soup return to a boil and added the cheese and stirred until the cheese was melted. I then added chopped green onion and the broccoli florets on top of the soup. Yum!"

The cheese that I stirred in clung to all the broccoli so I had yellowish chunks of broccoli that were chewy. Take the cooked vegetables out and place them into a pot of milk?"

Now in their 20's, they are making it for themselves. No changes needed.! This soup is easy to make and delicious. I prefer to shred my cheese over buying the pre shredded. It melts in better. I do tend to add a little extra broccoli in but that is the only change. I also bought an immersion blender after a bad episode where my blender leaked. So much easier!!!"

Three 4-in russets was plenty. Don't know how many pounds that is. Had 6 cups of chicken broth, so used that. Added the broccoli to the soup to cook for about 5 minutes, turning the heat back up. Used 2 cups of cheese, which was enough for us. My wife likes chunky soup, so I didn't puree it at all. Good blend of flavors and texture."

I cook the broccoli in the same pot as the potatoes and use an immersion blender to blend the soup to our level of preferred smoothness. I also use less cheese than the recipe, because we love it even without the extra calories. Generally, I don't even measure the cheese - just add and taste until it's \"enough\" for us. I've also frozen and reheated the leftovers at another time and it was good then too."

When the onions and carrots were soft I added several cloves of garlic chopped and sauteed two more minutes. Then I added 2 cups chicken broth, chopped fresh broccoli and simmered until the broccoli was soft. Then I added leftover mashed potatoes and cheese. I will make it often even if I don't have leftovers."

"reviewBody": "I added 12 ounces of bacon, chopped and fried, then cooked the onion in the bacon grease, omitting the margarine. Next time I will set the bacon aside to add to each dish because the cooking down of the potatoes made the bacon soft, which hubby didn't really care for. \n\nI just used a bag of frozen broccoli which I thawed out in place of a fresh bunch of broccoli. I added a teaspoon of minced garlic too, because I like it in my soups. Next time, I am not going to puree half of it because I like my soup chunkier so I think maybe a third or even a quarter of it instead. It gives it a nice chowder like consistency though. \n\nHubby loved it and went back for seconds, so I know I'll be asked to make it again!"

Like other reviewers I added the broccoli to the potatoes after about 10 of the 15 minutes of cooking time. I used an immersion blender to break up enough chunks to get the soup to the creaminess I wanted but still leaving some chunks behind. I only had about a cup of cheese, so that's all I used, and I had a little sour cream that was about to expire (~1/4 cup), so I threw that in too when I added the cheese. \n\nGreat, flexible recipe. The mister added Tabasco to his bowl. I tried it too and it's a delicious way to give it a little kick!"
