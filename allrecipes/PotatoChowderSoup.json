I've made various chowders and haven't seen that step before - great addition. Very easy to make."

I cooked the other vegetables in a large pot in olive oil with salt and pepper, you are going to need quite a bit of salt the potatoes absorb lots of it that is way many of you thought that it was bland. The milk Roux I thought was not enough when I poured it so I added a cup of cream that I heated up on the stove top and it came out great, I did not mix in the cheese that is for when I serve it into the bowls."

I used a packet of Simply Organic Chipotle Ranch dip mix, smoked paprika, dried parsley, and some other spices. I sautÃ©ed the onions, celery, carrots, and some garlic in the soup pot for a bit. Added the diced potatoes. Filled with one box of chicken broth. Topped that off with potato water, and cooked. I fried a pound of thick cut bacon in a saucepan in batches. Removed bacon. I put the flower in the bacon grease and cooked for a few minutes. I added milk, half and half, and chipotle dip mix. Added chopped bacon to potato mixture. Cooked the flour mixture until thick and smooth. Added that to the potato mixture, as well as 2 cups of shredded cheddar, and simmered until the crescent rolls were done. I served with chopped fresh parsley on top. Delish! Next time I think I'll add a couple of cans of baby clams. I will definitely make this again! Thanks for the recipe! Oh, this was the first time I ever made potato soup. I did not use butter, as I used the bacon fat instead."

Fat free milk used, and low-fat margarine, and cut back on amount of cheese, and used only 2 cups of a 2% fat Cheddar cheese, that is shredded. \n\nIt is an excellent chowder. One could leave out the cheese if desired."

While I was waiting for the vegetables to cook (and before I put on my milk and butter), I fried up 1/2 lb of spiral ham pieces that I had diced. After the ham pieces were done frying up, I removed them from the skillet onto a paper towel then poured the frozen corn into the skillet with no heat (just to defrost the corn) because I didn't have any canned corn in my pantry. It turned out just fine. After I added the milk mixture to my vegetables and added the cheese, I then added the corn and the ham pieces to the soup and it was perfect!"

"reviewBody": "A wonderful soup! I make this without celery and add a dash of \"liquid smoke\" (you can buy it at the grocery store in the cooking isle). I use veggie stock to boil the vegetables while I make a roux in a separate sauce pan: heat the butter, add the flour, then slowly add in the milk until it's a nice thick and creamy sauce-- then add in the cheddar and combine with the veggie stock mix. The whole family loves it and even my little ones will finish a whole cup (2, 4, &amp; 6yrs old). I serve it with some buttered french bread and a side salad. An easy dinner fit that heats up well for left-overs."

So I started with this as my base recipe and made a few changes. I added my normal seasoning of salt, pepper, garlic salt, celery salt and Lowrys. I cut back the corn to just one can and I also used a little less than 2 cups cheddar cheese. I sliced up and fried about 4 precooked style brat-sausages (like johnsonville) and I added them at the end, just to heat before serving. Unfortunately the sausages I had on hand were a spice anduoille sausage style and I think it could have been better with more of a traditional sausage or beer brat. Ham would have been good too."

When I made it I omitted the carrots and the celery because I had none and was snowed in so I couldn't go to the grocery to get any. Only thing the recipe wasn't clear if you should drain the water off the potatoes and onion once they are boiled. I did but after reading reviews that was an \"oops\" because apparently you're not supposed to. My soup was thick so I added a little more milk. I also added fresh garlic and some other seasonings. Perfect! Will repeat."

"reviewBody": "Very Yummy! I'm so stuffed from it right now! For more flavor, I cooked the veggies in fat-free low-sodium chicken broth, added some onion/herb seasoning blend and ground white pepper. I didn't use the full 2.5 Cups of cheese because it seemed like too much to me, but I bet it would've been fine, since I didn't drain the broth from the veggies. Regardless, 4 out of the 6 of us LOVED it. The youngest (4 &amp; 5 yrs) were OK with it and they are REALLY hard to please. Winner!"

I added some spices to my own portion but couldnt fix it much. I cant even see how chicken stock could make it better. I would definitely try a different recipe. Rated 2 stars instead of 1 because the potatoes were cooked the way I like them (very soft) and they were slightly flavorful."

The corn made the soup sweet and I imagine without adding the stuff I added, the original would have been very bland."

"reviewBody": "This soup got great reviews from everyone that was fortunate enough to get a spoonful! I used all chicken stock to cook the potatoes, it really did make amazing flavor. I also used much more potatoes and veggies, as I was really trying to maximize the recipe. Instead of 2 cans of corn, I took a previous reviewers advise and used one can of creamed corn and one regular (Del Monte Summer Crisp). I also used 1C 2% milk and 1C half and half in order to add to the creaminess of the chowder. I think the most important step was that I removed about 1/3 of the potatoes after they were cooked, as well as a handful of other veggies, blended them with an immersion blender, and added them back into the soup. It made a super amazing texture. I will be making this again, and am already taking requests from my family and coworkers for another batch!"

I would suggest starting the milk mixture about 10 minutes into the simmer and adding a bay leaf to the veggie pot. I ended up standing at the stove for ten minutes stirring because I didn't want globs in the soup. I also used chicken broth. Put the veggies in first (added a few cloves of garlic)and added chicken broth to cover. I cooked them for about 5 minutes or so--just until tender crisp. Then I added 6 medium potatoes and proceeded as written. Oh, and I forgot the cheddar cheese but it was great even without it! Thanks for sharing! (I plan on adding cooked chicken to it tomorrow.

What I love about it is that the ingredients don't have to be exact - for example, one potato yielded more than 2 cups chopped so I just threw it all in anyway. I also added two baked chicken breasts (unseasoned.) I'm not sure I got all the cheese because I grated it right in the pot and didn't bother measuring. After we had some, we decided it was still missing something. So I tossed in a capful of bacon bits and will probably add a little more cheese when I reheat it for lunch tomorrow. All in all, a great recipe considering it can be altered based on what you have available!"
