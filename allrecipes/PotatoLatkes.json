Tasted wonderful with the Beef Brisket I prepared too and wow!! Best dinner. I was going to take a photo with the sour cream and applesauce toppings but I ate it before I thought of it. I will be making these more often!! I highly recommend this recipe! Happy Hanukkah!"

Omitted the salt and baking powder, and cooked them in bacon fat. However, I did place the shredded/grated onion and potato, after squeezing out water, in the freezer for about 20/30 minutes. Then added rest of ingredients. They seem to cook up crunchier this way."

Consider adding less egg or more potato if you want something with more defined potato shred look. \n\nPersonally, the salt was *way* too much, and my friend ended up shredding in an extra potato and more egg to even the flavor out. Go easy on salt, guys.\n\nLastly, I like my food extra flavorful so I added more grated onion. Tasted awesome, smelled awesome. If you are cool with onion, you should try this. Go for 2-3 spoons versus just the 1."

I add a splash of buttermilk as well. For the taters I used a grater and them let them sit in cold, salted water while I got other stuff ready. I put them in a colander and let them 'drip' dry.\n\nFor a few spices beyond the basics, a bit of red pepper flakes, a little seasoning salt and for fun and texture, I ground up a couple of Ritz crackers. Just two as I didn't want them to over-power the texture.\nFor frying I used coconut oil."

These latkes can become dry while cooking because you squeeze out all the water out of the potatoes. You need to keep a little bit of water so the potatoes can be hydrated so the latkes can be moist and juicy. Also, DON't EVER SHRED OR GRATE POTATOES. Always dice or cut them into long thin strips for more flavor and better presentation!"

"reviewBody": "Hi there and thanks for the recipe Rachel.\n\nI'm in the UK and I get kind of mixed up with US/metric/imperial measurements but I've worked out how to make a brilliant Yorkshire pudding with equal quantities of egg/flour/milk (plus seasoning) and adapted your latke recipe to this, using onions grated by my trusty Ninja in place of milk. To every 3 egg mixture I add 4 medium/large-ish potatoes, peeled and grated (again in the Ninja.)\n\nI do the batter first (onions grated, then egg, flour, seasoning including a good squirt of garlic paste) and leave it to stand for at least an hour (like Yorkshire pudding) as this allows the flour to expand and blend with the rest of the liquids and prevent it from being stodgy.\n\nThen for the potatoes. Peel and zap them in the machine and tip into a bowl lined with a clean cloth. Draw up edges of cloth and wring them out. You'll get an alarming amount of brownish liquid out ...just keep wringing. Tip liquid away and in the cloth you'll find stuff that looks like cold mashed potatoes. Scrape out into batter mix and mix well. I add more salt at this stage as I love salt (naughty!)\n\nThen I follow your instructions though I just cover the bottom of the pan with oil, corn in my case, flatten gently and fry, turning when bottoms are brown ... ohh delish!\n\nThey freeze and heat up well too; did one on a sandwich press today with the sandwich.\n\nIf you leave out the onion and garlic they are Irish boxty, very good with butter and jam :)"

I used 2 slotted spoons to pick up a big mound and squeezed the egg liquid out before frying in 1/4 inch of corn oil. Crispy and deep golden on the outside and tender on the inside with just the right amount of onion. I did add some coarsely ground black pepper to the mixture, but otherwise made as directed. Served with sour cream or ketchup, they were the perfect side dish instead of the usual mashed or baked potato. I will be making and enjoying these for years to come!"

I only used 1 egg per 2 cups of grated potato (thanks to other reviewers). I also added a dash of baking powder. I also fried them in sunflower oil.

I mean, once a year I make latkes, maybe twice if I'm feeling sassy, b/c I feel so guilty when I devour them w/ sour cream and applesauce, but this recipe didn't do it enough for us for me to make them again anytime soon."
