I'll make it at home, a day or two before we meet up. That way it's done and I can enjoy my time with them instead of being in the RV cooking. My kids are not fans of real mayo, so I do use miracle whip, and sour pickles. My mother used them in just about everything that called for pickles."

Been making it so much I can almost make it without looking it up. ANY excuse to make it. It’s difficult for me to eat potato salad from anywhere else because I compare it to this. It’s also difficult to restrain myself from sneaking extra bites from it when it’s sitting in the fridge. Do yourself a favor and make this now. You almost have all the ingredients in your house already. Just don’t omit anything. Everything works so well together, from the pickles and mustard to the egg and celery and vinegar. Do it."

"reviewBody": "Due to the pandemic, I didn't have eggs, onion, or celery, and this STILL turned out wonderful! I scaled down the recipe to 6 servings, and I used 3 large russet potatoes. The amount of dressing that the 6 servings directions yield was perfect for 3 large russets. In place of the onion, I used onion powder (to taste) and in place of the celery I used celery seed (just a few shakes, because celery seed is potent). If you don't have celery seed, you could totally use celery salt (just reduce or omit the regular salt the recipe calls for). I also added a pinch of sugar per another reviewer, and it gave the potato salad that hint of sweetness that I love. This recipe is a keeper and I can't wait to try it again when I have all of the ingredients on hand. Oh! I also added a few shakes of paprika at the very end, when serving, for a pop of color and another dimension of flavor."

We added capers because hubby is fond of them. no time for hard-boiled eggs, so made it without. Just as good. Used sweet onion instead of red, again, because of supplies. Basically a wonderful recipe!"

I added an extra egg because I love finding hard boiled egg chunks in potato salad. I added the mayo and mustard without measuring (3 cups mayo = 24 oz (google conversion) and I had a 30 oz jar). When I finally mixed in the potatoes, I took my first taste. It was too good to mess with further. I’m a fan. It’s chilling in the fridge now."

At first, I thought it was too runny, but after sitting in the fridge for an hour, I stirred the mixture again, and the consistency was perfect. I will definitely be making this again!"

Most of the time was spent cutting the potatoes &amp; veggies. My advice is don't be shy with the salt in the water for the potatoes and when they are done and drained add plenty of salt too. I also used garlic aioli mustard which really took this recipe to the next level flavor-wise. This was a HUGE hit at the potluck. I saw people eating it by the plateful LITERALLY."

I did add about a teaspoon of garlic powder and used Guldens spicy brown mustard instead of yellow mustard. Everyone raved about the potato salad at the BBQ and my mom (who's the best chef I know) requested I make it for her birthday BBQ tomorrow."
