I'll make it at home, a day or two before we meet up. That way it's done and I can enjoy my time with them instead of being in the RV cooking. My kids are not fans of real mayo, so I do use miracle whip, and sour pickles. My mother used them in just about everything that called for pickles."

Been making it so much I can almost make it without looking it up. ANY excuse to make it. Itâ€™s difficult for me to eat potato salad from anywhere else because I compare it to this. Itâ€™s also difficult to restrain myself from sneaking extra bites from it when itâ€™s sitting in the fridge. Do yourself a favor and make this now. You almost have all the ingredients in your house already. Just donâ€™t omit anything. Everything works so well together, from the pickles and mustard to the egg and celery and vinegar. Do it."

"reviewBody": "Due to the pandemic, I didn't have eggs, onion, or celery, and this STILL turned out wonderful! I scaled down the recipe to 6 servings, and I used 3 large russet potatoes. The amount of dressing that the 6 servings directions yield was perfect for 3 large russets. In place of the onion, I used onion powder (to taste) and in place of the celery I used celery seed (just a few shakes, because celery seed is potent). If you don't have celery seed, you could totally use celery salt (just reduce or omit the regular salt the recipe calls for). I also added a pinch of sugar per another reviewer, and it gave the potato salad that hint of sweetness that I love. This recipe is a keeper and I can't wait to try it again when I have all of the ingredients on hand. Oh! I also added a few shakes of paprika at the very end, when serving, for a pop of color and another dimension of flavor."

We added capers because hubby is fond of them. no time for hard-boiled eggs, so made it without. Just as good. Used sweet onion instead of red, again, because of supplies. Basically a wonderful recipe!"

I added an extra egg because I love finding hard boiled egg chunks in potato salad. I added the mayo and mustard without measuring (3 cups mayo = 24 oz (google conversion) and I had a 30 oz jar). When I finally mixed in the potatoes, I took my first taste. It was too good to mess with further. Iâ€™m a fan. Itâ€™s chilling in the fridge now."

Most of the time was spent cutting the potatoes &amp; veggies. My advice is don't be shy with the salt in the water for the potatoes and when they are done and drained add plenty of salt too. I also used garlic aioli mustard which really took this recipe to the next level flavor-wise. This was a HUGE hit at the potluck. I saw people eating it by the plateful LITERALLY."

I did follow other's suggestions to pare back the amount of mayo to a little bit over 2 cups. I also used my mom's trick of grating the onion which was really easy and quick. I did add about a teaspoon of garlic powder and used Guldens spicy brown mustard instead of yellow mustard. Everyone raved about the potato salad at the BBQ and my mom (who's the best chef I know) requested I make it for her birthday BBQ tomorrow."
