I didn’t need to serve 40, so I halved all of the ingredients and added a little finely chopped celery. I will definitely make this again. It was delicious and used ingredients that I would keep on hand. This is a keeper!!"

My hubby &amp; father-in-law both said \"it's better than grandma's\"! I also added a little celery for a crunch &amp; extra color...green onions are a must (added about 5-6, mostly the green ends)!! I didn't quite measure all the salt/pepper, also added a smidge more mustard because it seemed really mayo-ey when I tried the sauce. **to anyone who has a hard time cooking potatoes perfectly (I always made them too mushy), a trick my mother-in-law taught me is to boil them with the skins on just until a fork can penetrate without too much force, then put them in the fridge for a bit to cool, peel and dice. I am tossing any other potato salad recipes I have as I will use this one ALL the time. ;o]"

"reviewBody": "I have been eating, and making, this type of potato salad since I met my husband 44 years ago. The only difference is we add some dill pickle juice to the mayonnaise mixture before adding it to the potatoes, eggs and green onions. My mother-in-law always used 5 pounds of red potatoes, one dozen eggs and close to two bunches of green onions (green parts only). The mayo-mustard, salt and pepper were never measured. I followed your recipe using 5 pounds of potato but added a lot more mustard than listed (I USED TWO TABLESPOONS, AS WE LIKE IT TO HAVE SOME ZIP). IT WAS FANTASTIC! I CAN NOW DUPLICATE THE TASTE EVERY TIME."
