I opted for a tiny bit of powdered garlic. It was very good. My only advice would be to keep an eye on them as they can burn quickly. Other than that, a dab of sour cream sounds good to me!"

I want to taste potatoes not flour. I added a teaspoon of vegetable stock powder, chives and a touch of garlic powder."

"reviewBody": "Agreeing with another review here, you cannot use exact measurements for this to work, potatoes are different and some will be more watery than others. Pick a good mashing potato (russet etc) and for ME took more flour. Basically if your dough is still sticking to things, its needs more flour… I also think adding finely chopped onions and a bit of garlic powder adds to the flavor but that is preference.. Oh and you can use “All purpose” flour if that is all you have but as recipe suggests use self rising if possible."

My husband was born and raised in Ireland, and there, they call this farl. one thing to note, depending on how wet your potatoes are, you should adjust your flour accordingly.this is a great and easy recipe. Also it's easily tweaked to suit your family's taste. one of my favorites alterteration... even tho It's not traditional is to add a nice slice of Monterrey jack on top when it's nearly done..so it's all melty... omg.

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe (or one exactly like this) just before Thanksgiving 2014. I made it because it is so similar to the Norwegian Lefse recipe (there is one on this site) that I make and I was curious. I made it as directed and it tasted very similar to Lefse. I rolled some of the dough paper thin, like we do for lefse, and it was identical. Lefse adds a pinch of sugar, for browning, and some cream for a moister dough and also is cooked on a dry griddle. This recipe is a treat and because you don't roll it so thin, it's much easier to make. I'll make this again! It's wonderful to eat plain with a little butter or you can spread it with jam. Try it, it's a wonderfully tender bread."
