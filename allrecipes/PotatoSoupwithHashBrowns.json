Only thing I have changed over the years is: add second can of cream of chicken reduce sodium and I use chicken bouillon then add water. Garnish with Chedder Cheese, Sour Cream, more bacon pieces and green onions. Yummy"

"reviewBody": "Made this exactly as recipe stated. It was good but a little bland. I’d recommend using an immersion blender to blend the hash browns and make the soup creamy, otherwise the potato texture is stringy. It really needs the bacon, cheese and green onions on top to complete it. I think it also could be a good base for a cheddar cheese soup which I think I will try next time."
