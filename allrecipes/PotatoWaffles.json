I was skeptical that the mix would be too thick, but it spooned onto the iron and cooked up beautifully. The iron was hot and I sprayed it with oil beforehand. I made a sour cream sauce with smokey paprika, shallot, parsley, lemon, and a bit of cayenne. The waffles tasted like potato pancakes but were soooo much easier. A keeper for leftover mashed potatoes."

I loved the crispy exterior while maintaining the creaminess of the potatoes on the inside. I'm not sure how I would serve these though. They are relatively plain and I don't like gravy. I tried to use a little maple syrup (aka chicken and waffles) with the leftover turkey but it was a battle of savory vs. sweet instead of complimenting flavors -- it just didn't work. I recommend sticking with a savory topping."

(Just conveniently and easily made in a waffle iron!) It is not meant to be served with a sweet topping. Have you never had potato cakes??? They are NOT a cake at all...Where I come from you'd better not think about applesauce or any syrup or sweetner near it..."

Would have liked them a little crispy but put in toaster oven to warm up and that made the difference. Ended up with 5 small waffles."

Served with all the toppings for loaded potatoes. \nNow, as to changes, I have a real issue in that while everyone loves the flavor my Grands are not pleased to find bits of onion in their food. My solution is to add garlic and onion puree (just blend it in your food processor) to the potatoes as they cook. Taste after mashing and add a touch more garlic powder as needed."

I had a bunch leftover so I tried making these. There was a little trial and error in the beginning and then they actually looked like they should. I had to cook them longer than I would have liked to get the waffle to stick together. Would have like to not make them quite so brown. I added cheese but they didn't have alot of flavor. They were all eaten tho so I guess they were good :) Next time I'll use and would suggest real mashed potatoes (if you were thinking of instant). Looking forward to trying them again"

"reviewBody": "Listening to others I ommitted as much moisture as possible by using plain mashed microwaved potatoes. I used no flour or breadcrumbs at all. I did use a smidgen of milk and the butter and oil from the cooked onions and garlic. I added just one egg and a bit of baking powder per another reviewers recommendation for fluffines (I have also tried it without an egg, no issues). My waffle iron has no temperature setting and I made the mistake of opening the lid while it was steaming and it split. For the second waffle I waited until the steam was to a trickle. At the end I spread some cheese on the top and closed it for a few seconds so it can melt. Super easy to clean the cheese if the iron is hot as it slides right off."

"reviewBody": "These were different ... I haven't quite decided if I like them or not, but I made changes (after reviewing several different recipes and incorporating a bit of all of them). #1) I used a Belgium waffle maker - the finished waffle came out high and fluffy like a Belgium waffle with the texture of a Belgium waffle and the taste somewhere between a waffle with potato overtones. #2) I did add 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1/4 tsp of baking soda ... I'm sure that contributed to the *thick waffle* texture which I've since decided I do NOT want in a waffle potato cake. I'd definitely prefer a crispy crunchy potatoey texture. So. In short, my bad. Going to retry without the leavening agents, but I'm thinking I'm probably going to have to go out and buy a regular waffle maker to get the results I'm looking for. Aside from that, this is a great way to use up leftover potatoes. Thanks so much for the recipe!"

Added another egg and a bit of milk since my original batter was more like choc chip cookie dough consistency. The first batch cooked in 41/2 min. The wetter better took longer but the family loved both versions. I am going to use them for the \"bread\" in a breakfast sandwich. Husband wanted more onion."

We make waffles at least once a week so it's not as if our iron doesn't work but after 10 minutes with the potato mixture in the waffle iron, it was still a gooey mess, no closer to being cooked than it was when it went in. I would make sure that if yo attempt this, that you have a super hot waffle iron."

"reviewBody": "Dear Wifey- I nearly flew to my waffle iron to try your recipe and the flavor did not disappoint. I did tweak the recipe (as I always do potato pancakes) by adding 1 tsp of onion powder and 1/2 tsp white pepper and omitting the garlic (and I use Russet potatoes)... The problem I can see happening to others (as it did to me), is that everybody's recipe for mashed potatoes is going to vary in texture and moisture... so my first two waffles turned out so tender I could hardly get them out of the iron. By the third waffle, I had added probably double the flour, used 1/2 cup of batter, and cooked it over 7 minutes. I have a great waffle iron (been using it for 30 years) so I know to have it thoroughly preheated and normally can cook any waffle recipe in exactly 5 minutes. I will definitely try the recipe again with either less potato or more flour because I love your idea... good use of leftover potato, reduced use of oil, fun to serve, and good flavors!"
