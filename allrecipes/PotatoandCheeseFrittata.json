I appreciated Patty Crocker's recommendation to make a merengue (by separating egg whites from egg yolks, beating them separately and achieving stiff peaks with the egg whites and folding back into the blended egg yolks). I also par boiled the potatoes in salt water with baking soda -- the baking soda reduces is a great little trick that makes for much better baked or fried potatoes. Thank you for posting!"

Used 4 eggs, too dry...kind of looked like, I dunno, damp bread crumbs. Moved frittata from the skillet to a small glass baking pan, sprinkled on spices including jerk pepper sauce. Put it in oven for 7 mins, then added a fifth egg on top, put it back in oven, then added grated cheddar cheese. Definitely making again!"

I also used a cup of cheese with 1/2 mixed in with the eggs and 1/2 added to the top as the recipe called for. I didn't find this bland at all. I think the other reviewers who described it as bland didn't add enough salt and pepper to the recipe. I served this with Salsa Verde for an extra kick."

I used a well-seasoned cast iron pan with a bit of butter and grapeseed oil, and had delicious crispy potatoes and well-cooked eggs. Use your own discretion for seasoning: if you like a lot of flavor, add seasonings and salt and hot sauce for a kick...don't blame a simple recipe for not being seasoned enough for your tates...like onion? Add onion, like more cheese, add it...5 stars for simplicity, cost, and ease."

Over the heated oil, put all the hash browns in a thin layer. Cook for 7 minutes and flip to cook another 7 or 8. I'm a bad flipper so I use a plate to help. You can add anything to this! I've used the recipe as stated, added and used garlic, paprika, Parmesan cheese mixed in w/ the eggs and always add turkey sausage on top. After I do the hash browns, I move to a shallow pie dish and dump the 6 eggs over it. The recipe is amazing, you just have to know how to do the hash browns right!"

I also whipped the eggs whites (as suggested by someone) and folded in the yolks. I got a great fluffy frittata that was a hit!"

I tripled the recipe for a party and ended up cooking it in a 2-inch deep baking dish instead of a skillet. Worked perfectly. Added some garlic and seasoned salt to the mix. I would have added some spinach, but didn't have any on hand. It needed a bit more cheese than the recipe called for, but overall, I think I will definitely be making this again."

I fried bacon to crispy, cooked the frozen hashbrowns in the fat, and when I poured the eggs in topped with the crumbled bacon. Yummm! Would also be good with red bell pepper and/or mushrooms. Must try that. I've made this several times and like it more each time. Thamks"

"reviewBody": "My son and I have made this several times. I decided to adjust the recipe to fill the skillet a little thicker. I used 4 or 5 potatoes, diced and 9 or 10 eggs. We use different spices and different cheeses every time we make this. We also have used bacon once and sausage another time. We have to bake it at 350 degrees because of my skillet's temperature restrictions, for about 12 to 15 minutes. Then top with lots of cheese and return to just melt the cheese. This makes enough for us to eat all day and maybe even for the next morning. My aunt had never had one and she loved it also. Thanks for sharing this great basic recipe."

I added ground pepper, paprika, 1/4 chopped onion to the potatoes and sautéed for about 5 minutes. I then topped the potatoes mixture with some chopped sausage and finally the egg mixture. I cooked the rest of this according to the recipe. Even my four year old thought this was great!! I might recommend adding a few more eggs if you are looking for of that consistency! Otherwise, great recipe, that could have many different variations!!"

I plan to make it again, but slight differences: 1) I'm going to fry some bacon in the pan first, use that oil, and crumble the bacon on top before I put the egg on. 2) I'm going to add some peppers, maybe even a bit of cilantro."

I did not bake the frittata, but cooked it on the stovetop and then finished it under the broiler. I also added some crumbled bacon under the cheese.\nThe next time I make it, I will probably use frozen shredded hash browns. The fresh potatoes did not get as crispy as I would have liked, maybe too much moisture? I will also add the onions either before or with the potatoes rather than after. All in all, pretty tasty."
