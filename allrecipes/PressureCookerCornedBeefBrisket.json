Best part is it didn't take 4 hours to cook. Plus, the roast didn't shrink nearly as much under pressure as it normally does with the old stovetop method."

"reviewBody": "This recipe seems to simple to be good, but my husband and I were both amazed by how only a couple of ingredients combined tastes so good. We followed the recipe EXACTLY the first time with a 4-4.5 lb corned beef. The second time we made this with another 4-4.5 lb corned beef we added just a few favorite spices (like smoked paprika) that would not overwhelm the beer. The second time I made this I was pressed for time so I set the pressure cooking time for 1 hour, then let it sit in the pot until hubby was home from work, which ended up being over 20 mins NP. Worked fine, and I may do that from now on. And DO NOT ADD SALT!!! Read about Corned Beef... it is salt cured!"
