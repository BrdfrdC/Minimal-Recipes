"reviewBody": "Excellent flavor! Tastes rich and satisfying. Easy to make , good meal for packing up and taking to a friend. The only changes I made were using boneless, skinless thighs, then when the meat gets tender in the pressure cooker, it’s easy to stir in, not worrying about the bones. \n I tried it twice , comparing cooking the chicken on the stove in a non stick pan, and cooking it in the instant pot as directed. I felt that the chicken cooked on the stove had a better flavor, and I was able to get it more brown and then added some of the cooking juices to the rice.\nI also left out the saffron, since I didn’t have any, and added a little more turmeric, tasted wonderful even without the saffron."
