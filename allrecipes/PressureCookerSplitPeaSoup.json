"reviewBody": "This is a great base recipe. I read the other reviews and made these adjustments. I used 6 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of water. I added one packet of Lipton Onion Soup mix. Added one bay leaf. Eliminated the salt &amp; pepper. Eliminated the garlic powder and instead used 2 teaspoons of minced garlic (prepared.) Fresh would work too. I cooked (sweated) the onion, celery, and garlic on the stove first on medium low heat before adding it to the pressure cooker. I used my Instant Pot pressure cooker. 30 minutes, 5 minutes natural release. Removed the ham hock and stirred in just enough potato flakes to thicken it just right. Cut up the ham pieces and stirred those back in. It sounds like I completely overhauled this recipe, but not really. Just added to a good base recipe."

The ham bone had only a small amount of ham on it so I added in 3 strips of bacon. Of course once it cools it gets thick and that’s when I added a can of Chicken Broth to thin it out . This recipe is a keeper."

For the 6 cups of liquid I chose chicken broth and I really thing it needed that extra boost of flavor. 6 cups was perfect to eat right then in there but the leftovers do thicken considerably and that is where I can see needing the extra liquid. I thought I would miss carrots in this but I didn't. It was simple and had great flavor. Again, I do think in needed the broth instead of the water."

I also did not add any salt because I thought it would have enough salt from the ham hocks, but found that the salt was necessary. I added it to the individual bowl of soup, allowing each person to salt to their own taste. I will make again."

Also, running water on pressure cooker for rapid pressure release is in the instructions for older cookers. Obviously not for new fangled electric ones which don't seem to work as well."

I used an electric pressure cooker and set it for 30 minutes. after it finished I also added 1/2 pound of diced boars head tavern ham."

"reviewBody": "Giving this a 4 only because I made changes. Reason being, I was happy with my old recipe but wanted to try it in my fairly new pressure cooker. FASTEST, EASIEST, TASTIEST soup I've ever made from scratch! \nNow for my additions. I added two carrot sticks, finely chopped and a bay leaf. Also, instead of onion powder, I used two cloves of garlic, pressed in the garlic press. \nI have an electric pressure cooker so I simply set it for high pressure for 30 minutes and let it naturally release the pressure. Consistency was perfect! Prep time was about 10 min so whole thing was done in about an hour! SPLIT PEA SOUP IN AN HOUR! Gotta love the pressure cooker and this recipe!"
