"reviewBody": "I really liked this dish. It was more mild of a teriyaki flavor than I was expecting, but still good. I used a brown sugar substitute and low sodium tamari for the soy, other than that, added chopped carrot and bell to pot. I did cook a little less than specified time and the chicken was nice and tender. Hubs really enjoyed it over rice and topped with green onions, toasted sesame seeds and peanuts. (For me, I marinated a tilapia filet in the sauce while everything cooked, then sautéed it in EVOO , served over cauliflower rice with same toppings.) Will do again, worked quite well both ways!"

I did not have the vinegar so I cut down to 1/2 cup soy sauce and added 1/2 cup teriyaki sauce &amp; marinade. I did not have ground ginger so I used minced ginger from a jar. I poured the hot chicken/ sauce over cut up green pepper chunks and let it sit for a few minutes to pick up the pepper flavor. The whole family loved it!!"

Set the Instant Pot for 12 minutes; chicken was done. Took the chicken out and tried to cook the rice in the Instant Pot. Messed up the proportions by using 1 cup of rice to about 2 cups of liquid. Did not finish cooking and had a lot of liquid left over, so drained the rice and put it on the stove with a little more liquid. Took the rest of the liquid and added corn starch to make the best sauce! The rice was very good once it finished on the stove and dinner was a success!"

"reviewBody": "I followed the recipe as written with the exception of mincing fresh ginger (I did not have ground ginger on hand), marinating the meat in the sauce for two hours, and using chicken breasts. That last change is the important one. If you are cooking chicken breasts the timing of the cooking is critical. I cooked a little over 3 lbs of boneless, skinless chicken breasts that were halved in 10 minutes and they were slightly overcooked. \n\nThe timing on thickening the sauce is inaccurate. It took about twice as much time (6 minutes) with twice as much corn starch. That said, the rating is four stars because I liked this recipe a lot but my wife did not. Five stars should be for a recipe that will be a crowd pleaser but some might find it a bit too sweet."

It was supposed to be only for an electric pressure cooker (any brand including Instant Pot) not a stove top. 20 minute cook time is for thighs so they fall apart and leave the chicken in the pot to break it up. Quick release pressure. It takes at least 3 or 4 Tbls of cornstarch mixed with a little water to thicken using the brown/saute setting. If you use breasts reduce the cook time in half."

It was still too sweet. Also the chicken didn't soak in the flavor, either. \nMy recommendations would be: Add fresh garlic and ginger (minced) instead of the grounded or powdered. Only use 1/3 of recommended sugar if using gluten-free soy sauce. Lastly, double the sauce (without cornstarch) and use half to marinate the chicken the night before. Add cornstarch to the non-marinade half of the batch, if you'd like."

I have an instant pot and just used the soup button with no adjusting, I used a quick release, then I used the Saute function to thicken the sauce. Turned out pretty good. I think it would be better with chicken thighs though."

I'm planning a next time, using frozen Asian stir-fry veggies and serving this recipe over LO-MEIN noodles; that should hit 5 stars. LOVE the convenient ease--and amazing speed--of pressure cooking!!"

"reviewBody": "This was a really good recipe! A couple things I did that really worked well: first of all I trimmed a ton of excess fat off the meat before cooking. Don't worry about trying to get it all off, or you'll be there all day! ;) Doing this at the beginning will eliminate the need to skim the fat off the top at the end. Secondly, I added a tsp of red pepper flakes to the sauce mixture and that really added a bit of a kick to the dish! I have a Pressure Cooker XL and as far as I can tell, there is not way to lower the heat during the process of cooking (I'm totally new the the pressure cooker thing, so I could be wrong?!), so I cooked it for 18 minutes on the chicken setting and it was falling apart good! Definitely a keeper recipe!"

Next time, I'm going to reduce it to 12 mins. \n\nThe pressure cooker really seals in the flavor like the chicken had been marinated overnight. I served it on top of jasmine rice (also cooked in the pressure cooker). \n\nThe other thing I did was that instead of making the gravy in the pressure cooker, I took the juice and put it in a pot on the stove and thickened the gravy there. While I did that, the rice was cooking (1 min in the pressure cooker). Oh, I will say that the gravy didn't thicken hardly at all with what was in the recipe. I might add just a tad more. \n\nI loved it and will definitely make it again."

I did cook the chicken for only 10 minutes instead of the suggested 20 minutes and it turned out great. This is an easy dinner to whip together for the family although I didn't feel it was good enough to serve it to company. I cooked this one in my Instant Pot. And if you don't have an Instant Pot yet, I suggest you do a little research and see if it might be a useful tool in your kitchen, too."

We ate it for almost a whole week (changed sides &amp; veggies) and NO ONE got bored! Much more than \"just\" a keeper; this will be my new go to meal if I forget to defrost something. I can't WAIT to try it with pork! I had all the ingredients in the pantry. Super easy, fast and delicious!!!"
