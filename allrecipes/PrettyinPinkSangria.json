Used fresh strawberries (muddled half of them) and a little extra pineapple juice since I had 2 - 6 oz cans, and 1 bottle of Rose. Great as written, but I do like my sangria a little more potent, so after my first glass I added about 1/2 a cup of brandy and 1/4 cup of triple sec -- perfect!"

"reviewBody": "This Is a great, easy recipe. I made half for a small party and was so good. Had to use a few different ingredients as I forgot the ginger ale ( and opt not to use the pineapple juice) I used 1 bottle of Barefoot crisp white and added about a cup of pear vodka. I also added a bottle of Cispin pear cider, fresh strawberries, one sliced peach and a handful of blueberries. It is SO pretty! And just as delicious. I saw on another site to slice up lemons and soak in food coloring for awhile -as the rind soaks up the color- I think this would be really pretty. Trying next time. FYI I like sweet wines and was tempted to use one of those for this, and I'm glad I didn't as this ends up being sweet enough even with the altered recipe. Enjoy!"

I did tweak the oringal recipe just a little. Since my theme was valentine's day i needed the color of this drink to say \"love\". Here's what I did....... I used frozen pink lemonade instead of regular lemonade. I did not use the pineapple juice , instead i used 1 cup of pineapple vodka. For the fruit i used frozen strawberries along with sliced lemons (why not, since im using frozen lemonade ) and sliced oranges. The drink was so good. Everyone loved the taste and appearance of the punch. It didn't last long either :)"

"reviewBody": "Yum! I halved the recipe and since I had the small cans of pineapple juice, I just used one 6oz can instead of the one cup called for. And since I didn't have ginger ale, I used one small can of Sprite, and finally, added a couple splashes of vodka. So good! I'm not a pineapple juice fan, but this amount was subtle and added a nice touch. I've made many sangrias and if I'm not making it for company, I just leave out the fruit. My punch was more yellow than pink, so next time, I might use pink lemonade. Thanks for such a good, easy recipe!"

All other drinks at the party (we said should be called wine club instead) were ignored until all the sangria was gone. I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I added in some vodka as well to give it an extra kick--and you couldn't even tell (until later!). I didn't measure but I probably added in about a cup of vodka. I also added some fruit - apples, oranges and frozen raspberries. This was great, it's definitely going to be a party staple."

I also used lemon-lime soda instead of the gingerale. Perfect sweetness! I think that the pineapple juice might have made it too sweet! I used fresh stawberry slices that I froze in single layers in a glass pie pan seperated by wax paper sheets. PERFECT!"
