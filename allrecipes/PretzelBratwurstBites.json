"reviewBody": "We made these tonight for the Super Bowl. They tasted good, but the instructions failed to say whether or not to use cooked or uncooked brats before they are baked. We used uncooked and they took probably a extra 25 minutes to cook. When I first took them out of the oven at 12 minutes, not all of the dough looked cooked enough, so we put them back in. When we took them out the second time, I cut them into thirds, but the brats still weren't done, so I threw them back in, all cut, for 5 more minutes and they were finally done. Please edit the recipe to state how the brats should be when preparing.. uncooked or cooked. I used Johnsonville brats. Other than the cooking time adjustments, they were good."
