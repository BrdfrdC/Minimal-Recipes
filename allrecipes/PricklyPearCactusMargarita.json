I had to order the pear syrup online because I couldn't find any. I bought Cheri's All Natural Prickly Pear Cactus Syrup. These are great and the cactus syrup gives a nice reddish color! Gracias!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe is amazing. To our surprise we found prickly pears in our local farmers market (in Delaware!) and bought 3, having no idea how many we would need. As it turned out, cooking down all 3 provided the right amount of juice to make 4 margaritas. I followed the advice of another reviewer and cut back a bit on the lime juice. I used almost the amount of triple sec in the recipe but not quite -- I trusted the recipe but we tend to prefer a bit less sweetness in our drinks. Needless to say the drinks were a hit and I will contact the market first thing tomorrow to see if they regularly carry prickly pears!"

"reviewBody": "Searched google and found this as the first recipe. Made my drink exactly as per the recipe. It's a good margarita, the prickly pear syrup is mostly just decoration in my opinion. The lime just fights to overpower what little flavor the cactus brings to the mix. It's a very good margarita though, I'll do it again and again because my cactus gave me a lot of prickly pears...."

Thank goodness I had a plane to catch or I would have sipped on one after the other. This is a great recreation of that memorable drink. It's not the same color as I remember, but it tastes the same. If you like different flavored margaritas and can find prickly pear syrup, this one is definitely worth a try."
