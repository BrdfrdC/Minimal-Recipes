We have a four burner grill heated grill using first and third. Placed ribs as directed on top rack above actual cooking surface between the two burners Cooked one hour. Kim closed. Ribs reach temperature in about an hour and 10 minutes. Turn off the grill lay the ribs on the foil on the rack put on some sauce came back 10 minutes later. Pulled them. They looked nice and juicy. But there it was tough as shoe leather. Yes these were baby backs. So I put them back on the grill on the cooking surface At 350° for about 10 minutes flipping ribs over occasionally Putting some a little burn On each side. Let rest for 5 minutes they were significantly better. Point being I need to know an exact cooking temperature for this recipe. Otherwise it’s guesswork it shouldn’t be"

I made a few changes to the preparation, the rub and to the grilling time I had my husband increase to almost 2 hrs. I boiled the ribs with 1 tspn cider vinegar for 5-10 minutes(helped tenderize and reduce grease). I changed the rub ingredients to 1/2 tsp of cumin, paprika, and chili powder. I added 1 tsp garlic powder, 2 Tbsn Kosmos Sweet Honey Pecan Dry Rub. Removal of the membrane was the best tip evah! Seven minutes direct grill at 400 then wrapped in aluminum foil and placed on uppermost grill at lowest temp (250) for 11/2 hrs, then slathered with Carolina sauce, back on grill for few minutes more...absolutely delicious with meat falling off the bone! Everybody loved it!. Ya gotta try it! Helen"

"reviewBody": "OMG! My husband was mortified...we had company and wanted to make something special. Followed this recipe To The Letter and the ribs were burnt to a crisp. We didn't check them because it said not to open the grill. We opened it up because we saw flames shooting out sideways...and there was a huge fire. My husband backed off so he didn't get burned but then came back in carefully and turned off the grill. The flames continued for another 5 minutes--the tin foil gad caught fire with the drippings from the ribs most likely. We turned the grill on high then turned it down to low when we put the ribs on the upper gril. What in the world??!! (my second choice of words....) My friend is still talking about this and we had a bit of a chuckle when the deck and house at least didn't catch fire and we were all safe. We then put on hot dogs and caled it a night. $25 worth of ribs carefully prepared with the rub and membranes removed. Sad."

After about 20 minutes I noticed smoke coming out the grill so I opened it and turned off the center 2 burners while leaving the other 3 on low. The ribs basically cooked for 40 minutes at 300 degrees farenheit after the initial crisping on direct heat on low for 20 mins. The ribs came out out good also. I suggest grilling the ribs on direct heat for 5-7 minutes after putting the sauce of your choice. Gives it a chance to caramelize a little more."

Just place the aluminum foil on the rack and the ribs on the foil, as is done in the video. (Cup the foil to contain the grease.) Putting the grill on low keeps the temp at about 450 and the ribs cook in an hour, plus another 10 minutes for the sauce. Wonderful."

I did use one of our favorite bottled dressings and worked fine. I did deviate using hickory chips to smoke and cooked on a coal grill (meat off to the side) for 2 hours. Tender, flavorful and the cumin was fine. My internal temp got to 180 - Looking forward to making again, may try homemade sauce."

"reviewBody": "I changed rub ingredients to have salt, pepper, GrillMates BBQ sauce, and later BBQ Sauce. I started the grill with all 3 burners on high, and it got up to 550 F in about 10 minutes. The babyback ribs were put on the upper shelf, the area below was lined with silver foil to catch drippings. I lowered the lid and turned the heat down to Low.One hour later I opened the lid, added BBQ sauce on top, lowered the lid for 5 minutes. The inner temp was 189 so I put the ribs on the table and sliced them up. Very tasty! I'm not sure but I think they could have been a bit more tender (next time I'll let the temp get above 195). I highly recommend following cooking info exactly!"

"reviewBody": "So so so so SO so good!!! My review is for the cooking method, not the seasoning. We have a seasoning we love and used that instead of making our own!! We have a small Weber charcoal grill. We grilled one rack at 350° (it fluctuated between 300-400° for the whole time, but next time we make them, we’ll hold steady at 350°F!) for just over and hour and then put only about 1/2 C of sauce on for the last 5 minutes. Were they fall-off-the-bone tender? Not quite. But they WERE tender, easy to eat, and crazy delicious!!!! If you’re a rib snob that gets butthurt over not taking 4 hours to grill ribs, then this recipe isn’t for you. But if you want quick, delicious ribs, this is ABSOLUTELY for you!!!"

I was a little worried that I didn’t get my grill hot enough, so for the last 20 minutes I turned the flame up. It didn’t over cook, and got just the right char on the top after brushing on the bbq sauce. I used pork ribs, but I’d like to try beef next time."

They turned out perfect - soft as butter on the inside but crispy/charred(ish) on the outside. Great proportions on spice, too. Since my gas grill doesn't go low enough I turned on one side and put the ribs on the other side (no flame) and just turned them so that both sides were closer to the burner at some point. Thanks for a great recipe!"

At first I was a little skeptical about this dry rub but it was everything I was hoping for. My brother in law is a very picky eater and he was definitely loving the ribs. In fact everyone who had eaten them loved them. In addition to the listed seasonings I added Garlic salt, and of course Goya Adobo(being Puerto Rican this is a must). I made 3 racks so I added 3x the amount of ingredients. I did have difficulty removing the membrane off two of the racks so I left it on. Once seasoned I wrapped all the racks in foil and let sit over night. With foil on I cooked them on my gas grill low setting for 2 hours. After 2 hours took them out of the foil and brushed with some delicious bbq sauce. Left on the grill for about 10 minutes. Brushed more bbq sauce and remove. This was a definite home run."
