"reviewBody": "Mille grazie!! Finally pesto alla genovese that tastes like my mother made it. I have my grandmother's mortar (marble) and my mother's pestle (wooden) and I've tried many times to make pesto using them, but I have always failed. Your video inspired me and guided me to my first success!! And IT TASTES LIKE MY MOTHER MADE IT!. Completely different from Cuisinart pesto. There is a fragrance I cannot describe. I did one thing different, though. I used romano pecorino -- but not the cheese you get in most stores. Here in Seattle we have a store that sells romano pecorino from Italy, and it is a wonderful cheese. Mild but fragrant and flavorful. Though pecorino is what my mother used (and I love it), I will get some good parmigiano reggiano and try that, too. thanks again!!! BTW half my grandparents came from Liguria, the other half from Piedmont. The correct Ligurian pronunciation of pesto is pestu. In both Liguria and Piedmont there is frequently a sound shift where the \"oh\" sound becomes \"oo\"."

"reviewBody": "I have made this recipe a number of times and love it. Since I grow Genovese basil in my basement, I always have a lot of fresh basil available, and usually double or quadruple the recipe. Since I make large quantities, I make this pesto in my 16 cup food processor. To do this, I put the pine nuts, salt, and garlic cloves in the processor, pulse 4-5 times, add add the shredded cheese, pulse a couple more times, add 1/2 the oil, pulse a couple more times, add 1/2 the basil leaves and the rest of the oil, pulse a couple more time, add the rest of the basil, and pulse 3-4 times until everything is integrated. By weight, a large bunch of basil is 1.4 ounces for just leaves and 2.5 ounces for leaves and stems. I have been using just the leaves. Making the pesto with this method is so very good, I don't see how crushing everything manually could make it any better. I use this pesto mixed in pasta and have also used a lot of it in recipes. We love it, so I keep a stock of it in my freezer. It freezes very well."

I used this recipe to make pesto for stuffed challah and used only 1/2 the oil called for so it would be easier to stuff in the dough - it worked perfectly! I'll never make pesto in a food processor again - mortar and pestle all the way!!"

I also add zest of one lemon per batch as well as black pepper. Next time I will remember that my pound of basil should make three to four batches. The basil taste is too strong at higher basil amounts. Overall excellent recipe. This freezes quite well so you can use a spoonful at a time to add to sauces and stews, etc"

But THIS...this recipe is worth it. It’s so good. Just try it. I bought a mortar and pestle at tjmaxx for about $12. My tip is to fold a kitchen towel and place it under the bottom so that it doesn’t bang as loud. And let the tool work for you, you don’t have to put a lot of force into it or your hand will start to cramp. Then buy 2 baguettes and enjoy your life."

Still, I did make the mistake of using too much sea salt in the pestle as the final product...though flavorful, was much saltier than I would have liked. Basil seemed to take forever to grind up without more though. Guess I will just have to be more patient and perhaps reevaluate my olive oil. Used Bertolli as that is what I had on hand. Still loved it and will replace the store-bought pesto I used to get with this method."

"reviewBody": "RIDICULOUS!!!\nThis was ridiculously good!! First time I've ever made pesto and won't make it any other way!! OMG! My 13 year old and husband gave it a \"10\" (we rate all of my food).\nI understand that the secret to this amazing recipe is doing it a mortar &amp; pestle. If you do nothing else in the mortar, at the very least add the oil and incorporate it this way as oils tend to get bitter when whipped in a Vitamix or other blender/processer. This is one of the (many) keys to why this is so amazing. Use all of the freshest ingredients available and you'll have yourself some RAVE reviews! I only wish I had a huge mortar!! This was gone in one night with three people eating it. It is amazing on fresh, toasted (wood-grilled preferably) buttered sourdough bread as an appetizer, too! DON'T heat it as it will ruin it. Just mix it into hot pasta or serve on buttered bread. Indulgent!! LOVE!!"

"reviewBody": "I have made pesto plenty of times using my Vitamix machine and I thought it was pretty good. Little did I realize how unprepared I was for the burst of flavor that hit my mouth when I tasted this ground pesto sauce. It has been an hour since I ate it and I still have the full taste of the pesto in the back of my throat! This is THE only way I will ever prepare pesto sauce for my family. Thank you Chef John for introducing us to this revolutionary technique. It almost makes me want to use my mortar and pestle on just about anything..."

"reviewBody": "Wow. This was a revelation. I made half a batch because I was alone and my mortar and pestle is small; there was already a fair amount of cursing as I went about making this. It’s really not that much work, even if it feels like it at first; I was surprised at how quickly the basil leaves were pulverized. I ended up putting the garlic through a garlic press into the mortar, because I wasn’t having much success pounding it into a paste. The variety of basil I had might have been spicier than the Genovese type I’m used to--this pesto was SO sharp, and so fragrant! I even pulled the green sprouts from inside the cloves of garlic to keep it from being overpowering. I only used about 1/2 ounce Parmesan and 2 Tbsp olive oil for my half batch; my cup nearly runneth over. I put a few tablespoons of my amazing pesto on penne pasta and inhaled it. I need bigger and better equipment because I want to eat this stuff all summer long."
