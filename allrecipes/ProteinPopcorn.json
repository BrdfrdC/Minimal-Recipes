We put any leftovers in airtight storage bags and it keeps for days!"

Also I buttered a giant stainless steel serving bowl and used a silicone mixing spoon to toss &amp; coat the popped corn worked great nothing stuck to the bowl."

Also, the biggest bowl I had, which was quite big, was too small for all the popcorn, it was very hard to mix it, and we ended up using our hands. The peanut butter mixture was too hot and we ended up burning ourselves, next time I will try the paper bag method. None the less, this was very tasty and addictive and will be made again - SOON!"

We don't eat lots of sugar, so I use about two cups of this sweetened popcorn to a three cups plain (lightly salted) popcorn. (personal preference; this is good as is, just too sweet for me.)"

The only change I made was to pour the popped popcorn in a brown paper bag, then pour the hot peanut butter mixture on top, close the bag and shake it to coat the popcorn. It gets the popcorn coated evenly and is less messy."
