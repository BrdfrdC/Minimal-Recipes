"reviewBody": "Med-low heat did not make the onions brown in 20mins;took waxy longer. Too much salt would hv been needed , so I subbed with a Adobo 1tbs. Two little cubes were not enough of beef bouillon. Subbed with 1tbs. Small tomato sauce comes in 8oz. Original recipe located on the fresh frozen bag of Goya Bianca Sancocho blend from Wal-Mart worked best, seemed more authentic in the actual cooking steps. I used 2 bags of the mix the second time around."
