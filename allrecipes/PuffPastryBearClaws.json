"reviewBody": "The use of store bought puff pastry made this recipe so easy ! The filling tasted very good too, though I used almond flour for ground almonds and 1 whole egg for the 2 yolks. I think the puff pastry brand I used has smaller pastry sheets so I was only able to make 8 small bear claws, and had about half the filling left. I stored in the fridge and plan to use soon. And, heads up, the sliced almond browned too much during baking.."

"reviewBody": "What a lovely recipe! I was too lazy to make the traditional \"bear claw\" shape- I just made ravioli-looking things- but they were beautiful to look at anyway and tasty. I went heavy on the almond flavor, as is my preference, and I thought they were 'bakery worthy'. Great recipe!"
