"reviewBody": "I doubled up the recipe, added diced potatoes and more seasoning: minced garlic, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, Italian seasoning mix, and bay leaf. I didn't have any celery seed. I used a large casserole dish and put the puff pastry on top only. I saw that the pastry shrinks so I let it hang over the edges. It dripped quite a bit because it was full to the brim, so a tray underneath was needed to catch the sauce. Now that we've eaten it we both wanted more pastry so next time I'll make an extra pack of pastry on a separate tray. Despite dicing the potatoes up they were barely cooked so either I'll leave them out or dice them smaller to hashbrown size. Have to say I wasn't completely satisfied with the flavor of the sauce. Missing something I can't put my finger on."

"reviewBody": "I make this often and is my go-to pot pie. The puff pastry directions say no more than 40 min to thaw so I find 35 Min is ideal for working with it. The “picky eater “ kids actually eat this and I don’t dare tell them part of what makes it taste so good is the onions. I’ve switched out fresh cooked veggies and it actually is great with frozen and much easier. I usually get a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store when I’m rushed for time."

I had a Tenderflake pie crust leftover from a package to use as the base cooked in preheated toaster oven for 15 minutes. I cooked everything in my toaster oven to use less electricity. I put the completed dish in the toaster oven for 50 minutes, but the top was a bit charred. Next time, maybe next time a bit less time."

"reviewBody": "This recipe made the best chicken pot pie! My favorite part is the puff pastry. The crust if flaky, buttery and so easy with which to work. I used Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry Sheets. \n\nI used boneless and skinless chicken breast and thighs. Also, I used fresh vegetables: carrots, celery, potatoes, and mushrooms while I did use frozen peas. My casserole dish, 9 inches, was smaller too. \n\nI had to lower the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit because I used my convection/toaster oven which tends to get hotter quickly. The bottom crust layer took exactly 25 minutes to brown with the foil on top. However the top crust in the final cooking became the perfect golden brown around the 30 minute mark. To keep the crust from burning, I added a sheet of foil over the top for the remaining 20 minutes of cook time."

I added mushrooms and a splash of cooking wine, and exchanged the onion with asafetida powder to make it low FODMAP. Mine cooked only about 20 minutes before I was afraid it’d burn - I’m not sure if that was because of my smaller, different dish. Turned out great!!!"
