They turned out great and were very easy! Some people in the comments mention needing a tortilla press, but I made do with pressing them down with a cake pan (still putting dough between ziplock bag). \nI'm not a confident fryer, but these didn't require much oil and didn't spit any oil. All and all this was a fairly easy recipe. I will definitely be making these again!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe says masa de harina, which is flour masa and incorrect. You need masa de maiz (Corn masa). If anyone is using flour you aren't getting a delicious puffy taco. I was raised in San Antonio and lived here my whole life. My mom made puffy tacos when I was growing up. She says, what are you going to do when you want a puffy taco because I had already learned most of our dishes, even tamales. I thought I would just go to a restaurant here, but nothing is better than homemade. I am in my forties and just now picking up the tradition I will pass on to my girls because home cooked meals are so better. So, long story short corn masa not flour. I like the glass pie plate hack though."

With a little more practice, I hope to have them puff up a little more, but the flavor was very good!!! Thank you!!!"

"reviewBody": "I just want to let everyone know that I tried this recipe with wheat germ because I had it at hand and was lazy enough not to go to the store. I might have added more dry wheat germ because it was sticking when I was pressing it out and they didn't puff up as much as it the video. Still Loved the flavor, naturally but just letting everyone know that you are not going to get the same outcome. Will try again with the right ingredients and tools!"

And you must make them larger to have them come out like the originals. To avoid the \"volcano\" effect, start making the fold after flipping them and Viola! San Antonio style puffy tacos!"
