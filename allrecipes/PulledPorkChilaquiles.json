"reviewBody": "I made this into a casserole since it was for a brunch and not camping. I made the pork and salsa sauce the day before. In the morning I mixed the sauce and meat together, added the shredded cheese and then mixed in the chips, crunching them a little into the mix to absorb some of the juices. I put it all into a 13x9 baking dish (not layered). To make it a little more “breakfasty,”as the submitter suggested, I added eggs to the top. I pushed a water glass bottom into the mix creating 8 slight divots and then cracked an egg into each divot. Baked in the oven. It was delicious and everyone raved about it. I will definitely make this again!"
