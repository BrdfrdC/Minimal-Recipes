Everything else is perfect!!! I have printed several copies of this as I never want to lose it... The author is right, it's even better after it is frozen. I give one loaf to my granddaughter and cut the over loaf in half and freeze it and we eat one half... I make it so often this works for us. I suggest you give a copy of the recipe with it if you give it as a gift, save yourself sometime... LOL"

I also added 1 c. of salted pumpkin seeds. Very flavorful! We will make these muffins again."

DEFINITELY do 30 mins in oven uncovered and then 20 mins covered with tinfoil. At 30 mins my bread was cooked on the outside but raw inside, so I covered it and left it for 20 mins and it came out perfect and moist. This recipe made 2 loaves and I put one in the freezer."

I make it as close to the recipe as I can living where there is no canned pumpkin and I don't remember how it was. I don't add the water because I'm afraid it will make the batter to runny , though today I'm hoping it isn't to thick. I made it at Christmas and everyone is still talking about it. I do up the spices as a personal preference. When I made it to give away to people the first time I didn't up the spices; now I know people here like a lot of spice, so I have."

Where they vary, generally, are with add-ins, which can of course be done with any pumpkin bread recipe, or with spices. Some call for quite a lot, some not much at all. The amount and blend of spices with this recipe was just right for me. Warm and aromatic and just plain pleasant, this is ideally spiced. Just for grins, I added a cup and a half of raisins. Nice. (Note: for simplicityâ€™s sake, use a 15 oz. can of pumpkin rather than measuring out two cups)"

Mostly sweet potato. Still and all, as a pumpkin bread, Im sure it still would have been awesome! Hope this is helpful. Its always good to improvise too!"

I also suggest using flour to help the loaves come out of the pan after baking, instead of using aluminum foil. I used mini loaves and it worked really well! Great for fall and Halloween!"

I added vanilla extract, valence orange peel, increased the cinnamon to 1 TBSP, and rather than do the ingredients separately, just added everything to one large bowl and mixed. I also added about a cup of chopped pecans. It turned out amazing and made 2 loafs. Be sure to check it after an hour and then lightly cover with foil to prevent over browning."

"reviewBody": "This bread is delicious, however, I could not give it 5 stars, because I changed it as per some reviewers ideas. I cut the sugar back to 1 c. white and 1 c. brown, doubled all of the spices (except the cloves), threw in 1/2 tsp. of powdered ginger and also 1/2 cup of fancy molasses with the wet ingredients (I like the dark rich colour). After all my tampering with this, the batter seemed very light and moist, so didn't use all of the water suggested. I got three medium sized loaves and they only took about 50 minutes to bake. Yumm - spicey and moist."
