Only two things I did differently was make them in a 9x13 pan and the bottom layer was the only one with chocolate chips. Then I alternated pumpkin and chocolate. They were a huge hit! Once they were cool I put them in the fridge; I preferred them that way. This recipe is going into my \"must have for fall\" binder!"

I followed the directions and did repeating layers for swirled, but just one thicker layer of each on the layered side. All versions were very moist and delicious, but overall I would say I personally liked layers better as to me it seemed like I could taste all the flavors more. I liked it with nuts slightly more, but it was delicious both ways."

A few changes: In addition to baking powder, I added 1/2 tsp baking soda, I reduced sugar to 1 cup, I only had 1/3 cup chocolate chips which is enough, I put all of chocolate layer on bottom of 8”x8” pan with pumpkin layer on top. Instead of folding walnuts into pumpkin layer, I sprinkled 1/2 cup chopped pecans on top. They toasted beautifully. These bars are creamy, rich, delicious. It’s 5 a.m. the day after baking. I’m wondering how long I can resist eating one today."

I probably should've left them in for 5 more minutes, as a few of them had parts of the bottom come off, as those weren't fully set. The comments I received was that they were very moist and delicious. I didn't have walnuts, so used pecans instead, and I used Dutch processed cocoa as well. (and yes, I might use cupcake papers next time, or just extend the time as I mentioned previously.) Will make again!"

I wanted them to be just like the photo, so I followed one reviewer's suggestions to make them in mini muffin pans. Oh, what a mess! Even though the pan was well greased, it was a horrible mess. They came out in several pieces. The last batch to go into the oven were baked in regular sized muffin pans and worked out much better. The flavors were wonderful though. I will make these again, but probably in the 8 x 8 pan as directed in the recipe."

We’re not huge pumpkin fans and we are believers now. I’ll be making this for my work potluck as well. I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the nutmeg, clove and cinnamon and I am glad I did!"

I followed the recipe but added a bit more pumpkin and also baked this in muffin cups rather than a pan - a great way to have easy to-go treats. The flavor is fantastic and the choc chips and nuts add a nice little crunch. The crust is chewy in that brownie-like way. Highly recommend!!"

My 1 1/2 year old and 2 1/2 year old grandchildren devoured them! The spices are perfect to make the pumpkin stand out (love the cloves), and the balance of chocolate to pumpkin is perfect. I also loved the texture of the chocolate chips in the brownie batter. I made one recipe and it made 12 tall cupcakes. You could easily make up to 18 cupcakes and they would still be big enough. I cooked for 15 minutes, then checked every 5 minutes. As it was, 12 tall cupcakes required 25 minutes at 350 degrees. I will definitely make these again and again."

Suggestion: putting the pumpkin mixture in first, then the brownie makes it easier to remove the muffins. I baked them at 350 for 9 min, sprinkled a small amount of pecan chips/mini choc chips on top, then baked for another 9 minutes. Let them cool for about 15 min. Very cute presentation and so, so, SO delicious!"

I probably should have put the pumpkin portion on top instead of the brownie part, but it's fine. I doubled the recipe and used 5 eggs instead of 6. I added a couple of shakes of ground ginger to the pumpkin batter, and used pecans instead of walnuts as one of my co-workers is not a walnut fan. They have a very nice texture and are very tasty."

Recommend cooling after baking and then storing (covered) in refrigerator at least 1-2 days. Bring to room temperature before serving. Thanks for sharing!"

Due to the size I did not layer as the recipe mentioned but rather did one layer of chocolate one with pumpkin and then used an offset spatula to twist half of it within each cup to get it somewhat mixed. As others wrote, I went ahead and did about a 2/5ths 3/5ths split on the batter mix with more with the pumpkin. Overall, it was fantastic. Will definitely make them again!"

"reviewBody": "Nice dessert for fall. I doubled this and poured into a 9x13 pan, took about 45 min. to bake and ended up being more cake-like. However, I made the mistake of not adding the flour until I had divided the batter in half and had added my cocoa/chips to some of it. This worked out well though as I had read where some thought the cocoa half was too thick and the pumpkin half too thin. So, I just added less flour to the cocoa half and more to the pumpkin half to work that out. I realized the cocoa half was still pretty thick so I thinned it out a bit with an extra 2/3 C. of pumpkin puree. Oh, I only used 2 C. of the 3 C. of sugar called for in the recipe. Next time I would probably decrease that to 1 1/2 C and decrease the chips to 3/4 C as well. Our family doesn't like our desserts too sweet. Ended up with a scrumptiously moist fall dessert!"

I've had this saved for quite a while and really wanted to make as is but couldn't justify the full amount of sugar for a 8x8 pan... My teeth hurt thinking about that! I only used 3/4 cup and the end result told me that was enough. I decided to sprinkle the top with some remaining dark chocolate chips and the walnuts (instead of mixing with the batter). They are a really beautiful fall brownie. I was told by my kids that there was too much spices.. And it over took the chocolate flavor.. But the one bit I had.. I really loved. \nNext time I make I will try with whole wheat flour, coconut sugar, and try coconut oil instead of the butter, and use a full teaspoon of baking powder. My recommendation for this brownie is please cut down on the sugar... It's way overboard."
