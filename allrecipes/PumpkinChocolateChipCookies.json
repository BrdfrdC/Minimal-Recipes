"reviewBody": "These are pretty good, but with adjustments, they are the best! For more pumpkin-y tastiness: -Add a whole can of pumpkin or more (not just a cup) -Use less oil (maybe half) -Use less sugar (maybe 3/4 C or less) -Grease the pan with butter before each batch *I didn't add milk or vanilla because I don't ever have milk on hand and vanilla is expensive and I am poor For vegan cookies: -Omit egg -Omit Chocolate Chips -Omit milk -Still use less oil -Still add more pumpkin -Still use less sugar The consistency is great and no other adjustments are needed. Super easy to make a dual batch. Whip up the vegan portion of the batter, scoop out five or so cookies, then add egg and chocolate chips to the remaining batter. My buddies love these, (granted my buddies are starving college students who will eat just about anything) and always ask for them. My vegan buddy also really loves these bad boys (the vegan version, of course). She is always tempted to munch on the regulars once hers are up. 'Tis the season for pumpkin!"

"reviewBody": "These were very yummy, the consistency is cakey so if that's not something you are into you may not like this cookie. Having said that I read a lot of the reviews while I was baking and tested out 2 different sized cookies and 2 different temps and 2 cooking times. My husband and I taste tested them together and both agreed the first batch was the best! First batch, medium spoon scoop, at 350 for 12 minutes. Soft, moist, good flavor. Second batch, smaller medium scoop, 365 for 10 minutes, soft and I could really taste the baking soda. My least favorite... Third batch, same smaller medium scoop as batch 2, 365 degrees, more solid, I probably would have loved it, If I hadn't tried the first batch... Hope this is helpful and happy baking!!"

"reviewBody": "These cookies are reminiscent of my mother's baking for our school lunches in the Fall. I made some changes based on other reviewer's comments and my own tastes. I didn't want the chocolate to be the predominate flavor, so I added just 1 c. chocolate chips. To make them similar to my mother's cookies, I added 1/2 cup raisins with the nuts. Reduced the cinnamon to 1 t. and added a shake of other spices to increase the pumpkin/Fall flavors: nutmeg, ginger, allspice &amp; clove. By reducing the chocolate chips it reduced the sweetness of the cookie, so the next time I make these I will add a bit more sugar. Brown sugar would probably increase depth of flavor of these cookies. I plan to experiment the next time I make these by changing it to 1/2 white sugar &amp; 1/2 brown sugar, or to possibly add a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar to bump up the sweetness. With my changes this recipe yielded 38 medium sized cookies for me. I will make this one again and again, it's a great Fall cookie!"

I made a quadruple batch (13 dozen cookies when made with a cookie scoop) and it took me about 3 hours. It would have been less time if I had slightly smaller cookie sheets and could fit 2 at a time in my oven. The only change I make is adding more chocolate chips and leaving out the nuts."

"reviewBody": "I've been using this recipe (with some minor changes) for 10+ years and it's one of the biggest hits both in my home and wherever I take them to share! For a \"healthier\" and yummier version, I do the following: \n\n1) Instead of using vegetable oil, I use a barely melted stick of organic butter. \n2) Since vanilla extract costs more than liquid gold, I can assure you that these will be *just* as delicious with one teaspoon instead of one tablespoon of vanilla extract. \n3) I add a dash or two of ground cloves. \n4) 3/4 cup of chocolate chips is plenty, too - quite a bit actually, these are chocolaty cookies! \n5) Because most recipes call for a cup of pumpkin and a can of pumpkin contains 1 and 3/4 cup... I just use half a can, so slightly less than a cup. Save the other half for another whole batch of these or another recipe. \n6) I use an organic egg from true free-range chicken - the ones with the deep orangy yolk. \n7) I use organic unbleached white flour. \n8) I use pink Himalayan salt instead of regular table salt.\n\nI DO mix the milk and the baking soda and add it to the flour mixture. I bake them on a pizza stone, 12 cookies at a time, at 350f. They need about 12 minutes. We like them just a bit gooey.\n\nThey are best about 10-15 mins after they come out of the oven, or from the fridge the next day. If you let them sit out on the counter or in a bowl at room temperature, they are not the greatest. Slightly cooled but still warm from the oven - where the chocolate is still gooey"

You can taste the baking powder/soda once it is cooked, which I am not a huge fan of. Also the use of just cinnamon means the flavor isn’t very complex."

So, the baking time is pretty much solid &amp; you do NOT want to leave them in any longer, or they will end up very dry in consistency. I opt to do half semi-sweet chocolate chips, and half milk chocolate. I also add a pinch of nutmeg in, for the seasonal aspect. These are soft, fluffy &amp; moist, which is perfect solo, or paired with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I make them every year during the fall season, and this recipe is a solid one!"

"reviewBody": "I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil like another reviewer suggested. It worked great. I didn’t want to use canola oil because I’ve never heard of a canola, so where does the oil come from. The cookies were really great. Others said they were cake like, and they were but not overly cake-y. They were still like a cookie texture. I added 1/8 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and an extra 1/4 tsp cinnamon. Also I added an extra 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. I even substituted half the sugar for organic stevia leaf powder. I didn’t miss the sugar at all. Fantastic recipe."

They fell flat and weren't cakey like typical pumpkin chocolate chip cookies are, and were slightly unappealing looking but tasted fine. The second batch I added a dash of nutmeg and cloves, and baked them at 365 for 14 minutes (bake time/temp could be my oven's issue) and they came out perfect. I did also add a couple drops of orange food coloring to keep the color vibrant"

Added vanilla to the wet ingredients, since I don't think that is specifically stated in recipe directions. 3. Added baking soda directly to dry ingredients and omitted milk. (I always use a small, closely tined whisk to blend dry ingredients before combining with wet items.) Everything else was exactly as directed. These are scrumptious!"

Living at an elevation of over 3000 feet I made a few tweaks to get the consistency I desired; 1 tbsp more flour, 1 tbsp less sugar, and about 1/4th tsp less of the baking soda. My son also requested the addition a few pinches of both nutmeg and clove. I’ll definitely make this recipe again."

I solved that issue by using the full can of pumpkin and doubling the other ingredients (except the chocolate chips). A can of pumpkin is less than 2 cups, but the cookies turn out just fine and I do not have leftover pumpkin. Works for me! I also like using mini-chocolate chips."
