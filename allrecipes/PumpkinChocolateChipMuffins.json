I bet if I followed the recipe it would have been 5 stars but I’m writing modifications for my own reference so I know what to fix for next time. I will make these again though because I really liked them! I doubled the recipe so I could use the entire can of pumpkin and used 3 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice, used applesauce in place of butter, brown sugar instead of white sugar, and used whole wheat flour. I baked them at 375 for 25 minutes. Next time I will bake them for 20-22 minutes because they were a tad overcooked. Also will have to spray the muffin liners because they stuck to the paper liners. Or possibly do half applesauce/half oil. But overall these were really yummy muffins!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe quickly became a family favorite and are now known as “Audrey’s special muffins” around the house. First time I made them, a friend ordered half a dozen. I add a bit of honey just before I add the chocolate, just a little dollop about the size of 2-3 peas (I never measure exactly LOL) and it adds a firmer texture around the corners without tampering with the taste. I’ve noticed some suggestions in the comments that I will probably try in the future to add some extra flavor, but overall as they are these muffins are extremely satisfactory. The ten year old was begging for seconds right before bed and broke down in tears when I said no, and the toddlers eat more than half of theirs which is a huge accomplishment. Thank you so much, this recipe got me good grades in cooking class and now makes me feel more on par with the other women of my family."

On my second try, I doubled the recipe, and did add some extra pumpkin (2 cups total), and baked at 350 for 20 minutes. Didn't change anything else, and they were just perfect. Can't imagine why anyone would find these bland, unless maybe your spices are past their prime? Totally delicious and would also be awesome with toasted walnuts and / or raisins, too.

I can’t add a photo because they were gone that fast— my roommates and I devoured them. 25 minutes was more than enough, I probably would’ve baked them for more like 22 minutes. My friend helping me bake accidentally put more like a cup or more of chocolate chips but they turned out fine regardless, just super chocolatey. I will definitely make them again! Tip: Wal-Mart has 100% pumpkin, canned organic pumpkin."

I always indulge in extra spices, so I’m sure I did here too. Clove, cinnamon, ginger, vanilla, nutmeg, cardamom. Vanilla &amp; cinnamon create a wonderful autumn aroma with the pumpkin."

"reviewBody": "My new favorite pumpkin recipe. Quicker to make than pumpkin bread! Was a big hit!\nChanges I think improved it:\n- Upped it to 1 cup of pumpkin\n- Didn't add the water \n- I sprinkle chocolate chips only on the top once batter is already in muffin tin. Makes a nice bite of chocolate followed by pumpkin flavor vs mixing chips into the batter. \n- Baked at lower temp. 375° F for 18 minutes comes out perfectly in my oven. Moist! I think 400° dries them out."

I doubled the recipe and also did brown sugar instead of white sugar, added an extra 1/4c pumpkin, and added an extra 1/2tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg. I would recommend adding more! The batter will smell flavorful but it comes out tasting flat. I also used regular chocolate chips and think mini would’ve been much better."

Instead of the oil, I used butter, and being the idiot that I am, instead of using cups for the pumpkin, I did it by the can. Turned out VERY well and with a few more chocolate chips was the best muffin that I have ever had! Overall, a family favorite!"
