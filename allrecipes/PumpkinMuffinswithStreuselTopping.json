I also exchanged the raisins for chocolate chips. My husband loved them. I have a lot of food allergies and this recipe did very well with exchanging ingredients, not all do. I substituted a different protein for the eggs and butter flavored crisco for the butter, I used splenda white and brown sugars."

I think some more brown sugar and the pumpkin pie spice in the strussel crumb would really make this better. They came out beautiful it lacked oomph."

Substituted one of the cups of flour for whole wheat flour. My kids don't like raisins, left them out. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, used 1 tsp cinnamon + 1/2 tsp cloves + 1/2 tsp ginger. Doubled the crumb topping. Filled the muffin cups only halfway as they rise nicely. Baked 20 minutes vs. 25 as they get a little dark otherwise. These are SO good."

I also didn't make the topping because I was really hungry, but they are the best muffins I have ever made! I am sure the topping would just make them that much better."

I'm guessing the applesauce really makes it more moist. Don't know if I want to waste this much ingredients again. Maybe try again in 6 months. They look great, just not moist and not enough flavor. Don't think I'll be sharing with my neighbors."

The muffins were fluffy and delicious and the pumpkin flavor really shone through. The next batch I plan to try with dried cranberries for an extra Fall kick. Excellent recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I doubled the recipe following all directions and ingredients. Instead of using the optional raisins I used pecans crushed up. If you use the nuts you can use as much or as little as you want depending on your taste. These were fantastic with nuts I made a few with no strudel topping and no nuts they weren't as great as the ones with the nuts, the nuts really bring out more flavor. My son said they're okay they need more pumpkin which I do agree if you're doing no raisins, no nuts, or no strudel topping they need to have a little bit more flavor. Overall I will be making these again with the nuts and strudel topping."

They taste like a delicious cake, they’re light &amp; airy and they have the perfect blend of tastes. I also like heartier, denser muffins but these are equally delicious. Will make these again."

In the middle of the recipe, I realized I was out of eggs! (I am NEVER out of eggs) but today I was. I had to stop everything, run to the store for eggs. So when I got back into baking, I ended up forgetting one egg and the vanilla. Duh. But the recipe was still fab-u-lous! PS..I added chopped pecans and more golden raisins. YUM! Made exactly 18 muffins, and I used 1 can pumpkin. The 4 tsp pumpkin pie spice brings out the pumpkin flavor!"

I will try using applesauce instead next time and add raw sugar on top too. I also substituted 2 cups of the flour with whole wheat pastry flour. The result was delicious and moist with a little less fat and some added fiber."

"reviewBody": "I really liked these muffins, I think as much as my old stand by recipe. They just need a bit more pumpkin flavor, which I will improve upon when I make them again. Note: add more pumpkin and spices! I agreed with Naples34102 regarding the streusel, and combined those ingredients in the traditional way. It was a nice topping without being overpowering. I combined all muffin ingredients in 1 bowl, starting with the wet first and adding the dry last...no need for a blender, just use a whisk. I, too, added a few more raisins and I think the next time I will add a few nuts also. Reduced the recipe to make 6 muffins, and ended up with 8, this the recipe definitely yields more than listed."
