Also, I needed these to be egg free so didn't add the egg. I swapped one half cup butter for 4 oz applesauce to make it slightly healthier. Lastly, I mega increased the spices, about 1 tbsp cinnamon and 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. These taste well seasoned, as is they would have been bland. With my changes I will be making this often, with such a large batch I froze half of the dough balls. I like using a whole can of pumpkin, these seem like they are adaptable for changing the chocolate chips, different spices, etc."

"reviewBody": "I halved this recipe because I had half a can of pumpkin pie filling I needed to use up, but it still made a lot of cookies. My boyfriend is a pumpkin spice fanatic and nothing I bake lasts very long at all so I expected the same from these. Although he SAID he liked them he also mentioned he may take some to work \"so he didn't eat them all\"-which he has never done before, so I suspect he isn't a huge fan. I found the consistency to be very \"breadlike\" and although it isn't awful it is pretty disappointing for a cookie. I used butterscotch chips because I thought it would compliment the flavors more and they are the best part of these (I almost always reduce choc chips in cookie recipes but definitely regret doing so with this recipe). Very likely will never make these again-with all the great oatmeal cookie recipes out there these are a bit of a bust."

Cook them a little less and they are move gooey with a little extra pumpkin punch, my personal favorite, cook them a little more and you get a fluffy picturesque cookie. The recipe is great for non extract measurements, a little of this and that and it still comes out great."

"reviewBody": "I made three changes: I used Kosher salt. Not regular salt. I did not use mini chocolate chips. This is a robust cookie, and I used a more robust and larger chocolate chip. I used the Ghirardelli chocolate Premium Baking Chips \"Grand Chips\" semi-sweet chocolate chips. The chips are double the size of regular chocolate chips. \nThe other change I made was using Crisco shortening instead of butter. I used the standard exchange guidance printed on the can. ! 1/2 cups butter = ! 1/2 cups shortening plus 3 tablespoons of water. The chocolate chips gave melty chocolate flavor and positive distance from the indifferent quick cook oats and all that pumpkin. I used a two tablespoon scoop and I did not oil the cookie sheet The cookies came up fine from the hot cookie sheet onto a cooling rack. Next time I will use Kerrygold salted butter to see if that unifies and elevates this interesting cookie. and I will leave out the cinnamon or reduce the teaspoon to 1/2 teaspoon. The cinnamon needs to be \"quieter\" in this cookie to let the total flavors come together."

I divided the baking soda and baking powder in half, since Kodiak cakes already contain leavening\n-replaced 1/2 cup of the butter with 1/4 plain nonfat Greek yogurt. You probably could replace a bit more.\n-Cut the brown sugar to 1.5 cups and the white sugar to somewhere around 3/4 cups. Again, probably could reduce a little bit more, but not much less.\n\nThis made 7 dozen reasonably sized cookies for me!"

I was looking for something with less butter and sugar and a little more wholesome, so these are the changes I made: 1) substituted 1/2 of the flour with wheat flour 2) used a mashed ripe banana in place of 1/2 cup of the butter 3) added a couple of extra teaspoons of cinnamon and added pumpkin pie spice 4) added walnuts and 5) did NOT add the white sugar. Overall, the texture was great, and these were a yummy and almost guilt-free snack for me and my kiddos. We keep them in the freezer and microwave for 30 seconds to make them warm. Plenty sweet and very tasty!"

"reviewBody": "Will definitely use this recipe again! Was looking for a cookie combining oatmeal and pumpkin and this is great. Omitted the chocolate but will try adding it another time. Like some other reviewers I wanted to add pumpkin pie spice but since I didn't have any I kept cinnamon as is and added 1/4 teaspoon each of ginger, allspice &amp; nutmeg. Would have also added cloves but didn't have any. Toasted the oatmeal because we like the nuttiness that adds. Many requests to add this recipe to the repeat list, definitely a keeper!"

Adding the oatmeal makes this recipe the best / better recipe than the others because the cookies are more firm - less cake like sticky. And it also makes 70 - 80 cookies depending on your size. We sometimes freeze the extras and save them for Halloween, Thanksgiving, or Christmas. Enjoy!!"

I also used white chocolate chips and toasted pecans. They are a perfect Autumn cookie. I took them to a tailgate and everyone raved about them and asked, \"who made those cookies? They are amazing!\" I will definitely make these again as this recipe replaced my other pumpkin cookie recipe which made a more cake-like and sticky cookie."

I used full size chocolate chips, and I cooked them longer 15-16 minutes, though some I forgot and left I around 20 were good in a slightly carmalized crunchy way. It has to be the oatmeal that is making the difference. Excellent texture, and easily switched for butter chocolate chip cookies."

"reviewBody": "Fantastic cookie that is soft and a little \"bready\", which I really like. I have a 4 year old gluten sensitive child and just substituted the white flour with a gluten-free mix. Usually this results in a grainy/gritty texture that I don't much care for. (Baking gluten-free is a real struggle especially when I can almost always tell the difference and don't like it). In this case, thanks to the pumpkin it comes across just fine. Will be making these again!"

They come out soft inside with a slight crisp on the outside. For more flavor, try using pumpkin pie spice, the nutmeg added a little something extra. I always put a little extra spice in there. Also, I used a cookie scoop to get them in just the right size and shape. Try them with dark chocolate morsels or butterscotch chips, both excellent!"

Like others, I halved the recipe as it makes a HUGE batch. We still ended up with over 4 dozen small-medium cookies. So, I used butternut squash instead of pumpkin, coconut oil for 2/3 of the butter, egg white only for the egg and regular size dark chocolate chunks. I omitted the spices except the cinnamon. My 8 year old daughter pronounced them - SOOO good. I didn't tell her they were made with squash. They really are delicious."

Kind of a cross between the traditional pumpkin cookie and a chewy choc chip cookie. The oatmeal almost disappears. I added more spices and used a whole bag of white choc chips. I flattened them with a wet butter knife and sprinkled them with orange sugar. I got 4+ dozen with half the recipe using a melon ball-type cookie scoop.
