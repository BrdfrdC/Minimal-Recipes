"reviewBody": "Meh. The flavor was okay, but what really brought the rating down was the consistency of the batter. It was just way too thick. It refused to spread on the skillet, so I had to spread it with a spoon. Even so--even after adding additional milk to thin out the batter--cooking them long enough to cook the center resulted in a burnt exterior. The inside was gummy, even when fully cooked. For the record, I have no problem with \"plain\", buttermilk or banana pancakes; just these."

I made 4 pancakes Sat., refrigerated unused batter, then made 4 more Sun. from this recipe. The only variation I did was to add 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp sugar. Canned pumpkin - was trying to use up canned pumpkin on-hand. Thanks so much for contributing this recipe to allrecipies!"

"reviewBody": "Very, very good pancakes. Super tall and fluffy. My only changes were I added chopped walnuts and used AC instead of white vinegar. One thing to add about vinegar, in addition to helping the rise as a chef pointed out in their review from last month, is that it turns the milk into buttermilk. Many home cooks use this hack rather than keeping buttermilk on hand for baking, etc. You don't taste the vinegar in the end product and you're actually making pumpkin buttermilk pancakes.. a win-win. Thanks for a really good recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Made this for breakfast this morning for the first time. I read all the reviews and saw such varying results that I was a bit concerned, but as a professional chef, it looked like a good recipe with appropriate amounts of spice vs pumpkin. Not everyone is going to like a given recipe; that is why there are so many different versions of a recipe available; people have different tastes in food. First: Pumpkin pancakes are more moist than regular pancakes. Second: Regular pancake recipe usually do not contain sugar. Pancakes are, traditionally, not sweet. The syrup makes them sweet. I absolutely love this recipe! My husband had seconds and also thought they were great. I only made one (necessary) alteration. I used almond milk as I cannot drink cow's milk. These pancakes are light (for those who cringe at the thought of vinegar in their pancakes, it does not taste and its purpose is to react with the soda to help the pancakes rise, which it did very successfully in this light and tasty pancake. The pancake is not overly spiced; you can taste the delicate pumpkin flavor instead of all the spices, which is a good thing. Now for my rant! I do not understand why people alter a recipe and then write a bad review. If you are going to review a recipe, try it as written and review that. Then make any changes you may feel necessary."

I only made some very slight changes; I used pumpkin spice instead of the separate spices and I added the vinegar to the milk and let it sit for a few minutes while I combined the other ingredients before adding it to the batter. Otherwise I kept to the original recipe and these turned out great! The batter wasnâ€™t too thick, the pancakes were light and fluffy, and plenty of delicious pumpkin flavor."

The 2nd time I made these I subbed a cup of wheat flour for almond flour (lowering carbs) . no one noticed! These are tasty. I used organic pumpkin, canned, which was tasty. Going to try fresh next time. I also added a cup of chopped pecans 2nd time.. yum!"

On the spices I took out the ginger, oil and vinagre, I got really creative and used a box mixture of fluffy pancakes and added 1 egg and instead of water like the box called for I used milk for the Pumpkin purÃ©e I used 1cup and As far as the spices I used 2tsp of each pumpkin spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, 1 tsp vanilla, top it with pumpkin syrupâ€¦Delicious will make this again and againâ€¦."

Turning up the temp on the griddle didn't help, nor did cooking them longer. These pancakes wouldn't cook through; it was as if the interior is supposed to be mushy like pumpkin pie?? If you read the other 1 &amp; 2-star reviews, I agree with everything that was said. I don't understand the high ratings for these pancakes."

I was surprised there was even a call for vinegar but it balances out perfectly. Additionally, I also happened to be out of maple syrup so I used agave nectar, and it paired perfectly. Great recipe. The batter runs a little thin, so just make sure to give it plenty enough time to cook on your griddle before trying to flip it."

(I doubled the recipe and used 1 can of pumpkin and an individual serving of applesauce.) However, it was more like a cookie. It didnâ€™t cook on the griddle and needed more of an oven cooking than being cooked like a pancake. I tried round two and added some milk, but it was still too thick. Round three I added lots more milk, two eggs, and another round of brown sugar. It was good and still tasted pretty good. But based on the recipe, this is a solid 2 stars in my book. Probably 3.5 stars with adjustments."

Maple syrup goes great with the pancakes as does whipped cream. Thank you!"
