The middle came out nice and moist, but the ends were a little hard and almost burnt. I noticed some reviews mentioned lack of taste, but I added a tsp of vanilla extract and the taste was pretty good, but maybe I should have done 2 tsp. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it, but I think it still has room for improvement."

I also added a tsp of orange zest and 1/4 c orange juice. The recipe made 24 muffins and 2 mini loaves, baked at 350 for about 20 mins. Very flavorful, moist, and firm. The apple and orange juice brought out the flavor and provided a nice balance to the pumpkin."

"reviewBody": "This was AMAZING!! My husband who is not easily impressed said that it was really good. I had to adjust the amount of ingredients to 12 servings using the servings adjusted because I didn’t have much flour, and it made one perfect sized loaf. I did substitute the water with orange juice after seeing another recipe. The orange juice did not flavor it but according to the other recipe, makes the loaf moist. This was so soft, moist and delicious! I’m not a big fan of pumpkin pie but I love Starbucks pumpkin loaf, and this puts it to shame! Fast and easy to mix up too! Wish I had enough flour to make 2 loaves because this one is almost gone! Just may make it again today."

Finally pulled it out of the oven and the centers of each loaf sunk. Then where I went to turn them out of the pans they both stuck."

After reading reviews, and knowing what my family likes, I replaced 1 C flour with 1 C whole wheat flour, doubled the pumpkin pie spice, reduced sugar to 2.5 C, and replaced the 1 C oil with 1 C of additional pumpkin puree. This made 24 muffins, baked for 25 minutes. \n(I use a heaping 1/3 C of batter per muffin.) This is a keeper!"

Even with the addition of more cinnamon (1 Tablespoon) and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/2 cup molasses, plus 1/2 cup of walnuts it still lacked moisture and enough flavor.\n\nAlso, it had to be tented within 30 minutes with aluminum foil, rotated half-way through (both pans), and it still was done in 60 minutes, so I'm glad to have kept an eye on it and pulled it 10 minutes before the allotted time.\n\nI will try again by adding 1 teaspoon more salt, plain yogurt (1/2 cup), and 1/2 cup raisins soaked in boiling water and allowed to cool.\n\nWith the changes I'll make above, the outcome should be much closer to my original recipe which was dense, moist, had the right balance of flavors and spices--and didn't need anything on top.\n\nI do appreciate having something to go by to prompt my memory so thanks for sharing this recipe."

In one loaf of the bread I added a bag of milk chocolate chips. The other loaf I didn't add anything extra. The loaf without the chips took approximately 10 minutes longer than originally called for but the loaf I put the chocolate chips in took about 20 minutes longer. I also put aluminum foil over the 2 loaves about 40 minutes into the cooking process so they didn't get too brown on top. I will make this recipe again."

We stock up on the smaller higher sugar content pumpkins in the fall when they're available, slice in half, seed, and bake on parchment until soft, then scoop out the pumpkin, purée and store in 1 pound increments in Ziploc bags in the freezer"

I'm also gluten-free so I substituted GF flour for the white flour. The bread tastes GREAT and inside is moist and yummy but the outside got burned. If anyone has ideas for preventing this from happening, would love to hear them."

It's part of how my dad always made pumpkin pie, and I really like the taste vs pumpkin things made without it.\n\nIt's definitely better the second day, and even without any sugary topping, it is great!! I'm thinking the next time I might add some nuts or berries, or maybe substitute apple cider for the water. Lots of opportunities to play!"

"reviewBody": "I made this twice! My rule for trying out new recipes is to make exactly like the recipe is written so I can review the actual recipe and not my changes to a recipe. As written this recipe is a true winner. I did halve the recipe since I could only find one of my loaf pans, but there's only two of us so that's not necessarily a bad thing. The second run I added pecans to the batter and sprinkled the top with raw sugar that retains it's crunchiness after baking. The recipe was still wonderful and a bit more unique. I would suggest that if you are sprinkling with the sugar to make in a muffin tin as it was a little harder to slice and keep the topping in place. My gas oven has convection bake so I cooked at the stated temp but needed to add an additional 10 minutes. This is normal for my oven so not a big deal. The loaf came out nice and chewy on the outside and very moist on the inside."

The flavor was missing something in my opinion. Dunno, it just didn't come close enough to pumpkin pie to warrant the label. I've made a ton of pumpkin bread recipes. This one comes somewhere in the middle."
