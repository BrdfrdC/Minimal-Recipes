"reviewBody": "I usually find something 'off' about store bought pumpkin pie spices, but this is a base that's easy to make with proportions that are easy to remember. I like cloves AND allspice, so since both are similar, I did **1.5 tsp. of cloves + 1.5 tsp of allspice (1/2 of each) to equal the 3 tsp. of allspice called for. Then I added about *1-2 extra Tbsp. cinnamon to taste. I've put it with delicious results in cinnamon rolls and pumpkin pie at a ratio of about *2 tsp. cinnamon to 1.5 tsp. pie spice, and the spice blend was perfect! No one spice negatively overpowered the others; no, \"WOAH, easy on the cloves next time! Can't even taste the ginger!\" Obviously, if you don't love cinnamon like I do, you may want to skip my additions. :)"

Mixed this up, and it was every bit as good as the expensive store brands. There's no need to ever again buy the big bucks store brands. I made a half-batch, using freshly-ground nutmeg, and it filled up my McCormick spice bottle."

Since I was close to running out and didn't want to go to the expense of buying it, just for coffee, thought I look for a recipe online. Not surprised to find it on this site, which is ALWAYS my go to site for things like this and I am NEVER disappointed!! Thank you all who participate."

I used this for pumpkin pancakes and it was amazing. Just 1 tsp added to the batter. We usually put 1/2 C of applesauce in the batter to lighten them, but I think next time I will try mixing the applesauce with canned pumpkin."

I'm glad I found this one. Thank you!"
