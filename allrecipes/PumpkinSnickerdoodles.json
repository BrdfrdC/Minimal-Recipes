We have bought Pumpkin/Snickerdoodle muffins which we love from the grocery store. So, I decided to give it a go. We were both extremely pleased with the outcome... I hate when people say \"the only change I made was...\" but from the picture you will see I used a decorative glass bottom (Crown Royal) to press the cookies down and it gave them a really festive look! Thank you, Jenna, for this recipe."

Pumpkin seemed to only add color. Thankfully I had the allspice, because these needed every bit of extra flavor. Mine looked fine, more puffy ball shape than flattened typical snickerdoodle shape. They're decent, but not what I was expecting. Followed recipe to a T."

"reviewBody": "I made these with a few substitutions for what was in my pantry. I used shortening but I only had whole wheat flour so I used that. I also only had dark brown sugar so I used that instead of light. I see what people mean by these being very cakey. You could probably use a little less flour or perhaps bump up the cinnamon and nutmeg. I added extra spices to my sugar mix and that helps with the extra cakiness taking away some flavor. With that much flour, it could probably use more sugar in the dough. Just a few tweaks and I think these would be much better. I certainly would not say they’re awful like some reviewers. Just needs a bit more sweetness and spice! Plus you have to like cake like cookies!"

"reviewBody": "I did make these using half butter and half shortening (my go-to Snickerdoodle recipe calls for butter instead of shortening). The pumpkin flavor was subtle, which is what I was hoping for. They did not spread/flatten the way my regular Snickerdoodles do, but that seems appropriate since they are basically denser, non-rising Pumpkin Bread. Can't speak to a flavor increase after a few days, since the cookies were baked and then transported several days prior to eating, but I can say that the raw dough had a more pronounced pumpkin flavor than the baked cookies did. Would be perfect with a Cinnamon tea or with coffee."

If I make again, I think I will make them into bars instead with a thin cream cheese glaze with a little cinnamon/nutmeg/clove either mixed in or sprinkled on top. The flavor is okay, but it is missing something. Can't quite put my finger on it."

I can only believe that the previous reviewer(s) didn't follow the directions correctly. I would advise as with any other recipe where you cream the fat and sugars together to beat for approximately 3 minutes to get that fluffy consistency."

If I make them again I'll enhance the spices &amp; pumpkin. Anybody have ideas on how to make them more \"pumpkimy\"? How bout that for a new word!"

They are definitely better the second day. I brought them to a family reunion, and everyone LOVED them...my cousin posted on social media a week later about how he enjoyed them! Recipe easily doubles. Definitely a keeper."

"reviewBody": "This is my recipe and I just wanted to mention this: Snickerdoodles are traditionally made with shortening and cream of tartar...this gives them a distinct taste and appearance. You can substitute butter for the shortening and skip the tartar (which can produce a \"tinny\" taste) but it might also alter the shape of the cookie. If you like a little more spice, add a little more cinnamon or some pumpkin pie spice. **I wasn't intending to rate this recipe, just wanted to make this note.**"
