I do think the cream cheese frosting could use a bit of flavor tweaking. It reminded me of the frosting on a typical carrot cake. I think it could use more pumpkin spice flavoring. Overall not bad but most likely would not bake again. I think there are better, more true pumpkin flavored dessert recipes out there."

I used oil instead of butter, added the whole 15 oz. can of pumpkin and baked the cupcakes for about 22 minutes. I piped on the frosting, so I needed an extra 1/4 of the frosting recipe. If you just spread it on, you will be fine with the recipe amount as is."

My husband thought it was too cream cheese tasting, so next time I'll only add 3/4 bar of cream cheese. I also used 1/2 c of milk and 1/4 c of hazelnut creamer. I didn't notice a huge difference, so next time I'll use 1/2 of creamer and 1/4 c of milk. 12 cupcakes were ready in 22 minutes. Jumbo muffins took 5 more minutes. After putting on the frosting, I sprinkled some cinnamon sugar to top. Btw, the recipe makes a lot of frosting!"

I followed the suggestion of oil instead of butter and buttermilk and texture ended up great- moist and definitely a muffin, also thanks to heaping tablespoon of baking powder! And I agree that being heavier handed with the spices will be fine and adds good flavor. Used only 2 cups of powdered sugar for frosting and it seemed to be still a bit tart- maybe 2.5 cups next time, but probably not the full 3! Def a recipe to make your own! I was worried and it worked out. Will be making these again throughout fall season. Also, 8oz cream cheese didnât seem like would be enough for the frosting but it was fine for 12 good sized muffins"

The portions for 8 servings made me 12 mini cupcakes. I was surprised they tasted good even though they were missing most of the ground spices ! Haha I did follow the recipe exactly how it said and they came out super moist. Definitely going to bake these again, using all the ingredients."

Best cake Iâve ever had, and its so fall its perfect. It was very moist and in the process of making the batter it curdled but it was fine and still delicious."

"reviewBody": "I followed the cupcake recipe to a T. And I agree with previous poster that rating this recipe with changes is not a true rating of THIS recipe. I would have given this 3.5 stars if the option existed. My family and I \"Liked it\" and it was more than \"It was okay\". I did these as mini cupcakes (reduced the time to 15 minutes) and it yielded about 70 minis. I think I might try oil instead of butter next time. I'm fairly new to baking, and so I'm learning a lot by trial and error but don't know enough yet to get creative and try my own variations and substitutions. I did have to add more powdered sugar to the frosting because I over mixed and the frosting was too runny, but otherwise, I find the creaminess of the frosting as a good balance to the slightly dry recipe of the cupcake. In any event it is a hit with my family and one of my twins said it was her favorite cupcake I've made yet (and I've made quite a few!), so that's saying something, I guess. :D"

I did however read other reviews &amp; made changes as suggested: used 1/2c canola oil in place of butter &amp; 1 1/2c pumpkin(definitely gives much better moisture &amp; texture), omitted cloves(not a fan) but increased all spices &amp; salt to 1 tsp. The cream cheese frosting is wonderful... I only used 2 1/4c of powdered sugar &amp; just sprinkled enough cinnamon to suite my taste.

I haven't finished frosting all the cupcakes (with the added ingredients made 30 total cupcakes), but seems like I will probably need to make more. I have tasted the frosting and it is sweeeeet. Next time I will probably reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup. Other than that, the cupcakes are so delicious and moist. They are very fluffy! I want eat them all.\n\nHighly recommend this recipe! Thanks!"

I used the entire can of pumpkin puree and heaping spoons of unexpired spices (I suspect the people complaining that the cake is bland are using old spices that lack potency). I baked for a bit longer due to the extra puree, but the cake turned out moist and good.\n\nThe first time I made this recipe, I used half that batter for cupcakes for my family and the other half as a small cake in a foil pan as part of a meal for a sick friend. The second time, I bake it in two cake pans and made it into a layer cake. All turned out great. \n\nIt would also be good without the frosting as sweet muffins or with some streusel topping."

"reviewBody": "I followed the recipe exactly as is and they came out fluffy, light and delicious. I read the reviews and decided to stick with the original recipe, because I think adding oil takes away from the flavor. I have made other cupcake recipes on Allrecipes and read many great reviews, with great advice, that has turned an amateur cook, into a \"can I get that recipe\" type of cook. The first advice is, use fresh quality ingredients. I recently learned from a reviewer that baking soda gets flat quickly, so I buy several small boxes and use a fresh one when I bake(baking soda helps with the rising). Second bringing the refrigerated ingredients to room temperature is very important. The third and most important thing I have learned is in the incorporation of dry ingredients with the wet ones. I use a hand mixer to mix the wet ingredients, however to incorporate the dry ingredients into the wet ones, I use a spatula since I don't own a stand mixer. I use the spatula in a folding motion until the dry ingredients are blended and there is no visible flour, this helps keep air pockets in the batter and what helps make them moist and light. the last thing is the time, do not keep them in too long, for my oven 20 minutes was perfect. I decided to look for this recipe after eating a cupcake from a local grocery store bakery, because my kids loved them. They said these are better than the bakery ones! Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe! It was a big hit and I am baking several"
