"reviewBody": "This is the second time I have made this recipe. I must have liked it enough last year to remember it this year. Some of the complaints are weird, so I will sum up my experience: You're making waffles from scratch. Yes, it is going to be a little messy. It is not worse than normal. If you're having trouble cooking, something might be wrong with your waffle maker. My little, ancient thrift-store pickup managed it twice now. They do look like a mess at first - if you open the waffle maker too soon. If you close it and let it cook longer, the batter should solidify. I find that the waffles don't have a strong pumpkin flavor, but that's okay. They are still good. The cider syrup is delicious. This time, I didn't have eggs on hand, so I used applesauce instead. It worked perfectly. I also used a wheat flour, since I was out of AP. On top of that, I added some pumpkin spice to the batter."

"reviewBody": "Absolutely excellent waffles ( I didn't make the syrup, but would like to try it next time). I just substituted maple syrup for the brown sugar and added a couple teaspoons of natural maple extract. These did not turn out dense at all; they were crisp on the outside, light inside and wonderfully flavorful. Overmixing might be what caused some people to have dense waffles. Mix the flour into the wet ingredients just until combined. There may be some lumps, and that's OK. Also, don't overmix the beaten egg whites; it's OK to have a few white lumps. Letting the waffles sit in a 200 degree oven for a few minutes after baking them helps crisp up the outside. I will definitely add this recipe to my favorites!"

Also I used another tip and used 1 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice and 1 tablespoon cinnamon instead of the ginger and allspice combo. YUM! Yes the batter is a bit thicker than normal waffle batter I make, but I cooked longer and they turned out perfect. Also to the reviewer who said this is a 'messy' recipe; I make waffles from scratch all the time and this is no messier than normal. Maybe I'm just a slob! I will say the waffles are not sweet per say, but the dynamite syrup makes up for that. I did not change a thing when I made the syrup. Follow it as is (including the butter at the end) and you will not be disappointed!"

There were six of us and I had enough leftover waffles to freeze. Hopefully, they will freeze well as waffles usually do. I doubled the recipe for the apple cider syrup and glad that I did, it was delicious and can be used on pancakes or maybe even on a plain sponge cake. I will definitely make this recipe over and over again. Some of the other reviewers complained of dense waffles - mine came out very light and fluffy, they were actually moister than waffles usually are."

"reviewBody": "So admittedly I did not make the syrup as we did not have any apple cider in the house. So maybe that makes all the difference. But these \"pumpkin\" waffles did not taste like pumpkin waffles to me. They were good. But my family and I could not taste the pumpkin nor could we taste any of the spices. We are big pumpkin fans so that was a total let down. If I were to make these again, I would definitely up the pumpkin and spices. But I will probably just search for a different recipe instead as I'm not quite sure how increasing the pumpkin puree would impact the fluffiness of the waffles themselves."

I also had leftovers that I took home to give to family members and the waffles , that I had frozen, heated up nicely in the oven still wrapped in the tin foil. I didn't put in the ginger bc I thought it would be too much spice going on so I did add a little more cinnamon. I made mine in a Belgium waffle makers, not sure if that makes a difference for others. The pancakes were light in texture and taste but the flavor really came out when adding the syrup. A very special part of our brunch. Will do this again and again!"

Would be amazing on SO many things!\n\nThat being said, the waffles were good, but as many other reviewers stated, they were fairly dense, even when folding in the whipped egg whites. It must’ve been the pumpkin purée. I also couldn’t taste any pumpkin, but it may have just needed a little more of the spices.

You also can put a cup banana to fill in for the pumpkin completely! You only have to make one change to make it banana muffins. Also, you can only use half a cup of banana and half a cup of pumpkin to make a mix waffle."

We even used a Belgium waffle maker which normally produces deep crisp waffles, this recipe turned out fluffy and light. This recipe has good flavor but doesn't over power. Unfortunately, we didn't have anything on hand to make the apple cider syrup with. To replace that though I made a cream cheese type filling but cut back on the sugar. Amazing."

I followed the recipe exactly but did make a couple of rookie mistakes following simple instructions, as per my usual. In spite of my efforts to ruin this recipe, it came out fantastic. The waffles are light and tasty. Not too much pumpkin, not too little. The syrup is delightful. Creamy and not too sweet. My only thing that is wrong with this recipe is that for my tastes, it doesn't make enough syrup. I feel like the syrup portion of this recipe needs to be doubled. Thank you for a GREAT recipe."

The only substitution I made was to add slightly more cinnamon to the recipe and replace the lemon in the sauce with orange and orange zest. The orange flavor is a perfect fall compliment. My only complaint is that the waffles never got crispy and cooking time did not make a difference to change this fact. I cooked these for 4-5 minutes. We'll make these again!"

After mixing together the dry ingredients, I mixed in all the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients instead of mixing them separately, and also made it more simple by using 4 eggs and not separating the eggs and the yolks. Very good recipe!! But I don't see the purpose behind separating everything and creating more work. It is truly a great recipe without the additional steps!"

"reviewBody": "This was a really great recipe. I'm not too into the separate the eggs type, and I unfortunately had a yolk crack into my egg white bowl, so I never got fluffy peaks to fold in. That being said, I still got a nice waffle out of it. Not dense, but hearty. I liked it a lot. As for the spices, I have a HUGE container of pumpkin pie spice in my cupboard, so I omitted the spices (ginger/allspice/cinnamon) for slightly the same total measure of pumpkin pie spice. It came to 1 1/3 tablespoons, I just used 1 1/2 tablespoons for the same servings and it turned out great. I also just double the whole recipe and used 1 can of pumpkin since I saw no point in wasting it. The waffles turn out great, but the spice still almost felt underwhelming UNTIL I added the cider syrup. Changed the whole dish. The whole family chowed down like nobody's business, my toddler went back for thirds, and I still had some to freeze for quick weekday breakfasts by doubling the recipe. Definitely in Sunday morning rotation"

After trying it the way it is written I liked my accidental changes better. It makes it more flavorful. I also like to make waffle batter the night before so I skip the part about whipping the egg whites and folding them in afterwards. It makes the prep time a lot faster and the waffle still turn out nice."

I haven't tried the Apple Cider Syrup yet because I like the Maple Syrup that is made/sold in my area. They are also delicious with cream cheese or homemade cream cheese frosting on top!

Since others mentioned a bland taste, I tripled the seasoning and sugar which gave it a nice but subtle flavor. Some said the syrup recipe was not enough for the waffle recipe so I tripled the measurements and had more than enough. Waffles were good alone but really good with the apple cider syrup. They were dense and did need to cook longer in the waffle iron - some almost got burned but it's all good. This is definitely a recipe I will make again."

I added vanilla to the syrup after removing it from the heat. The syrup tasted good but would have been better with the waffles. The syrup was to thick so I'll use less corn starch next time."
