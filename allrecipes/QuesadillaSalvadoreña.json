I did exactly what is written on the recipe, except that I added a little bit of vanilla extract and added a little bit of raisins the bottom of the pan because I don’t like sesame seeds. I sprayed the aluminum pan with a spray that had a little flour in it so it wouldn’t stick and it is perfect and delicious!! Thank you so much for sharing it with us!! Will be making it for church whenever we can meet again! I’m Dominican but I thought I’d give this a try! Our church is a Hispanic congregation, so I know they will enjoy it very much! I mean, who wouldn’t?!! Thank you!!"

I felt awkward asking for her recipes when she was ill and in her death bed. Ive made this recipe for the whole family and they all LOVE it. My husband now said that this is his favorite recipe and always compares ANY quesadilla to this one. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for this recipe that even some Salvi family members have asked me to share with them. The instructions are so simple. Once again thank you so much"
