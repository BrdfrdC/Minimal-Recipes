You can change the filling, but use this recipe as a guide to make sure you aren't under- or overfilling your quesadillas. This is a good starting point for someone who hasn't made them before."

"reviewBody": "Making quesadillas in a frying pan is my preferred way to make. I spray the pan with just a little cooking spray. If using larger flour tortillas, fold them in half and place two in the pan, and they are easier to flip. I usually use Mexican blend cheese, but I love using half mozzarella and half cheddar. The submitter's idea of putting in a dash of hot sauce inside the tortilla is great. I prefer to put olives, salsa and avocado on the side."

"reviewBody": "My family has made a slight variation of this recipe for years. The main variation we do is that we add a very shallow coating of vegatable oil to the pan before placing the tortilla in it, and fry the tortilla until it is slightly crisp on both sides. It makes for a crunchier quesadilla, and when cut into slices, it makes a great appetizer or movie/game snack. Good basic recipe, thanks!"

I didn't have any avocados, so that was omitted. I used taco sauce instead of pepper sauce. And I added some black beans. I simply put the tortilla down on the hot (med heat) skillet, and put all of the fixings on that. Then I topped with the second tortilla and flipped it over, letting that side crisp up. They were delicious! I dipped in sour cream."

They turned out perfectly browned. Do let them sit a couple of minuets before cutting them so the cheese won't ooze out."
