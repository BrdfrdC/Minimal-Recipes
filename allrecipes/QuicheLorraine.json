This has been my go-to recipe and I always use half &amp; half or whipping cream, whatever is on hand. This time I had some Gruyère to use up! Green onions (scallions) work best in my book and I always use the hefty amount of bacon. Precooked-chopped-and crisped up with the onions in the pan! I love how creamy the custard cooks up."

(My husband didn't want a crust.) This came out so soft and delicious. I will definitely make it again."

I made Spinach and Mushroom Quiche, but most of the recipes I read called for 8 eggs, which are 4 too many. The quiche turned out beautifully delicious, thanks to the proper, proportional amounts. This is a great basic quiche recipe, using many different cheeses, vegetables and meats. I used grated gouda in my Spinach and Mushroom Quiche this time, but I have also used grated gruyere. Both were a hit with my family. I'm looking forward to making the Quiche Lorraine soon."

"reviewBody": "This is the base recipe I use whenever I make quiche. It is wonderful as written tho I would point out you really do need a deep dish pie plate to accommodate the entire amount. I really prefer the flavor of the onions if I saute them first. But having said that we have used a multitude of different vegetables and meats with great success. Chopped ham, crispy bacon, steamed broccoli, spinach etc all good! Love the pie crust from the freezer case at Trader Joes to make this come together even quicker. I have no tolerance for hot/spicy foods at all but the pop of cayenne in this recipe is perfect and distinctive and I believe is part of this recipe's stand out above the rest success! Sometimes we serve it with a little hollandaise and toasted english muffins on the side YUM"

"reviewBody": "First of all it takes more more time to prepare than 15 mins! It took me an hour and a half at least before it went in the oven. I baked frozen pie crust, sauted the onions to get some of the moisture out of them, cubed and fried a ham steak in a little butter and teaspoon brown sugar, grated all the cheese - gruyere and old white cheddar -and finally I didn't have any heavy cream so I had to substitute it with sour cream, melted butter and milk. I made a mistake by not dredging the grated cheese in flour. It turned into big clumps when i put it in the egg mixture. Think I would sprinkle the cheese on last over the egg mixture in the crust next time. \nI put the pies onto a baking tray which was good because it spilt quite a lot because I over filled them.\nIt turned out delicious so I'm glad I made two of them. I doubled the recipe and added an extra egg and a tablespoon of cornstarch just for safety."

I cheated and used precooked bacon to speed up prep time and since I couldn't find pre-shredded swiss cheese anywhere, I used a 6-oz pack of sliced swiss and just chopped up the slices into small chunks. I also skipped the cayenne pepper and sprinkled in Tajin seasoning instead, made it perfect. This is my go-to quiche recipe from now on."

I also put the chopped onion in the microwave with seran wrap covering it for about 1 min so they onions were translucent. I cooked the quiche for 20 min at 425 then dropped it to 350 for about 45 min. It always takes longer than you'd think. when I take it out of oven, I drape more swiss on top so it slowly melts as it is cooling. Oh, and I use whole milk instead of cream. Sometimes I add a tablespoon or two of cottage cheese or sour cream. QUiche is a great recipe to thro all sorts of things in it!"

Also it is enough for close to 2 pie crusts (store bought).\nDoubled the onions and sauteed with garlic. \nDoubled the cheese.\nUsed 14 strips of bacon instead of 12.\nRequired a smidge more cream. \nI make it frequently and freeze one fully baked quiche for later."

"reviewBody": "Thanks for the recipe Laundrie - my Quiche Lorraine turned out great!! I did make a few changes: as previously suggested I only used 1 1/2 c. of half-n-half (it would have overflowed if I used 2 c.), baked for 5-10 mins. longer, and I used more cheese and onion. I also added 2 pinches of dry mustard to the wet mix. The quiche consistency was a perfect creamy custard mixture. The only thing I might do different next time is to mix the ingredients in the egg mix before pouring, that way it's part of the batter (my husband didn't like it only on the bottom). This is also a great base for other types of quiches. Thanks again for sharing!"

Since I over shredded the large block of Swiss cheese, I ended up putting in a rounded cup but I'm sure it didn't make a difference. I also stuck the pie crust in the over for 6 minutes before adding everything in. As others have said, there is no way another 1/2 cup of milk could have fit into the pie crust, especially since I think it could have used more bacon. I also followed the advise and sautéed the onion with the bacon grease and since I don't have cayenne pepper, I used crushed garlic which I sautéed with the onion as well. It turned out great for the brunch and there wasn't any of it left."

IF I were to make it again, I wouldn't cook it at 425 for 15 minutes. I would use less cream and I would sautee the onions before additing to the quiche and I would cook it longer!

I made this crustless (like a lot of quiches I make), and it came out great. I saw comments about the onions being crunchy, so I sauteed them in 1 tblsp of butter for about 5 min. I layered half bacon, half cheese and half onions, and repeated. I wanted to use up what I had on hand, using micro-bacon and 1/2 regular milk and 1/2 heavy whipping cream. Cooking times worked very well. I tried some after 10 min (couldn't wait!); a little loose at that time. Delicious tasting Quiche Lorraine; just how I remember it. Once it sets up in the fridge, the texture will surely improve. Thanks - great recipe! UPDATE 10/26/17: My hunch was right. Much better texture the next day, just delicious!"

I also used a dash of nutmeg instead of the cayenne pepper. I used a deep dish frozen pie crust, and cooked the quiche 15 minutes on the higher heat and then 45 minutes on 350. It turned out perfectly and the crust did not brown too much. I did not have to cover the crust edges with foil!
