"reviewBody": "So I made an account just to leave a review and this was my first experience with almond flour. I made this recipe twice. First time as directed but my syrup was the keto monk fruit syrup and you smell that syrup all day. Yes these are more dense but that was expected and they refrigerated well. Tasted fine though I had to limit myself due to being on a keto diet. Second time I replaced the syrup with two packets of stevia in the raw, and it made the batter thicker. They cooked just fine but may need to add more fluid of some sort to allow the batter to make a thinner pancake as I ended up with fewer that were very thick but cooked very well with the pan covered. Still tasted just fine but didn’t have that monk fruit taste Or smell I had the first time. I also ended up with fewer pancakes. So next time I will add more fluid and keep with the sugar substitute instead of syrup. This recipe works for me as a great base."

Obviously gluten free pancakes aren’t ever going to be as fluffy as regular ones, but this recipe is pretty tasty and so easy. I made lots of almond flour pancake recipes from online and lots of them were fails, they would crumble and be just too soft and falling apart. These stay together, are easy to whip up, and taste pretty good as an alternative. Again, it’s not like regular pancakes bc it’s hard to repeat that type of consistency with almond flour, but for what it is, it’s good!"

I use pure cane syrup, 1. because I was raised on it here in Louisiana, 2. taste great, 3. better for you because, it's the real thing, and 4. a lot lower in carbs than other syrups. I already ate one, that's why there is only 3 on the plate. One is all I can eat. Very filling."

I did make 2 adjustments that I think made them less dense than they were reported as being (mine were nice and light): Substituted 1% Milk for the water and added a teaspoon of Baking Powder, and I let the batter rest for about an hour before I made them. I also threw some cinnamon in...because I like cinnamon in my pancakes! Will definitely make these again!"

Almond flour just has a less satisfying texture for me. That being said, my kids both liked them so as a healthier option I may make them again and grow to like them more. I did use milk instead of water and after I tried a couple I ended up adding a quarter cup greek yogurt and a few pinches of baking powder. It helped a little but I still felt I was chewing on ground nuts. lol (I hope someone else gets a good laugh with me.)"

"reviewBody": "I made these, just a few minutes ago, actually-- And taste wise, they are amazing, instead of maple syrup, I used 1 and a 1/2 tsp of Pyure sugar substitute, 2/8th cinnamon (Smell was there, but taste didn't follow through, so needed a bit more!), 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 tsp of baking soda (After reading comments for less denser pancakes), and only used 1 egg, and 1/4th cup of unsweetened almond milk, with a splash extra to give it a nice smooth consistency--- The batter looked so nice, and smelled heavenly, but like many of the other commenters, it did end up being on the dry side, and a few fell apart on the edges , I suppose that has more to do with the almond flour, than anything else, though. Would definitely make these again, but double the recipe, because it only made 12 slight bigger than silver dollar sized, so it fed 3 people, 4 lil pancakes each. Small dollop of whipped cream and fresh fruit, you can easily dress this up and make it beautiful and elegant. Great base recipe"
