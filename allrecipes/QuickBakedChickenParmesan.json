I used the quantities shown for 6 servings and used only two chicken breasts, which I pounded to about 1/2\" thick. As a result, I cut back both cooking times by 5 minutes each. Worked out great, and I have extra breading to keep refrigerated for the next time."

It would be so dry. \n\nI'd recommend pounding the breasts out so they're all even, about 1/2\". Then bake at 400 for 15 mins, top with cheese, and bake another 5-10 (check temp with a meat thermometer or cut a piece open)."

Because I used Italian bread crumbs, I had to cut back a little on the spices (cut in half). I only dipped in the breadcrumbs one time. Mu favorite sauce is Prego Roasted Garlic and Herb. Don't forget the important step of putting cooking spray on the top before placing in the oven!"

Baking the chicken rather than frying it is healthier Some things that I did differently - when I tried dipping the chicken in the egg for the second time, all of the breading fell off so I didn't do that for the rest of the chicken pieces. Cooked the chicken for 30 minutes instead of 40 as another reviewer suggested. Used homemade sauce. Chicken turned out moist. Will make this again."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is an easy, family pleasing recipe. I tried to stay as close to the original recipe as possible. I had seasoned Italian breadcrumbs so I did not need to add the seasoning specified in the recipe. I recommend using a baking sheet and rack instead of a regular backing dish. I used mine and the results were chicken breasts that were crispy on both sides. Once my chicken was cooked thoroughly, I turned on the broiler just long enough to get a pretty brown color on both sides before soooning a little sauce over and adding the cheese to each breast."

"reviewBody": "Really delicious! I sliced my breasts in half so that they were thin. I baked them on a rack set inside a 9x13 pan which worked well. This is the first time I've made Chicken Parm without the bottom being mushy! I used a combination of traditional bread crumbs and panko crumbs and only dipped it in the egg and crumbs mixture once. I was afraid all of my crumbs would fall off in the egg for the second dip. It only needed about 20 minutes before I added the sauce and then 15 with it since the breasts were so thin. We served it over Orzo. Yummy! This will be my go-to Parm recipe."

I made for a Home Ec project and thanks to this dish I got a 95. The only thing I messed up on was I almost put the breading into the egg mixture. Overall a good dish to make if your parents like chicken parmesan and I just like it with more cheese. The addition of the mozzarella and not just the parmesan."

Also, if you want to spice it up a little, here are a few tips:\n- Breadcrumbs - split up total measurement for bread crumbs (2/3rd Panko | 1/3rd Herb/Garlic Bread Crumbs)\n- Add a few dollops of either low fat ricotta or whipped cream cheese on top of each breast for the last 15 mins\n\nEnjoy!"
