"reviewBody": "Our family of 5 loved this! It was just the right amount for us! I doubled the garlic (we love garlic) and added fresh shredded ginger (we love ginger). Otherwise, I made it as is!, and it was wonderful! I made Rice a Roni Beef rice with it, and everyone took the amount of rice/stir fry they wanted. I put the soy sauce bottle on the table, and a few added extra soy sauce just because they love it. Mmmmm! Be sure to prep the veggies first, start the rice (if you serve this with rice), and then start the recipe. The wok heats up fast, and veggies need to be ready, or you'll overcook the meat. Also, our grocery store's meat department cut the steak into 2 inch pieces for me (though they were more like 4 inches, so I snipped them in half with a scissors - still it helped with prep). Thanks for an awesome recipe! We will be having this again for sure!!!"

I preseasoned my steak with S &amp; P and let it rest at room temp before cooking. I used 1 Tb of sesame oil and 1 Tb olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Browned the whole steak 3-4 min on each side till it was cooked medium. I took it off the heat and put in minced ginger, minced garlic, chopped peppers, onions and broccoli florets into the pan. I also added a tsp of hoisin sauce to the soy sauce and sautéed the veggies until slightly softened. Then I sliced the steak and added it to the veggies to reheat it for about 3 minutes. Served over rice. Delish!"

Didn't have broccoli but it was good with just red bell pepper and carrots. Perfect over a cup (or two--it's that savory) of rice. Will make again for sure!"

I used sliced ribeye. \n\nI added some red pepper flakes to it, for a little spicy bite. \n\nI'm going to try it again with chicken and asparagus. \n\nThe homemade teriyaki sauce is very good. I boosted the ginger because I'm fond of that flavor. About twice as much as the recipe called for."

I followed the instructions to the letter as I often do when trying a new dish.\nMy wife and I both loved it!\nWill definitely make it again but will probably add some mushrooms and cherry tomatoes. Also will use Tamari Sauce instead of Soy Sauce.\nMy only complaint would be that it would in no way feed six people (I think that is what it said).\nAnd to those who say it is bland, maybe so but put a jar of Chilli Paste or Spicy Mustard on the table and let everyone season it as they please. I just used a little more Soy Sauce and it was great!"

I dumped that into a bowl and put broccoli, red bell pepper and zucchini in the pan with a little more garlic olive oil and a splash of coconut aminos (soy allergy). When the veggies were done, I put the meat back in the pan, added another splash of coconut aminos, stirred it up and served it over rice. SO good! Can’t wait to try it with other veggies!"
