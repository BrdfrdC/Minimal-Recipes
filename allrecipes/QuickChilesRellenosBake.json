After I cooked them I toped with sour cream. If your tortillas are a little stiff I put them in the microwave for 13 seconds before you add any of the peppers, that way they rolled up nice. If your are a chile rellenos fan you will love this reciepe!"

I used fresh green chiles, charred them over an open flame, peeled, removed seeds and veins. I also added some shredded beef I had leftover from another recipe on this site. I just melted cheese over top of the enchiladas while baking and left the sour cream and salsa to be added on the side."

I used the 10 minutes enchilada sauce recipe from this sit that I added low fat sour cream too. I also used 50% low fat pepper jack to cut back on some of the calories and low fat tortillas. You never would have known it was a lot fat dish. Very easy to make and very tasty."
