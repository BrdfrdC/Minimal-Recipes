"reviewBody": "IDK if I'd call these actual \"cinnamon rolls\" but they satisfied a craving for something sweet and cinnamony at 10pm at night. Like others said the dough was extremely sticky so either less milk or more flour. I put almost a cup of flour down on the counter and on the dough. I also had to coat with flour before even picking it up out of the bowl. I think they need way more baking powder because these came out very heavy and not \"light\" at all like you would expect cinnamon rolls to be. I baked them for 20 minutes in a gas oven and they were mostly crunchy on the outside. I should have checked them at 16 minutes and taken them out at 18 minutes max. I think 25 minutes they'd be rocks all the way through. I am wondering if I did squish them all together in a pan if they would have been softer. I didn't have a 9x9 so I used a 9x12. I also only got 10 out of the roll out as I couldn't roll it out any thinner because the dough was getting stickier even tho I kept adding flour. I also sliced with a pizza cutter BEFORE rolling. There was no way I was rolling a 14\" slab of sticky dough. Like I said.. these worked for satisfying a craving. It did take me 60 minutes from start to eating, not 40 like it says, but what's 20 minutes? I may make these again but with the few changes and they should be better."

I added extra flour from the start after reading the reviews about sticky dough and they weren't kidding. Crazy sticky. Lots of extra flour in the recipe and on the surface and it was still extremely difficult to roll. They taste fine, but I think I'll go ahead and put in the extra time and do a yeast recipe next time"

Next time I'll spend the extra time using a yeast based recipe."

Work quick to begin rolling and you should have no issues with dough."

The cinnamon rolls did not rise much after being baked, and you could still see my cut marks. It was like eating a day old cinnamon roll that was left out and reheated, kinda hard like a pizza crust.

I added about half a cup extra flour, halved the milk and added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dough and it turned out perfect! Only thing is it did not make 18 (only made 6) and i forgot to add butter to the dough before adding the cinnamon-sugar so it all was falling out. The cinnamon sugar mix was also very sweet but maybe thats because I'm Italian and not used to too much sugar in things. Overall, it was a great recipe and so easy to make since I'm only 14. I just think maybe you should adjust the milk and flour or it will be too wet."

It's more of a fold instead of a roll bc it's so heavy it keeps going flat. Cut them into appropriate sizes and attempted to shape into cinnamon rolls. Ended up with soft cinnamon sugar biscuits."

The cook time was longer for me, but that was probably because I used a slightly smaller pan and they rose very high in the middle of the pan. I will make these again but, use a 1/4 cup of sugar as we can taste the baking powder. Gives them a biscuit flavor. All in all a fairly decent recipe with potential to be great, with slight adjustments."

"reviewBody": "The dough needs a extra 1/2 C of flour to become a dough. Plus dough for dusting surfaces. Someone else's review said \"the ammount of flour is right you just need to knead for 15min to develop the gluten\" bruh it's supposed to be a no knead recipe. You missed the point.\n\nThe salt needs to be reduced to a pinch. Someone else's review mentioned it \"tasting like playdough\". This is why. The recipe ends up making a very salty base. \nFor reference a entire cake ie a 4C flour recipe generally takes 1/4tsp of salt, this is a 2C flour recipe and it asked for a whole tsp of salt. So doing the maths, this recipe is 8x more salty than normal baking. I'm assuming anyone who didn't complain about a playdoughy/salty taste, must have just completely skipped the salt cause they were lazy, in this case it was a good call.\n\nCalling it 18 rolls is ridiculously exaggerated. Making 12 rolls I was cutting 1cm high and 3cm wide (unbaked).\nTiny!!! Idk if it would be physically possible to cut a roll smaller than that.\n\nAnd finally, it's a American recipe, so for anyone not living in the USA, you should automatically half the sugar, which I did, and it was still plenty sweet. I'd forego the sugar at the bottom of the pan, and just try get it all in the roll. The sugar at the bottom just solidified into a crust.\n(as I was worried it would, but hey, always worth experimenting, my optimistic side hoped it could've gone like a selfsaucing pudding, except it just... didn't...)"

That could not be more accurate. I had such a hard time trying to need the dough adding about a half cup if not full cup of flour didn‚Äôt measure just added a little at a time. This process took and extra 10-15 minutes between washing my hands and the cup used for additional sugar. Even after flouring the counter and rolling out the dough in the final step of rolling the cinnamon buns prior to cutting it started sticking again! I had re re flour the surface and almost back roll the dough so I could continue to roll it. Over all now easy and not quick they were still fairly white after baking for 25 minutes and it seemed a lot of the sugar came out the bottom and caramelized. The texture was cooked not fluffy but not overly dense either , had a little bit of a floury/doughy tase. They were OK but not great. I would probably not make this recipes again. Can‚Äôt upload picture from iPhone due to size requirements."

"reviewBody": "The recipe is really good.\nOnly adjustment I would make is on the quantity of flour - for half the qty - I used 1.4 cups of flour . Best would be to start with the 1 cup and add the rest to make the dough manageable"
