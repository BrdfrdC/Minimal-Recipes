Sat back and enjoyed more wine. it was fantastic. so good I would make it for company served with green beans and some risotto, they will think you are a culinary genius."

I bake on a rack so it's crispy on both sides. I pair with my creamy parmesan mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli and my family goes nuts! This is an absolutely delicious recipe, thank you for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "It already has five stars so we know it’s good. And it’s Versatile! I changed it at the last minute, though. Had just put the mustard in the bowl and I suddenly decided that with Parmesan cheese I’m thinking Italian! I removed the mustard and added Italian season . Also substituted water for wine. The cold chicken caused the butter to harden so I think next time I will dip the chicken in buttermilk first instead of butter. \nNote to any novice cooks: Critical to the success of this dish is flattening the chicken breasts —pounding and making thin, particularly if you use the supermarket chicken breasts which are huge due to growth hormone. I flattened my chicken breasts to about half an inch and they were actually doubled in size; so you’ll need a large pan."

I cut the recipe in half, filleted the chicken breast thin (instead of pounding it), and it turned out well. The white meat was moist and tender. The only problem I encountered was that the chicken, still cold from the fridge, caused the melted butter in the sauce to congeal and stick to the bowl rather than the fillets. I may try brushing it onto the chicken next time."
