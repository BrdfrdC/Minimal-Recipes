Fisher house has some items in the pantry like cheese, spaghetti sauce, eggs, hot pepper flakes, parmesan cheese and croutons so I made this dish. I used meunster cheese because that's all I had. This exceeded my expectations. It's the best eggplant dish I have ever had. I added extra hot pepper flakes because I like it like that but omg delicious. My husband and kids don't like eggplant because I usually stir fry it but I was bragging how good this was on the phone to them. When I get home I am making it for them and I know they're gonna love it. 5 stars especially for not having to use the oven."

Instead of marinara sauce, I used the last bit of pizza sauce that was in the fridge. I added a little sugar to it to sweeten it up some. I was pleased with the texture of the finished product. The taste was good, too."

First I laid the eggplant slice's out and sprinkled salt over them and let them sit for a couple minitues, then used paper towels to soak up the water that the salt pulled out. Then I added flour to the slices after the first batch (bread crumb stuck better) before putting them in the egg batter. I also put them in a browine pan when i added the sauce and broiled them to melt to cheese. Everything came out Faboulous!!"

I had to add a little more water to stretch the egg wash. I also used more sauce because we like it that way. Thank you for sharing this wonderful dish!"

I changed things a little by heating the tomato sauce in a separate pot while the eggplant was cooking then I put it on top of the eggplant when everything was done. I put the shredded cheese on and put a lid on the pot for about 2 or 3 minutes and the cheese melted and it looked and smelled great. Red pepper flakes kicked it up a little which I liked and I had plenty of leftovers. Great and easy dish."

Set oven to 375 and baked slices till golden brown. 4. Made my own sauce made of crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, garlic salt etc. 5. After slices were baked to a nice golden brown I pulled them out of the oven and THEN spooned my sauce and sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top. I found that doing it this way keeps the crusty outer parts of the eggplant crispy bc they aren't soaking in the sauce. My and my husband really liked this recipe."

Absolutely DELICIOUS!! Raves from all around the table. I may try cooking it in peanut oil next time but just following the recipe and YUMMY! I had never even had eggplant before. I'm definitely making this again!"

I am normally a super healthy eater but was craving eggplant and had hardly any ingredients in the fridge after being out of town...used light mayo instead of egg to adhere bread crumbs and used extra parmesan to make up for no mozzerella on hand....tasted delicious but will not use much oil next time."

Also I used a medium-large eggplant so I quadrupled the sauce and used a healthy 1/2 t of red pepper. Placed the finished eggplant in a 250 degree oven for the cheese to melt while I finished making the pasta and side dishes"

It did take longer to cook than the recipe specified but it was worth it. As others suggested, I baked the cheese in a 200 degree oven for a few minutes, then turned it up to broil to brown the cheese (and the garlic bread) a little."

I did take other reviewers tips and after frying the eggplant, I placed on a baking sheet and spooned spaghetti sauce on and topped with cheese then baked until cheese was bubbly and slightly browned. Family (even my son who is a picky eater) loved it. I served it with left over spaghetti and meatballs and garlic bread. What a hit!!! Will definately make this again. This is the first year we have grown eggplant in the garden but will from now on for sure. Thank you for posting this recipe."

I drained moisture first, then cutinto rounds, crumbed, fried, placed in baking dish - 1 layer only, topped with pasta sauce then cheese and baked for a while. yummy. I think cut the eggplant about 1cm in thickness, no thicker. Thanks - I'll try load my pic"

To cut some of the fat, I fried the eggplant in a nonstick skillet with only 1 tsp. of olive oil and used reduced-fat (Kraft 2 percent) mozzarella. Served it over whole grain penne. YUM!\r\nI used Barilla bottled sauce but overall found this dish to be kind of salty (even though I looked for the lowest sodium breadcrumbs I could find), so next time I would omit the salt when boiling the penne to make up for it."

The only things I did differently is slice the eggplant about 1/4 inch thick, instead of 3/4 inch and I peeled about half of the peel off of it in verticle strips around the eggplant. I used 1 Tbs. olive oil in a non-stick skillet, it cooked all the way through and nothing burned. Served over whole wheat spaghetti made for a perfect meal. THANKS!!!"
