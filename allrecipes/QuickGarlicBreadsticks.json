I had all my nieces and nephews up this weekend and those kids ate them like hot cakes! Everyone got their own cute little garlic breads that crisp up like french bread pretty well!! The parmesan mix makes it! DO NOT SKIP!"

Only change I made the 2nd time today was: I used 2 Tbs melted butter, 2 Tbs ghee/clarified butter, and 1 tsp garlic paste to brush on the bread. The ghee has a higher smoke point, so it kept the whole thing from burning as easily as it has in the past when I used only butter. It soaked into the bread beautifully, very much like store bought frozen garlic bread. Will definitely make again."

I used sub buns that I had in the freezer, while still frozen I buttered and seasoned them then sliced them in 2 inch sections. I also used fresh basil which made it really fragrant and beautiful. I popped them in the oven right before it was time to eat then piled them high on a serving dish. There was nothing left! I love this recipe because it reminds us to use what we have available."

If you want to vary the presentation a little, you can prepare the garlic bread following the same recipe but just before toasting cut the hot dog buns in strips. Viola, you have garlic breaksticks. After they are cool, I store them in a cute tin on the counter by the stove....they make great quick little snacks. Good with soups or pasta dishes. Enjoy."

There are variations you can add as \"toppings\", such as real Bacon Bits (real,not imitation), sliced mozzarella or cheddar cheese (cut down to size), pepperoni. \nAs far as the recipe goes what we do is use 1/4 to 1/2 stick real butter (softened) and use crushed garlic and just mix everything together then spread the mix on the rolls then add our topping and bake."

However, I always make my own garlic bread by mixing the garlic and seasonings with the butter--I think it makes it more flavorful--so it was par for the course in this house. I also added some fresh garlic to the mix bc I just love garlic. I used hamburger buns since I had those but no hot dog buns. Thanks for the recipe!"
