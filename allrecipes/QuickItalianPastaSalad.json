I use it as meal prep and I never get tired of it!"

Hubby isn't a fan of raw onions, so I add chopped chives instead which are much milder, but still give a hint of onion taste. A good 1/2 cup of parmesan - it is the salt. I throw in small bocconcini if I have them (yum!) . I probably use more veg overall, I add oregano, and I don't use the dry dressing mix."

I would use a high quality pepperoni instead of the salami and I would only use 1/2 pound. I did not care for the dressing at all, but the body of the salad was excellent. I will find a dressing I like better, use pepperoni, but keep the rest of the recipe intact. It was a beautiful presentation."

I was at home looking on here for a recipe that would fit our tastes and found this one. While he was preparing the ingredients, I happen to notice that they were very similar to the ingredients in this recipe. Only a couple of things were different. He added pepperoni and cucumbers instead of the black olives and parmesan cheese and used a 16oz bottle of dressing and 1pkg of the dry instead of what this one called for. It was delicious. We loved it! We plan to follow this recipe next time so we can compare. I was just amazed at how much alike this recipe and his recipe were. Thanks so much to \"both\" creators. Soooo tasty!"

I only used about 1/2 cup dressing or less to my liking. Red onions gives it a bold spice but I love red onion so amount was great. Awesome recipe my family loved it. I will make again or for potluck for Thanksgiving. Yummy"

The dry packets are magic. I tasted the salad after each dry packet addition. You really need all 3. I followed this to the letter. Will make again."

"reviewBody": "This is the best recipe for pasta salad ever! \nI make this for every event I go to and I always get tons of compliments. The thing that makes this recipe so good is the dry Italian seasoning, it makes all the difference. I start with 2 packs and only add the 3rd if I feel like it needs it. I do add more veggies, like cherry tomatoes, broccoli and cucumber. And I think this is the reason why 3 packs of Italian seasoning works for me because I'm adding more to the salad.\nAlso.. I have also made it vegetarian and its still just as good.\n\nA few tips.... After pasta is cooked, run cold water over it and then add a little olive oil. Also, try topping it off with McCormick Salad Supreme Seasoning. (you wont be sorry you did.)"

I think I let the pasta cook too long and the ingredients got lost in the process because the pasta was too swollen (lol). Will try again and only cook the pasta for 12 minutes or less."

I also used one packet as others suggested and Olive Garden Italian Dressing. No added salt was needed. I added mozzarella cheese sticks cut into bite size pieces some blanched baby carrots and grape tomatoes for color and variety. Everyone enjoyed it and this will be my go to pasta salad from now on."

I'll cut back on the onion either since that too was a bit much. Maybe it's because I used a large red onion instead of a smaller one, but there was too much. I'm a bland person, I know. This salad just packed too much of a punch for me personally. Mom and brother loved it though!"

I used 2oz can of black and about 3oz kalamata olives (b/c I read a review that said she used those), and it was WAY too many olives and very salty. I also used 1 package of the Italian dry dressing which was sufficient. I used pepperoni since I like that better than salami. Next time I will use only 2oz of black olives or even omit them entirely. Overall this recipe is one of the best I've ever tried and 2 of my compliments were from fantastic cooks."

I didn't dice the meat, I cut into more of a chopped size. I used packaged, whole milk mozzarella, instead of the balls (very soft and creamy). I used Olive Garden Italian dressing and made this the night before. The next day I needed to add about a cup more of the dressing. It was the hit of the party that night and I will definitely make this again!"

I did not add the dry italian dressing, thought it would make it too salty. It was fabulous!! I also omitted black olives and used Salad Supreme seasoning from McCormick's that gave it a little extra flavor. I meant to add cucumber but forgot to buy at store but that would make a great addition to this salad. Kids loved it!!!"

I used pepperoni instead (personal preference) and added a cup of zucchini. Tomato would be a great addition as well. With a few personalized tweaks, I'm super happy!"
