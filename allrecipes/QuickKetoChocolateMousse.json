And it took close to three times the amount of sugar to be the least sweet."

I also used 2 tablespoons of avocado that I mashed up and blended with the cream cheese. It made it a thicker mousse and you can‚Äôt taste it at all. It was amazeballs! I could not tell this was keto at all! If you‚Äôre reading this and you already made it and didn‚Äôt have success. Try again and you‚Äôll love it! \n*I don‚Äôt use stevia other than for dishes like this on occasion"

"reviewBody": "Thanks for the base recipe! I used xylitol granular sweetener but put it through the bullet to make it powdered and I only used 1/8th of a cup which was plenty for me. It definitely hits the chocolate and sweet craving. It's true you don't need much, its filling. Delicious, thanks again!"

"reviewBody": "An excellent recipe. I have made this on 2 occasions and it was brilliant both times. I used erythritol and didn't have the issue some have complained of when using it. didn't crystallize in the refrigerator. i think its because of how long i whipped it for. I added a teaspoon of instant coffee to the vanilla before adding it to the whipped cream. I used one tablespoon hersheys special dark cocoa powder and one tablespoon hersheys 100% cocoa powder. I'll use a little less sweetner next time though. a tad sweet. I got 4 servings on each occasion I made this recipe. Keto or not I'll be making this recipe one of my regulars. Thanks for the amazing recipe."

"reviewBody": "I made this as an alternative to another version that doesn't use the cream cheese, but everything else. I found this recipe to be slightly heavier/greasier (not in a bad way), but also not quite as \"harsh\" of a taste on the tongue as the counterpart I have been making for several weeks now. It helps to satisfy the sweet tooth cravings, but I think the cream cheese flavor is a little too strong - it tastes more like a chocolate cream cheese frosting than a mousse."
