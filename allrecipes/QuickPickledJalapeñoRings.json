Only one whole garlic clove and pulled out after the 10 min. Left serrano peppers whole but did poke holes in top and bottom so the insides could get filled. The oregano was a game changer. It was just like the name brand but more crunchy and less expensive."

I seal the jar and tap the bottom edges to get the bubbles to rise open the jar and top it off. I repeat until no more mixture will fit. I posted a jar I just made and one made several weeks ago.

I have always liked pickles, green olives and other deli items. This recipe keeps a slight crunch to the jalapeño rings, so I only leave them in the pan for the 10 minute timeframe. It is easy, quick and a great addition to eggs, tacos and quiche. So good!"

"reviewBody": "Good basic recipe. I also added onion, black pepper, serranos, a bit of citric acid, and totally omitted the sugar. I live in NM and we rarely use sugar with jalapenos. This also makes a great salsa verde (with or without tomatillos.) Use lots of fresh cilantro for that fresh taste. Just blend to desired consistency. Serve with chips, meats, tacos, etc. I'm making mine for my Memorial Day hot dog fiesta! This is just one of the sides. Everyone should be able to get at least 3 hot dogs each so they can mix and match the toppings. Should be fun!"

Once I got comfortable with the recipe I started experimenting with the amounts of sugar. I use less than 3 tablespoons for jalapeños but I will use the full 3 tablespoons for a very spicy bunch of peppers. But as always I follow the recipe exactly a few times until I’m comfortable with it and then going forward I make adjustments."

"reviewBody": "I’ve never been a fan of jalapeño peppers until recently, all of a sudden I can’t get enough of them. These homemade ones are so delicious and superior to anything store bought I’ve encountered. I harvested a bunch of Serrano Peppers off my plant and decided to use this recipe to pickle them so they don’t go to waste. They are definitely missing the distinct “jalapeñoness” of the original but the brine still gives them a great flavor and their little zing adds a great pep to our dishes. I love this simple and easy recipe for dealing with an abundance of peppers! Thanks, Chef John."

I do prefer to stuff my jar tight then add the very hot liquid and put tops on fast, as this will seal the jars. Cover the jars with a towel to cool and listen for the pop sealing sound. When sealed they can be put in the cupboard. If any jars do not seal then put in the fridge, and use first."
