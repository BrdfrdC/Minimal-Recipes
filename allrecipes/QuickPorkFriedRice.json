I will keep this recipe for other leftovers! thank you!"

That was the perfect amount of rice to vegetables and meat. I also added a spoonful of hoisin sauce per another reviewer's recommendation. The vegetables to meat proportion was perfect - except, feel free to increase the amount of mushrooms! I think I'll double them next time."

I also added just a tiny smidge of Chinese five spice during the stir fry. Be VERY careful with that last spice as it will dominate if too much is used. How much is a smidge? Just a pinch between finger and thumb but maybe half of that. Try it. You will know if you used too much. Mine came out tasting great. That spice also adds aroma."

Its worth the extra time making it!!!"

Listening to other reviews I added 3 Tbls of soy sauce, but I was worried that it might be too sharp or too salty so I added a tsp of brown sugar to the soy sauce before adding it to the recipe . I also added a tsp of sesame seed oil for flavor. The vegetables (especially the celery) took longer than 3-4 minutes to soften, more like 15 minutes. Next time I will take that into consideration in the timing of the meal."

Definitely would make again!"

Oh and it requires 10 stars not 5."

Make them slightly soft scrambled; the heat when you add them to the hot rice will finish them up. And for added flavor: a little butter in the oil, about 2 tsp sesame oil, and about 1-2 tsp MSG. Excellent! And of course adding other bits of meat is always good: shrimp, diced ham, chicken, etc."

I did read the other comments and made just a slight adjustment of only using 4 cups cooked rice (6 cups cooked rice is way too much) and adding 3 scrambled eggs. I recommend to definitely add more soy sauce to your taste. I also added some Hoisin sauce for a little spice. I have never used fresh ginger, but it was definitely worth it. This would be great with broccoli. Will definitely make again!"
