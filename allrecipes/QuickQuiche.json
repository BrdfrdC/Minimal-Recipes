I swapped Colby Jack cheese for the Swiss because that is what I had on hand, and I sauteed the onions in the 2 Tablespoons of butter before adding - the flavor this added was AMAZING! I think next time, however, I will drain the butter before adding in the sauteed onions, there was a pool of grease at the top of the quiche when it was done baking. Lastly, I took another reviewer's advice and only added in 1 1/4 cups milk - I will be keeping this measurement as the texture of the quiche was PERFECT. I love how customizable this recipe is, I will definitely be making this again!"

Hoping next time to have Swiss on hand so as to experience this wonder fully! If cheddar is all you have on hand, it's best omit the butter. Would love to try this cold, but I fear that it will be all gone by tomorrow! Edit 2018: Tried this with a tsp of curry in the mix - still delicious but in a whole new way!"

I cooked until all moisture was gone from the spinach. I sprayed my pie dish w/PAM and crumbled the bacon in the bottom, then topped w/the onion and spinach mixture. I topped that with generous handfuls of shredded cheddar, then poured the custard mixture over all. I used half and half in place of regular milk and baked for 40 minutes. It was absolutely delicious and as you can ready from other reviews, very adaptable. Thank you!"

I followed another reviewers suggestion,, and put in some of the bacon grease for added flavor. Yum. I've made this recipe before but it was with Bisquick instead of flour, and I think I prefer the the Bisquick. After it came out of the oven and sat 5 min it settled and became quite flat. That's ok it was just as good. Next time I'll add some mushrooms. This is a keeper."

"reviewBody": "OMG!! This recipe is FANTASTIC!!! I've always been afraid to attempt making another quiche after I ruined one many, many years ago. I was inspired by the video and the reviews, which both emphasized ease and success, and boy were they right! I added asparagus pieces, used cheddar, and baked it for 45 mins. (not sure if the ceramic quiche plate I used takes longer, or if making it in my toaster oven required the extra time; I may raise the temp next time to see if I can get it right in the 35 mins. instructed). I couldn't imagine a quiche w/out a crust, but after making this one I don't see any need for a crust. During the baking process, it almost seems as if some of the flour in the mix sinks down to the bottom of the plate and ends up turning into a sort of soft crust on its own. The end result is perfect, easy, and the taste is AMAZING! I will make this recipe for the rest of my life! Thank you a million times over!"

Depending on what’s on hand, i’ve added fresh mushrooms, baby spinach (cooked and cut up), green pepper, a smidgen of chili powder (it livens up scrambled eggs too, but just a pinch in both cases) and sometimes cut back swiss cheese a bit and replace it with old cheddar.Still it’s great as published here too. So i give it 5 stars"

I made this recipe - as written - for Christmas brunch, since we are pressed for time due to travel obligations. I threw in one bag (12 oz.) of frozen chopped broccoli (after fully microwaving it). I did not saute the onion, although I was tempted to (doing so is not needed). I also did not layer the recipe, but mixed it altogether. I made it the night before, put it in the fridge and microwaved it the next morning. Easy and tasty. Recommended!"

"reviewBody": "I love this recipe! This has become staple in my recipe collection. The first time I made it, I follwed the directions exactly and WOW! The base recipe can also be tweaked to suit your fancy. I ALWAYS USE 1% MILK and usually omit the butter (the cheese has enough oil on it's own although they do say \"Everything's better with butter\"! That said - I've made an all veggie version with bite sized pieces of steamed or a package of frozen chopped spinach that I've defrosted and squeezed by, then added it to a bit of diced sauteed onion, and sliced mushrooms, I've added dijon mustard or dried mustard, I've substituted diced ham for the bacon, I've switched up cheeses and have used cheddar (the pre-shredded stuff is fine), swiss or gruyere.. My only other tweak is that I add a heaping teaspoon of baking powder to the flour to add some additional lightness to the quiche. Last but not least, the quich fits perfectly into a square Pyrex baking dis."

Here is what I did and it came out really good - kids loved it.\n\nCook the chicken and shrimp (I cut the shrimp in bit size pieces) with half the onion and half of one jalapeno) with bit of crushed peppers and a pinch of allspice as we like our food spicy. You can adjust the spice to your need. \n\nHappy eating!"

I took one reviewers tip and used 1 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of plain Greek yogurt (mixing it together before adding the other ingredients. I also used Monterey Jack because it's what I had. I sautéed the sweet onion until caramelized and then threw in a diced red bell pepper. I also used Whole Wheat flour instead of AP for added nutrition, and folded in grape tomatoes sliced in half and a diced small avocado. So basically, this is a great base of ingredients that allows you to use up anything fresh you have on hand to make a great meal! I served mine with hot sauce, my husband had it with toast."

Then I added left over baked ham and broccoli lightly fried with garlic (also left over from a previous dish). I used half milk and half heavy whipping cream ( left over from a previous dish) I went with pancake batter instead of flour and add shredded Cheddar cheese on top after the egg mixture.
