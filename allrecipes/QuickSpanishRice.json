I used 1 1/2 cup of uncooked rice. I then simmered as directed. This way you do not get overcooked rice. It was very delicious and everyone loved it. Next time I think I would add a little more spice but keep everything else the same. Thank you for the great recipe!"

I used only 1tsp of chili powder because one family member doesn't like spicy food. This recipe made enough for 4 meals as a side and two mixed with cheese and beans to make tortillas. I will definitely make this dish again."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe! I did make my own modifications. I didn't have celery, so I omitted it. Omitted the bouillon cube since I didn't have that, either. I didn't miss either of them. I also omitted the butter. Instead, I pan fried 3 slices of bacon. After mopping up all but about a Tbsp of the drippings I added 1 Tbsp of garlic infused olive oil to the frying pan to saute the onions and green pepper. I chopped &amp; added the bacon the rice and tomatoes before simmering . I did the entire dish, start to finish, in the same electric frying pan. It was a hit!"

"reviewBody": "I did not have celery so I omitted. I also used left over white rice from Chinese take out last week, and instead of canned tomatoes, I used three 10 oz cans of Rotel with chilis. This came out near perfect. It is a keeper! The only thing I may do differently next time is perhaps lessen the amount of chili powder. It had a bit of a kick to it due to amount of chilis I already added, but it was a total hit with the less tender-tongued in my house lol"

I remember using bacon in an old Spanish Rice recipe, so next time I think I will use bacon grease instead of olive oil or butter for a little extra flavor. I will definitely use this recipe again."

The only thing that I did differently was to use brown rice instead of white, because that's what I always use. We all loved it, so I'll definitely be making it more often. Thank you for reminding us about this easy &amp; delicious side dish."

"reviewBody": "I omitted the celery (for some reason, I didn't have any on hand this week and didn't want to spend extra money at the store), increased the garlic and went a little easy with the chili powder. I used pre-cooked brown rice. Heating this through for 20 minutes was unnecessary. I think if I had done that, my rice would have been WAY overcooked. Tasty, though a little salty for our tastes. The kids especially liked this. NO leftovers."
