It looked amazing and it was so easy to put together. I put all the other toppings in a divided dish so everyone could put on what they wanted to. This worked out very well and my salad was a hit! I will definitely make this again! Next time I will add avacado to make it authentic."

"reviewBody": "This was yummy, I have not had a taco salad in forever. I only had 1 lb of beef and so I made 1/2 recipe. I am not a fan of raw onions, so I decided to chop the 1/2 onion and sautee it in 1 Tblsp of safflower oil until transluscent. I then added the beef and an addition of 2 minced garlic cloves and a dash of garlic salt and black pepper. For the taco seasoning I used Penzeys Brand. It is more natural and less sodium than the packets. I used 96% lean ground beef from Trader Joes. I layered the bowls with torn lettuce from a bag of butter lettuce and radicchio mix also from TJ's. Then added about 5 broken ranch flavored tostado rolls chips, 1/4 chopped tomato, a tblsp or so of lite sour cream, 2-3 sliced olives, about 2 Tblsp of sharp cheddar cheese, 2-3 tblsp of medium Chi Chis brand bottled thick and chunky salsa. After that I layered 1/6 of the cooked meat and onion mixture, then topped that with about a tblsp more sharp cheddar and 2 tblsp more med salsa. This was so delicious. I did have to write down all of the precise measurements because I calculate calories currently. Made as is 1 bowl came to about 305 calories. That is fantastic. Thanks"

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I ALWAYS add refried beans to mine and this makes it taste 100% better in my opinion. Also, as for the onion...I fry it up in the hamburger to \"hide\" it so my 7 year old will eat it and doesn't even know they're in there."

"reviewBody": "I have been making this for many years now, but instead of using corn chips, I make taco shell bowls out of burrito sized flour tortillas and serve it with taco sauce on the side like a salad dressing. Just use oven safe small bowls (soup size works best), invert them on a cookie sheet (only 4 will fit each sheet), spray them very lightly with oil and place a tortilla over each bowl. Bake at 350 degrees for about 8 - 10 minutes. Let cool for about 2 minutes then remove the shell from the bowl and continue to cool a few more minutes on a rack. The tortillas will take on the shape of the inverted bowl while baking. They are light and crispy and I think taste much better than corn chips."

"reviewBody": "The original recipe for this came out in the 70's, I believe, and I think it was published by the folks who introduced Catalina salad dressing - the dressing the original recipe calls for using. It is delicious on it! Also, French and 1000 Island. And the original recipe also uses a can of drained kidney beans. We like black beans or Ranch style. Such a great recipe! I never buy taco seasoning...usually just add what I have on hand, garlic powder, cumin, chili powder, all the things in taco seasoning anyway - and less expensive. You can also add salsa to the meat after it is browned. Doing that with tacos also helps your meat to bind together and not fall out."

When the grand kids (10, 12 &amp; 16) were here enjoying a taco supper (with all your trimmings!) they had several taco shells break and then piled what was left of the tortilla with more trimmings and we haven't looked back for another taco night. This does it all. Super delicious and everyone gets to do it themselves. Great for me and fun for the kids!!"

They all have the same basic ingredients and it really comes down to personal taste as to what you add and subtract. In an effort to clean out the fridge, I added pinto beans and green peppers to the meat and used up a bag of fresh spinach by mixing it with the lettuce."

As it is it's the perfect summer night dinner when you don't want to heat up the kitchen cooking a lot and don't want a heavy hot meal. I used tortilla chips and didn't have shredded cheese so I just used a can of condensed spicy cheese soup heated up. I did top my salad with some homemade guacamole as well. This is easy to customize to what you have on hand and suit to personal preferences. Great summer recipe!"

Many who I serve to don't like taco seasoning so opt to use plain ground meat instead. Besides ground beef or chicken try pork because it's tasty too. And simply 'must' add diced avocado that has been tossed in lemon or lime juice and some fresh chopped cilantro to the ingredient list too"
