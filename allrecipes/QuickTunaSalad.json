Nice light and healthy lunch which I'll surely make again!"

I used more tuna than the recipe called for, which meant I had to adjust the other ingredients as necessary. On the whole, it was great. I added Old Bay seasoning, red onions, a pinch of garlic powder, and a little minced onion. This is definitely a keeper in my weekly rotation. I also anticipate that I'll be able to add pasta to it and make a nice tuna/pasta salad. On the whole, I rate this 5 stars!"

Mylove said that he had a taste for the tuna salad from his childhood-the tuna salad his grandmother made for him when he was a little boy. I doubled the recipe and it was too \"wet\". Mylove tasted it throughout as I added 2 pouches of Starkist tuna (no draining needed), 2 T each finely chopped celery, onion, 2 T. sweet relish (no juice), 1 T yellow mustard and 2 boiled eggs, finely chopped. After the final taste test, Mylove said, \"Now THIS is the tuna salad my grandmother made for me when I was a little boy. Let's eat it now on kaiser rolls with lettuce and tomatoes tonight instead of waiting for tomorrow.\" It's great to be appreciated!"

But this was excellent. I will be making it this was from now on. Actually, I didn't use sweet relish, I only had tangy dill relish, but I don't think it would make much of a difference. It was still good."

I also add 1/2 tsp brown mustard for a very slight tang, a pinch of salt, and fresh ground black pepper to taste. You could eat it right away, but it gets even better if you refrigerate overnight to let the flavors come together. I have bypassed many a tuna salad because it had raw onions and celery in it. And don't get me started on chopped hard boiled eggs..."
