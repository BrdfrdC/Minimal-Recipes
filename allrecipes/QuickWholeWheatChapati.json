"reviewBody": "A friend of mine from India, recently introduced me to this healthy, wholewheat, unleavened, tortilla that makes for a delicious sandwich wrap, soup dunker, hummus dipper, etc,... Paru's recipe is basically identical to this and I followed it exactly. In an effort to avoid over-processed foods tainted with preservatives and \"white powder\" substances like white flour &amp; sugar, this is an amazing substitute for us. I think it works best after the dough has been refrigerated for at least 10 minutes. Keep a bowl in the refrigerator for up to four or five days and just make tortillas as needed. Jeff and I both think they're great. Tip- spices like garlic and onion powder, pepper, cinnamon, or whatever you like may be added to spice it up a bit. *If you don't like whole wheat bread you will definitely not like this."

The resulting flatbread is exactly as it sounds ... Although bland, and because it is bland, the flatbread blends well with spicy spreads."

"reviewBody": "I love the chapati. It has a nice flavor without the added lard or shortening. I did have to tweak the recipe. Only use 1/2 cup of water and then add water as needed. If you add a whole cup of water you will have a very sticky dough. Also, make sure your water is warm water. After making 8 small balls, let the dough rest for ten minutes before cooking. Meanwhile turn the heat to medium high on a cast iron griddle. Cook the chapati until you see bubbles start to form and then flip, about 10 seconds per side. Then flip for another ten seconds. Flip over again for another 10 seconds to make sure chapita is cooked."
