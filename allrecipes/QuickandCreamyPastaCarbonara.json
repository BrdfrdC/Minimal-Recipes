Followed his recipe, but I did things just a tad different: 1 ) I oven cooked / browned the bacon and about six thin slices of pre-cooked ham, placing them on paper towels before dicing them. I poured the bacon / ham fat in glass measuring cup. 2) Using just a shade over 1 Tablespoon of bacon fat in skillet, I browned the garlic. 3) Used \"garden herb\" flavor cream cheese. 4) Found and used the most robust / nutty flavor SHREDDED Parmesan cheese out there---and I wasn't shy about using generous amounts, either. And this was FAST EASY to make and serve---your family WILL love this !! If Big Daddy opens up his restaurant---I pray this recipe is on the menu!!"

I also like to cook the peas and add to the sauce so I don't over or under cook them. I had something similar at Cheesecake Factory and liked this just as well."

I made 1/2 recipe and used 3 Tablespoons of real bacon bits cooked in 2-3 teaspoons of grapeseed oil. Removed the bacon and then added the rest of the ingredients, using whipped butter (lower calorie), reduced fat milk, and 4 triangles of laughing cow lite garlic and herb. It reminds me of cream cheese and I didn't have any. I just threw the peas in frozen. I didn't have ham, but it was fine without it. Not a dish I would repeat often as the calories, even with the tweaks, are still very high. Although, it worked well this evening. Without the pasta, and with my tweaks, 3 servings of the sauce as made above was 245 calories. ty"

"reviewBody": "Delish-- As I rule I don't rate or comment on a recipe if I make changes to it but in this case will make the exception.This to me was a marriage of an Alfredo and a carbonara with the bacon. I was looking for something different to make for dinner. I had leftover tortellini salad I wanted to use up and together they worked well. My tortellini salad had a little fresh basil and parsley, a few pine nuts, red and yellow peppers, pepper flake and artichoke hearts. The vinagrette was very mild but it added a touch of brightness to the dish to cut through some of the fat.I did drain some of the bacon fat as there was enough fat in the cream cheese and the extra olive oil from the dressing. I followed the recipe exactly until the point I added the pasta where I substituted the tortellini salad. I warmed the cold pasta salad in the sauce and added cooked bacon and cheese as directed. I did not have any ham and eliminated the peas as well. The artichoke hearts and peppers were there for sweetness and color instead. The changes made were out of desire to use existing product but the actual sauce was as written. \nI have made again as written and I do cut out some of the bacon fat and add just a touch of red pepper flakes depending on who is home for dinner."

"reviewBody": "Not bad, and it doesn't take a long time if you use already cooked and crumbled bacon, which is what I did. I don't think I could handle the bacon grease it calls for personally, but that's me. I fully expected this recipe to have eggs; since it doesn't, I suppose it's more of an Alfredo sauce, but it's not bad. Hubs and I had for a quick lunch. I added red peppers in place of peas since we didn't have any and used tri color rotini and penne since that is what we have. Thanks for the recipe."

I did not have ham or peas, what I did was throw in a good amount steamed broccoli. I also added a good amount fresh ground pepper. I sprinkled fresh parmesan over each portion before serving. The boys and I inhaled this. VERY good."

"reviewBody": "The flavor was great, but what I couldn't get out of my head (or mouth) was the film that the bacon grease left. Sadly these leftovers weren't touched again, a sure sign that it was only an adequate dinner. If somebody had made this for me I would have been completely satisfied, but no way will I bother putting the time and effort in to make it myself again. Altogether tasty but not perfected."

"reviewBody": "I found this recipe with not much in the house to cook and craving pasta. I did not find it time-consuming to cook as others have commented. I had to substitute the Parmesan cheese for shredded \"pizza\" 5 cheese blend and bacon for ham. It came out super tasty. I'd say a mix b/c spaghetti carbonara and alfredo sauce. Will definitely make again."
