Instead of using blue cheese dressing i used ranch dressing and just kept the blue cheese for the crumble for the top of the dish. Doing so made this dish Perfect! I also used franks hot sauce for buffalo wings, not just hot sauce. Would for sure make this dish again with my little changes to it! Everyone thought it was so good! it was perfect it didn't have to much of a hot kick to it which was nice, just the right amount."

I really liked the use of the pepper jack instead of cheddar and the blue cheese just put this over the top. I did half the recipe, and that was the perfect amount for us. I will def be making this one again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)"
