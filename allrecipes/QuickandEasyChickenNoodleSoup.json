I browned the whole chicken breasts in the pot first, took them out, then cooked carrots and celery until barely soft. Put onions and butter in, cooked until slightly browned, then put everything else back in, including double oregano and basil. Simmered for 20 minutes, then took chicken out and cubed it. Put noodles and chicken in and served when noodles were soft. Fantastic."

Wife was impressed as well.\n\nI increased the amount of noodles to 2 cups, rather than 1 1/2, and there was still A LOT of leftover broth, so I'd definitely recommend adding more noodles. I think next time I might actually do 3 cups of noodles, even. I added a half a can of cream of chicken soup, like someone else here had suggested, and I think it really helped. As a matter of fact, I'll probably do a whole can of cream of chicken next time. I also substituted the salt and pepper with Tony's creole seasoning, because I do that with just about everything. ;)\n\nOverall, it was a hit, maybe even literally the best chicken (turkey) noodle soup I've ever had. I'll absolutely be making this many times in the future."

"reviewBody": "Fantastic recipe! I cooked it in the slow cooker as follows. I doubled the recipe, except I only used 2 boneless, skinless chicken breast and I just ended up using a whole 8 oz package of egg noodles because we like a lot of noodles. I sauteed the onions, celery, and carrots in a cast iron skillet with butter and just a little broth, until the carrots were tender, then added to the broth (I used chicken broth only, as that was what I had on hand) in the slow cooker. I then cut up my chicken breasts and added those. Besides the listed seasonings I also added maybe a tsp of poultry seasoning, a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic (jarred, in water) and about a tsp of dried marjoram, since I was out of thyme. I cooked the noodles separately, added them to the soup when it was done, (about 5-6 hours on High), and let the soup in slow cooker return to a boil and let the noodles boil with the soup for 10 or 15 minutes. I will be adding this to my regular rotation. So good and comforting, thanks for sharing!"

Dbl celery and carrots. Use 2 32 oz containers of chicken BONE broth (very important) and 1 of veggie stock. Also 1 can of heart healthy cream of chicken soup to thicken it up a bit. Also dbl oregano, basil and added same amount of poultry seasoning. 2 cups noodles. Use chicken breast or chicken thighs to taste. We like a lot of chicken."

I used all chicken broth and I did not add the egg noodles until the last 9 minutes of boiling time. That is really key. You don‚Äôt want mushy noodles so begin the 20 minute boiling time and add egg noodles when you have 8-9 minutes left or according to the package directions. This is such a fast, easy and flavorful soup, thank you!"

"reviewBody": "This is my go-to recipe for a quick chicken noodle soup meal. It works well as is and I recommend the recipe. I usually enhance it a bit by using a good chicken stock instead of broth, then adding 1 tsp (not Tbsp) Better Than Bullion Chicken concentrate. I don't like the texture of cooked carrots so I cut them into large chunks and remove them before serving. I also simmer till cooked through about 10 lbs of fresh boneless skinless chicken breasts at a time in chicken broth and the stated seasonings, vacuum seal and refreeze 1 lb portions of them for future use. I usually get 4 to 5 servings this way. Because of the pandemic, I shop in bulk and freeze."

"reviewBody": "Loved this!! Didn't have any homemade broth and had no intentions of making any. \nI used left over chicken I had roasted whole in the oven, shredded it by hand. Since my chicken was already cooked, I added it after the soup started to simmer and left it in for a few minutes onces it started to boil to make sure all of it was heated through. \nAlso I didn't have a celery so I just omitted that, but I did add a whole head of finely minced garlic and sauteed it with the carrots and onions. I used shallots, it's what I had and it was a nice sweet addition and will do it again in the furture. I didn't have dried basil so I used a few bay leaves (mine were quite small) and it was wonderful. I did add quite a bit of salt to mine, but my boxed broths were all low salt (they were the only ones on sale and Jebus knows I own plenty of salt). \nI also did freeze these in plastic liter containers without the noodle as someone else mentioned, and it's wonderful!! Easy to destroy and a large enough portion that it's enough to give to my boyfriend for work, and have some left over my own dinner later that night.\n\nLove love love this recipe and everyone's suggestions. Not trying to change it, just suggesting substitutions in case others dont have extra these ingredients!"
