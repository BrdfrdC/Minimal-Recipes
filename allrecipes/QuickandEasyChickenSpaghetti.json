Since I did not mix the sauce with the noodles, we all tried the sauce &amp; chicken mixture with tortilla chips. A NEW HOUSE FAVORITE WAS BORN! We have been scouring the internet for new recipes and this is one that we all loved. Will definitely make again."

As written, it is delicious, so this time, I got adventurous and added undrained Rotel, 1/4 tsp. onion powder, and 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder, and it was even better. DO NOT add salt. When I did, it was way too salty. Don‚Äôt know why I added it anyway. Thank you for this great meal, and a big thank you for ALLRECIPES."

"reviewBody": "So I had to substitute thin spaghetti for angel hair, and I didn‚Äôt have any jarred mushrooms on hand-But-I did use the 8oz of Velveeta, the (drained) can of Rotel, 2 cups of cooked, cubed chicken breast, and the can of crm of chicken soup, so the base flavors were all there. This was just too much like glue for me, tbh. The flavor wasn‚Äôt bad, but it quickly turned into a solid-matter dish...Though I did think it was a creative way to use up leftover seasoned chicken breast. I just wish the texture could have stayed creamy, instead of it tasting much too heavy as soon as it came off of the heat. The few bites I had before that happened were pretty good though! Would not make again, however."

Wanted spice so dissolved about 1/4 cup FF jalapenos ( comes in a container like fried onions ) with the cheese. Made a nice thick cheesy sauce, added cooked pasta and the leftover diced chicken, put in casserole, topped with bread crumbs because I was feeling fancy, and baked till bubbly...made a lovely garlic bread....\n\nNot really the same dish...but somehow I got there starting with your idea!!

"reviewBody": "Nice recipe, I will definitely use it again. I did do a few things differently though. The pasta was kind of dry for my taste following the original recipe. So I used 1.5 cans of cream of chicken, cream of mushroom, and rotel. I used Velveeta shredded cheese instead of cubed cheese (it melted wonderfully). I used Tyson already cooked grilled chicken breast, it's seasoned really well and tender. Turned out great, kids loved it and they're a hard to please bunch."

I could have eaten the whole pot. Delicious."

I made my own cream of chicken soup, used reduced fat colby jack, chopped my own tomatoes and green chiles and since the Hubs doesn't like mushrooms, I used canned artichoke hearts and just rinsed them really well and chopped them. I also used whole grain wheat spaghetti to make it more diabetic friendly. It's one of our favorites and pretty quick despite all the fresh cooking I do."

Added a family size can of cream of mushroom soup, 2 mild cans of Rotel, &amp; a large can of mushrooms. Used pasta shells &amp; a small loaf of Velveeta. Baked in the oven for 30 minutes @ 350 degrees. Was extremely bland, BUT Sriracha added to my bowl made this meal outstanding! Dont know if I would eat it without the Sriracha. My husband &amp; oldest son liked it-not a hit with the 7 yr old. Would probably make again in a pinch."

"reviewBody": "Quicky, easy, and good. In Texas, I was taught to also add a can of Cream of Mushroom to the recipe. I also learned that Velveeta is the favorite to use since it melts so well. Some people drain the Rotel, and some don't. (It's spicier if you keep the liquid though). Either way is good to me. I know a few people who use canned chunked chicken (like canned tuna, but chicken) to make it that much quicker to make. Occasionally, I like to add diced celery, pimentos, onions, garlic, and garlic powder (depending on my mood). No matter what, it's fool proof! You can't go wrong! The best one I ever tasted was baked, and it wasn't too cheesy (which is good because I'm not fond of things that are too cheesy). It was just creamy (not too creamy) and good! Good starting off point for people who have never had it before though! I like to serve it with garlic toast (or that garlic Texas Toast you find in the freezer section of your grocery store), and green beans (fresh or canned). Try it out! You can always tweak it as much or as little as you like!"
