Monterey Pepper Jack, and nice melting Queso Asidero cheese. I dipped each tortilla in the green Enchilada sauce like someone said. I added some of the remaining on top, with the rest of the cheeses, and voila! It came out perfect. A big hit with the family! Thanks"

I followed it as written with two modifications per other reviews: I put a thin layer of enchilada sauce on the bottom of the 9x13 pan, then mixed the rest with the sour cream to make spreading easier for the layers. I also added half a teaspoon of cumin and a quarter teaspoon of chili powder to the enchilada sauce/sour cream mixture. It really is a fantastic recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I have been making a recipe almost exactly like this for years. By cutting out a few steps, you can make this and the flavor is just as good, if not better. I do put a bit of the green enchilada sauce on the bottom. I tear tortillas in half so I can line them around the edges of the pan and they just use whole ones to fill the rest of the space in. I take the green enchilada sauce, a small can of green chilis, and sour cream and mix it into a sauce. I then add rotisserie chicken into the sauce. Pour half over the tortillas, then add shredded cheese, which can be anything, Mexican blend, Colby Jack or Mozzarella or a mixture. Just whatever you have. Repeat starting with tortillas and then the mixture, top with remaining enchilada sauce and cheese. Cover and bake for about 30 minutes. I usually use the smaller can of enchilada sauce to do this, but still make it in the 9 X 13 pan. If you don't want to make that much, or just have a bit of chicken left over, then use a 9 X 9 pan, a 7 X 11 pan and adjust your ingredients accordingly. I'm kind of a \"no measure cook\", put in what looks and tastes right. This is a pretty no fail recipe no matter how you do it, as long as you stick to the basics."

I use either boiled or rotisserie chicken, shredded, and I don't dip the tortillas in the enchilada sauce. They get nice and moist cooking in the casserole dish. I also use less cheese but get the 4 cheese fiesta blend already shredded, so it's tasty and quicker. I highly recommend sharing this out!"

Pulled the chicken while still hot, meat always shreds easiest when still hot. Then mixed it with the sour cream and some green chili's. I did not chat the tortillas, only cut/tore them to fit dish, and dipped them in the enchilada sauce. I put sauce in bottom of dish, layered tortillas-chicken mixture-cheese-tortillas-chicken mixture-cheese-tortillas. Poured the remaining sauce on top and baked for 30 minutes. Added rest of cheese, onions and olives (on half) and baked another 15 minutes. It rocked y'all. Don't be afraid to adjust. I can already think of other things to try...... jalapenos, chopped tomatoes, or avacado."

I only put enough sauce in the bottom to cover the surface. 1/2 inch was too much. Then placed 6 tortillas on top. I did not cut them or tear them. I did not char them. Mixed 2/3rds of the remaining sauce and all of the sour cream with the shredded chicken. Put half of the chicken mixture on top of the tortillas. Covered in cheese. Dipped the next 6 tortillas in sauce and placed on top of the cheese. Then put the rest of the chicken mixture on top of the tortillas. And covered in cheese. There was no more sauce left. So I just put the remaining 6 tortillas on top and covered with the remaining cheese. Placed in 350° oven until cheese was completely melted. Let set for 10 minutes then served."

I tore the tortillas in fourths and put a third of them down, then spread half the chicken mixture and cheeses (as directed). I dipped the rest of the tortilla fourths into the second can and finished assembling as directed. This was so yummy!

After that when I make it, I don't char the tortillas and I do like another reviewer mentioned and mix in the sour cream. That just makes it easier to put everything together. I don't notice a difference with charring vs not charring, minus just saving time. To the sour cream mixture I add some of the Trader Joe Chili Lime seasoning and that seems to give it a little more flavor. I use canned enchilada sauce but I add cilantro and some green chilis. With these simple modifications the recipe is a keeper"

"reviewBody": "I made it for my husband for Father's Day from our kiddos and he LOVED, LOVED it. I made a large 13x9 dish &amp; it's gone! I always end up throwing leftovers away, but there were NO LEFTOVERS tonight. It was really easy to make which is good because I have a lot of physical disabilities that prevent me from cooking. I did use the InstaPot (IP) to cook the meat in, with a can of green sauce. It made the meat so easy to pull apart &amp; put the dish together. I do think it's easier to mix the sauce (and/or the juice from the meat) with the sour cream, then pour onto the casserole - it spreads easier &amp; more evenly. I thought it was great! We'd do it again. In fact, my husband has already asked when I will make it again."

Also like to add chopped roasted red peppers for color. Turns out wonderful."

Also did not toast the tortillas, don’t have a gas stove and besides it absorbs liquid better if the tortillas are just raw. Since it calls to bake covered, I uncovered and put it under the broiler for a few minutes before I pulled it out."

I have given it to friends and they like it as well.\n\nI make the shredded chicken in my instant pot, cool it, and mix with the sour cream. I also do what the reviewer suggested about coating the tortillas in the sauce by dipping in a pie plate. \n\nI use garlic powder or garlic salt, whichever I have on hand. But I think the recipe is best with garlic powder added liberally and then salt added to taste. You can only add so much garlic salt before it's too salty, but by using the powder, you can add as much garlic as you want and not add too much salt"

( stir it up after an hour or so). Don't overcook it ..drain any liquid. When cool, shred the chicken with tomatoes and all. I followed other suggestions....cut up the tortillas and soak in the green enchilada sauce. I sauteed 1/2 of a finely-diced onion, jalapeno and garlic clove. ..5-10 minutes. Add the shredded chicken, sour cream, juice of a lemon, handful of chopped cilantro and a few dashes of taco seasoning. Mix it up. Taste and adjust seasonings as preferred. Layer with sauce at the bottom, tortillas, chicken mixture and don't skimp on the cheese ! I mixed sharp cheddar with the Jack cheese. WOW....fantastico !"

I pretty much followed the original recipe but added a small can of chopped green chilies, also used extra chicken breasts and a bit more sour cream to compensate for extra chicken, and mixed the sour cream with the shredded chicken for more even distribution. Also mixed in fresh chopped cilantro, just because I love cilantro! I liked the idea from other reviews of not toasting the tortillas because I did not want that crispy texture, and then dipped the pieces of corn tortillas into the enchilada sauce vs pouring sauce into baking dish, as recipe says. Came out very good! Also garnished with chopped scallions. I think the title Quick &amp; Easy justify the original recipe. It is a good base or starter recipe, enabling you to be more creative, which is what cooking is all about! I did not give it 5 stars just because it's a bit heavy, but very delicious! Maybe I should just learn to have a smaller piece!"

I had a 12 oz jar of enchilada sauce from Trader Joe's, and used all of that plus all of a jar of red salsa to take the place of the 28oz can of sauce. It worked and tasted fine. Tearing and soaking the tortillas in the sauce in a pie tin helped to soften them. I wish there was a little more sauce. Mixing the shredded chicken and sour cream helped a lot too during the spreading of layers. This 9x13 pan provided many meals throughout the week for work lunches. It was plated with green onion and cilantro on top, and a dollop of greek yogurt, and a side of canned refried beans (Amy's are good)."

We also were a little short on the corn tortillas so supplemented with some broken up tortilla chips for the top layer. We just mixed them with the enchilada sauce and it worked out perfectly. Also forgot to cover it while baking. This could be the best chicken enchilada casserole I've ever made and I think this recipe would be equally good with leftover pork roast ."
