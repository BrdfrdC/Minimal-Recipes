I thought the seasoning salt was a bit odd and prefer using kosher salt or skipping the fresh garlic and using garlic salt. I like trying new guac recipes though, so thank you!"

I added more lime juice to help counter the salt. I had the recipe made in less than 10 minutes - you gotta like that. Good flavor, I will make it again, just with less salt. It was served with 'Lettuce leaf Tacos', 'Refried Beans Without the Refry' from AR and fresh fruit."

Stuck to the recipe except for one slight thing, out of green onions so I used a scallion I had. Made it again, but this time I used green onions and Adobe with pepper for the seasoned salt. Still a great dip!"
