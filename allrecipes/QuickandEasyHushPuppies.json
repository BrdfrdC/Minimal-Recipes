I couldn’t really get them to stay together into balls, they came out kind of flat lol. Nonetheless they taste amazing!! This is a really good recipe and we will most definitely be making them again!!"

I did alter it just a bit since I do not use mixes, hence I grabbed my fav cornbread recipe and just mixed up the dry ingredients, which included 1/4 c. sugar. From there, I followed this, except that I also omitted the cayenne. I used melted coconut oil to take the guilt out of frying. Tasted great! Will be making this again!"

Because others said the batter was too runny (and it was), I left out an egg (I used 2 large ones) and used 1/2 c. milk. I added flour till it was the right consistency, about 1 to 1-1/2 c. I will make these again even if I am not having a fish fry! This made quite a few using a small cookie scoop and cooked up to golf ball sized. You could easily half the recipe."

We also used this recipe as a base and increased the buttermilk to thin and make a batter for fried zucchini, which was a huge hit. Definitely a keeper recipe."

These are VERY tasty and light, just like proper hush puppies should be, IMO. I did halve the recipe, but still used 1 teaspoon each of the garlic and onion powders, which gave these great flavor. I will def be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)"

I also threw in a few chopped green onions. Very easy to prepare, the hardest part about it was the frying and not because it was hard, only time consuming. We used this as a side for Ham Bone Chowder as \"dippers\"--NO leftovers."
