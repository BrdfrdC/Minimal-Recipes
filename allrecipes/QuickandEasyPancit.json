We have recently been putting our own spin on this we use Napa cabbage and red onion really really good and I know red onion is not everyone's cup of tea it cooks down enough that you don't taste it"

"reviewBody": "It's a good recipe but sometimes it dry. When I make it I add low sodium chicken broth, about a cup maybe a little less. This adds the needed moisture the pancit noodles needs. This should resolve a dry pancit, but remember to soak the noodles when you begin. The noodles need to soak in warm or hot water. I do recommend you them in half or 3rds. Garnish with sliced hard-boiled eggs and sliced scallions and lemon slices. That's how my late grandfather made it. He cooked for the family. Enjoy. Hope this works for you."

My mom used to make it with pork and shrimp. Also, very good. \nI also use the packet that’s in the Asian isle that’s from the mama sitar’s line called chopsuey/pancit canton. This will help with the taste! \n\nHope this helps!"

I also added a healthy amount of ground fresh chili paste. As others have noted, this is a really flexible recipe. It's so good and easy it's on the menu a couple of times each month."

"reviewBody": "We added chopped red and green peppers to saute with the onions in olive oil, along with a splash of sesame oil. Soaked the broken rice noodles for over an hour to soften. For simplicity, we shredded the carrots in a food processor. We purchased 1 bag fresh coleslaw mix from the Produce department so we wouldn't have to slice the cabbage. We used chopped garlic from a jar, along with additionally adding some oyster and hoisin sauces. Added cracked blacked pepper at the end and omitted the lemons (hubby doesn't like). Next time, I think I'll buy a Costco rotisserie chicken and debone to save some work."

I don't cut up carrots &amp; cabbage- Buy a bag of coleslaw from the produce section of the grocery store. It's the same thing but already thinly cut for you. When getting your noodles pick up a bottle of fish sauce. A few squirts of this will add a yummy flavor to the dish. Serve with soy sauce &amp; lemon or lime wedges. Enjoy!"

I save the broth to add later to prevent the noodles from drying out. I also recommend sprinkling dried garlic on top. My credo is you can never have too much garlic. It's my wife's favorite and she has several of her friends asking me to make it for them. It's the closest I've come to my late Mom's version."

I did make few adjustments to the recipe:\n\nOnly needed two carrots and half an onion (was a larger medium sized one), also got a head of cabbage about softball size and only needed about 2/3rds of it. Added thinly sliced celery, green onions and salad shrimp too.\n\nI ended up boiling the chicken first and then cut it up. Boiled water with about a cup of chicken broth in it then removed it from the heat and put the noodles in it. Definitely break the noodles up so they aren't super long.\n\nUsed more like 1/3 of a cup of soy sauce and sauteed everything but the meat together at the same time til softened a bit and then added the chicken and maybe a 1/4 to 1/3 cup more soy sauce and cooked a few more minutes then added the noodles and stirred/cooked until heated and all noodles were coated in the soy sauce."

I wasn't sure about soaking them in hot water, because the bag instructions were to boil in water for 12-14 minutes. So, I boiled them, drained them and added them at the end. They are good, but I was hoping for a very small thin noodle....better luck next time. It ended up being GREAT! I made this as a side dish with chicken adobo. Happy family and clean plates!

BUT, I used this recipe as a guideline and it turned out el yummo. I basically emptied the leftover vegetable drawer - zucchini, carrots, green beans, mushrooms, onion etc. I chucked in leftover chicken. I used vermicelli (see what I mean about the myriad of substitutions?) as that's what I had. Anyway, it turned out delicious. It made a huge amount - easily enough for 4-5 hungry people, and was extremely economical to make. I would say about $1 per person at the outside. \nThe DH and I like things spicy so we chucked some hot sauce on there rather than extra soy sauce. Nom nom nom."

"reviewBody": "I have always been scared to attempt pancit but this recipe was super easy and delicious! I had to go to a local oriental market to find bihon rice noodles. I filled a large plastic container with warm, on the cusp of hot, water from my tap and covered it with a cloth towel. I checked it in ten minutes and they were good to go! I drained them and set them aside. I don't like using canned chicken so I bought 1.5lbs of chicken breast, cut it into cubes, sautéed it and then set it aside to be added with the noodles. I cooked the garlic and onion in the chicken drippings. A lot of other reviews said green onion but I went with a small diced yellow and it was great. I also added snow peas and water chestnuts (drained of course) because I love them. They all cooked really evenly and added great texture. I am a huge fan of Bragg's Liquid Aminos as a soy sauce substitute but it would have made it WAY too salty so I used Yamasa brand soy sauce. I put in 1c of soy sauce total instead of the suggested 1/4c. I started with 1/4 but it seemed too dry. After everything was mixed in and served up I grabbed my bowl and put a few drops of sriracha in. It gave the dish a little kick. This is definitely an easy, wonderful base recipe! Will make again."
