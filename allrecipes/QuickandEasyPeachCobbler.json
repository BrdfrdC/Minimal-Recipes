I made it as directed the first time, but wanted some warm spices added, so on numerous occasions, I’ve added individual spices or a combination thereof of nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger and even a pinch of cloves from time to time. I’ve substituted fruit cocktail, canned pears, even canned pineapple. It’s just a great recipe that is so adaptable. Enjoy."

The recipe says to leave in the syrup, which then mixed with the dough batter while baking and formed a gross soggy paste. There’s more syrup in the whole recipe than there is dough. Absolutely horrible experience. Syrup started boiling out of the pan and burnt to the oven. If I could give this 0 stars I would."

"reviewBody": "I have made this several times and it is a big hit w/ my husband. Just two of us, so I use an 8x8 dish and only one can of peaches and only about 2/3 of the butter. However, I make the batter as indicated. Adding a liberal 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg is a must. As someone else suggested, I put the butter and peaches on the bottom and pour the batter over. FYI: The batter will be VERY thin and you'll think it won't work, but it does. I don't buy self-rising flour, so I also add 1.5 tsp of baking powder and 1/4 tsp of salt to the flour. I don't think you'll be disappointed in this quick cobbler w/ canned peaches, when you fresh ones are out of season."

This concept of a peach cobbler was so foreign to me but I decided to go with it but I was prepared to throw it out ...It's actually very good and easy to whip up. My picky Dad wanted to taste a teaspoon..lol but he ended up eating a bowl. He thought the flour mixture taste like a real crust and loved it!!. That's a huge compliment from him. I love rolled out crust and my taste buds didn't really detect a huge difference. The dough mixture is extremely similar to a rolled out crust but softer so this recipe is a winner. I used buttermilk, added 1tsp baking powder and cinnamon in the dough mix. I made the same peach mixture as I would in a regular peach cobbler. Thank you and I will make this again and again."

"reviewBody": "I’m 7 months pregnant and I couldn’t stop craving cobbler and I found this! Admittedly I hate to be one of those people BUT I didn’t have quite everything exactly so here’s what I changed: I used baking powder and salt to make my all purpose flour, self rising flour. I also used one can of peach slices and one can pears but both were in lite syrup so I drained the pears completely and drained about 1/3 of the peaches. I also sprinkled maybe a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon on top before baking and added 3tbsp of cubed butter on top at the end of baking. I really dislike watery/soupy cobbler so this turned out PERFECT. It’s sooo good and buttery. The pears don’t really do anything for the flavor and after baking it’s texture isn’t really too much different from the peaches. It’s still very peachy, the pears just seem to add more substance so it’s not all bread."

When I got ready to mix the batter I made a mistake and added my syrup to the batter instead of the peaches. It should have been a recipe for disaster and I wanted to cry when I realized what I had done, but I need a dessert for church so I carried on. Despite everything it turned out wonderfully and was the hit of the dinner. While there were leftovers for the other cakes and pies mine was completely gone. No one minded that it wasn't as sweet as it would have been had the peaches been in heavy syrup. The only thing I would change is to maybe add some cinnamon next time."
