Simmered for about 15 minutes or so, after mashing to allow the liquid to evaporate to allow the seasoning to fully incorporate. Just finished eating these refried beans. They were delicious and my picky family loved them too. Thank you."

I didn't change the recipe at all and these came out perfect. I kept some of the juice from the pinto beans to make sure it didn't come out as paste. Everyone loved it and it's easier to make than cleaning a can of pre-made to heat it up. I'm hoping the half lime is about 1/8 cup because that amount seems to work prefect for us."

Well, I used olive oil, &amp; one can of organic black beans… with the juice, per other reviewers not knowing because the recipe doesn’t disclose. I just made sure to let cook on low-medium and simmer to reduce the liquid to the right consistency. To make a double batch, I will use 4 cloves of garlic. Thank you!!!!!!"

Fajita seasoning water, as needed, for thinning Saute the garlic for about a minute, add the spices and stir until fragrant (1-2 minutes) Add beans and heat through then mash until consistency you desire. If needed add water 1 Tablespoon at a time until desired consistency. It was very flavorful and a great topping to my nachos."

They also were really missing that umami flavor of good refried beans. I'd chalk that up to the lack of lard and bacon grease. I added a little butter to add more of a fatty flavor and some water at the very end, and it made them a little better. Wouldn't make this recipe again."

Made them pretty much just like the recipe. Used the oil, but stirred in a pat of butter when they were almost to the right texture. I paid $8.00 for a jar of whole cumin seeds last week, so I’m trying to put them in everything. Toasted them for about 5 minutes in a skillet, then ground them with a mortar and pestle. They had texture that added a little interest. Wasn’t sure about the half of lime, but holy smokes, that was the perfect finishing touch! Thank you for a new favorite!."

My oil must have been too hot, since my garlic burnt pretty bad. I tossed it. I used an immersion blender since I don't have a masher. It was great. Don't wait until it's the perfect consistency, since it will solidify somewhat. Leave it a little liquidy and it will firm up as it starts to cool."

However, this recipe changed that, very tasty the only thing I amended was adding lime. I didn't have any lime so instead I substituted with a splash of apple cider vinegar. DELICIOUS!"

Super easy too!1 I would add some chicken bullion/chicken stock next time. I did add both chili powder and cumin, dried minced onion, a little taco seasoning and parsley flakes. Some of it went to taco salad and some for chips and dipping. The dipping ones I added shredded cheese. Yummmy!! Definitely worth making again. Reminded me if restaurant style refried"

I also reserved the can liquid and added only what was needed because I prefer to add my own salt to taste, plus I threw in a little bit of chicken broth."

I didn’t drain the beans, I just dumped them by themselves with 1/2 teaspoon each of salt, cumin and chili powder. They are very flavorful and perfect for my family members because it is not spicy. 5 minutes was enough to meld all flavors. They mashed beautifully and thickened in their own. I won’t be buying refried beans anymore."

We drained the beans, added the seasoning, doubling the cumin and lime juice, with the addition of Southwestern Seasoning that I had on hand. Delicious! I'm sorry for the changes, as I feel that its really not the same recipe, but this became a great basis for something with a little more flavor that we prefer."
