Used Fajita packet seasoning instead of taco (as that is all I had on hand), added hot pepper flakes while frying the peppers and onions &amp; 1/2 cup of fresh rough chopped cilantro. Served it with Mexican rice &amp; beans. OMG it was so yummy. It is great recipe as I always have frozen peeled shrimp, Fajita seasoning, peppers and onions on hand. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe with us all."

Having said this, I do think I prefer a more basic (i.e. garlic &amp; lime) treatment for my shrimp. While I enjoyed this, I am not sure I'd ever pair taco seasoning with shrimp again. Mexican rice, chips, guacamole and margaritas completed our easy weeknight meal. Thanks for sharing your idea, Anne! :-)"

Instead of packaged taco seasoning however, I make my own fajita seasoning according to a recipe from my housekeeper: 1 t corn starch, 2 t chili powder (again I make my own), 1 t salt, 1 t Spanish Paprika, 1 t sugar, 1 t powdered chicken stock, 1 t onion powder, 1 t granulated garlic, 1/4 t cayenne ( or to taste), 1/2 - 1 t powdered cumin. I keep this on hand and use when needed. \nAlso used the tip from another review and let raw shrimp marinate a bit with chopped cilantro and a little lime juice (not too long or you have ceviche, which can be good, but just not here)"

I pt the tomato in when I put in the shrimp. They cooked too quick next time I'll put them in when the shrimp are almost done. I recomend this to anyone looking for a quick tasty meal."

The shrimp ended up being overly done; I'm wondering if it needs to simmer with the vegetables instead of cooking it then simmering it. I would mix the seasoning with water (if that is possible)...I feel like parts of it ended up having concentrated taco seasonings despite the fact that I stirred, flipped &amp; mixed it in. Overall, we enjoyed it. We enjoyed spicy food so the cayenne was a good compliment!!!"

I diced up a few tomatoes and added a dollop of light sour cream to the shrimp mixture in my tortilla. But other than that, I followed the rest of the recipe as written. It was so delicious and healthy for you. (Well, less the sour cream, I suppose!) Try this recipe - - you will not be disappointed."

I also added a little of the taco seasoning and chopped garic to the green peppers and onions while they were cooking. Like previous reviews I didn't use all of the taco seasoning( probably a little more than half) I used Old El Paso. Everyone liked them and will probably make again. I topped them with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese."

I think I might try it with that next time instead of th taco seasoning!"

I think there was way too much seasoning though, as the shrimp just got covered and was completely overwhelmed.
