"reviewBody": "Ok so I’ll admit I had to alter this. I had roughly a green pepper and a half with an onion I chopped and froze I cooked first in the vegetable oil. When it was almost done I used jarred minced garlic (what I had) and sautéed a couple of minutes. The rice well I didn’t have instant but still cooked a couple of minutes before adding the liquid. I had to use tomato juice not v8, doubled it, then used an extra cup of water and beef bouillon cubes to make the broth. Added 2 cans of mexican tomatoes (again to give more liquid with it not being minute rice) as well as a pound of cooked hamburger an entire package of taco seasoning. This was scrumptious and honestly I wish I had read to use minute rice as it would have been done much faster. With normal rice beware it makes a ton lol. I made 8 huge burritos with refried beans and have well over half left. Leftovers tomorrow yes plz. Will make again. Thank you."

I used 2 1/4 cups chicken stock, mix in 1-2 tablespoons of taco seasoning (season to your liking), stir in rice, cover, bring to a boil, and let simmer for 20 minutes. When finished fluff with a fork. It turned out outstanding! Served with Tequila Lime Shrimp."

Thankfully, I tasted it ahead of time and \"doctored\" it up with spices. It was also a bit dry so I aded some enchiladas sauce to it as well and people enjoyed it. I served it with Angela's Chicken Enchiladas recipe (loved it) and Christmas Eve dinner was a success all in all."

I would have to say this was as good or better than some other recipes I have to make Spanish rice that take 3X's as long to prepare and sometimes don't turn out. I used Minute Rice brown rice which is a bit chewier, but still good. The taco seasoning I used was listed as \"hot\" when I bought it but lent a nice zing to the flavor. It was very good, I'll keep the recipe and make it again."

Then sprinkled cumin and salt in the rice. Added to the boiling broth..cooked 22 min..You might go with 1 1/4 C of chicken and 3/4 cup of the enchilada sauce. Next time will sauté green peppers and and black beans..Thanks for the recipe idea!"

Kids will like it because of taco seasoning influence. I think there's an error in the recipe, though. \"Instant\" rice should not take 20 minutes to cook as the recipe calls for; about 7 minutes is right. I think you could make this with regular rice and follow the recipe that calls for 20 minutes of cooking."

My only problem was it was a tad dry. I ended up adding about tsp. of vegetable oil at the end which helped. I didn't have V8, so I found a subtitute to do 1/2 tomato sauce and 1/2 water and it tasted very similar. I made broth from broth paste, so I could control the sodium. I made 1/2 recipe and it made about 4 servings. At the end I added some frozen defrosted peas and carrots for color and texture. ty"
