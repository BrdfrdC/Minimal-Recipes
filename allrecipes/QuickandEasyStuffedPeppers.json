I stuck pretty closely to the recipe except for using salsa instead of tomatoes and added mushrooms to the rice. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe."

I used canned diced tomatoes with chillis. i boiled the rice in a mixture of low sodium chicken broth and the juice of the canned diced tomatoes. I also fried onions in garlic and added to the rice mixture. Along with black beans instead of kidney beans and added 1 shredded chicken breast. Black pepper and some cayenne pepper to taste. \r\nI pre cooked peppers in microwave for a couple of minutes or until soft as suggested. I then stuffed my peppers then put in oven at 350 for 25 minutes added the Parmasean and a slice of provolone cheese and put it back in the oven until cheese is melted. Great easy recipe! Thanks Jen!"

They were super quick and easy to throw together after work, and very healthy/inexpensive.\r\n\r\nI only rate the 4 stars though because the beans were not quite cooked through (\"microwave times may vary\", after all) and I added a few spices based on other reviews/my own assertion that the combined flavors might seem a bit bland. Still, a great jumping off point to adjust to suit your own tastes and preferences."

"reviewBody": "Quick and easy way to make stuffed peppers during the summer if you don't want to heat up the house w/ the oven (and live in NYC w/ no access to a grill). Used leftover brown rice from another meal, used white onion instead of green, which added a lot of flavor, used diced tomatoes bc that's what we had, frozen corn, black beans instead of kidney, and chopped up a couple jalapenos we had sitting around. It did need some more flavoring like some of the others mentioned, so I threw some cayenne pepper in, some red pepper flakes, chili powder, and some seasoning salt to taste. Only had lite mexican shredded cheese, which worked perfectly. My boyfriend loved it and we'll definitely be keeping this one around!"

First, I used regular rice and so I started cooking it on the stove a bit before I added in the tomatoes. I didn't use a microwave at all, but instead heated the peppers in the oven. I also added a little bit of garlic, black pepper, and cayenne pepper to the rice mix. This recipe was really really easy to make yet tasty... I am definitely going to make it in the future for company as a main dish. It's really hearty because of the beans, too!"

I also used lower fat mozzarella. Really tasty, easy and I've never used the microwave to make a meal like that before. I will be adding this to my permanent recipe box. Thanks for posting it!"

Used pre cooked brown rice, and combined the beans and rest of the ingredients on the stovetop (or microwave, depends on how lazy I am) and heated through. Added chilli powder, cumin, garlic and onion powder. Used mexican cheese blend and put the stuffed peppers in the oven/toaster oven for a few minutes. You can also tailor this recipe to be more italian depending on the spices."

So, I added a little cumin, black pepper, and paprika. They turned out great! I will be making these again. Also.. using red/orange/yellow peppers makes all the difference. My fiance who normally hates stuffed peppers, liked these Thanks for the recipe."

I also added a few dashes of Frank's red hot sauce. I used microwave to cook peppers, beans and corn. Cooked rice on stovetop and added all together. I baked in the oven at 325 for about 10 minutes then added cheese. I turned oven to warm until wife came home. She loved it. We froze remainder and looks like enough for 4 halves. Great easy recipe.

I had to a adapt the recipe a bit for the normal, smaller sized peppers, by halving the amount of ingredients for the filling. I also used wiener sausages (sorry) instead of kidney beans which made it even yummier, along with a touch of oregano. I have never known anything so nice to come out of the microwave before.... nice one!"
