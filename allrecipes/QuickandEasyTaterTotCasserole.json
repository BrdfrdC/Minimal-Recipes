"reviewBody": "Many have been concerned that this recipe uses raw hamburger. The hamburger seems not to be done after cooking the amount of time according to the recipe. this is due to the hamburger being cooked anaerobically (without air.) This leaves the hamburger looking pink, but it is fully cooked. If you check the temperature and it is between 170 to 180 degrees, it's done. I add dried onion and garlic to the soup mixture. I also reverse the soup and the tater tots layers. We the tots to be browned and crunchy. I adjust when to add the tots so they don't burn. See the tater tot cooking time."

At the very least, the hamburg should be super lean and the casserole should be tightly covered during most of the bake time. Safer to cook first and pour off fat. I did make this, but I used 85% lean hamburg, precooked it first and poured off the fat. Also added some chopped onion and garlic to the hamburg mixture. Was good, but I didn't make it exactly as written. This is supposed to be a quick dump and go recipe, but it doesn't work as written with raw meat, for safety reasons. Just my opinion."

I also used cream of chicken soup instead of celery and added a blip of dijon mustard, ketchup and worcheshire to the sauce. I used ground turkey and then cauliflower/broccoli tots for the topping. It came out good but kind of salty so I will look for ways to cut that down in the next meal. This did please two teen boys and their dad so for that I am grateful. It's hard to find a single dish that will make all of them happy. Me, I'm eating a salad, lol."

I then mixed the soups and milk with the burger. Not sure what was meant by a can of milk, so I used a can of evaporated milk. I put this mixture in bottom of casserole dish, then topped with an 8 ounce package of cheddar cheese. I layered the frozen bag of tater tots on top. Baked for one hour. The cheese is what made the casserole. Without it, this would of lacked flavor. Leftovers are good but tots get a bit mushy."

Most of the reviews are several years old and I don't know if and when people check the reviews. I just had some comments to make. Any recipe that you try should always be adaptable for your family. The ingredients in this recipe are just that and you should always season to your familys tastes. It only calls for a pinch of garlic powder. This makes a lot for no more seasoning than a little garlic powder and salt and pepper. I have gotten used to using onion and garlic powder since my husband doesn't like onion. I have to slip it in anytime I can and if he can't see it he doesn't know it's there. I have always cooked the meat before combining the ingredients. I also usually use more than one pound of ground meat since you are putting it in a 9X13 dish that isn't a lot of meat. It is much better if you season the meat but not with salt. I noticed someone commented on saltiness and I had that problem and learned to use the low sodium soups and WATCH the cheese because that adds salt also. You may want to try different kinds of cheese if you have a problem with saltiness.\n\nWhen I put it together I put the cooked, seasoned meat on the bottom and top that with some frozen mixed vegetables cover that with the soups mixed with the milk and sprinkle some cheese over the soup. Add the tater tots on top and I usual"

"reviewBody": "Hmm....after reading several different recipes for this dish I'm beginning to wonder if the trailer park where my momma done raised me up was located in a parallel universe because we always added the meat to the pan raw (after combining it with dry french onion soup mix). In fact that's how I still make it. It always forms this wonderful/frightening solid sheet of more or less boiled meat that serves as a sturdy foundation for the more wobbly parts of the dish. And at 375 F I've never had a problem with the meat not getting cooked in under an hour. I know that any foodie would become apoplectic at the idea of not browning meat, but hey, it's a freaking casserole!"

Couple of changes...didn't have the two cans of soup as I thought I did, so in addition to the one can of cream of chicken soup I had on hand, I improvised and added a can of cream corn. Actually, it gave the dish a nice added flavor! Also, I accidentally put the tots on before the cheese, but it worked out great anyway. Will definitely make again!"

"reviewBody": "I made two 9x13 casseroles with the changes to the recipe. This was an excellent base recipe. We love veggies and did not want to have to serve any sides with this. So I ended up using the following: 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground turkey (both lean). Cooked and drained. I added the following veggies finely chopped, and sauteed (may look like a lot but veggies cook down quite a bit): 1 1/2 lb fresh spinach, 2 bunches green onions, 16 oz broccoli slaw, 16 oz fresh cauliflower, 2 green bell peppers, parsley, cilantro. Mixed meat and veggies together seasoned with cumin, garlic powder, chili powder, pepper, tiny bit of salt *even using the healthy request lower sodium soups it does have a lot of soduim already; as do the tots. \n\nFor the soupy mixture I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of celery and 3 cups milk, added handful of cheese. Layered bottom with sparse amount of tots, put meat/veggie mixure, poured some of the soupy mixture; covered with 2nd layer of sparse amount of tots, then put rest of soupy mixture on top. Baked at 375 for 40 minutes; added handful of cheese to the top, baked another 10 minutes. \n\nThe tots end up soaking up the soupy mixture, as did the meat/veggies. I did not have enough of the cream of whatever cans to follow the recipe exactly, that's why I increased the amount of milk. Also had to be sparse on the tots since I only had one bag. So incredibly delicious."

I made a few changes and I know that's annoying when people do that but even without the changes I don't see how this could've been bad. Here's what I did: I cooked a pound of ground beef and layered it in a 9x13, then sprinkled with garlic and pepper (I had already salted while cooking), then I added I can each low fat cream of chicken and cream of mushroom, layered chopped green onions, shredded fat free cheddar cheese, and then tatertots and sprinkled them with salt and garlic, then added a thin layer of cheese and green onions on top. I cooked at 375 for 1 hr. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was that the cheese on top came our kind of crunchy instead of melty and I think that's due to the type of cheese I used. Maybe next time I won't use the fat free cheese on top.... and there will be a next time!!!! :)"

My family realized the tator tots themselves could be the culprit. We don't eat them often so I think our palates are a bit more sensitive to their salt factor. Not sure how to remedy this other than try different brands of tator tots and cut back the salt all round.\n\nReally though, this is a fine recipe. Our son even asked to have some for breakfast."

Brown 75-80% lean ground beef in pan along with 1-3 cloves of crushed garlic (I use about 2 Tablespoons of pre-crushed squeeze garlic) - We love garlic! add a pinch of pepper.\n\n2. once brown, add 1 can of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup (10oz or about that size).\n\n3. add about 1tsp of Worchester sauce, 2tsp of Heinz Ketchup, 1/4 cup of milk, 1 cup of shredded mild cheddar (or Mexican blend) we like Sargento because it is real :), stir everything.\n\n4. add about 1-2 cups of frozen corn or other veggies, we like corn because it is not green :)\n\n5. put it all in a 9x13 pan layer on tater tots\n\n6. I convection bake for 25 minutes at 400-425\n\n7. take it out and add a layer of cheese then put back in oven for 2-4 minutes to late the cheese melt and form a layer (1-2 cups of cheese\n\n8.

After reading other reviews...I added chopped onion when browning the meat, changed the cream of celery soup to another cream of mushroom(that is what I had on hand), and I have no idea how much tater tots I used because I had a huge bag from Sam's Club and so I just covered the top. I didn't stir the tots into it so they were still crunchy which we all loved the texture."

"reviewBody": "This is a great base recipe. I made a few tweaks to the original. I added chopped onion to the ground beef and seasoned them really well with kosher salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder. I also layered in a bag of mixed frozen veggies and used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of celery. I skipped the can of condensed cream to have a thicker sauce. You also don't need to thaw the tater tots beforehand. With an hour cook time they'll be plenty hot when they come out. My super picky husband loved this dish and had three helpings. I will definitely make this again."

"reviewBody": "My family LOVED this! I did make adjustments. My family doesn't like garlic so I left it out. I used ground chuck. Browned it first, then blotted out the grease on paper towels. I then mixed the meat with 1 can condensed cream of CHICKEN and 1 can condensed cream of CELERY soup in the bottom of my casserole dish (I didn't want to thin out my sauce so I didn't use milk). I added one can, drained, corn, spread around. I sprinkled on 1.5 cups shredded cheddar. Then I arranged a bag of EXTRA CRISPY tater tots on TOP of everything. Don't pour the soups over the tater tots unless you are going for shepherd's pie/soggy tots! Cooked for 40 minutes and then added 1 cup shredded cheddar on top of casserole over the tots. Cook for 20 more minutes. The only thing I would do differently next time is use one of the cans low sodium soup bc it was a bit salty. This casserole was WONDERFUL!!! Tried this again, but wanted less salty. Didn't have reduced sodium soups, so I used half can on CC. Didn't help enough. I will leave out altogether next time and MAYBE add a 1/4-1/2 can milk. I also wanted crispier cheese/tators so when I added the extra/topping cheese, I increased oven temp to 425. Added FF onions to a portion for kids durning last 5 minutes. The tots and cheese topping were crispy and AMAZING!! Disappointed at the saltiness still. Will work on that next time."

I used to use the Breakfast tater-tots, and with great success... but I found the small regular hashbrowns work really well, cause you can mix it with the soup base and really blend the flavours. It makes for great leftovers, and amazing for families. I like the cream of mushroom but I actually have better results with cream of chicken and celery. And I add a bit of corn too for extra flavour. Happy Cooking!"

"reviewBody": "This is similar to a recipe I always used but couldn't find mine but once I seen most of it I could recall where I added or changed.\n\nBest thing to do is season your ground beef while it is in the browning processing. Add salt, pepper, onions, green peppers, and 1/2 Tbsp of minced garlic (or use the 1st pinch of Garlic Powder).\nBeginner Cooks use minced garlic left it tends to burn quick in a hot pan and leave a bitter taste.\n \nAdding a package (2 cup size pkg) of Shredded Cheddar Cheese (or your choice type shredded cheese) is a MUST. \nI also mix the tater tots, hamburger, soups, seasonings of choice, 1/2 to 3/4 the pkg (1-1 1/2 cup) of shredded cheese and milk in bowl til the tots are coated then place in the baking pan and top with remaining shredded cheese the last 20 minutes of the baking time.\n\nFor Health Nuts or Low Sodium version:\nUse Ground Chuck (at least a 90/10) or you can use a lean meat like ground chicken or ground turkey. I use Sea Salt vs table salt when cooking. This way I use half the amount of sea salt vs when using regular table salt. Cream of Mushroom &amp; Celery soups I get the Healthy Request or Low/Less Sodium versions. I also use skim milk with my cooking. (You can always add more salt to your taste level but you can't take it out.)"

At first when I poured the sauce over it didn't seem like there was a whole lot and also the meat didn't fully cover the bottom like on the sides but I think in the end it was fine. I put green beans in mine but might try it with peas next time, didn't care too much for green beans in it. Also if I would have been more prepared I would have sprinkled more cheese on top as I only had a little left I think it would have made it better. I didn't leave it in for the full hour but probably should have, I think the tater tots would taste better if they were more crispy.

"reviewBody": "This is a recipe that has been so common since I was a kid that it didn't occur to me people hadn't heard of it. Maybe it's the Minnesota hotdish thing! The way we make it is to brown the hamburger first in a skillet, then crumble into a 9x9 inch pan for every pound of hamburger. Layer 1 can of cream of mushroom soup over the hamburger, than a vegetable (most commonly used is orn or a vegetable blend) than you only have to bake in the oven for as long as it takes the tater tots to brown. Cheese is good on it but that was never added when I was a kid. I like to throw some feta in after its done. One thing to remember is that if you double the hamburger, double the soup, veggies, etc. Easy and REALLY good!"
