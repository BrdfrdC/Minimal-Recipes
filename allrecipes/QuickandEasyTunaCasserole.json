Instead of 10 slices of American cheese, I used 4 inches of Velveeta off a block. I sautéed the onions before adding to the recipe. They added a great dimension of flavor. The resulting casserole wasn’t dry, and was very creamy and good. Serve with potato chips."

Of course, the ingredients in it are classical and always work well together. It did improve a bit after refrigerating it, which is also common with casseroles. I made the mistake of using albacore in olive oil, so it had a bit of heaviness at first, until the flavors mellowed. A super recipe, especially if you're in a hurry-- and it makes several dinners ahead of time. And it freezes very well."

I boiled the noodles by themselves, and steam cooked the peas, because boiling vegetables boils out 90% of the nutrition, were steaming them doesn't. I also had to use 5 cans of tuna, because of how skimpy they are with tuna. Other than that, this is a very good and simple meal that everyone loves."

My mom always did that in her potato salad to season the potatoes. The best. I added the cream of mushroom soup plus a can of cream of celery. No cheese. Then when done I put potato chips on top if desired. It’s a classic from the 1950’s with my mom. Comfort food."

The difference is that she would add some milk to the mushroom soup base, use a bag of frozen peas and carrots, and then bake the casserole with crushed saltine crackers on the top. I made like my mother did and my kids LOVED it! Serve with a green salad and you've got a great mid-week meal with enough left-overs for another meal or work lunches."

"reviewBody": "First a compliment: Yes, it was fairly quick and easy. And disclaimer: I halved the recipe since it was just for me and my daughter. With all that said: The tuna to dish ratio is too low, and the onion to dish ratio is WAY too high. I took some people's suggestions and pre-sauteed the onions, I cannot fathom how crunchy the dish would have been if one followed this recipe to a T! The dish was just OK, would be better with more tuna, less onions (could even replace with onion powder if you didn't have fresh onions), and maybe a bit more liquid of some sort since it ended up being quite thick."

And yes, the cream cheese Ill use next time, and Ill likely add mayo too arent health foods but they're purer. To each his own."

I quickly threw my peas in with my pasta, with about 6 minutes left, and then drained. I added about 1/2 cup of mushrooms and 3/4 can 2% milk along with (duh!) chunk albacore tuna. I’m a total novice so I didn’t think about the tuna not breaking up very well! I added another can (making 3 cans) chunk light I had on hand for added tuna. I used 8oz package of shredded cheddar cheese, then added a few handfuls of some packaged finely shredded mozzarella to increase cheesiness. Came out great!!! I did all this subbing because I originally purchased these ingredients for the other recipe. My fiancé is a muscular 260lb guy and he and his apprentice will eat this up after work today. Look Ma! I did it!"

You really can use what you have on hand.....like alot suggested, I sauteed the onions in olive oil before adding the rest. Added milk to make it creamier. I used American but didn't have 10 slices so used shredded cheddar as well. Then put in a casserole dish with plain bread crumbs on the top and broiled to a crisp. Easy and good!"

"reviewBody": "I made this because I had most of the ingredients at home. When I read the recipe I realized that the onions would not be cooked if I put them in the pot last for 2 minutes, so I used the ingredients of this recipe as a base for what I made.\n\nI did the following while the egg noodles were boiling:\nI chopped some garlic and onions and put them in a sauce pan with butter. I cooked those until the onions were translucent and then added 2 cups of frozen peas. I let that cook until all of the peas were warm. Next, I added to the mixture 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of celery (its what I had in my cabinet), and following that the cheese. I let this cook until all the cheese was melted. I then added the tuna and mixed it in.\nWhen the noodles were cooked, I drained them and added the mixture to them. I stirred the mixture and served hot. It was very good this way, and will serve as 2 nights of meals for my husband and I."

"reviewBody": "First, I’m very much a novice at cooking, or usually anything that has to do with the kitchen (excluding refrigerator and microwave). I love reading the “Easy” recipes. Even then I set up the kitchen in advance of starting the process. Looks like an operating room. But I digress. Immediately following the recipe I race to the reviews to get others ideas. Fascinating. I disagree that amending, adding, etc. to these wonderful recipes is derogatory to the original. I feel it is the highest of compliments to “build” on another’s’ great ideas or recipes. I blended this recipe with the “Easy Tuna Casserole “. Nothing like “Two Easys “. \nI think that’s what is wonderful about cooking...the tweaking. Don’t mean to preach...oh, and everyone loved it. Apparently I still have issues with quantity. Ended up making two casseroles. Young couple next door loved it. ??"

I think the amount of noodle may be slightly too much and it could use more meat maybe double that in the recipe. It was easy to make and I'll probably make it again for a quick lunch but increase the meat and use just slightly fewer noodles. Thanks for a quick lunch."
