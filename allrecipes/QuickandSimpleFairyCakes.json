"reviewBody": "There is something hugely wrong in the suggested number of cupcakes this recipe is supposed to make. I wanted to make only 6, to try it out. The reduced batter filled the muffin cups barely even 1/4 full. I had to make more batter to get 6 decent sized cupcakes. Also, a the batter was so thick, I added a little coconut milk, maybe a 1/3 c all told. They also took almost double the time to cook. Working with such small amount of batter I didn't bother separating the ingredients as per directions - just put it all together in the bowl and beat it up. Bottom line, it's a really nice recipe, with a lovely crispy crunchy top, nice fluffy interior, quite tasty. I don't think they really need icing but without icing they look like cornmeal muffins. I would make these again and repeat the single step method. Couldn't be easier - or tastier. Update: next day, the crispy topping is gone but it's still a really nice cupcake. I might add a 1/4 tsp vanilla next time. This may become my go-to cupcake recipe."

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe but had a few changes. So I added tsp of vanilla and 2 tsps of cocoa powder to half of the mixture to create a marble cupcake. They needed much longer than 12 mins at 355. I left mine in for 12, then added 3 mins as they were visually not ready, then took them out and did the toothpick test and still very runny inside so put in for another 3 mins."

"reviewBody": "These def live up to their name of being quick and simple (they are also tasty!)...I halved the recipe and got 10 cupcakes out of this. I couldn't resist, so I added in some vanilla extract for flavor. The batter is pretty thick, but these bake up beautifully. A little dry, but I may have over-baked by a minute or 2 (they weren't done @ 12 minutes, so I baked them about 3-4 mins. more, but will check sooner next time). I frosted these w/ a vanilla buttercream...the family is happy, so that's good enough for me! Thanks for sharing. :)"
