Some family thought it was bland and needed something else like salt or more juices (maybe cream of chicken soup or more chicken broth) as they thought it was a little dry. I like my food more bland so this was perfect to me (and I could taste the spices in the rotel). So I am rating it 4 stars as some people in my family didn't rave over it. I have tons left over too so we will be eating this for a few more meals if I don't put some away in the freezer for a later use."

I also replaced the chicken with Nueske's beef summer sausage (diced), and vegetable oil with olive oil.\n\nThe result turned out great and I will definitely cook it again. I see others are commenting that this recipe is a little on the bland side...if you add the summer sausage it has much more flavor."

Seasoned to taste with salt, pepper, and cumin to bring out the Mexican flavor of the chilis in the tomatoes. Good tasting, quick and easy, and only one dirty dish!

I stuck to the basic instructions, but followed the suggestions of others, added a bit more onion, 3 cloves garlic and all purpose seasoning. I also threw in a can of kidney beans I had. It was quick and easy, he had 2 helpings and brought some to work for lunch! Thanks for this new favorite."

I didn't have Rotel tomatoes. I froze leftovers for work lunches. I will make this recipe regularly, it's that GOOD!"

"reviewBody": "This dish was easy to make. I used some tricolor quinoa, which I think made it more appealing in appearance. Like others suggested, I added black beans and then added some cayenne for a boost. I'd like to think of a way to make the taste more complex on the next go round, such as add Italian sausage (no cayenne) or an additional vegetable (if those would do it - I'm not a chef! :)). Regardless, I will make this again."

I think it turn out very good. Added some sprilized Zucchini, and dehydrated tomatoes.I probably shouldn't review recipes because I'm always changing them to fit what I have available."

"reviewBody": "I just finished making this but tweaked like others did. I used organic chicken breast. Seasoned with salt pepper , cayenne pepper, garlic powder and cumin. When I sautéed the onion I also added minced garlic. To the quinoa I added a little low sodium soy sauce. Once The chicken was cooked I added the rotele can and quinoa to the chicken then I added green onion and cranberries and a few shakes of red pepper flakes. Let it all simmer then topped off with a small squeezed lime. Had a small taste and taste yummy...can’t wait to have this for lunch tomorrow. This is a keeper but you need to make it your own, to your liking otherwise I think it would be tasteless. But thank you for the foundation of this dish."

I can’t have dairy so the family added the cheese individually as it was served. It still melted in and they really liked the recipe. I will definitely do this one again."

I also added corn, zucchini and a finely diced jalapeño to the onion garlic and chicken. Seasoned with salt and pepper and Pico de Gallo seasoning I had. The squeeze of lime that others mentioned, some scallions and cilantro to garnish, were perfect. Will definitely do again."

My husband and son ate it wrapped in tortillas with refried beans and freshly shredded cheddar. I enjoyed mine on half of an avocado with a side of refried beans and a little cheddar. Try it you won't be sorry."

No ground chicken, but cut up chicken breasts with diced fresh serrano peppers and fresh tomatoes.\nBest suggested addition was the lime juice! Also added garlic powder, salt, pepper, paprika, a little jar of marmalade and a couple splashes of asian dipping sauce from Trader Joe's. Still needed more spice. Next time would cut chicken into bigger pieces."
