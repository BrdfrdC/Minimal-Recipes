Just placed in fridge, and returned a few hours later. To my surprise most of broth had absorbed. Placed in microwave for a ~3-5 minutes, but in the end had to strain. Used a couple more tablespoons of a light butter just to add a little more flavor and moisture. Used dried spices, in addition to adding salt and pepper. Came out great."

"reviewBody": "I've been looking for new ways to make quinoa and came across this. I rinsed my quinoa because the package told me to do so. It's definitely more flavorful using the Vegetable Stock instead of cooking quinoa with regular water (I used Rachael Ray's Vegetable Stock). I used the optional squeeze of lemon. I liked the combination of flavors."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe. For those who asked, quinoa needs to be rinsed of the bitter saponin coating unless otherwise directed on package labeling. I measure what I want to use, soak it in a large cup of water for 20 minutes, dump it in a mesh sieve and rinse before proceeding by mixing it with some oil in a skillet and stirring periodically over medium heat to brown it lightly and bring out the nutty flavor. Once browned a bit, I add enough hot water to exceed the top by about a 1/4 inch, cover it, lower the heat, set a timer for 15 minutes, turn the heat off at that point and let it sit with the cover on for another 10 minutes. If I want it drier, I just remove the lid, turn on the heat and stir it until more water evaporates. At this point I can refrigerate it so it's ready to go for any recipe. It freezes well at this point, too - just be sure it's fridge-cold before freezing since the steam from warm food is what causes the proliferation of annoying ice crystals. I keep a container of plain cooked quinoa in the freezer at all times so I can scrape some into oatmeal or scoop out some for a salad topper, etc. It separates easily with minimal microwave power. Amazing, nutritious, versatile stuff."

"reviewBody": "I spoke words tonight that I never thought I would hear myself say: \"This quinoa is really good.\" Like someone else said they did, I cooked the garlic in the same pan when I toasted the quinoa. I caramelized the onions separately, but in retrospect I guess I didn't have to do that-I just could've cooked the onion and garlic in the same pan. Oh, and I didn't have any vegetable broth so I used chicken broth. The quinoa was definitely *not* quicker than rice-took more like 20 minutes. But if you want something a little healthier than rice or potatoes, or just want something different, give this a try. At first I didn't like the firmer texture of quinoa, but now I love it."

"reviewBody": "SO GLAD I FOUND THIS RECIPE!!!\n\nSo many times I've attempted to cook quinoa and have failed miserably. This recipe made me feel like victory is mine! A couple of changes I have made to make this recipe better. I toasted the quinoa with a tablespoon of butter and a teaspoon of olive oil. I after 2 minutes of toasting the quinoa I added the diced onion. After dumping in the vegetable stock, I seasoned it heavily with sea salt and lemon pepper. I ended up having to cook the quinoa closer to 18 minutes as opposed to the recommended 15 minutes to have all the liquid absorbed. I didn't have thyme so I omitted that. Will definitely make again!!!"

Great way to add variety to a sometimes boring side dish! I served it with salmon and asparagus, and it went very well together."

"reviewBody": "I LOVED this recipe (after a simple change). The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I had to slightly change it. I sauted the onions and garlic in the butter before adding the quinoa and then added the quinoa and continued to saute everything together. I tried it the other way (as the recipe instructs) and the taste was quite different. If you're new to quinoa this is a great way to introduce yourself to a great power food."

Still, really good dish that I'm going to make again and see about tweaking."
