"reviewBody": "As written, this recipe is a solid 4 stars, and with tweaks it's a 5. I found 4oz of feta to be way too much, so I started out with about 1/2 of the package and that was a good amount for our liking. Also, 1 tsp of salt and 1 tsp of pepper is A LOT, especially given all the salt from the feta. I used 1/2 tsp of each and that was plenty. I happened to have fresh dill on hand, so I used that instead of dried. Very tasty! I also think this could benefit from an extra tomato, but still a great recipe overall. This is great to bring to a BBQ or to serve to guests. Thanks for the recipe Elizabeth!"
