Next time i would use less oregano, i didn't love in the dish but that's just personal preference. To those pointing out that the cooking ratio is 2 cups of water per cup of quinoa, that's right, however this recipe uses a different metod where you use more water than needed and just drain it when it reaches your desired doneness (like cooking pasta). I have done rice this way, just adding way more water than needed (no measurement) and then draining it when it was done and it's actually very good if you have trouble making rice. If you don't like this method just stick to the normal liquid/ quinoa ratio :)"

I used frozen peas &amp; carrots in place of the corn (personal preference) and added a can of black beans as recommended by previous reviews. Very important to note that the flavor was much better after a couple of days of the flavors melding in the frig. When I reheated it I melted some shredded sharp cheddar cheese on top and it was downright yummy! Kids still aren't crazy about it, they think it might be better with some meat added."

I loved the idea of cooking the carrot in the water. It was soft after 10 minutes. I find stir frying the carrots they never get soft. I added chopped sugar snap peas, chopped red onion and everything else as the recipe called for. Very colorful, very tasty."

"reviewBody": "I liked this recipe but I did make a couple changes. First of all, rinse the quinoa well with cold water before cooking. I cooked the quinoa as directed on the package (2c liquid per 1c quinoa) which is a cup less than the recipe states. I used beef broth instead of water. I will be trying vegetable broth and chicken broth in the future as well. By using less liquid there is no need to drain it after cooking. I used a can of garden vegetable medley (corn, green beans, carrots) instead of half a cup of corn. I didn't have garlic so I used two green onions (green part included) instead. I put them in with the peppers after they had softened up some. I didn't put salt or pepper in it because the broth is salty enough and pepper can be put on according to each persons own taste preference. I'll make it again using different liquids and veggies. It's quite tasty!"

I followed the recipe but did add to it, couple pinches of dried onion powder, half tsp or more dried garlic powder, bit of extra salt...and you know what? It's rather nice."

It tasted great hot. I cooled it overnight and added crumbled feta cheese and grape tomatoes to make a cold side dish for a party. It was very tasty and everyone seemed to like it. I will definitely make it again!"

"reviewBody": "Divine! I roasted some sweet potatoes, acorn squash, carrots, and onions instead of the veggies listed in this recipe. Once these babies were roasted to my liking, I sautéd 2 garlic cloves in some olive oil for about 2 minutes... then, I added about a 1/2 of a head of kale, coating the kale in the olive/garlic oil in the frying pan. The kale softens up a little fast (be careful to not over cook the kale!). Once the kale, quinoa and the roasted veggies were all done to perfection, I layered the ingredients in a serving bowl and Wham!... Amazing!!!! Will definitely make it again!\n\nAlso read another reviewer's comment about adding some veggie broth in the quinoa water for a little flavor. This dish has tons of flavor so beware... make extra!!!!"

It had great bite to it and tasted A-O-K!\nInstead of Veggies I cut up Portuguese sausage and corn niblets, frozen instead of from a can WHICH WORKED okay. And the corn was also from a can.\nPerfect for company!"

I sauted the garlic, added tri colored peppers, a little green pepper, broccoli, frozen green peas, and frozen corn. I also added some butter to the olive oil for flavor, the cumin, and the oregano and a touch of crushed red pepper. I served it with chopped green onions.\n\nBoth hubby and I thought it was too bland. I added walnuts and sunflower seeds to mine, he added raspberry walnut vinaigrette dressing to his. His was delicious, mine was OK.\n\nI gave it three stars cause of it being bland. I'll try it again, but adjust the seasoning. Maybe my spices are to old."

I also used Garam Masala spice instead of just Cumin.I was reaching for my Cumin when I saw the Masala it has Cumin in it and I thought what the hay. It was very very good. If I hadn't seen this recipe and the poster hadn't pointed out other vegetables that would work just as deliciously my Quinoa would still be sitting on my shelf unused and unappreciated. So for the inspiration this recipe gave me I give it 5 stars."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is good, but does end up pretty bland. I added a sprinkling of freshly grated Parmesan and it gave it that edge of flavour that it needed to really be a satisfying meal. Also added some leftover mixed frozen veggies (carrot/lima bean/peas/green beans)cherry tomatoes and substituted coriander for the cumin. Also finely chopped a little bit of onion and added with the other veggies, as I didn't have any green onions.\n\nDidn't take too much prep and was ready in just over 30 minutes (I had an issue with my bell pepper, so was a bit delayed) which is a huge pro for a mom of 2 who doesn't have a lot of cooking experience!\n\nMy 2 year old loves it and my picky husband is eating it! Very pleased and will be making this again!"

I used up some homemade chicken broth instead of straight water, sauteed onion and garlic before adding the corn which was leftover from the farmer's market. I forgot to add the cumin but it was good without it. I did squeeze a little bit of lemon over it all at the end with a final drizzle of olive oil. Yum."
