I used my favorite store bought prego sauce. I used Ragu last time bc it was a little cheaper and you got more of it. It was very bland. I am not a fan of ragu sauces anyway. I hadn’t bought any in a while and was gonna give it another shot. Nope! To sum it up, this recipe is delicious if you use the right sauce! I’m a prego fan all the way. Use your go to sauce in this one and it will be a winner"

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe; however, I used ground turkey instead of beef. The pasta did cook during the baking process, but it tasted pasty. I believe that was due to the ricotta cheese. The recipe called for 1 1/2 pounds of ziti and I used 1 pound 2 ounces along with the 1 cup of ricotta cheese. The next time I make it I will use less ricotta cheese. However, the next day it tasted much better and less pasty. So like someone else said it is better as a leftover meal."

"reviewBody": "My kids love baked ziti, but I haven't been pleased with my results. Decided to try this one based on the reviews and it did not disappoint. One of the easiest recipes I've ever tried, so easy that my 15-year-old son made it all by himself, with only verbal cues from me! Upon advice of a couple reviewers, we switched out the ricotta for cream cheese to reduce the water content and added in dried oregano, garlic salt and Italian spices to season the meat. Whole family loved it. Thank goodness we increased the servings to provide dinner for two nights. Will definitely make this again...SOON!"

And I also added tiny dollops of sour cream. I had to cook mine about an hour 5 mins for pasta to be fully cooked before adding the mozzarella. Husband went back for seconds and even ate it for breakfast!"

"reviewBody": "This was good and very quick to prepare. I used Italian sausage ilo ground beef and and added garlic powder and Italian seasoning to the sauce. I used Ragu traditional sauce (my favorite) and the flavor was excellent. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce wasn't watery. I do think the ricotta was a waste. I mixed it in as directed and it disappeared, wasn't enough to make it creamy, if ricotta can even do that. Next time I would double the ricotta and mix it separately with an egg and seasonings. I would add it as a layer sandwiched between half the sauce and the other half, like lasagna. Otherwise, good recipe, thanks!"

"reviewBody": "I love this recipe! It's so good and easy to make. It also freezes fairly well. I don't think there have ever been any leftovers whenever I made this! I do make a few changes for my family- First, I take out the beef because I don't really care for it. Second, I use one 8 ounce package of Philadelphia cream cheese instead of ricotta cheese since no one in my family will eat ricotta. It probably adds lots of calories, but the cream cheese makes the casserole soooo good! As one reviewer said, it's kind of bland so to add more flavor, I took their advice and also mix in about a teaspoon of garlic powder and a teaspoon of oregano. Also, I change the shredded mozzarella to Sargento Mozzarella and Provolone mix and sprinkle garlic salt on top of the cheese. I always line the pan with aluminum foil to make cleanup a breeze. Hope this helps!"
