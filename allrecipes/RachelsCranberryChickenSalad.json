I doubled the recipe, used rotisserie chicken, so no need for salt and pepper; threw the whole Fuji apple in; added a bit more mayo and eyeballed the pecans. I love the addition of dill, and the lime juice was inspired. To stretch it a bit, next time I will add diced celery. Again, loved it, and thanks for submitting!"

My only changes were using a chopped red apple instead of green, and I added a few drops of liquid stevia to the mayo mixture to give it a hint of sweetness. This will definitely be my go-to recipe from now on."

I feel there isn't enough flavor from the apple and would suggest chopping one into small chunks, and not grating it. I again couldn't detect the dill amongst the other flavors. I added celery this time and left the green onion in as well, and there was still not enough other items besides chicken. I'd suggest upping the amount of green onions at least, if not adding in another item for additional flavor. Not a bad recipe, but definitely not one I have a desire to make again."

The second time I didn't have a green pepper but did have an apple and cranberries:) Great both ways. I probably used less mayo . . just enough to mix. I realized I prefer chicken shredded better than cubed, and chopped apple better than grated - just me turning picky in my old age. Thank you Rachel, I'll make this again!"
