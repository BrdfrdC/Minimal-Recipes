"reviewBody": "My husband needed a dish to take to a potluck and I was happy to find this recipe. I used a bag of store brand coleslaw mix . I also used red wine vinegar because that was all that I had on hand. I followed the suggestion of using Splenda for my diabetic hubby. (I haven't cooked with Splenda and thought it might be gross, but I was pleasantly surprised.) I skipped the salt because I know how salty ramen is, and I didn't miss it. I also found that 5 minutes in the oven was plenty of time for my almonds and sesame seeds to brown. After reading the reviews, I was concerned that making it ahead would result in a slimy mess. So, I made one batch for home and one for him to take. I left the dressing off of his batch so that it could be added just before serving. On our batch, I added the dressing immediately. I ate a serving right after and thought it was very good, but after it sat in the fridge for 5-6 hours, I had another serving and I thought it was even better. Things had softened up, but it was definitely not slimy. I think having time for all of the flavors to meld together was of benefit . The salad was more flavorful and the texture was just fine. It wasn't dripping with dressing and it wasn't offensively soft. I am addicted."

I've also seen this recipe made with napa cabbage, but it's not always available at my grocery store, so I use a combination of red and green cabbage sliced really thin and it was fine.

Skipped the salt and pepper. Used olive oil, also, instead of vegetable. \n Toasted the seeds, almonds, and crushed noodles in a saute pan. Halved the sugar and added a handful of dried cranberries for sweetness and texture. Don't mix the salad dressing or toasted ingredients with the fresh ingredients until just before serving to maintain the textures. It was a hit!"

To give it more of an Asian flair, I used sesame oil and rice vinegar. I love the crunch of the almonds, but 10 minutes at 350 is a bit too long. My almonds were browned at 6 minutes. I'm glad I was watching. Overall this is a solid recipe, and I will likely make again. Thanks for the idea!"

"reviewBody": "This is one of my favorite standbys for BBQ's. I don't like vinegar so I use fresh lemon juice instead (def seems to make a difference to use fresh instead of the bottle for this recipe). I also skip the salt because the ramen seasoning packet is already very salty. Usually skip the sugar or just add a little bit - definitely doesn't need it at all. I also add thinly sliced peppers for some color and crunch. I've made it with the chicken ramen but also with the oriental to make it vegetarian- they are different but both are very good. Echo what others have said- wouldn't mix together ahead or it will get soggy. Often keep some of the toasted nuts and seeds out to add to leftovers to add some crunch back in. Didn't mean to upload photo 3 times- didn't think it was working but don't know how to take it down so enjoy it x3 :)"

"reviewBody": "This was a wonderful recipe, did some adaptations. Yesterday family raved on this recipe which I doubled to accommodate the crowd.\n1) Used purple cabbage for a brighter Fall color presentation\n\n2) Subbed sugar for organic Stevia: each individual Stevia packet is equivalent to 2 tsp sugar --- a TBSP = 3 tsp, therefore that would be 3 packets if you're the making recipe as is, if doubling,6 packets or to taste.\n\n3) Swapped half the oil out for sesame oil\n\n4) Used half seasoned rice vinegar and half white wine vinegar since I didn't have enough of the rice vinegar\n\n5) In addition to toasting the sesame seeds and sliced almonds, I opted to toast the crushed Ramen noodles too to avoid the sogginess others mentioned. There's only a little of the coleslaw left this morning and the Ramen noodles are still mostly crunchy!\n\n5) FOLLOWING SOMEONE THE OTHER REVIEWERS SUGGESTIONS, I did not assemble it until right before serving. \n\nREFLECTIONS *** I think if you roast the Ramen noodles, it would be safe and optimal to put it together about 30 -60 minutes before, to help the flavors marinate a bit, because I notice it's more flavorful this morning. \n\nNext time I will try it that way and post an update if it made a difference. If anyone else is brave enough to try this and post feel free ? By the way, sorry no pic. As usual was rushing yesterday! Will post what's left in a bit."
