I really liked the ease of it but prep time was much more than 15 minutes. I followed other people's advice and added the mozzerella between each layer."

The only thing I didn’t do was put shredded Mozzarella cheese between the layers but that’s ok because it definitely doesn’t need it at all, it’s even better without the cheese. I was very generous with the seasoning and I also added ground Italian sausage along with the ground beef. I used 2 jars of roasted garlic pasta sauce and it is fabulous!! 4 and 1/2 hours in my slow cooker was all it took and I will definitely make it again!!"

I did what another reviewer did: I put a little extra mozzarella cheese on top of the sauce layers when putting it together to see how it would turn out. Then I put the 2 cups of mozzarella cheese on the top at the end like the recipe states. It was great! Next time, I will add more mozzarella cheese in between the layers. I think it will even taste better! I also used a crockpot liner bag for the first time with this recipe. It worked great, too. After scraping out the leftovers, I just pulled out the bag and threw it away. There was no cleanup of that heavy crockpot other than washing the lid. It was great! I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who loves lasagna but wants to be able to make it easier than the traditional recipe. It was yummy!"

The only thing I did differently was to use turkey burger instead of hamburger and added 2 cooked and cut up Sweet Italian Turkey sausages. I also did as some other reviewers and added part of the mozzarella to the layers. I used frozen ravioli and cooked on low for 3 hours, then added the remaining mozzarella on top and cooked for another 45 minutes. Will make this again, thanks for the recipe."

Bake at 350° for 45-60 minutes , adding the cheese to the top for the last 20-30 minutes. I found it gets too messy in the crock pot but this way keeps it together."

Used about 36 oz ravioli and added mozzarella and Parmesan into the three layers of ravioli. My daughter loves it more then actual lasagna so guess what- will be making two crockpots next time and having lots to freeze for when I don’t have time to cook. I actually had to turn my setting to high since at two hours (several reviewers said it only needed 2 hours) on low (with the extra layers) mine was not done. I did throw extra fresh parsley in with the last layer of cheese for the last 30 minutes of cooking"
