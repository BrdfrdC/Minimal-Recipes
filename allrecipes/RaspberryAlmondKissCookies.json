"reviewBody": "Never made thumbprint cookies before, but I wanted to find a cookie to set in the cherry jelly hearts I picked up for Valentine’s Day. I looked at LOTS of recipes. This was the only one I saw with brown sugar, so I was intrigued by that. \n\nI tried the suggestion of adding the extra egg yolk, and it worked very well. \n\nI had to use strawberry jam, and I added 2 drops pink food coloring for Valentine’s Day. \n\nI tried some with a thumbprint first, and I definitely found that waiting until they have cooked at least 9 minutes was the best time to place the piece of Candy. If you press them down first, the cookie slides away from the candy, and the cookie goes flat. I pulled them out of the oven at 9-10 minutes placed the candy, then returned it for 1-2 minutes more. I didn’t have the chocolate kisses, so I would probably just place those right as they come out of the oven like the recipe says. \n\nIn all, I was very happy with the result."

I'm someone who typically loves to eat tons and tons of cookies, but these cookies were so sweet that after one cookie I knew I had to stop. For the first dozen cookies I forgot to add almond extract to the drizzle, and I ended up liking that batch better. If I make them again I'll probably tinker with the combination/recipe a bit. I'm curious if almond flour would work within this recipe."

Instead of almond ext., I used vanilla ext., and used a pumpkin spice kiss in the center. I added a shake of cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter to go along with the theme. I added 2 T. of milk to the batter to avoid the dry, crumbly cookie that many reviewers complained about...no dry cookies here! Thank you for the base recipe to fuel my creativity. This recipe made 36 very good cookies."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was an awesome one! I wanted something different and this provided. I don't actually like peanut butter cookies so this concept was great. Just a few critiques though. First the dough was so dry I couldn't get it stick. So I had to add about a tablespoon of water to the dough. It was still very dry but after that I was able to get it to stick decently. I would start with adding a teaspoon of and move your way up. An oil would probably work better but I didn't have any in arms reach. I also didn't have raspberry jam, but I had a berry blend. Turned out great, I think any tart berry jam would work we.. Finally I took other's advice and used dark chocolate kisses because I just really like dark chocolate. Huge hit. You only need one small bag. I apparently made my cookies small and it made about 65 cookies, so you get a lot out of this recipe."

My cookies came out a bit flat (due to the additional butter I think.) Also I used strawberry jam instead of raspberry, which was just as delicious. I also used Hershey's hugs. I'd recommend freezing or chilling the hugs first since they melt when placed on the warm cookies. All in all a great recipe with a few modifications."

Not wanting to stop &amp; go to the store I found some coconut extract and decided to go that route. I even added some shredded coconut to the mix. Mix was a bit dry, so I added some drops of water. It worked. My kids went nuts over them. For the glaze I just used vanilla. They were really good. Next time I'll have the almond though, that sounds even better to me."

My hubby loves raspberry and almond flavor, so I knew this was a good choice. I used my 1.5 Tbsp. cookie scoop to measure out the balls and came out with 27 cookies. For the glaze, I did have to add an extra 1 1/2 tsp. milk to get to drizzling consistency. I put the glaze in a baggie, snipped off the corner and squeezed it on in a zig-zag. I was a little disappointed in the cookie part, it was hard and dry. However, I do love the flavor combination and the fact that they are very pretty. Great for Valentine's Day!"

"reviewBody": "I tried this recipe out for a different type of cookie to make rather than the same old stuff. But, unfortunately, I was not fond of this. I think the almond extract should be increased as I could still smell the flour and eggs after baking. The kisses and drizzle part tasted average. It was ok. Thanks."

"reviewBody": "Very very tasty. Might need to add more levening to the dough (I'm at high altitude 6200ft) as they turned out too flat and crunchy for cookie texture. The sugar-covered dough balls baked up flat and the sugar coating melted in with the butter. Absolutely delish none-the-less."
