It thickened too much and was too sweet, but still very good. The second batch, I used half the sugar and what an explosion of flavour! Raspberry jam is my favourite. Homemade raspberry jam is the only kind I'll eat from now on. So easy in the machine too! This was the first time I'd ever made jam and can't believe how easy it is. Thanks for forgetting the pectin and giving us this great recipe."

Used 5 c smashed berries, less than 4 c sugar and 2 T lemon. Thought extra seeds would give more pectin and thicken faster..not the case kept at 220 fo at least 20 min. Boiled down to 7 8oz jars. Very Good as jam or icecream topping."

Jam was still liquid when I placed in jars and I was pretty sure at that point I didn’t cook it long enough. However , the next morning I checked the cooled jars and it had turned to jam. Very easy recipe, jam turned out delicious and sweet enough with 3 cups of sugar."

Good thing there's still so many things that it will be delicious with!"

I may cut back on the sugar next time just to get a little more of the raspberry flavor, but it really is good as written as well. However, I did have to cook it longer. At 4 minutes, it was just saucy and I started looking at my box of pectin, wondering if I should try to add it. But, I stuck with it, and cooked for about 24 minutes. Being new, I wasn't sure exactly what I was looking for, but it may be just a tad too thick now that it's cooled. I would probably do 20 minutes next time. Thank you for this delicious recipe!"

Used the frozen plate method to check (freeze a glass plate in the freezer 10 mins. When jam is ready put a spoonful on. Freeze for 1 minute and if you can run a finger through without it running back together, it’s ready. Can add corn starch or lemon juice boil for 3 mins and try again until it jams up after a minute in the freezer)"

I strained half the mixture to get the seeds out and left half with the seeds. The jars sealed themselves after filling with the hot mixture. I opened on recently. It was very good. I think just a touch too sweet so I may cut further down on the sugar. My berries were really ripe. It spreads perfectly and the amount of seeds in the jam is just fine. The original mixture was just chock full of seeds. So I am glad I strained half the seeds out."
