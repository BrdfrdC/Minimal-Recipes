It turned out great, next time I would refrigerate for longer (or overnight), the leftovers the next day were slightly better than the day I made it. Word of warning - the juicing / de-seeding of the raspberries took much longer than I expected. It was worth the delicious results but will plan for more time for this task next time."

"reviewBody": "4.15.19 What a lovely recipe. Made this exactly as written, and I wouldn’t change a thing. The fresh raspberry flavor is delicate and fruity, the texture is silky and spot-on perfect for mousse, and the level of sweetness is just right, not overpowering. Without question, this is an indulgence in this house, but I wanted to make a special dessert for my husband’s birthday, and this didn’t disappoint. This is an exquisite dessert suitable for any special dinner. Thanks for sharing your recipe."
