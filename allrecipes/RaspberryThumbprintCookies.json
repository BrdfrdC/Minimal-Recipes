I checked the math after trying to diagnose why it was so dry and awful. I also think all butter rather than some shortening would have given it a lot more flavor. Bad recipe all around."

"reviewBody": "I loved these cookies! I used roughly the butter/shortening ratio, though probably slightly more butter but overall the same total volume. I found the dough quite firm even without chilling. Both pecans and walnuts worked well—even though I normally don’t really like walnuts. The best jam to use is tart, to balance out the flavours. I liked gooseberry jelly best. I will make these at Christmas because they are more fancy and finicky than my usual cookies."

Only differences are all butter with no shortening and we added the jam right when the cookies came out of the oven still warm. If we wanted something different we replaced the jam with a room temp Hershey chocolate kiss (make sure its pressed into the warm cookie right when they come out of the oven since this will slightly melt the chocolate kiss to adhere to the cookie).

I always put the jelly in after they're out of the oven, so the jelly doesn't run!"

A few suggestions from other comments really helped keep things simple. Chill the dough before rolling it into balls and also put the jam in a ziplock and cut a corner off to squeeze the jam into the thumbprints. Thank you for sharing and thank you also to all of you who left suggestions/tips in your reviews!"

I made them smaller than 1\", then \"thumbprinted\" them with a wine cork. I also used a raspberry \"all fruit\" spread (in a ziploc bag with corner cut off for EASY application.) Made 5 dozen. I will definitely make these again!!!"
