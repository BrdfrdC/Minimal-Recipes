"reviewBody": "I skipped the liqueur and mistakenly used Ghirardelli white chips (not sure if they’re actually chocolate or not) and filled and iced a chocolate cake with it. I poured the raspberry sauce between layers and on top of the cake. Everyone agreed it was the best cake they have ever tasted. The next day everyone wanted me to bake another because the first one didn’t last. I chilled the mousse before filling the cake and it still squished out of the cake when I stacked it. I wasn’t planning on icing it with the mousse but when it squished out, that made the decision easy. I had doubled the mousse recipe and there was just enough to fill between the 4 layers of the torted 8” cake and cover the outside. It was a huge hit. I’ll definitely be making it again and will also make the mousse/sauce on it own as a dessert. The sauce pushed this recipe over the top and was incredible."

"reviewBody": "I saved this recipe to my Allrecipes box way back in 3/2007 but didn't get around to making it until a few days ago. It's fairly easy to make. I was lazy so didn't strain the raspberry puree. I have Grand Marnier and orange citronge in my cupboard. I intended on using the citronge but grabbed the Marnier by mistake and added it to the puree before catching the error. But, according to the internet Marnier is a cognac-based orange liqueur so I figured it would be ok. \n\nI did not add food coloring to the chocolate-cream mixture. It's also not necessary to put this mix into a separate bowl. Once the cream was whipped, I folded the cooled chocolate mix into the whipped cream. \n\nIt sets up nicely in the frig. It has a light, creamy texture and flavor. The raspberry puree was a little tart but not overly so. I ended up with a lot of leftover puree which would be good on ice cream, stirred into plain or vanilla yogurt, or drizzled on a bagel that has cream cheese on it . I would make this again."

I left out the food coloring, and used Julia Child's recipe for Raspberry Sauce instead of the one listed. Basically, it uses a tablespoon of Cognac (expensive french brandy) instead of Orange liqueur. Absolutely divine. My parents loved it, but my sister thought it tasted too strongly of dark chocolate. It wasn't as sweet as she would have liked it. Overall, definitely a repeatable recipe."

I was specifically looking for a simple mousse recipe but this just tasted like really sweet whipped cream. The texture was off too (not like mousse) and I followed the recipe exactly. I made chocolate cups for the mousse and with the raspberry sauce it was a pretty good combination. I think the sauce was the best part of the recipe. I would make that again for a different dessert."

I originally gave this 3 stars, but after refrigerating for several hours I had to bump it up to a least 4."

This was my first time making mousse, and the recipe was very easy to follow. Not to mention, super easy to make an absolutely BEAUTIFUL presentation, especially garnished with a whole berry or two! I did the sauce a little differently - using the directions from *Supreme Strawberry Topping* on this site, which I think made it a little more thick and syrupy (and delicious). TIP: I don't have any kind of mixer/whipping appliance, so DH and I did it like second graders - put the cream in a tightly sealable tupperware, and shake it like there is no tomorrow! (How fun would it be to have kids to help do this?)"

Simplified version: 8 oz. white chocolate, chopped 1 pint heavy cream 1 tbsp. vanilla Melt chocolate and about 1/4 c. cream in double boiler. Meanwhile whip cream until stiff (I do this by putting cream in a large container with a tight fitting lid and shaking....fun for the whole family). Remove melted chocolate from heat, let cool slightly,stir in vanilla. Let cool until lukewarm, fold into whipped cream until no streaks. Distribute into serving dishes or glasses and chill. Serve with whatever sauce/topping works for you."

They recieved rave reviews! Easy to prepare ahead, just don't put them in the freezer beacause your chocolate cups will melt! Just store them in the fridge if you make them ahead of time."

I added about a quarter to a half teaspoon of orange extract instead. The mousse was excellent and not too sweet (and I was really afraid it would be, as I usually don't love white chocolate for this reason). I divided it into four one-cup ramekins for four servings (recipe says 16, but they'd be quite small servings). Then, I put a few fresh raspberries on top, and drizzled a couple of tablespoons of the raspberry sauce over that. Then, I shaved some good dark chocolate over the top and it got rave reviews. Thanks Stacey! Very easy."

I layered it in a champagne flute w/the raspberry sauce, then topped it with raspberry, sprig of mint, and a chocolate filigree design I made. It received a lot of compliments."

The flavor of the mousse is so subtle tasting that it was more like a bland whipped topping than a mousse. The mousse is not as sweet as cool whip is alone. I might try double or tripling the amount of raspberry sauce added to the melted chocolate &amp; cream mixture. The mousse served 8. The raspberry sauce is really fantastic - it went a long way, is delicious on Belgium waffles, and kept very well."

The only changes I made was omitting the red food coloring, using fresh berries, and I substituted the almond flavored tequila for the orange liqueur, because it was what I had on hand. Also, I used white chocolate chips because my grocery store did not carry any bars. It worked just fine and according to another recipe, 6oz of the chocolate equals 1 cup of chips. I didn't find it hard to strain the seeds from the berries, I just used a fine wire mesh sieve, and worked the sauce through with a spoon. This recipe made four large servings for me. I will definitely make this again!"

I do think the number of servings is way off though, there's no way this would feed 16 people unless they're each getting about one spoonful apiece. I made a full recipe and it was just the right amount for 4 people, though we had quite a bit of raspberry sauce leftover. We found that spooning the leftover sauce over whole raspberries (or even strawberries) was a great way to eat the leftovers though!"

"reviewBody": "What a wonderful little recipe! Just served this tonight to my mother, my husband and my in-laws. Quite a nice finish to a quasi-heavy New Year's Day meal (crown roast of pork and turkey). I used a frozen berry mix for the sauce and made sure to adjust the sweetness after I sieved it. I served parfait style in champagne flutes, placing a little of the sauce in the bottom of the flute first. I chilled until ready to serve, and served some last minute chocolate dipped strawberries as a garnish/side. Overall, I found that the flavors married really well, and the dessert on the whole seemed to go over equally as well. For my part, I have to say that I liked both the taste and the texture of the dessert. I was a little concerned at first that I might get something marshmellow-y in texture, and I am so NOT a marshmellow fan, but definitely not the case here. One thing, though, I read the reviews after I'd made the dessert, and absolutely have to agree with everyone about the yield. I could have easily made 6, but no doubt would've needed to double the recipe to make considerably more than that. Nevertheless, worked for me!"

Can't quite put my finger on it, but something was off, maybe the combination of the three flavors, or maybe Grand Marnier was not the best choice of liqueur. This was just okay, and there are many better mousse, raspberry, and white chocolate recipes than this. None of my dinner guests were particularly impressed either, but for those who are going to give this recipe a shot my suggestion would be to try Cassis, or Chambord, or leave the liqueur out altogether."

I made the raspberry sauce using triple sec because that's what I had on hand and my (frozen) berries were already in light syrup, so I didn't add sugar. Unfortunately, I whipped my cream too much (to stiff peaks instead of soft peaks), so the end result of my mousse was somewhat stiffer than it should have been, but it was still really tasty. We all agreed in the end that the while the mousse is really good, it is the raspberry sauce that really makes it."

"reviewBody": "I made this for a Christmas Eve dessert. It tasted great and was easy. I ended up serving in white and semi-sweet lacy chocolate cups with the mousse frozen (partly due to my lack of refrigerator space at this time of year). It was served to 11 people. Like one reviewer had warned, it only makes about 3 cups so is not a lot of mousse for 16 - possibly a typing error (should be about 6-8 servings I think). But, with the addition of some extra whipped cream on top and the chocolate bowls I found it to be adequate after a heavy meal. I had the sauce on the side mainly and used mixed berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries) as not everyone in our family is nuts over raspberries. I also didn't have any orange liqueur (thought I did) so I substituted about a tablespoon of orange juice concentrate which turned out to be tasty to my 7 year old son. Straining the berries was a bit tricky/time consuming so added a little bit of liquid to the berries to make the processing a little easier (just had used a small Braun food processor attachment - perhaps a blender would have worked better in making the puree). Everyone liked it and I would make it again or use it as a cake filling."
