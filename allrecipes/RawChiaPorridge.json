The night I made it, it was very soupy. after sitting in the fridge over night it was nice, thick and creamy :). Will make often!!"

I admit, I heated it for a few seconds in the microwave to take off the nip (It's snowing outside, so cut me some slack :-) Warmed a bit, the banana cinnamon flavor really jumps at you and the chia seeds still give that bit of crunch. Don't think this is like tapioca pearls, it's not. Oh yeah, I added a drop of vanilla. Thank you Raw_Angel for convincing me to eat this."
