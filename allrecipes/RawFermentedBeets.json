"reviewBody": "I like these a lot and they ARE easy! The only trick is using the right kind of beets. Detroit reds hold their color well but I think chioggia beets should only be eaten young and raw or they fade to gray and become less visually appealing. If you’ve let your chioggias get big and old and lose their color, you can still ferment them. They’ll taste fine but not be beautiful jewels on your plate."
