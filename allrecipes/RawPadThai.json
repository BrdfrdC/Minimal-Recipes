"reviewBody": "Overall, this wasn't a horrible recipie. I chose to add in actual pad thai rice noodles, and I'm so glad I did because there was still way too much leftover sauce at the bottom of the bowl that wasn't soaked up by the contents of the recipie. The carrot and zucchini \"noodles\" took way too long to peel and cut, and I didn't even use half of the red cabbage. I didn't realize how much I enjoy pad thai served hot and with egg in the recipe. It was an okay meal, but I probably won't be making this again."

"reviewBody": "For me, this is more of a salad rather a Pad Thai. The taste of the zucchini doesn't compare to rice noodles, although I can imagine the sauce, which was very good, being used in traditional Pad Thai. \n\nI wish I knew all the commenters technique with making this a quick, easy dish. I found it to be very laborious. I'm sure the zucchini would have been easier for me to work with if I had a smaller one (mine was fat and 17\" long), and I just have a little hand-held spiraler, but cutting the cabbage into thin strips was painful too. I'll probably try this recipe one more time someday with a regular sized zucchini, but if I don't save much time, the effort won't be worth it for this to be a keeper. It's good but not great, except in terms of health, which is fantastic."

The second time I got the sauce ready in a different container and put it in the fridge cuz I didn't have time to eat it. The next day I found the peanut butter and miso paste broke down. I added some sesame oil to it and blended it, poured it over my single serving and it was great! I reduced the nut butter and honey, I also added roasted sesame seeds and some sesame oi"

The miso is part of what makes the dish. I also used 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger instead of tablespoon of fresh. As you are eating, the bottom of the dish becomes watery and soggy. My husband tolerated it. He is definitely a meat-atarian. I liked it quite a bit. It makes a good side dish."

I also reduced the amount of honey to make it \"better\" for sugar content. Additionally, I only added about 3/4 of the head of cabbage and added in some jicama in replacement for the crunch of the bean spouts since my local grocery store decided to stop carrying them due to problems they were having. I've made this for my family and for a nutrition group, many without kitchen access, great recipe, thanks for posting!"

Hubs liked it alot though. I actually made a similar PB dressing from the asian coleslaw recipe on this site to use on the cabbage/zucchini mixture. We added fresh cilantro too. Will def make the salad part again but stick to the other dressing."
