"reviewBody": "This was my first time making pablano peppers, so I didn‚Äôt make the sauce. A couple things I learned, you can roast the peppers in the air fryer. My model has shelves rather than a basket, so it can roast 8 at a time. I cooked them for 20 minutes total at 320¬∞, turning them over every 5 minutes. Next time I will only cook them for 15 minutes. I will also make a single slice and remove the seeds before I cook them. Mine were a little soft after cooking and steaming, which made cleaning out the seeds without tearing the peppers impossible. üò¢ I put them in a Ziplock gallon bag and let them steam for 20 minutes. They were still too hot to handle, so I let them cool outside the bag for 5-10 minutes. The skins came off easily and I wore kitchen gloves to be safe. I also added a pound of cooked ground beef and onions with the cheese, then added more cheese on top. I thought my first attempt was just okay the day I made them but they were great on the second day! They were a little more spicy and the flavors blended. I will definitely make this again and follow the instructions next time.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Five‚≠êÔ∏ès!"

"reviewBody": "My husband, who loves Chiles Rellenos in restaurants, will never order them again. He has never had them as good as these. I made your recipe using several tips from reviewers. The tips are: 1. Mold the shredded cheeses around a tablespoon of cream cheese; 2. Don‚Äôt over roast the poblanos, they become mushy; 3. You can use regular oregano, and I used Hunt‚Äôs Seasoned Diced Tomatoes in Sauce for Mild Chili; 4. I cut way back on the cinnamon and cumin. I‚Äôm a little sensitive to cumin; 5. I used 4 egg whites and did not whip till dry but just before that; 6. I added 2 yolks (why not?); 7. Just dipping the chiles in the batter did not work well, I did a combo of dipping and spreading the batter; 8. Spoon hot oil gently over the chiles before flipping to the second side. The batter slightly cooks and it will stay on; 9. IF there are leftovers, re-heat on foil in 375 F for about 6 minutes to preserve the crispy crust."

"reviewBody": "These are really delicious, and the supper light, crispy batter and slightly spicy salsa really sing together. Next time I'd skip the steaming step to keep the chiles a bit firmer, as they tended to come apart when filling them with cheese. I'd also use a chunk of cheese rather than grated for a stronger cheese presence. I would probably keep the stuffed peppers in the freezer longer, too, perhaps an hour to make dipping them in batter easier. I would also cut the vinegar in the salsa to 1 Tbs or omit it entirely, as tomato by itself is plenty sour. I separated egg whites and egg yolks to beat the whites, but I blended them all back together to make the batter. I used fresh Hatch chilies rather than poblano, simply because these were readily available."

But, after tasting it, I will most certainly make it again. :-) I ended up holding the stuffed chile in my hand, spooning batter on top of it and placing the batter side down in the oil. Then, I spooned more batter on top. I thought the cheese would explode out, but it didn‚Äôt. I used home grown chiles. I want to try this with hatch chilies when they‚Äôre available, too. Yummy!

"reviewBody": "We really enjoyed it. It is very intimidating and quite a mess to clean up, but worth it! I made a few adjustments according to what I had. I used a 10oz can of Rotel Tomatoes instead of 15 oz Mexican stewed tomatoes. I also used regular oregano. I grilled 4 poblano peppers. I used a 2 cup bag of Old El Paso 3 pepper shredded cheese. I used Frank's Red Hot Sauce. Rather than blending the tomatoes, I put all the sauce ingredients into the sauce pan and used my immersion blender on all of it and made it ever so slightly chunky. Medium High was too hot for my stove and oil and my 4th pepper burned. I'd dial it back a bit in the future. By the time I was putting the 3rd pepper in there, the first one was getting over done. It will take some practice to get the timing down, but I will do this again for sure."

If I were using large eggs, I believe the call for 5 eggs would still be right but with extra-large eggs, 4 is plenty.\nWith the increase in seasonings, the flavor was perfect.... Not too much. I think if I would have used the quantities called for in the recipe, it would have been a little too mild in flavor."

To bread them I put them in flour, egg mixture, then flour again. I also baked them instead of frying, 420 degrees for 15-20 minutes. Came out great and will definitely make them again. Yum!"

My mouth is watering just writing this. For the cheese mixture I used what I had on hand: 4 oz of cream cheese, mozzarella, and sharp cheddar. Don't whip your egg whites too dry like I did, though.

I followed the recipe carefully and found that the chlies were easy to peel, and the batter was perfect--some recipes don't add flour to the egg mixture, and I think this made the batter easier to work with. The only thing I did differently was that I put less oil in the pan (half canola, half olive oil) and fried the chiles on either side, medium to slightly less than medium heat about 10 minutes per side til they were browned. No need to then drain them on paper towels. Also, next time, I think I would put less mozarella and more cheddar. I didn't make the sauce, used a 10 oz can of red enchilada sauce that I simmered on the stove while the chile rellenos were cooking, maybe I'll have time to try the sauce next time. Really great recipe, many thanks!"

"reviewBody": "Very good and very authentic recipe! I avoided the freezing stage by using French fry-sized pieces of Monterey Jack and cheddar in place of the shredded cheeses. I had enough meringue to coat 6-8 chilies, so if you're going to take the time to make 4, why not make 8 instead? Poblano peppers are not particularly spicy, but the inch closest to the stem can be, so be careful! I suggest that you broil the chiles as close to the flames as you can get them. When I made these, I think some of the peppers were over-cooked because they started to split. A faster roasting probably would have avoided this outcome. I also used a clean paper bag instead if plastic because I don't really like the idea of putting hot things into plastic. Who knows what plasticizing agents come out of the plastic and into your food with the heat? As long as the chiles are well floured, you can ensure that they stay closed by coating them with the meringue and immediately frying. Overall, this recipe had wonderful flavor and a beautiful presentation. Now, if only I could find a super Mexican rice recipe . . . I will definitely be making these again."

There wasn't any at the store so I bought Cotija cheese instead and it was so amazing I've never gone back! (way better than using monterey jack). I've also heard my mother-in-law say that the batter can be too eggy so I omitted 1 egg white from it (so I use 4 whites instead of 5) and I like it that way. They can be time consuming so I often prep the peppers the day before then leave them covered in the freezer overnight. My husband says they are the best he's ever had!"

I've been making homemade Chile Rellenos for over 30 years now and make the batter for the rellenos pretty much the same way as this recipe. It takes a bit of work but the results are delicious and not the least bit heavy or greasy . I tried the sauce recipe here but in my opinion, it was too tomato-y and did not work well with the relleno. Out here in New Mexico we (strongly) favor a sauce made from pureed red chiles, using no tomatoes, cinnamon, etc. for our rellenos. So, for the battered chiles, I give this 5 stars. I give the sauce 2 stars."

I think it works best as a 2-day project: stuff and freeze the peppers on day 1, make sauce and fry peppers on day 2. \n\nOne modification I made was to dip the flour-dredged (still-frozen) peppers in beaten egg before applying the batter coating. I think this helps to seal up cracks in the peppers, preventing leakage of filling, and makes the batter adhere better. And make sure to choose peppers with the stems still attached! The stem makes a great \"handle\" to lift and turn the peppers when frying them."

I ended up adding a little water to the flour - egg yolk mixture before folding it into the stiff-peak beaten egg walks so everything would fold in together. Came out tasty &amp; spicy."

"reviewBody": "The real beauty of this is that after step 3, you can freeze these babies and wait until another time to finish cooking them (and the sauce). I do use other cheeses - no cheddar or mozzarella cheese at all! I have been making these for many years, and this recipe is almost identical to mine, with the exception of the cheeses. The only 'tip' I would add is that when you start to fry the peppers, lower them very carefully into the hot oil and before you flip them, spoon some of the hot oil over the top of the egg mixture coating the peppers, otherwise, when you flip the pepper all of the batter will splatter off. Thanks \"fat dog\" for a good recipe."

"reviewBody": "The good? It was ALL good. It took some work but most of it was in the side dishes and, since my electric mixer is on the fritz, I had to whisk the egg whites the old fashion way. My arm still aches.\n\nWould I do it all again? Absolutely!\n\nI was a little taken aback about putting the stuffed peppers for \"at least 30 minutes,\" but I soon discovered that it is an integral step. It makes handling the once floppy peppers a breeze.\n\nBottom line is it was a bit of work but the result was well worth it. I've paid $25+(each person) for these at a restaurant and they weren't as good. This recipe might cost $12 (plus sides) to feed 4.\n\nGo for it and make any personal adjustments to your taste."

"reviewBody": "I really liked these, but my husband thought they were to spicy. I used green chiles from a friends garden. I too had tiny holes in my chiles from removing the seeds, but cheese didn't spill out. I baked mine because I do not usually fry or deep fry. I will try frying next time. I could not make the sauce because I sent hubby to the grocery and he forgot the stewed tomatoes. Served with spanish rice and sour cream. I will make these ahead and freeze them until ready to use to cute down on prep time."

My dad orders chile rellenos everytime we go to a mexican restaurant and he claims he has yet to find any that will beat these. I think the sauce also really makes the dish, it's delicious. :)"
