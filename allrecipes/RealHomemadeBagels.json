You must dissolve your yeast in water and sugar first, then work into your flour. I used 4 cups of flour, which was plenty. The instructions for shaping the bagels are lacking. The final product is abysmal. Some parts are burned, some parts are still soaked from the boiling process. This is not a good recipe, even with the changes.

"reviewBody": "First time making bagels and not an experienced baker, so this was a real adventure but have now run it three times. Dough is a bit dry and have added a bit of water each time. They are a bit large, but not outrageous. Tried it twice leaving the dough overnight and once for only two hours -- results pretty similar. Taste is great and they have the right chewiness that a bagel should have. Struggling with two things: the dough comes out a little too light, not the right bagel density, and having a little bit of trouble getting the loop to stay a loop -- the joint tends to pull/bake apart. Wetting the joint helped a bit, but still need to figure that bit out. But super easy, super tasty."

"reviewBody": "These were DELICIOUS! I followed other users' recommendations and proofed the yeast first, then I only added four cups of bread flour. It was very hard to mix (I used my hand mixer and my arm just about fell off!). I then ended up kneading it by hand for a little while on the counter. I didn't let it sit in the fridge overnight but next time I probably will. I guess I didn't roll them well enough because mine had funny stretch marks on them when they were done. Also they floated the entire time while I was boiling, and I couldn't get them to stay together where I closed the circles. I will for sure make these again and correct my mistakes, but even with the problems I had they were so good."

I tried only boiling them a minute, putting them immediately into the oven, and various things people have said to do. They look great until I put them in the boiling water. Then they lose all their umph and just end up looking like a rather thick piece of bread with a crunchy crust. I don't know what I might be doing wrong."

"reviewBody": "Excellent. Great flavour and chew. Like others, I tweaked a few things. 1 tbsp sugar and 2 tbsp honey. I used regular yeast so I bloomed it in advance in the hot water, sugar and honey then added flour and salt. 3 1/2 c whole wheat bread flour and 1 c all purpose. Used about 1/2 c honey in boiling water. I put dough in fridge for about 4 hours before taking out for 2 hours and then making the bagels. When I put the bagels in boiling water, they puffed up to almost twice their size and they're huge. I made 6 very large and 4 large bagels. I would make them smaller next time and could easily get a dozen or more. Topped with sesame seed on some, poppyseed on others. Very tasty. And unlike others experienced, they didn't stick to parchment paper at all."

I thought the first dough was much too thick with the 4 cups of flour, but after kneading it for a while it was fine and turned out to be much more authentically chewy. We did two other batches with 3.5 cups of flour and they were a little lighter and still chewy. I also cut down the honey by 1/2 and it still gave the sweetness to the outside. We loved them and although a bit time consuming they were definitely worth the effort!"

Dough handled well after I let it warm up for about an hour. I used the honey in the boiling water as directed and dipped in sesame seeds prior to baking. My only issue was how to keep the dough together on each bagel? I used a tiny bit of water and that helped but a could came apart in the boil. Any suggestions?"

Unbelievably I was able to add about and 8th cup more water to the dough to get it to a manageable state. It rose beautifully. \nAlso I think the bagels would have been much too big following the recipe for cutting them out. In the end I cut 16 pieces for 16 bagels.\nIf you go this small you will need to lower temp to around 400 and cook less. I actually don't really know how long I cooked mine for so I will have to play with it the next time I make them. For 16 bagels the heat is too hot and they will end up burning the ingredients on the top. For the ingredients on the top I made some garlic and onion, pizza seasoning with tomatoes and cheese, and parmesan cheese with tomato. \nHad the recipe needed no changes I would have given it 5 stars. But I feel since I had to figure out how to make some changes in order to get the dough manageable I gave it 3."
