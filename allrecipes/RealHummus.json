I used the red tinted olive oil from the pan that I roasted the peppers in on top of the mixture I then also added a dash of cayenne pepper to the recipe and sprinkled a bit around the edges . My daughter, a huge NYC foodie, ate it with gusto and announced that this was actually the very best hummus she has ever tasted, including from the foreign countries she's visited. I myself am very happy with the result and will be making frequently."

"reviewBody": "It certainly was delicious but it came out too watery when I added the specified amount of liquid from the can. Unfortunately I only had one can of chick peas and had no way to go back and thicken it up. I must say that I don’t much care for the use of liquid from the can. I have another recipe that calls for olive oil and and cumin that I like much better. Nevertheless, if you don’t have olive oil, or prefer a lower fat version, this recipe is great. And like I’ve said, it’s delicious. Just make sure to add the liquid slowly to get the right consistency."

I replace the Tahini with 1 Tbsp sesame seeds (lightly toasted) and 11/2 Tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil. The result is a hummus that is better than what I can buy locally. You can increase or decrease the amount you get buy varying the size of the can of beans that you use."
