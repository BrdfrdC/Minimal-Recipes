"reviewBody": "So I made a half batch, kind of winging the batter recipe (and still ending up with what seemed like more batter than a regular recipe would make. I froze my curds (which were roast pepper and garlic infused! Yum!) for about an hour beforehand, breaking them up before they went in to freeze. I also double breaded them, dipping the frozen curds into beer, then flour, then the batter before going in to the oil. Turned out great! Had to do the entire production in two or three runs through the fryer, due to not wanting to overcook the first in and having the melty cheese run out. So I put curds in until the first in was nicely browned, then fished them out as they were done before starting the next batch."

We added some seasoning to the batter based on other reviews but did everything else as stated. Cooked them in a pot on the stove over med-high, didn't have a thermometer so just had to watch them and adjust temperature as needed. You can tell when you drop them in if they are browning up quickly or if you need to up the temp a bit. Definitely a keeper of recipe! Would be perfect for shrimp or other things as well."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe! \nI did make a few suggested changes however.\nI made the batter as stated.\nI took out the cheese curds from the fridge and let warm up for a while. I put them in a zipper bag and added cornstarch, about 1 tablespoon, just enough for a thin coating on each curd and shook like crazy. I then, in small batches placed in the batter and coated the curds. I took the curds out of the batter with a slotted spoon, draining excess batter and placed on a cookie sheet pan and placed in the freezer for about 10 minutes and blast chilled. After chilling, just long enough for the batter to slightly form to the curd without dripping...I re-dipped them in the batter. A 2nd coating of batter! Put in the freezer again to chill the batter to the curd so it's not dripping; another 10 minutes, give or take. Don't freeze solid just chill so batter isn't dripping. When chilled place curds in small batches in your pot of hot oil (I suggest using an oil with a high smoking point). Don't over crowd your oil. Watch closely! Seriously only a minute or two and they are golden and done. Place on paper towels to drain and enjoy. Be careful they are hot! But delicious!\n*NOTE: you can add seasoning to your liking too. When you put the cornstarch on the curds add Paprika, Onion and garlic powder and cayenne pepper if desired. I just eyeball it. You can add the same seasonings to your batter as well if you want."

This will help them hold together in the 375 degree oil for 2min.\n\nAlso, refrigerate batter overnight. Again, to help cheese curds hold together while being fried in hot oil. They‚Äôll still come out hot, but most importantly, intact. \n\n(Only fry a small hand full 4-7 at a time)"

I fried some with the regular yellow cheddar cheese curds &amp; then some with the white cheddar &amp; jalapeno curds. I froze the cheese curds ahead of time, broke them apart, battered them &amp; then put them in a pan with hot oil on my stove (while still frozen) for about 2 minutes for each small batch. None of mine stuck to anything. I honestly think freezing them before frying, helped with the cheese not oozing out while they were frying, like they did with the room temp or refrigerated ones. We will definitely make these again!"

"reviewBody": "I made this on a whim after buying some cheese curds from a famers market. I love beer battered foods but alas I don't drink. So i had to buy a pack of Yuengling and hoped for the best. After reading some of the other reviews, I coated the curds with cornstarch first before battering, but I didn't freeze them and it didn't seem to make them melt out, so the cornstarch is enough. However, if the oil isn't at 375 or hotter, I found that they took too long to cook and eventually the cheese would evaporate into the oil. \n\nI also used peanut oil some that's the best oil to fry with. \n\nI suggest taking them out if you notice a tiny bit of cheese escaping. That pretty much means it's done.\n\nSo the best way to make them is to have the oil hot enough and I also found that going straight from the batter to the oil made the batter fry up more smoothly and beautifully. If you batter them first and let them sit a while the batter isn't as full and smooth. \n\nI found it overall to taste delicious and highly recommend eating them as soon as they get out of the oil. It tastes best when hot."

Freezing after battering is a must in my opinion, had almost no leakage or mess! Great flavor, and will have to say they're better than the State Fair curds this year. Could be because I now live in Oklahoma instead of Ohio?"

I almost did because the batter seems so thin but did a trial run with them at room temperature. lightly dusted them with flour, that helped the batter stick, and they were left out over night, separated out, and at room temperature on parchment to absorb the moisture...this probably helped too...I don't know but they were perfect and the recipe just needs some added salt and seasonings. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and added a bit of paprika, garlic powder, pepper, and extra salt. first time making them and did about 5 at a time (didn't crowd) and used oil thermometer to stay at 375. Fried in coconut oil. DO NOT freeze, you will lose the squeaky freshness but if they are grocery store bought, it's already gone anyway :)"

The first couple times it ended up with a huge mess and burnt cheese stuck to the bottom of the pan. \nThe trick to them not melting all over the place is freezing them first. Completely frozen. The batter has a chance to cook before the cheese gets too melty and leaves the batter. Mine still end up melting out a bit and not restaurant quality but it soothes the cravings. \nThis batter is the perfect thickness though doesn't have much of a flavor. Add seasoning if you're into that kinda thing."

I also added about 1 tsp of Franks Red Hot sauce for a little zip. I heated my peanut oil to 375 and did the rest as the recipe stated. I was concerned the batter looked thin, but once I got it in the oil in turned a nice golden color and the cheese did not ooze out. I cooked mine on the side burner of our grill as I grilled Wisconsin brats that were boiled in Wisconsin beer...of course! I am proud to be a Cheesehead!"

This batter didn't have much flavor and some of the curds leaked out before the batter had a chance to crust around the cheese. Best tip is to freeze your curds before putting them in the batter. Then drop the battered curds into the oil - shaking the basket immediately so they don't stick to the bottom. I'll keep looking for a better batter"

The batch I didn't freeze, was very messy, stuck to the bottom of the basket and all the cheese oozed out. I also sprinkled Cajun seasoning over a few. Yum! Here are the steps I used:\nI brought the curds to room temp. Lightly rolled them in flour right before I battered them. Placed them on a wax paper-lined cookie sheet. Froze them for 40 min. Put them in the fryer basket and lowered the basket into hot oil. I just kept my eye on them and when they were golden brown, took them out. PERFECT! Dip in pizza sauce!"

Used sunflower oil and a pan on the stove so I had complete control over oil temperature, maybe that helped.

Everyone still liked them, but I felt it just needed a little extra something."

Second, when using wet batters it is best to lower them into the hot oil with a metal slotted spoon vice putting them in the basket then lowering in...helps prevent sticking.

I added garlic parsley salt to half of them after frying, and some season-all salt to the rest, this cured the bland flavor. I think I am going to season my batter just like I do with my other fried foods. A bit before and after adds so much flavor! Use your favorite seasoning and you can not go wrong with these cheesy delights! \n\nI could not figure out a faster way to fry them all separately, so so I plopped them into the fryer in groups.

I knew what I had to do -- replicate those little golden nuggets of goodness. And this recipe is AMAZING. I feel like I just left the Mouth Trap in the Food Barn. BUT it's very important to a) let the curds sit until room temperature and sweating and b) coat the cheese in flour before dipping in the batter. Don't be shy about coating them, it makes the batter stick when in oil. I also used twice the amount of salt because...hey, it's the fair.

I had the cheese curds sitting out for a day before I used them, as others suggested, and coated them lightly with flour. I made the batter just as it is written and it looked like a thin pancake batter. \n\nI placed 6-8 of the battered cheese curds into the wire strainer that gets dipped into the grease and the curds immediately stuck to the bottom of the strainer. Those were ruined. Then I just plunked the battered curds directly into the oil, and that wasn't much better. The cheese almost immediately starts to ooze out of the coating and into my deep-fryer oil. It made a gigantic mess of my deep-fryer. \n\nAfter it was all said and done, maybe half of the curds I made actually retained their cheese (I did not over-cook them), and the ones that did retain their cheese weren't good.\n\nIn fairness, I admit I used canola oil instead of corn oil because that was what was in my deep fryer. After attempting to make these, I will have to replace the oil because it got destroyed. A LOT of the batter came off the cheese curds while frying. \n\nMaybe I did something wrong, but I love cheese curds and I will not try out this recipe again unless someone can tall me what I did wrong."
