I didn't measure, but it was probably an additional 2 tbs or so. I also felt like the recipe calls for just a little too much oil. I'll probably cut that next time. Otherwise, it was really good and the flavors balanced out perfectly. Next time I'll probably try it with some sliced onion, as others have suggested."

I added about 1/2 cup chopped onion rather than the onion powder; instead of regular salt, I used 1/2 seasoned salt and 1/2 garlic salt; added white pepper to give it some zing; and used Truvia blend (1/2 sugar, 1/2 stevia) to reduce calories a bit. I reserved half of the slaw and added chopped apple and golden raisins to serve the next day with pork roast (different guests!) and it was very good, too. I will be making this again."

"reviewBody": "After a trip to Europe where I ate a lot of red cabbage, I searched for red cabbage recipes and found this one. I've made this recipe twice and followed the recipe as written both times for the most part--didn't have any onion powder but didn't miss it. Like one of the reviewers said, the longer it sits, the better it gets! Also, if you aren't going to eat all of it at once, I think it's a good idea to reserve the liquid after you drain it and let the cabbage that's leftover sit in it until you're ready to serve it again. Thanks so much for a recipe that was exactly what I was looking for!"

"reviewBody": "This was fabulous, even though I made some minor alterations. 1. I used only 1/4 cup oil, as others mentioned. 2. I didn't have any seasoned salt, and I don't like to add a lot of salt to my food, so I added about 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon basil and 1/4 teaspoon celery seed instead. 3. We like onions, so as others mentioned I added about 1/4 of an onion, sliced thin on the mandolin along with the cabbage. Next time I'll add a full half. Even so, the taste was awesome, starting immediately after making it (not even waiting 8 hours), then multiple times over the next week. Will DEFINITELY make again!"

I also chopped up a medium sized sweet onion instead of using the onion powder and I omitted the seasoned salt as I didn't have any. Any time I went into the fridge, I took the slaw out and stirred it around to coat all of the cabbage. This is such a refreshing change from your normal coleslaw. This is a keeper!"

This really is something that only improves as it sits in the refrigerator. It is a great thing to make on Sunday and eat with your lunchs all week long. This is something that really fills me up, and tastes indulgent. Sprinkled with the tiniest bit of gorgonzola cheese this becomes a decadent treat!!"
