I also was out of carrots, which is unheard of in this household! I used coconut sugar - 2 teaspoons since it is a bit less intense compared to regular sugar. I didn't want to open a new apple cider vinegar, so I used some orange muscat champagne vinegar in addition to what was called for. We are pleased with this recipe. ??"

Didn't seem to need the milk: it was beautifully creamy without being runny at all. I did add about 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper and one teaspoon of lemon juice. It really is delicious! Next time might toss in a minced jalapeno and an apple or something just for fun. Note: I bought the smallest red cabbage I could find and it still made about 4 litres of salad. Yum!"

I eyeballed the measurements. Used light mayo, rice vinegar (had it on hand) instead of cider, and pecans (hand them on hand) instead of walnuts, added a couple twists of black pepper. Left out the carrots because I was lazy and didn't want to shred up any. \n\nIt's super good without even setting overnight. The nuts add a little crunch. The cranberries add a bit of tangy sass. None of my substitutions will substantially change the original recipe. Thumbs up!!\n\nThis is going to make a great topping for tonight's burgers!!\n\nThanks for the recipe!"

It's not made like \"old fashioned\" slaw by salting and waiting an hour and squeezing out the water, hence the recipe needed salt (1 tbls). If that was done, it might help. Plus, it has no other seasonings such as celery or mustard seed which might help as well. I made it exactly how the recipe was written. It was just ok. I will eat it, but when I make it again, I'll change it up a little."

"reviewBody": "Oh my goodness! I had to force myself to quit eating this and I just made it (and haven't even added the walnuts yet)! I knew I was going to like this recipe, but I love it! I was being greedy, so, I used about 2/3 cup mayo, 3 tbsp. vinegar, 1 tbsp. sugar and 2/3-3/4 cup cranberries, plus lots of pepper. Yum! Yum! \nIf I can stay out of it, I'll add the nuts tomorrow, so they don't get soft in the frig overnight. I hope I didn't mess it up by adding too much dressing, esp. after it sits, lol, but it sure tastes good right now! Thank you so much for posting this recipe, AuntE"

(The first go-around wasn't quite tangy enough for us). I will also leave out the sugar. I love the addition of the cranberries and walnuts. This slaw was better after sitting in the fridge a couple of days.....got better and better with time."

I didn't realize until writing this review, that I forgot to add the cranberries (oops); but will next time. We enjoyed the walnuts in this. Thanks for a wonderful side dish with pork sandwiches. This is a keeper, AuntE !!"
