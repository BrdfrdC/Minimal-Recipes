It's so easy to make and you can cut down on the calories a little by using SF Jello. I like serving it in the plastic champagne flute for kids, whip cream on top sprinkle a few red hots on the whipped cream. Kids think its so \"fancy\". Good at potlucks and gatherings in a large dish."

I used 1 cup of red hots which I melted into 2 cups of boiling water that I then mixed into the gelatin, and added 1 1/2 cups of unsweetened applesauce mixing it throughly.\nThen I added 2 cups of cold water and put it into the fridge to set which made it taste more like a jello than a dessert, and it wasn’t as overly sweet but it just turned out perfect."

I would have to call that a mistake, make the jello according to package directions with your water. (Two cups of water) it dilutes the flavor just the tiniest it and makes the final product actually edible. I personally think it sets up better too!"

I would definitely consider this, as written, a dessert. \nNext time I'm going to try it using tart cherry juice instead of water, and then unflavored gelatin. The red-hots will be plenty of sugar, and will still give it that lovely red color too. \nMight also try it with lemon jello like bevist says here."

It takes about five minutes to whip up and your house smells fabulous while doing so. It's just the right amount of cinnamon. In reading the previous reviews, a few people have commented on the texture...ironically enough, the texture is one of the things I enjoyed most about this recipe. It actually feels as though it has some body, unlike plain Jello dishes. Five stars for me without a doubt!"
