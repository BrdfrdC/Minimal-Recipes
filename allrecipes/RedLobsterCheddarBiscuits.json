Smaller portions perhaps then normal, could’ve used a bit more milk, made mine plain that might explain it. 375 Convection bake. 10 minutes then buttered (margarine then 5 minutes more. Perfect. Crispy outside and tender inside. Now to try variations. Thanks for an easy and wonderful keeper to the book."

I'll be trying this recipe again since I have some shredded cheddar that needs using up."

Added a tsp of sugar, chopped up the butter before mixing with the milk and egg, and included some Italian seasoning and garlic powder in the melted butter. I also used a tablespoon scoop and got closer to 2 dozen biscuits. Next time I will definitely use an extra sharp cheddar though. The texture was great but I only had medium cheddar and it made the biscuits less cheesy than I expected them to taste."

"reviewBody": "I have issues with this recipe, but it's still worth 4/5 stars. The directions say it makes \"6 servings\", but the instructions say to drop the dough onto the cookie sheet by tablespoonfulls. It's easy to figure this out without being told - but the size of the biscuit affects the amount of time it takes to bake. I ended up with 7 biscuits that took 20 minutes. Tasted great! Along with the garlic powder in the melted butter, I added thinly-sliced green scallions to the batter. This is a keeper. Next time, I may try actual tablespoons of dough in one of those mini-muffin pans (24-count)"

Instead of putting the melted butter with parsley on halfway through baking I put it on once out of the oven but still piping hot, just like the Red Lobster box mix tells you. I also think that you could easily get 8 biscuits out of this recipe, I thought the biscuits were too big, I ended up splitting them in halves for the kids. Will make again!"

For butter I used unsalted butter.\n\nI would definitely make these again with the following changes:\n\nReduce salt by 1/2\nAdd a little more Sharp Cheddar \nBrush tops with melted butter \"and\" garlic\nWatch closely when baking beyond 5 minutes after brushing tops to avoid bottoms getting too hard"

I wound up with 16 biscuits using a big rounded tablespoon to plop then (a bit larger than a golf ball when raw). \n-----------------------------------------------\nDelicious recipe. Added a little less salt in the initial recipe only to add some salt into the (already salted) butter I used to dress the tops at the 10 minute mark. Definitely add the garlic powder/parsley to the butter to dress the tops as well. Timing was just right. Would love to give it another go where I put the butter into the flour first and then the cheese and wet ingredients - as well as adding other treasures like chives/bacon."

It came together well (with about 1/4 C. extra flour). I put 12 good-sized dough pieces on a silicone mat to bake. They needed about 15-16 minutes in the oven to brown (but they were pretty large). I brushed them with butter (with garlic and parsley) when I removed the biscuits from the oven. \n This is an easy recipe to stir together by hand (especially using oil) and it was very good.
