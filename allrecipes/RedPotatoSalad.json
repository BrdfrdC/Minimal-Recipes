Per other writers, it did need some liberal salting. A helpful tip I stole from making pasta is to cool the potatoes on lightly oiled baking sheets, where I also started the salt/pepper additions. One last tweak was to use 1/2 chopped dill pickles and 1/2 sweet pickle relish. Great recipe, thanks!"

Everyone raved about it. My sister just asked me to make it for our Labor Day cookout. \n\nI didn't have any green onion, so had replaced it with diced vidalia onion, which I soaked in water for a bit prior to using. I was also using organic celery from my farm co-op and the stalks were tiny with lots of greens. I included the greens and used best judgement on how much of the celery to use. \n\nHoping I can repeat what I did last time when I make it today!! Great recipe, though! Even if you've never made it before."

"reviewBody": "such simple and yummy recipe! my family loved it! and my husband normally dislikes potato salad. we were out of onions so I used extra celery and it worked out great! we used fat free sour cream and low fat mayo and I added some bacon. we didn't have any hot sauce so I added a lil cayenne pepper and this turned out delicious!! JUST A TIP (I had read another review with this tip and since this was only my second time making potato salad I wasn't aware of this tip and it was helpful!): make the sauce in advance and let sit in the fridge and the flavors become stronger and disperse. when I first made it I thought it was a lil bland and was going to add more, but listened to the tip and let it sit in the fridge while the potatoes cooled too. when I finally mixed it all together it was PERFECT! had I added more it would've been too flavorful. im a picky potato salad eater, and find most home made ones disgusting...but this one was fantastic! thanks for the recipe!! :) we plan on making it bi-weekly!"

To make it even lighter, I used low-fat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and I used Lawry's Fire Roasted Chile and Garlic powder. Be sure to use Clausen refrigerated dill pickles. The chile/garlic powder gives the salad a slight but alluring smokey flavour, and the dill pickles, celery, and yogurt keep it fresh and light."

Everyone recalls that Mom's tater salad is the best, and mine is no exception. But I like this one. Things I did different? Added more egg, celery, changed the ratio of sour cream and mayo. Used a Thai chili sauce and added crushed garlic and onion. Except for the potatoes, I minced everything tiny, just like my Mom did. I hate chunks in my salad. Anyways, enjoy!"

This year I joined a CSA (community supported agriculture) program and received many new or untried veggies through this program. The last few weeks we have gotten red potatoes as part of our bounty. I cooked them with green beans in the crock pot (love my crock pot) from a recipe found here. Yesterday, I wanted potato salad and had more red potatoes so I did a search and came up with several but this one used low-fat ingredients so it caught my eye. I omitted onion salt and celery because I didn't have on hand. The dill pickles add a surprise taste. My husband and I both loved it. I will be making again!"
