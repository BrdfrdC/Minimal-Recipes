I did roll it in pecans as suggested and it's a great little appetizer. The salmon I used was from my own canned salmon which is good with nothing added. If I was making this for myself, I would have added capers as well, however it's for a party, and some may not like capers as much as I do. I will make this again when time is limited, because it took 15 min to make"

"reviewBody": "I love this pate. This is the 3rd time I've made it. I did the adjustments as well. I used the packet of salmon instead of canned (so convenient), added dill and fresh chives (replaced onion) and sweet Spanish paprika. I also zested a little of the lemon into the mix. I made an error and added more liquid smoke than I meant to... but it didn't hurt the recipe one bit. Served with crackers and capers on the side and also some good cayenne pepper for anyone who wanted a little heat. The only thing was the \"roll into a ball with pecans and parsley\" was no easy chore. You may want to just use a bowl or shape it with gloved hands. FYI - The pecans give it just a little bit of texture which takes it from yummy to extraordinary! I made 2 balls out of it for 2 different parties. Great!"

I looked at the insane amount of pate in the dish and was expecting to throw at least 1/2 of it away since I expect our three kids (4, 7, 8) to turn their collective noses up. NOT SO. The kids devoured it! I made the recipe as shown but added 1 tsp of liquid smoke (remember, doubled the recipe). I'll add more next time. I also used a food processor."
