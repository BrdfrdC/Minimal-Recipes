I started with this then I used 1 cup of sour cream ,1cup mayo and 2- 3 table spoons of ranch dressing with garlic powder, salt and pepper and dill. also I used green onions and a yellow pepper for sweetness and color. then I added fresh parsley. simply then best potato salad!! I only put 4 stars because I made the recipe my own. a recipe that needs nothing is 5 stars"

I agree with one poster, cut up your potatoes prior to cooking and save yourself a little work. If you want to kick it up a notch though, add a couple tablespoons of sour cream to the mayo and maybe a half teaspoon of mustard or less, according to taste but not enough to where your guests can tell its mustard. It adds just a little zest and gives it that nice pale yellow yummy color."

This was a very simple and easy dish to make, especially if you are just starting to get into cooking different types of food like myself. Although, I did make a few adjustments like adding a pinch of garlic salt. I don't think I added the amount of mayo this recipe was asking for, mainly because I don't like potato salad that is mushy, but I think that just depends on the individual. Again, overall, this was a great recipe and I will definitely make again."

Two cups would have been WAY too much. I also added 2 Tbs organic unfiltered apple cider vinegar to give it a little tartness. It was just a little too bland. Now it's perfect. Oh, no salt added. The mayonnaise has just the right amount of salt already in it."

I added 4 cups chopped eggs, I added McCormick salad toppings to the salad as I had no bacon but there is bacon bits in the salad topping which gives it crunch. I added dill weed onion powder, mrs dash,dill mustard 1 cap of white vinegar, mixed up well and chilled. perfect. I may just do the recipe as is next time but I am pleased with the results today."

I also added maybe a cup of mixed cheddar cheese. I decided not to add the eggs as my family prefers it without them. I feel like the red potatoes hold their shape better in this recipe. 5 stars with my changes its our new potato salad recipe!"
