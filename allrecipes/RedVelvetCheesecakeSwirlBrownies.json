I'll try that next time. Enjoy!"

It looked like it should have more liquid in it and did seem dry when we ate it. Also the cheesecake top was too thin...I actually poured it onto the brownie base. Very liquid with the consistency of half &amp; half! I even tripled the cheesecake part and it was still not as thick as the base. I would make this again with a few modifications. You have to be very careful to NOT overbake this!! Maybe it's one of those recipes that can't be doubled successfully."

"reviewBody": "The recipe is very easy to follow. The taste itself is really good, just enough balance on the sweetness and sourness and chocolatey flavor. I just had a slight modification and used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour and I think it’s the same. The other bakers are right on their comments that cooking time really varies. The first time I did this it took me 35 minutes while the next time it took about 45 minutes so just make to check starting at 35 minutes. The recipe also has a tendency to brown at the edges/top with too much baking time. Overall this is a good recipe and I’ll make it again."

They were very pretty; in the future I might try and use natural red food colouring, as this calls for quite a lot of artificial dye to get that nice red colour. They took about 15 minutes longer to cook than the recipe called for, and I agree with the author that they do taste best the day after!"

However, the batter for the brownie part was extremely thick and I found that I had to cut down the flour by 1/4 cup. Also, next time i wouldn't save so much of the brownie batter to swirl on top- it was too thick to \"swirl\" much and ended up just kind of baking into a red blob on the top. Lol, not necessarily pretty, but in no way lacking in taste! I also didn't need to double the red dye, there seemed to be plenty with the single batch amount. They came out very moist, soft, sweet, and AWESOME."

"reviewBody": "Delicious! My family really liked it, but I could not serve it to company as planned. It was so gooey that it would not come out of the pan cleanly (even though more than one toothpick came out clean.) The edges of the brownie layer were done, but the middle was quite underdone. I did not want to bake it longer, as the cheesecake layer looked just right. I had no issues with consistency of the batter as other reviewers mentioned. I will try this again, but next time I will try baking the brownie layer for 15 minutes before topping with the cheesecake layer."

"reviewBody": "I attempted this recipe twice. Second time I changed the servings for a recipe geared towards 25 people, but really made about 16 brownies. They baked beautifully! I received many compliments on the appearance. But ultimately noone was raving about the taste and I agreed. Next time I think I would use the old fashioned Dunkin Hines mix and add the cream cheese with same baking time for the same effect. I feel I would produce similar beautifully appearing brownies but with significantly improved flavor. I made this dish from scratch twice for family and co workers and the brownies ultimately leave more flavor and moistness to be desired, but beautiful appearance!"

"reviewBody": "So first off, this recipe is pretty okay on it's own. A few tweaks, and I was deeply pleased. I did note, like other reviewers that the brownie batter is a much thicker consistency than the cheesecake batter, but if you work in haphazard glops rather than trying to make it \"perfect\" it really works out fine once you swirl it together with a knife. I do recommend doubling the cheesecake layer. Like others, I had to extend the bake time (bout 7 min more), so my cheesecake got really brown while the brownie was still cooking. I felt if the cheesecake were thicker it would be more even, like the picture as well. It worked. I also added semisweet choc chips between the layers for extra chocolateyness. Might experiment with melted chocolate instead of cocoa in the batter for richer flavor, next time."

But all in all, I would made them again. VERY easy and I had everything on hand."

"reviewBody": "I made the recipe with no changes. Other reviews were correct in saying the cream cheese will pour nicely over the cake batter and the reserved batter will go on in dollops. I think it is important to note that this dessert needs to be enjoyed the day after making. The first day the \"brownie\" part has the texture of dry cake. But after one night in the refrigerator the texture changes to that of a moist chewy brownie probably because it has time to absorb moisture from the cream cheese topping. It was delicious the second day!"

I improvised. when I got to the stage of adding the saved batter in dollops on top and pulling a knife through, I then squeezed on in small dollops about a quarter cup of seedless strawberry jam that came in a squeeze tube, and carefully running a knife through that also. The result was just colourful enough, and delicious! Will definitely make these again."

Came out incredibly well. The brownie mixture got thick after I mixed in the flour, so I shall set aside a bit before adding the flour for the topping. Will let you guys know how that goes. Cheers for the recipe."

Also I used apple cider instead of the distilled white vinegar. And didn't have food colouring so I used 3 big table spoons of raspberry jam in the batter and hot chocolate powder instead of the unsweetned cocoa powder. It turned out very good and the right amount of sweetness. Will differently make this again. And at 350 it took 35min to cook. Depends on ur oven."
