I wanted to make a delicious patriotic desert but also didn't want to be tied up in the kitchen long. This was perfect and I think I'll make it every year! I made the cake the night before (while its cool enough to fire up the oven), frosted it the next morning and put the berries on about a half hour before guests started to arrive. I also made the frosting with the vanilla pudding mix as others suggested. I put rows in strawberries and blueberries instead of making a flag. It still looked very patriotic and every bite had a strawberry and blueberry. I got tons of compliments. I mean...this isn't my Grandpas famous apple pie or my Grandmas famous sugar cookies...but it IS a quick, attractive tasty cake for a 4th of July BBQ!"

One of my kids wanted to make something for a gathering and I suggested this because it's quick, fun and easy. And boy did she have fun making it. Now she was requested to make again but with a chocolate cake for someone's birthday. Made the cake even cooler was adding red and blue sprinkles into the cake mix made it sparkle holiday fun. Thanks again, we will totally make again. But sans the homemade whip topping. ;-)"

Whipping cream with powdered sugar and chopped strawberries goes between layers, frost with whipped cream, then use 50 blueberries in upper corner, sliced bananas dipped in lemon juice for one row; alternate rows using strawberry halves to make the stars and stripes. It is huge and feeds a group on July 4th and tastes like a gourmet strawberry shortcake ala Independence Day. Change to two boxes yellow cake mix, 2 pints heavy whipping cream, use wax paper on jelly roll pan, grease paper."

Outlined it with blueberries and filled with sliced strawberries. It was fantastic! Really did taste like shortcake - maybe because when the cake is refrigerated it takes on more of a shortcake texture. Anyway, it was delish! And my whole family enjoyed. Even the little ones from ages 4-9. Thanks for a great, simple and easy recipe! Mema328"

Next time I will stick with the recipe...I have made this before as written and the Cool Whip alone is just OK on top, which is why I opted for the moderations this time. Either way it's just a 3 star recipe."

It was just the extra touch needed to make it special for the holiday!\n\nOh, and we're a family of raspberry lovers so I used raspberries instead of sliced strawberries. The key is to wash them well ahead of time and keep turning them in the collander to make sure the water drains out so they're ready to put on your cake."

First off, in the past when I have made this, it always seems to overflow the dish, so I baked the cake and transfered into a larger dish to decorate. I covered the cake with a can of strawberry and a can of blueberry pie filling. Then covered that with the cool whip blend doubled (16oz cool whip, 2tsp vanilla, 2 cups milk, 2 small boxs instant vanilla pudding). I decorated that with fresh blueberries and strawberries. It was a huge hit and well enjoed by all!"

Because I am a newbee to baking I messed up the first layer because of impatience and excitment. My hubby said:\"Baby, let it cool in the oven and calm down.\" :-) Second layer fell right out. The only thing I did different was I thought an orange cake would compliment the blueberries and strawberries and it did! I did use the cool whip and pudding recipe that I found on this site. Next time I'm going to use the white chocolate pudding. Nothing like chocolate and fruit! I love this website."

It holds up very well to room temperature. It also isn't too sweet like traditional icing. 13x9 pans, now sometimes come with covers. It makes it nice and easy to store before of after a party too."

I took other's advice and made a layer cake, using the cool whipped frosting (doubled the recipe) and put strawberries and blueberries in the middle layer. I used French Vanilla pudding with the frosting - DUH, forgot that pudding was yellow, so we had a yellow, red, and blue cake. :D Yummy and fun, nothing fancy. Will definitely make again!"

Although the angelfood made the cake really airy &amp; refreshing, I didn't exactly have the proper sized pans because it won't cook in 1 \"standard\" 9x13 cake pan. I improvized by using 2 loaf pans, so my rectangle flag was a little square shaped. So, just be aware that if you want to go with angelfood, just check your pan sizes ahead of time. Happy 4th of July!!!"
