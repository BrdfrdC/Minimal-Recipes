I like to cube the feta in little pieces which makes it a little prettier because there's not so many tiny crumbles. Also, don't forget to drain off the juice that gathers at the bottom of the bowl so the watermelon won't get soggy. Don't throw out the juice though; drink it! It's delicious! Best served within a few hours of preparing. ;)"

I didn't have enough cucumber so ended up using about 1 and 1/2 cup of small cubed cucumbers. All other ingredients were proportioned as specified in the original recipe. It was delicious and was a big hit! I will definitely make this again."

Next time try cantaloupe or honeydew if they are less expensive? Next time add lime zest with the lime juice. The quality of feta could really take this over the top. I used a very nice feta from a specialty market. Served with baked buffalo chicken thighs and roasted veggies."

I think I will play with the ingredients to meet my needs."

Let sit in the fridge to let flavors blend for 30 min. Wait to add salt just before serving since water from the melon will release.\nAdd cilantro or mint... Or neither :) yum. Def the best watermelon salad recipe I've tried.... And I've tried a bunch."

I was expecting to like it anyway as I do love sweet/savoury combinations and was anticipating the saltiness of the feta to counteract with the juiciness of the watermelon, which it does! I found that I had no fresh coriander to hand so I used flat leaf parsley instead. It was still wonderful. Perfect for a hot summer day! On a side note, my partner did not enjoy it so much, although he admitted it tasted very good. He just could not get his head around the fact that watermelon was the main ingredient and not something like tomatoes - tough luck for him, as I'll be making this again!"

They said it is an attractive salad and the comment was made that those flavors together will take some getting used to. I agreed there. I think I will try it again and play with the flavors a little and see if we can't make it a little less savory. I think that could be accompolished by leaving out the salt, pepper and some of the cilantro and adding some herbs from my herb garder of lemon and cinnamon basil. Over all I think it is good but I love watermelon any way at all. I'm still thinking about the cheese. I'm giving it four stars."

I love watermelon, and the feta cheese kind of \"ruined\" it. I cut back on the cilantro by half, because although I'm starting to appreciate cilantro more I still need to have it in small doses or it's too overwhelming for me. It still didn't seem to fit in this dish, so I think I should have stuck to my instincts and used fresh mint instead."

I really liked the sweet and salty taste of the salad but even though I like Cilantro, I did not think it went well in the salad. I only used it for a small portion of the salad for the sake of rating and for the photo, but then I used basil in the rest of the salad and we really liked it. It brought out the sweetness and freshness of the watermelon. I will make this again but with basil and will assemble the salad right before serving. With the changes, it's a 5 star salad."
