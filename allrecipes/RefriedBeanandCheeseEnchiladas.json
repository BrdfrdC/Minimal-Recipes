Added side dish Jasmine rice 2 cups 1 tablespoon garlic salt 1 teaspoon dried parsley 1 teaspoon olive oil in a rice cooker nice fluffy non sticking rice. This is a quick east and tasty recipe that you can play with."

Also liked the fact that it came together very quickly. Will definitely make again."

It was fantastic to have a meal that made the vegetarians and meat-eaters in my family happy. I'm not sure if I'd say it's five stars in terms of taste, but it was very good and so easy that I know we will make it again and again - and that's a special kind of five stars. Thank you!"

I double the amount of cheese - 2 cups go into the filling, and 2 cups go on top. For me this makes two 9\"x12\" pans, or 12 enchiladas total."

Also, I used two cans of medium red enchilada sauce since my batch made up into enough mix for a pan and a half of enchiladas. Added some sour cream on top after they cooled a bit, and ate with saltine crackers. Very very good! A new favorite here, and so easy to make that this will be a regular. (If you want to bring an empty dish home from a pot luck, take it full of these.) :)"
