Did not use chicken broth but did add in a bit of the beans juice. Also used Tapatio sauce instead of chili’s. We’re in the midst of CoVid19 and was only going to use what’s on hand. Made a great dip for my lunch."

I found that I needed to slowly add more liquid (broth) when trying to blend the beans and to get them to the consistency we wanted. I left the beans simmering on low while other dishes were finishing and simply added a little more liquid when they seemed to be drying out a little. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"

Since I like mine seasoned more, I used 3 cups of dried black beans (instead of 4 cups) and used the remaining ingredients as stated above for 4 cups. I used a hand blender to emulsify the beans instead of a food processor so I can control the consistency better. In addition, I added about half a cup of the reserve water to slightly thin out the emulsified beans."
