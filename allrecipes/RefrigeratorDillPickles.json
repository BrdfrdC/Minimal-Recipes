Pickles came out halfway decent. 2nd batch I kind of did it myself and they did not come out that well now I am on my 3rd batch and I'm using this recipe again . Very easy to use highly recommend for the 1st timer grab some cucumbers slice then up throw them in some pickle jars throw in the ingredients 3 days later you have pickles enjiy"

For people who want a smaller batch, you can half the recipe and it is still great. For a half batch, I used 1.5 tbsp of dried dill and it worked great. I also like to add the dried dill when I am heating the vinegar mixture. Also, if you don’t have a mason jar, plastic takeout soup containers also work perfectly."

Definitely delicious, you can mix up the recipe contents of the jar anyway you want just use the base liquid recipe"

(I soak mine in an ice water bath.) I also put in some extra baby carrots and onions. I think they taste best after about 5 days in the fridge. Before that time the small cucumbers were still bitter and not pickled enough. I'll definitely make this recipe again!"

They were extremely delicious, even after only 1 day in the refrigerator. 3 days in and they are great. They remind me of Claussens which are the only brand I typically buy. I've eaten so many after 3 days that I chopped up a few more cucumbers from the garden and added them to the brine. I'll be curious to see how the added pickles do."

That said, I ran out of sugar and only had a sprinkling when I made them, so I will continue to do that with further jars as I do not like sweet pickles at all, and this was just right with only the sprinkle. \n\nI also didn't have fresh garlic and used garlic powder instead. Tasted great. In one jar, I threw in some black pepper and a few red pepper flakes and they were even better as I like things a little spicy, but the milder pickles were good, too."

My mom and I added the recommended amount of everything but possibly more dill than listed though. They came out wonderful! I've eaten half the jar already! The only downside I have encountered is that some of the spears have a bitter taste to them, especially on the ends? I can't think of why though. I don't think a little added dill would do that but maybe. I didn't use \"pickling cucumbers\" per se, just small ones a local farm grows. Definitely going to make them again!"

I did have sea salt but you could use Kosher. \n\nSecond batch I added a couple of sliced jalapeno's and some pepper flakes for a spicy dill. They were the bomb.\n\nThis is a great recipe as written. It's easy to make, the 3 day brine is perfect and they are crunchy and delicious. Recommend it definitely."
