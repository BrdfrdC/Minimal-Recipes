I'd follow this recipe again but probably use more like 1/4-1/3 cup corn starch. I think as long as it is dissolved in some liquid beforehand it will dissolve fine and the taste will be gone. I would have cooked it longer to let it thicken up and let the liquid evaporate out a bit, but the crust was getting such a burned look on it I decided soup for dessert it is!"

Add back to the rhubarb strawberries before placing into the pie shells. Makes a less juicy pie. We love this recipe. My wife and I just made 11 pies for friends and family."

"reviewBody": "Love how the flavor turned out! I decided to use up all the strawberry and rhubarb I had, so it ended up being about 4 cups each of fruit. It fits because it cooks down, but I knew the juice would overflow (which it did) so I placed the pie on a baking sheet to contain juice. I adjusted the other ingredients accordingly. Lastly, for those wondering like me, do you really need the foil on the outside crust? If you want an even color, then yes. Although I don't mind, because my crust, while dark, still tasted good."

This is a very juicy pie - after the filling sits for 30 minutes - stir to combine well and then make sure the pie sits extra time after baking to solidify a bit. I have made so many of these pies this season and also freezes well to savor it past strawberry season!"

I tripled the cornstarch/water mixture and I still had trouble with some soupiness (which I drained real quick before putting in pies.). This had very good flavor and the black cherries didn’t interfere with this great tasting pie. Oops, almost forgot— I added 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg. BTW, make sure you put a piece of parchment paper between your pie and the cookie sheet you place it on in the oven. It’ll save you some clean-up, my dears."

She passed away a few years ago from Alzheimer’s and due to the disease I was never able to get her recipe from her. This recipe nails it on how I remember hers tasting! I follow the recipe exact and never have any issues with it being “soupy”. I do let it cool completely and then refrigerate it till ready to eat. If you’re not in the mood for pie, make the filling as specified in the recipe and heat it up on the stove to desired thickness. After it cools, spoon over vanilla ice cream!"

"reviewBody": "Turned out a lot better than I expected! Everyone enjoyed it! Made a double recipe (risky for a first trial!) with locally grown strawberries (slightly thawed from frozen and sliced) and rhubarb from my garden. I did add the cinnamon and vanilla, but also added 1.5 Tbsp flour per recipe to the fruit mixture. I used commercial pie shells that I half baked and lined with toasted bread crumbs before filling with the fruit mixture. I opted to just top the pie with a crisp topping. Otherwise, I followed the recipe’s directions. The pie tasted fruity and light, not too sweet or runny. I think the cinnamon and vanilla gave depth to the flavour of this pie. I would definitely make this again, and it’s a tasty way to use up my rhubarb!"

Use some extra creamy whipped cream or make your own and add vanilla and cinnamon and you have a combo where you could finish half a pie by yourself. I 100% recommend this pie and share this recipe with everyone."

I questioned the small amount of corn starch, but went ahead with the amounts listed in the recipe. A rule of thumb (according to chef John) 1 table spoon of corn starch per cup of fruit. In this case 5 table spoons of corn starch would have been better"

I decided to try a few of the other reviewers' suggestions. I increased the corn starch to 1/4 cup, sprinkled tapioca on the bottom crust plus substituted a little less than 1/4 cup of strawberry jello for 1/4 cup of the sugar. It may have been overkill, but I can't stand runny, soggy rhubarb pie! Next time, I will probably eliminate the egg white wash because the crust turned brown too quickly."

Some others pre-cook rhubarb - all the way back to my great grandmother we have never done that so I don't either. The cornstarch thickens it enough so it's not too juicy and as long as you cut your rhubarb about 1/2 inch thick you should be fine. This will be my go to recipe from now on."

I think I should have left it for one more hour, cuz it was still warm and with the first slice some juice came out of it. \nOverall it wasn't soggy or anything. I am very happy with the results."

We added some lemon zest and juice to our taste, but I would recommend this receipt to anyone. Using the lattice top crust maximized evaporation of excess juices and placing the pie low in the oven ensured a flakey bottom crust. Five good sized stalks of rhubarb makes a full 9\" pie."
