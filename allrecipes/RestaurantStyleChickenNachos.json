"reviewBody": "Great base recipe, even better if you jazz it up with adding black beans, frozen corn and a little seasoning (like taco seasoning) to the chicken mixture. Speaking of chicken, I used plain rotisserie chicken, quick and easy! After you remove from oven and plate it, add toppings like fresh sliced jalapeno's, cilantro, guacamole (store bought is fine), and sour cream. A squeeze of fresh lime juice after it's plated really made it special too! With the tweaks, it was absolutely amazing, will make again and again!"

Nachos, I don't care if they are chicken or beef, are a blank slate, and begin with a great basic recipe such as this one, which establishes great flavors. Then it's up to you and your family to customize with what you enjoy. Each of my family members customizes this basic recipe I make first as they like it and pop their version into the air fryer and, viola! I won't bore you with our customizations. This recipe is a 5 star \"go to\" for us!"

Some of the most helpful comments improve this dish: Cook chips in oven for 5 minutes before assembling nachos (prevents sogginess with chicken mixture), add taco seasoning to the chicken mixture, top nachos with corn/black olives/green part of green onions. These changes improve the dish without extra hassle."

"reviewBody": "Super yummy recipe! I made this recipe with mostly what I had on hand. I agree with the recommendation to use rotisserie chicken. I mixed the chicken with Kirkland's salsa (from Costco)- just enough salsa to cover the chicken. Agree with the review to heat the chips first 5 minutes. I warmed up frozen broccoli, corn, red peppers on a separate tray &amp; dumped them on top of the warmed chips. Then I put drained black beans (3/4 a can) and Trader Joe's 3 type mixed shredded cheese. Put sea salt &amp; red pepper flakes on top. Heated in oven @375 until cheese was melted. I put a few black pieces on top, but I won't do that, again... too overpowering. When done, scoop sour cream on top. Yum!"

Next time I will follow others' advice and add taco seasoning to the chicken mixture. I'd also add more cheese than what they called for and black beans too. Some people suggested that you should heat up the chips for 5 minutes before spooning on chicken mixture to keep em crunchy/crisp. Next time I will put them under the broiler for the last 2-3 minutes. Great with beer!"

I wish I had read the reviews first, you really do need to cover the pan with foil and bake the nachos a bit first. Otherwise the chips will be soggy! Also if you add 10 ingredients and make cheese sauce, you have changed the recipe! Thanks for an easy delicious recipe idea."

"reviewBody": "Phenomenal! I made this exactly as directed (flatten chicken w/ mallet to 1/2\", boil 10 min, let cool/rest 5 min, shred w/ two forks), and added jalapeños and sliced black olives. I think the ones that say they needed to add taco seasoning must not have let the chicken and salsa reduce enough. I simmered the shredded chicken and salsa mixture about 20 minutes until the juice had JUST simmered out, leaving a dry-ish mixture so as not to let the cops get soggy. Using slightly preheated cast iron fajita pans I added the chips, baked 5 min, added about 1/3 of the cheese to melt another 5 minutes (this keeps all the wetter ingredients separated from the chips), then added the chicken, remainder of the cheese, and the rest of my toppings. Let cook another 5-8min, then remove, add chopped green onions, let rest a few minutes, throw a dollop of Greek yogurt (SC replacement) on the edge of the pile, and viola! Better than ANY restaurant nachos, by FAR! All in all, I did NOT modify this recipe, just added Jalapeños and black olives along with a refined cooking technique based on others reviews. AMAZING, thank you for this recipe!"

Drained and rinsed a can of black beans, drained a can of corn, added olives, salsa, sour cream, etc. Instead of baking and dealing with the mess, I make these on individual plates like this: Layer of chips, sprinkle shredded cheese on them, spoon on corn and beans, add chicken if it cooled off, and microwave about 20-30 seconds. When done, add your cold ingredients, sprinkle on more cheese, and enjoy!"

"reviewBody": "Before I discuss this recipe, let me mention the few small changes I made, just in case. One-I used garlic powder instead of garlic cloves. Two-I left out the onions and tomato, because my family and I don't like them. Three-I left out the oil and the salt for health purposes. Now let me mention the two small changes I would recommend to others: 1, definitely use more than a cup of salsa and 2, use even MORE cheese. These are supposed to be nachos, after all (I used a 16 oz jar of salsa and a bag and a half of 8 oz cheese, and it still needed more of both). Also, I used two chicken breasts, but would probably recommend three (all this was cooked in a casserole dish for my husband and I). Now, having said all that, this recipe was absolutely, 100%, amazingly INCREDIBLE! We turned it into a meal. Put it on a real plate, used a fork, broke the chips, and ate it like a taco salad. Didn't have anything else with it, and it was still super filling. SO tasty--really hit our Mexican food-craving spot. Most DEFINITELY will become a staple in our house. In fact, I will probably make it again next week! Can't say enough about it. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! Would give it 6 stars, if I could!"

I too toasted the tortilla shells for 5 minutes in the oven, helped to keep them crisp.\nAnd I added rinsed black beans and some frozen corn to add more texture as another reviewer suggested.\nAnd one other thing I did was add a packet of taco seasoning to the chicken as it heated. Thank you for this\nGreat recipe! Will be making it again!"

"reviewBody": "I used coconut oil instead of canola since coconut is healthier for us. I also did not go by the recipe because it would not have been as flavorful. Added 1/2 pkg. of taco seasoning in with chicken as I cooked it in pan with green onions. I used rotisserie chicken and I added can of refried black beans in with chicken. Also added sweet frozen kernel corn. I used whole bag 13 oz. of tortilla chips and put in Lg. glass Pyrex baking dish and sprayed with nonstick spray. I also added a little mozzarella cheese on top of Colby/ mont/jack cheese. Used a fresh salsa I found at Wal-Mart deli and 1/4 jar of mild salsa in jar. Used sour cream as dip on side. The corn really made this so much better and we thought it was really good and ate it as our dinner. The tortilla chips were not soggy either."

"reviewBody": "I used this recipe as more of a guide. I cooked some chopped rotisserie chicken with the white parts of green onions, garlic and a little bit of salsa in olive oil. I topped the chips with that mixture, some black beans, some diced pickled jalapenos and cheddar cheese and baked it on a baking sheet until the cheese was melted. Then I topped with plain Greek yogurt (in lieu of sour cream), the green onion greens and more salsa and these were THE BEST nachos I have ever made at home!! They were definitely restaurant quality, which I credit to cooking the \"filling\" mixture before baking it, which I never would have thought to do otherwise. Thank you!!"

"reviewBody": "I didn't use the green onion, because heaven forbid my son, Mr. Pickypants, find something green on his plate! Knowing the chicken would be bland without it, I sprinkled with chicken with taco seasoning instead. Mr. Pickypants ate his unadorned, just chicken, cheese, and chips; after baking, I loaded mine with tomato, avocado, and shredded lettuce. We both really enjoyed them, and I will definitely make them again - thanks for sharing this recipe! 9.2.2013: I chopped the chicken finely instead of shredding it, which was a lot easier for me. I didn't have Cheddar/Jack, so I shredded a little mozzarella and some American cheese and tossed them together with a fork. That may sound awful, but this was THE BEST batch of these nachos I've made so far!"

I used frontera green salsa which blended well with the other ingredients esp the garlic. My only addition was healthy avocados diced on the side before serving. I have been craving this practically every night for dinner since the first time I made it. A keeper!"

I made it as described, with the exception of using 2 tbsp. of homemade taco seasoning (\"Taco Seasoning I\" on this site); and I used a rotisserie chicken (shredded up) versus the canned version.\n\nEase of prep: it couldn't get any easier! I think shredding the chicken took the longest but it was worth it! The shredded chicken felt smoother in your mouth versus chunks of chicken, but I believe it's personal preference. \n\nEase of putting the meal together: again, it could not be easier! I do feel that you need more Mexican seasonings to make it taste more authentic, though. \n\nOverall: DELICIOUS!! Or as my teenage son would say, \"Nom nom nom!\", This will be a staple in my household!\n\nSide note: I doubled the recipe and used an entire bag of Tostito's...layered it on a 9x13 cookie sheet (lined with foil). When it was done, the first thing I thought was this would be PERFECR for a football party!!"

I liked the use of the onions two ways, they served very separate purposes. I did throw a little homemade taco seasoning (bill echols' from this site) on the chicken while cooking because I like extra spice and I put that on just about everything. Next time I will add olives, black beans and jalapenos to customize it a bit for us. Thank you!"

I however didn't use a cup of salsa, I instead spooned it on, until it covered the chicken but didn't overwhelm it. I also added a little bit of cayenne pepper and some paprika. I then layered the chips, making sure they didn't overlap then I sprinkled cheese on it, and then I put the chicken mixture on and put monterey cheese on top. Then I added more chips and repeated the process. Put it in the oven, let it bake. Then the last 5 minutes I put the tomatoes on and let it bake another 5 minutes. Then a couple minutes after I broiled it to get the cheese and chips to brown a little. Then I took it out, sprinkled it with green onions and squeezed sour cream on to it. Served it with salsa on the side. It turned out great! Cheaper than going out and probably healthier."
