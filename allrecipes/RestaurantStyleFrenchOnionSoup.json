This was so impressive that I am having my neighbors over for a meal of this soup. Yep, I am official on the French onion soup campaign. Thank you SSSOOOO MUCH!!! I LOVE, LOVE THIS!"

My grandmother always said: A little sugar in the pot, Gives it what it hasn’t got. Just delicious, even without the additions."

I added the full amount of wine in the recipe, however the flavor was a bit too rich and I think I will cut it in half next time. I used Mushroom Broth from this website for the broth to make this vegetarian. Overall, great recipe, I will surely make this again!"

I solved the problem mentioned in reviews that the onions took much longer to cook, by dividing the onion step into 2 pots so it took 30 minutes! That’s the only tip I can make, I followed the rest of the recipe as written. Definitely will make again."

"reviewBody": "Nov 2020 Excellent method for French Onion Soup. Used a store-brand beef broth that ended up not being very flavorful. Added a few dashes of soy sauce and Worcestershire. Added a bay leaf, garlic powder (in addition to the fresh garlic). Once added extras was very good. Used shiraz for the wine (a little less than 1 cup, was tentative about too strong of a wine flavor). Used vermouth instead of sherry (just what I had). Used gruyere to be traditional instead of swiss/provolone but that is so expensive, next time I'll try the the swiss/provolone as is recommended in the recipe. In the end I was very happy with the result."

I think that would build up even more flavor."

I wasn't sure what size or type of onion to get so I bought sweet onions, 6 in all as the sizes were med to large. At first I thought it was too much but after things sweat down it was a good ratio.\n\nI wasn't in any hurry so I let the soup simmer and meld for probably 4 hours. I wanted to add more flour early on, but I didn't as I knew it would be on the stove for awhile. I am glad I didn't, each time I skimmed the top a bit more thickness and scrapings off the pot mixed right in.\n\nI was maybe a little heavy on the sherry, pepper and salt, but that is just me. I made it ahead of tomorrow for Bowl Games, so like I said, no rush, if I were not letting things simmer that long, I might have added more flour and / or boiled a little harder.\n\nI did use 1 quart each of beef stock and beef broth. We tend to lean to stock when cooking.\n\nI added twice the amount of cheese, just because I feel like there is never enough cheese ever... Broiled in a good old fashioned crock. \n\nI am not a huge cook and do not stray too far from a recipe for the first time...but with the additional simmering, melding, and stirring time involved, this was really as good as I have had anywhere. Looking forward to tomorrows meal."
