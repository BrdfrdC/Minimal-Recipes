( learn from my mistake, if you do this, omit the salt) I added about 1/4 c of sour cream and instead of adding the melted butter , poured it on top. 350 for one hour then a few minutes under the broiler. My family loved it."

The next time I put it on 450 and stirred half way thru. But now I’ve read my chappell’s comments and it makes sense I’ll try that today. But please don’t be down from these suggestions your basic recipe is great!"

Then uncovered and added a layer of cheddar cheese. Continued to cook for about 10 minutes. Then switched to broil for the final 5 minutes. I did not have any issues with it being greasy and I did use the full amount of butter.? Absolutely delicious!"

"reviewBody": "A few tweaks to make this good recipe great :\n-Grease your baking dish with Crisco, not spray. ??\n-Sautee the white onion for a couple minutes before adding it in. \n-Use Colby Jack cheese instead of Cheddar. It's creamier and a little smoky, which gives it more of a robust flavor. \n-Crumbled hickory smoked bacon added into this is PURE HEAVEN! \n-Keep the potatoes frozen until just ready to use; do not thaw them out first. This increases your cook time about 15 minutes, but it'll be worth it! \n-Cream your butter, then mix all of the other ingredients together in a separate bowl, then add them into the potatoes last.\n-Adding chives or chopped broccoli into this converts it to a magnificent dinner option."

"reviewBody": "Made this today for Christmas brunch and it’s now a family favorite. However I did a couple of things different. First thing is: I used Southwest style Hash Browns instead of the regular which added so much flavor. Omg! Then I added a few diced onions to mine, not a lot. I also did half Mild Cheddar and Colby cheese. I used more of the Colby since there was a lot of reviews saying it was really greasy when they used Cheddar. I didn’t add any butter. I mixed up my potatoes the night before and let the sit overnight in the refrigerator. Cooked them on 350-400 not sure how long. I just waited until the onions disintegrated into the Hashbrown Casserole and wasn’t crunchy any longer. I did use Cream of Chicken soup but I think I’ll use Cream Of Celery next time and I might add some Chicken Stock so it doesn’t dry out. All in all the family loved it. Not a bite left! I’ll definitely make this again."

I used half a bag of potatoes O'Brien (eliminating the need for extra onion), half a can of cream of chicken with mushrooms, 2T of melted butter, white pepper and a handful of cheddar cheese since that is what I had on-hand. Colby would have been great, but this is what I had on hand. Per the advice of one of the reviews I did not bother to thaw the potatoes. I actually stirred everything up in my dish since I cook with it often and know it will not stick."

I use the dried hashbrowns that you rehydrate in the cartons from Costco. One box appears to be about one pound frozen, so use two boxes for this. I haven't been to Cracker Barrel in a long time, but I'm totally full and I still want to eat more, so I'd say these rank right up there!"

I gave it 4 stars because I did change some things 1) I only used 1lb of frozen potatoes, if you’re feeding more than 8 people then you might want 2lbs like the recipe says. 2) I only used 1/4cup of butter. All the bother measurements I left the same. 3) I sautéed the onions in the butter before adding them to the mixture because I hate undercooked onions in HBR 4) I used cream of onion soup instead of chicken because I didn’t want little chicken bits in my casserole. 5) Then I baked it for closer to an hour (I eyeballed it instead of timing it) to get a crispy top. I served this at Easter brunch and got multiple compliments on it. I will definitely repeat."
