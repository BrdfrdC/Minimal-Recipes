Only thing I did different is use the thousand island dressing and doubled the layers of meat, sourcrout and dressing. I added bread crumbs to the bottom and the top as well. Not too bad, just wasn't the taste we wanted and was high priced."

I toast the bread cubes in the oven before assembling the casserole. Mix the dressing (a generous cup), corned beef, and drained (but not rinsed) sauerkraut together, and put in the Pam sprayed pan first. Topped with bread cubes, then covered with sprayed foil. Baked for 20 minutes. Removed foil, topped with Swiss cheese, returned to oven until cheese is melted. This is a fantastic recipe if you love Reuben sandwiches. Everyone who has tasted it absolutely loves this. I don’t understand any of the low reviews."

Layer of meat, drained sauerkraut, homemade thousand island dressing, shredded Swiss and topped with butter cubed rye bread. Use 9x13 casserole lightly greased and cooked covered 20 min and 10 min uncovered. First time used corned beef but 2nd time didn’t have so I used ham....not same as Reuben but still very tasty variation."

I put a layer of the mini rye breads on the bottom of the casserole dish, then added a layer of meat, sauerkraut, cheese and dressing, then another layer of meat, sauerkraut, cheese and dressing and topped with some diced up rye bread cubes. Baked up nice and the topping was crunchy to offset the soft bread on the bottom. Easy and delicious and reheats well!"

Also added a bit of spicey brown mustard. Its extremely filling, and would have been quick to make if I didnt have to shred the swiss myself (thanks walmart smh).

I diced up the loaf of marbled rye bread (My husband had me leave him a couple of slices so he could make a sandwich while waiting for dinner ??) and let it sit in the pan to air dry (like stuffing). When putting together the casserole, I layered the bread in the bottom of the baking dish thick enough where I couldn’t see the dish through it, reserving some for the top of the casserole. I spread on half of the meat (I had cut a heavy pound into bite sized strips) on the bread, then half of the pint of drained &amp; squeezed sauerkraut, then evenly spread/ parred on a heavy half cup of thousand island dressing (probably around 2/3), then 1-1 1/2c of cheese. I then spread on the rest of the meat, sauerkraut, and dressing (same amounts as the first layer). I sprinkled the remaining bread on the top of the casserole, covered, and baked as directed, including removing foil and adding/baking the 2 C. of Swiss cheese. It came out perfectly. Served with dill pickles, garlic rounds w/cheese dip, and coleslaw, it was a great meal. I wondered about adding a bit more dressing next time, but my husband vetoed it. My sister in law said maybe so. I decided to make it exactly this way in the future and just putting a little pitcher of more dressing on the table for those who want it saucier. I was asked for the re"

"reviewBody": "I love Reubens! This was terrific. I make my own rye bread and thousand island dressing (FYI, known as Russian dressing in some parts of the US.) I used leftover corned beef, toasted the rye bread, and made two layers of everything in my Ninja slow cooker, 3 hours on low, 1/2 hour on high. It definitely needed more dressing but that didn't detract from the taste. Next time I won't drain the sauerkraut so well."

We did not add the bread to the bottom, but rather toasted it in the toaster, then made crumbs in the food processor. We added some butter and sprinkled the bread mixture over the top. It ends up being a nice hearty casserole!"

I have them chip it and then I cut it up in smaller pieces and mix it with my sauerkraut and thousand Island dressing and put in a casserole dish sprayed with Pam. on top of that I add shredded Swiss cheese. I cut my Rye bread into crouton size pieces ,toast them in the oven and cover the casserole with them, drizzling them with a little bit of melted butter. Cover with foil bake, then right before it is done cooking I sprinkle with a little bit more Swiss cheese and bake until it is melted."

"reviewBody": "Yes! Making this for the 3rd time. I use good quality deli corned beef &amp; toss some thin dill pickle strips on that layer. I added a sprinkle of the sauerkraut juice &amp; a little brown mustard to the dressing (a personal preference). Ground up caraway seeds skattered on the rye kicks up the flavor. The swiss can be sliced &amp; cut into strips if you like. You can make ahead, storing without the dressing for a few hours - adding before baking &amp; addition of cheese. It does NOT disappoint real reuben lovers!"

Put the mixture on top of the cubes and baked per the original recipe. Topped with the other 1/2 of the cheese for the last 10-15 minutes.
