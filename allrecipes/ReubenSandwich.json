"reviewBody": "This is an okay recipe for those who are looking for a starting point. Traditionally, a Ruben is made with Russian dressing and not Thousand Island. Russian is very, very easy and inexpensive to make. Secondly, as a retired executive chef from New York City, who absolutely loves Ruben‚Äôs, I advise people to use mayo and not butter on their sandwiches. All that butter does is to give you an extremely greasy sandwich, whereas, mayonnaise adds a bit of ‚Äòsavory‚Äô to the sandwich; and it's easier to spread. After-all, mayo is nothing more than egg, oil and seasonings."

Also, with the middle ingredients preheated it only takes a couple minutes per side in a frying pan on med. high heat or 2 minutes on a Foreman or panini grill. I use more meat and seedless rye or sourdough and serve the Russian on the side as a dip."

I prefer marbled rye, but even a good Pumpernickle is a fantastic change-up. Best cole slaw is from Popeye's. Add a side of potato salad (I use the Red Hot &amp; Blue recipe - very important to use Hellman's mayonnaise - easy to make). Enjoy!"

I also at used a lot more corned beef and cheese that recommended. If you are using deli corned beef (like I did) two slices are no where near enough. I used a full pound of sliced corn beef to make four sandwiches, and two or three slices of cheese on each sandwich. They were delicious!"
