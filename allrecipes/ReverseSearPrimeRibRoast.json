On the recipe it calls for precise amount of salt and herbs, I used whatever amount was enough to cover the roasts( I had two 5.5 pound roasts) I left the roasts out at room temp for 5 hours before cooking and measured them with digital meat thermometers. ( internal temp before putting in the oven was 56 deg.) I was in a time crunch so I set the oven temp to 300 deg.with a meat thermometer probe in the roast and the digital display on my stove.\nI cooked this until the internal temp was 119 deg and the followed the rest of the original recipe. Came out perfectly seasoned, Med rare and delicious. I've cooked prime rib twice in a decade, so I have to learn all over each time, but this is my new go to."

"reviewBody": "This is the recipe folks!! It’s the only way to do it…correctly! Some tips…use a meat thermometer. It’s essential. I’ve let the roast sit and rest on counter loosely covered for over an hour (waiting for late quests ??) and it was still perfect. When you’re ready to eat, blast it in the oven at 500 to really brown the roast and get good bark. No need to rest again..you can cut immediately after this. \n\nI also salt really well with kosher salt the day before and put in fridge uncovered overnight. You want the meat to “dry”. Also important to note that you WILL NOT get a lot of pan drippings…like not at all. All the juice stays inside the meat where it belongs. This is not that kind of recipe! Do not add any cooking liquids whatsoever to your roasting pan! \n\nThis is the way to cook a rib roast. I’ve also done this w/out the butter. Still perfect. Also, it doesn’t matter if your roast is 8lbs..10lbs..15lbs..the cooking method remains the same. Your roast may weigh more but it’s not so much “bigger” it’s just longer so cooking times remain pretty much the same. \n\nExcellent recipe!!!"

"reviewBody": "I've been making my prime rib this way for over 20 years. Very similar with couple of tips for those trying for 1st time. Most important thing is to get a digital instant read thermometer and insert it into \"The middle of the thickest part of the roast\". Proper placement of the thermometer is key. I pull mine to rest at about 118 and rest for 25 mins., then back for 7 mins. at 550. I also use olive oil, fresh chopped garlic, sea salt, ground pepper and Kinders prime rib seasoning. Not advocating for exactly what I do, my advocacy is season how you like, but cook it right with good thermometer, inserted correctly. Happy feast all!"

The roast was perfect. The reverse sear really did the trick. It was pink throughout with only the crust seared. The salt and refrigeration seals in the juices. By cooking it at 200 d. first there was not the dried out crust. I will certainly do this again."

As per other reviewers suggestions, I let the roast sit at room temperature for almost 4 hours and I also added chopped garlic to the butter paste.\nMy roast was 5.1/2 lbs and I did have a bit of trouble with timing. Thank heavens for meat thermometers. Although the internal temp measured 131 when carved, the inside was quite rare. Next time I will cook at 225 on convection. While the roast sits to let the oven heat to 500. Parboiled veggies roast and Yorkshire puddings go in with roast. An awesome dinner"

I put a 7.5 lb rib roast ...just seasoned with salt,pepper,rosemary and thyme on a rack over a baking pan in the refrigerator overnight . I got it out about 2hours before putting it in a 225 degree oven and roasted for about 3.5 hours...to 120 degrees. I removed it from the oven and covered it with foil for about an hour...I made Yorkshire pudding while the roast rested. I put the roast back in the preheated oven set to 500 degrees for ten minutes. It was cooked evenly and had a perfect crust! Awesome!"

After reading the other reviews I did let it roast to 122 degrees, let it rest for 30 min. and then finished it off in my oven at 500 deg. for 10 minutes. (My roaster only goes to 450 deg) It had a lovely crust and was incredibly tender. It really was a perfect medium rare and I'll definitely make again. As others did, I used an internal thermometer to monitor the temp. This was an easy and elegant meal, everyone agreed this was the best roast they ever ate."

I wonder if larger roasts (like the recipe calls for) retain their heat better in the middle and \"cook\" more while resting? Taking mine out at 120-125° was still super rare and yummy."

I made some changes to the timing and the recipe. \n\nIt is very important to let the meat come to room temperature before baking. \n\nBased on research, I estimated 35-45 minutes per pound. A 8.25 pound rib roast was done (132 degrees) in 4 1/2 hours at 200 degrees. In addition to dry brining the roast for 48 hours I made a paste of butter, chopped garlic, pepper and onion powder and smeared it all over the roast before putting it in the oven. I also rotated the roast from back to front at 2 hours and put more butter on top. \n\nThe finished product was incredible. Melt in your mouth tender and beautifully juicy. Rave reviews from everyone and I will definitely make it again."

I pulled it out around 130F to rest. It continues to around 135 F.\n \n3. Put it back in 500 F oven. \nThe inside is perfect.\n\nFor next time, I may use cast iron pan for the last step though."

I discovered that instruction when I took the meat out to let it come up to room temperature, so I did the salt rub then and it was just fine. My kids - big guys in their 20s - absolutely loved this!

"reviewBody": "This was a great framework to make some minor adjustments too. Firstly i'd suggest cooking to 130 as prime rib does better at a medium than a medium rare I believe. I love medium-rare steaks but the prime rib cut just does a better job with a little more cooking.\n\nSalting the day before makes a huge difference too with the crust of the roast, don't forget to salt and let it dry out for at least an overnight period!\n\nCooking time does take a long time with this method depending on how well your oven does at a low temp at 200 so give yourself more time than you think you need. You can have the roast rest under aluminum foil for up to 2hrs.\n\nThe butter rub really makes this a special roast too, just throw in a bunch of fresh garlic ,thyme, rosemary and some cracked black pepper. It'll be an amazing dish you won't regret!"

Carryover temp maxed at 134 after a few minutes (the lower the roasting temperature, the less the carryover cooking I gather). This seemed like a pretty perfect medium rare. I can't imagine what it would've been like if I pulled it at the suggested 115 degrees #rawAF?\nThe reverse sear is a winning technique though and I will be using it again in the future on other foods. I read a number of recipes for prime rib and followed parts of several of them, but this one was the most influential. I saw one recipe that said to dry brine with salt a couple days in advance, but I'm not sure how much flavor that actually imparts or if it's more to retain moisture. Anyway, the beef was a hit."

"reviewBody": "you have to use this recipe. I only used pepper, salt and garlic rub but use what you want. The rock salt is important for a great crust. I cooked mine to 120. you can cook it from 115-125. Many Cooks use this method of reverse searing, look it up. This is not the only person using this method. This is the best way, you won't regret it. just remember, when you pull it out, use the foil to canopy for 20 minutes, while you preheat your oven to 500. make sure your oven is at 500 before you put it in. Reverse searing cooks the meat more evenly inside instead of an overdone outer meat. Also, don't worry about losing juices because you didn't sear it ahead. They have found, it does not make a difference as the juices still remain perfectly juicy. No worries"
