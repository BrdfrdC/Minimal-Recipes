I used a bigger can of pie filling (30 oz) and 3 cups rhubarb, increased the tapioca to 4 tsp. The filling could have been more \"thick\" but the taste was amazing! Today I am making another one and I used 1/4 cup tapioca.... the filling was much thicker when I poured it in the crust. Am anxious to see how it turns out... perfect is my guess!!!!! Can't wait! No ice cream needed with this pie... it's taste is enough!"

With the purchase of our house we inherited a wealth of Rhubarb plants in the yard, think the previous owner liked to can. I just wanted to find something to do with all this Rhubarb, not generally my favorite, I wanted something to take away from the tartness. I used it in conjunction with the Cherry Pie Filling Recipe from this site. I used an extra cup of cherries and had too much filling but the extra will be heated on the stove for popovers."

"reviewBody": "This was a great way to use our rhubarb. Being stingy with our rhubarb (having just brought some down south from Iowa and cleaning and cutting about 6 cups), I added a drained can of tart cherries to the cherry pie filling, which allowed me to still use only 2 cups of rhubarb. As did Betty Boop, used 8 tablespoons of flour in place of the tapioca, since we had none. Quite tasty and a change from our usual strawberry rhubarb or plain rhubarb pies. Thanks for sharing."

I added the extra rhubarb from other suggestions. The reason I added the apple was due to the fact I used a 10 inch pie plate and there wasn't enough filling to fill the pie. It is on my list of keepers. Thank you for the recipe"

"reviewBody": "Great! I came across this recipe when trying to find out what to do with ingredients I had in freezer and I'm trying to clean it out right now. How perfect for me!I used 4 cups pre pitted frozen cherries and about 1 1/2 cups frozen rhubarb. I personally don't care for any pie so I have not tried this, however the pie eaters I do have are loving it. I did let it sit in front of a window for about 4 hours with a cool breeze coming in over it before serving. I asked my pie eaters if they liked it better the first or second, they answered \"yes\". I could see that it definitely has set up more within a days time. Will make again. Editing my review I did try some of this pie because I couldn't believe how much they said they liked it but didn't seem to be eating it all that quickly. Very sweet and I can only bet it's because of our tree that gives the sweetest cherries. If using fresh cherries may want to taste them and adjust sugar accordingly. As a sidenoted it's been requested by the pie eaters to have this available for the weekend. ;-)"

I did add a bit more rhubarb as some other reviewers had suggested (about 3 cups total), and still, there was not a lot of filling, so I wouldn't recommend using a deep dish pie plate. I would also suggest serving this pie cold and/or letting it cool and serving the next day for the best texture. Overall, a wonderful, easy recipe--my husband said \"delicious!\" :)"

Will have to make another one as I have all the ingredients and my rhubarb plants are in full swing. Will try my make ahead suggestion and update my review with the results. UPDATE - changed from 4 to 5 stars. let sit overnight in fridge and it set up beautifully plus the flavors were even better he next day YUM. making another one this week!"

"reviewBody": "I made this pie but did not get to taste it. I gave it to my Dad and he thought it was wonderful. I did not use a top crust, but instead used left over topping from the rhubarb strawberry crunch that I made the same day. He thought it was great and even asked to have more rhubarb in it next time."

"reviewBody": "When strawberries are not quite there but the rhubarb is abundant -try this !\r\nI altered the recipe by using 3 cups of rhubarb,\r\n1 T. tapioca, and 1 t. cornstarch .\r\nIf you like it sweeter, use a full cup of sugar.\r\nI also made a crumb crust -- cut 1/4 cup butter into 1/4 c. sugar mixed with 1/2 c. flour, and stir in 1 yolk.\r\nA very easy and great way to use up that can of Cherry Pie filling !"

"reviewBody": "This pie was awesome!!! I made it in a 10 inch deep pie plate so I had to add another two cups of chopped rhubarb. Also, I didn't have tapioca in the house so I used flour 8 Tbsp. and it came out just fine. Everyone loved it, not too sweet nor too tart! This is definitely a KEEPER!"
