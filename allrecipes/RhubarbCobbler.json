I also threw in a couple cups of strawberry halves just for some extra sweetness. Wow!! Delish!!\n\nI think you could add even more rhubarb or other fruit if you wanted because, even with the extra strawberries thrown in, there was still slightly more crust than fruit. I think a little more rhubarb or fruit or both would take this over the top."

If it had been listed base ingredients then cobbler ingredients it would have been a bit more understandable. I felt like a chicken running back and forth getting everything. But I will say the cobbler looks very pretty and I used a 8X8 pan so we will see how it looks and tastes once it's done!"

I used an 8 inch square pan but I think I could double topping instead of 1.5 it and it would still fit.. 4 cups of rhubarb, 2 of frozen strawberries and 3 TB of cornstarch but kept the topping measurements same as recipe. I added touch of vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon to pot as it was cooking, as well as sprinkled more nutmeg and cinnamon on top of dotted butter. I added 1 tsp of vanilla. For the top I used 1/2 TB of brown sugar and 1/2 TB of reg sugar as well as more cinnamon and nutmeg. Delicious!"

"reviewBody": "Other than the balance of filling to batter being out of proportion this looked very appealing coming out of the oven. Vibrant color, crusty golden topping – I couldn’t wait to dig in. Unfortunately I was disappointed from the first mouthful. First, there was not enough filling for the topping, though used a smaller pan size, 8x8.\" It could have used 1-1/2 times the filling ingredients. Next, there was too much cinnamon. Rather than a subtle hint of cinnamon, this was overbearing. One half teaspoon would have been plenty (and should be mixed in with the cornstarch and sugar, not sprinkled over the filling in the dish which would sure be tricky!) The topping tasted like a cracker, for lack of a better way of putting it. Not lightly sweet at all, and on the dry side. Seems to me more butter and more sugar were in order. Finally, it could have been juicier, even coming straight from the oven (and I only baked this for 17 minutes). I can only imagine how much more that will be emphasized as it stands. A little less cornstarch or a tad more water certainly would have alleviated this. All and all, this was a big disappointment. So glad I made ice cream to serve with this. It should help mitigate its flaws."

I love cinnamon so sprinkled lots in. It was just perfect... the sweetness, the amount of topping and the consistency of the rhubarb/apple was all perfect! Thank you for posting this one!"

I also cooked in 9x13 pan and it took about 30 minutes to cook. It may have taken longer because I had to go to town and buy milk when I went to mix the topping I noticed I was out so the filling had time to cool. We both loved this one. It would be good mixed with other fruit but if I have enough rhubarb I will make it this way."

It was my first time cooking with rhubarb so I chopped it up pretty small just in case the flavor was a little disagreeable I wouldn't get a chunk of it. It turns out we really liked it! The dough/bread part is really light and sweet. I think I'll be using it with my other cobblers."

The only comment I would like to point out is that the top says it's for a 9x13 pan and the recipe portion states 9inch square. Definately use the square pan or double the recipe. I just pulled it out of the oven and can't leave it alone even though it's piping hot! Thanks for sharing this great recipe! :)"

I keep the amount of sugar the same, but add about a tablespoon more of cornstarch to the mix since I use more fruit than the recipe calls for. The biscuit topping is so tasty! I switch up sprinkling it with white sugar or brown sugar depending upon my mood. I've made this cobbler about 4 times, and it's always a hit!"

I added about a 1/2 tablespoon extra of water as some folks commented it was dry. This was not dry...it set up to perfection. I did not decrease the baking powder (and I was happy I didn't). I think the \"too much baking powder\" comment some have made could be coming from the fact that rhubarb ALWAYS makes your teeth feel coated - kinda squeaky after eating it. It's just the nature of the beast. I did add about 3 drops of Mexican vanilla...because I bake nothing without it...lol"
