"reviewBody": "Delicious jam! Thank you! I doubled the recipe and used it as a base. I combined one heaping teaspoon of ginger powder with the sugar before adding it to the fruit, and added half a cup of lemon juice, and about two-thirds of a cup of some surplus black chokeberry and apple jelly that I had only just made. It was \"surplus\" because there wasn't enough to fill half the jam jar. I also added another 3/4 cup of sugar. The highly-staining chokeberries turned the rhubarb a wonderful deep wine red colour. I also cut the stems of rhubarb into 1/2-inch pieces because the only rhubarb jam I had ever tried before was made with pieces that were more like 1.5 inches in length. I thought this had reduced its spreadability, but after making the jam myself I think it had not been cooked for long enough to reduce it to pulp. BTW, I don't have a sweet tooth so I add lemon juice to most jams and jellies to increase their tartness. \n\nI am definitely saving this recipe for next year's crop of rhubarb! :)"

I have a batch on the stove right now with about 20 minutes to go on the cook time. Mine isn't turning red like the photo here, more like a brown like apple butter, but still looks good. The only oranges I could get, (due to COVID and shelves not fully stocked yet) are blood oranges, but seems to be cooking down and thickening OK. I couldn't get over how easy this recipe and instructions are! I'm an experienced cook, born and raised of \"putting up\" food and preserves all my life. This is so easy a novice could do it! And have the satisfaction of \"making it themselves\" This will become my go to recipe for rhubarb jam now!"

"reviewBody": "Tasty and easy. I love the combination of orange and rhubarb, but wanted more orange flavor and added a little orange extract at the end. Next time I'll add the grated orange peel near the end of the cooking time to keep the flavor fresher and will use the juice and peel of 2 oranges rather than the water. I also thought the jam needed a little acidity and added 2 teaspoons of lemon juice at the end of the cooking time. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of butter to keep the jam from foaming. I've seen in other reviews that others added a little cinnamon. I'll try that next time along with a little nutmeg."

The jam is the perfect amount of tart and sweet and that little bit of orange really brightens the flavor. I added 4 drops of red food coloring. I'll use this recipe again."

I used 10 cups rhubarb, which I had frozen from fresh. I mixed it with the sugar and let thaw. Omitted the water. Turned out thick as the photo, not runny at all, was great warm over ice cream! Next time will decrease zest to 1-1.5 t, fresh squeezed oj to scant 1/4 c, sugar to 1.5 c and see how it goes. Thanks for the recipe!"

Instead of sugar, I added about 3/4 cup of Splenda and 1/4 cup of honey. I added much more orange zest, just because I love it in recipes, and used more orange juice instead of the water. Delicious blend of sweet and tart. Will make again, when my rhubarb regrows! \n\nOne note, my rhubarb was green, so the final product wasn't very pretty. Added just a few drops of red food color for looks."

But, although I followed the recipe exactly as written, I thought that it was much thinner than I thought it would be. Not at all like a butter. I also had to add some red food colouring because otherwise this jam would have been a nasty grey/green colour that my kids would reject. The exact measurements resulted in 6 1/2 pints of jam. On the whole, I would definitely make this jam again (because of the amazing taste and to use up our fresh rhubarb), but I might add some sour cherries for the natural red colour, I'd not add water, and I would let it cook down much longer, perhaps 75 minutes. I may also consider blending the mixture before cooking to eliminate the fibres for a better \"butter\" texture."
