However, I found it very gummy as I must cook with gluten free flour which doesn't end up anything like wheat flour. I thought, maybe another beaten egg, cut back on the gluten free flour and add more tapioca flour to thicken. Any ideas?? Anyone??"

"reviewBody": "Absolutely fabulous as written. Important notes: this is a big pie, ideally you would use a 9 inch deep dish pie plate. It will not fit into a pre-made freezer crust that’s already in a tray (even the “deep dish” one). You also must use fresh rhubarb (or it will be too watery) and you must use FULL-Fat sour cream. The sour cream mixture also must be mixed really really well or you’ll have clumps. Also, Although great as written, I prefer a crumb topping with oats. Also don’t open the oven when you turn the temp down and it does need the full 55 minutes."

"reviewBody": "I use this as a very solid base recipe, with only a few changes: Half or less sugar in the sour cream mixture, For the crumble I add half a cup of rolled oats &amp; double the butter &amp; brown sugar, making a double portion of crumble. We find that the rhubarb maintains more rhubarb flavor &amp; the crumble contributes the sweetness. Also, we find that this pie is best refrigerated overnight before eating. For whatever reason, refrigeration increases the rhubarb flavor &amp; sort of “cures” the pie into a heavenly delight. Everyone loves it."

The first time I made it, It spilled over the edges of the 9” pie plate and made a horrible mess in the oven. This time, I added 1 tbsp of tapioca to help absorb juice, and used a 10” pie plate. Voila! The pie stayed in the pie plate where it belongs."

Coconut sugar has more of a brown sugar taste so I thought it would work well with this recipe...and it didn’t disappoint. When I make this again I will use less sugar as the sweetness overpowered the tartness as others have mentioned. I think 3/4-1cp would work better. Very happy with this recipe...enjoy"

I add an additional 1 tbsp. flour to the 1/3 cup for the filling. I add 1 tsp. cinnamon to the streusel topping. I bake a bit longer than stated (sorry I don't know exactly how long but at least an additional 5 minutes). The additional flour and additional bake time gives the interior a firmer, more cheesecake-like interior. I always cover it loosely with aluminum foil near the end to keep the top from getting too brown with the additional bake time."

I did add zest from one orange and a tablespoon of the juice just because I like that rhubarb/orange flavor blend. Wow so tasty and easy. Next time I want to do what other reviewers suggest and double this with a graham crust in a 9x13 pan. Thank you for this awesome recipe."

"reviewBody": "This was excellent! Hubby and friends have asked me to make it again. I did cut the sugar back to 1 cup. The volume of ingredients was off a bit so I might adjust that next time but the taste was amazing. I used a deep dish pie shell and only needed about 3 cups of rhubarb. Also, the sour creme mixture over the 3 cups of rhubarb filled it right to be brim so that it spilled over while cooking. That was ok because it made the crust chewy and yummy, but when I took it out of the oven there was a huge air bubble in the middle that collapsed when it cooled. All of that was perfectly fine for my home pie, but if I was taking it somewhere I would use a little less filling to make a better presentation. Will definitely make this lots!"

Very nice texture, more like a rubarb crisp look when served. It did not hold the form of a piece of pie.\nThat is why we only gave it a 4 star."

I have followed the recipe exactly but now I reduce the sugar to 1 cup which is plenty. Also, I have added 2 cups of fresh strawberries without reducing the rhubarb. I think the addition of the strawberries makes it perfect! A definite 5."

This recipe has become a favourite with my family and my coworkers. Sometimes I use 2 cups of rhubarb and 2 cups of strawberries and since the berries are so sweet, I cut back on the sugar to 1 cup. I have a favourite crumble recipe that I use as a modification to this one - 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/4 c flour, 1/4 c oats, 1/4 c melted butter. The oats add a bit of crunchiness to the topping. I also find that for a standard pie tin, this recipe will make two whole pies if you just add 1/2 c more of the rhubarb."

So easy to make and a beautiful presentation.......but sour cream.......not so much."

"reviewBody": "Excellent pie! My all-time favorite rhubarb pie is the rhubarb custard from the 1950's Betty Crocker cookbook. This one is different, but is much easier, and also tastes great!\n\nI used closer to 5 cups of rhubarb (which fit nicely into a 10 inch pie plate), then followed the rest of the recipe as written. The recipe says to wait until it cools to cut and eat it, but of course warm pie is awesome, so we had a piece before it cooled completely. It was good, but the sour cream was the predominant flavor. Once it had cooled overnight, the sour cream flavor was much less evident, and the rhubarb flavor shone through.\n\nThe topping is a nice addition and is much lighter than some desserts. It was nice and crisp and delicious! I have 4 rhubarb plants and am always looking for good recipes. This one is definitely a keeper!"

My husband does not care for rhubarb, and when he heard there weren't any strawberries in the pie, he almost didn't try any. After the first bite, he said it was the best pie he's had in a long time! I am excited to make this simple pie recipe again. I only used 1 cup of white sugar (instead of 1 1/2 cups) and I added a little cinnamon, like another reviewer had posted.
