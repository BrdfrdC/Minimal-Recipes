"reviewBody": "I don't have a rice cooker however I do have an instant pot, and so I saut√©ed the rice in a little bit of olive oil until it was translucent, then added the chicken broth and cooked for 7 minutes on high pressure. Afterwards I added the Parmesan cheese I tasted it and decided it needed a little bit of garlic powder. Otherwise without the addition of garlic powder it was a pretty good risotto. This could be improved with a little bit of white wine."
