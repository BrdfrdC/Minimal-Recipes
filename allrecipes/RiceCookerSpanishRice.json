"reviewBody": "I had a chicken breast to use so I cooked the bacon in a large pan. I then sautéed the onions in the bacon fat, added the diced raw chicken to brown a little. Then I added all the other ingredients except the bell peppers and some extra chicken broth and red pepper flakes. I was surprised that it was a little bland till I realized it needed salt. It was a quick one pot meal that I would make again with a little more spice."

Next time I cook this, I'll use my Instant Pot and put in 3 cups of chicken broth, or use the rice cooker and use just one cup of rice."

"reviewBody": "This was excellent! The recipe submitter notes this can be done in a skillet on a stove and this is what I did since I do not have a rice cooker. I somehow let myself run out of rice so I used a box of the rice/vermicelli mix and just kept the season packet aside for another use. I left out the optional corn and bacon. This was super simple but tasted like I had fussed over it for hours. Definite keeper!"
