My daughter's boyfriend will eat half of the pan if you let him, so I double the sauce ingredients to make it go a little farther. I've used all cuts of beef and they all work fine, you just have to simmer some longer than others. I only use a sprinkle of red pepper flakes since I know that any more would ruin the dish for my family. This dish is very rich but that is probably why it's so good! There is a reason the reviews are so good."

Added cream cheese at very end and just a couple of teaspoonfuls of sour cream—don’t think it needs much, if any, and it’s got such exquisite flavours already"

Sour cream, cream cheese, beef broth? yep, open containers of all of those! and of course I had onions, mustard, spices, and worcestershire. I didn't need to buy another thing! Score!!!! and it is SO good, my husband didn't realize we were eating leftovers, which he hates. A fabulous recipe."

As I added the 2 tsps of crushed red pepper I almost only added one because I thought that was way too much for a traditional beef stroganoff being a dish that originated from Germany or Russia but I went ahead and added it. Wish I would've stopped at one and maybe even only half a tsp. When I make this the next time I definitely will use way less crushed red pepper because I cannot take away but I can add."

I used French's Dijon mustard that had chardonnay in with it, ribeye instead of chuck roast, used half the red pepper flakes, and I added about an eighth a cup of heavy cream to it. The original was great enough to try doctoring it a bit this second time, so you can see what your tastes prefer! I highly recommend, and it's great for a keto diet!"

I've made this so many times now and I can tell you there are two things that make this dish- the meat and the wine. \n\nChoose a wine that you enjoy drinking. I like a full bodied red. A Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, or a Malbec work nicely. Doesn't need to be fancy, it just needs to taste good. \n\nNow for the meat this is a little trickier. Some types are too chewy and that will not cook down in this. Choose your meat wisely, it's worth it to splurge here. Sirloin worked well.\n\nI never made this with the red pepper flakes so if you have to cook for someone who doesn't like spicy just don't add any and this dish is amazing!"

"reviewBody": "Love this recipe... it reminds me of my childhood in the 1970s. We don't eat meat, so I subbed in 2 lbs of Beyond Meat ground \"beef\" and use no-chicken Better Than Bouillon to make the broth. I cook the onions, mushrooms and garlic together and add in the Beyond ground as the onions start to soften. I never remove anything from the pan... I just do the sauce right on top of everything (easy peasy). We LOVE this dish and my daughter asks for the \"creamy hamburger pasta\" now pretty often. It's become one of our go-to comfort dishes. I especially like this recipe as it does NOT use cream of mushroom soup, which I don't care for and a lot of stroganoff recipes call for."

I would either have to cut the beef into smaller pieces or, like another reviewer said, buy a better cut of meat since even with these cooking times the meat ended up tough. Apart from that, I really enjoyed this meal and will make it again."

"reviewBody": "So I marinated the meat in red wine with salt and pepper. Then I melted some butter and the virgin olive oil together and cooked the meat until brown. After that I added in the flour (stirred into a little water first) and the beef broth as well as a little bit of the reserved wine marinade. I cooked it until it thickened up and then added the mushroom and let that simmer for about 10 minutes. Then I added garlic and let simmer for 3 minutes. Lastly I added the cream cheese and sour cream and stirred for 5 minutes. I then poured the meat, mushrooms, and sauce over wide egg noodles. This meal was delicious and definitely didn't need to cook for an hour. I would say I completed mine in about 30 minutes. My husband, kids, and myself finished our plates! I omitted the red pepper and onion for my kiddos."

He used 1 tbs of red pepper and .the leftover standing rib we had from our holiday meal."

I had to add a lot of salt to bring out any flavor and it still tasted like something was missing. The flavors didn't complement one another. It did taste a little better the next day, but still not happy with it."
