I used no-salt broth, so added in 3/4 tsp salt and pepper to taste. Topped with French bread (made into croutons and browned in frying pan), Swiss cheese, and parmesan. My son said that this is the best thing that I've ever made. Added to my favourites. :)"

Great recipe to play with and practice a classic.\n\n I like adding some umami fish sauce, worchestershire sauce and balsamic vinegar for a slight kick, and a few more green herbs (savory /cilantro /oregano /basil /bay) to add depth.

I used 5 cups of sliced onions and felt caramelizing the onions added more flavor. I added another tablespoon of dry sherry. Toast the French bread so it doesn’t get soggy. Gruyere cheese is more flavorful than Provolone. The broth was rather bland so I added Knorr home style stock enhancer which made the stock taste richer.\nWe enjoyed the soup but noticed it was a lot better the next day."

"reviewBody": "If you plan to caramelize the onions, I suggest not adding the 2 TBS of olive oil. It seems the olive oil prevents the onions from completely browning, which is really what releases their flavor and makes the soup scrumptious. Also, I think the amount of broth in the recipe makes the soup too watery. I cut back and still wanted to reduce the broth more. It's not as rich as I would like."

"reviewBody": "Cut the butter back to 6 tablespoons, because they were swimming in 8 Tbsps plus oil. Use spanish and vidiala (sweet) onion mix, as vidalia are not strong enough alone to hold this recipe up.\nWhile the onions are cooking, add 1 teaspoon of honey. Helps with the carmelization and rounds out the flavor. \nSprinkle 2 teaspoons of flour over the cooked onions and let cook 1 minute, stirring constantly before slowly adding broth.\nI did not use garlic as husband does not like it, but it adds to the recipe so use if you can. \nAdd worcesteshire. It makes a big difference."

"reviewBody": "So this is a very basic, learning how to cook from the beginning recipe. The biggest issue with this recipe is how long they cook the onions for. You absolutely, positively MUST cook and caramelize the onions to a very deep, rich brown. If you can drag this process on as long as an hour to caramelize the onions, even better. This is where all the flavor comes from. The rest of the recipe is fine, you will find many variations of which alcohol to use, red wine, white wine, port, sherry, brandy. None are wrong, it's all about your taste, but please, CARAMELIZE THOSE ONIONS!!!!!!"

Instead of cubing the swiss cheese, I laid a half slice on top of the provolone. And I think I used more parmesan cheese than what was called for. I also used dry red cooking wine, as that's what I had on hand. Otherwise, it was very delicious! My husband really enjoyed it and said it was a keeper. Will definitely make again!"

"reviewBody": "I had to change a lot about this recipe, but it was a decent jumping-off point. First; caramalize the onions. It makes a HUGE difference. Second; MOAR GARLIC! IAlways add entirely too much garlic (unless you're allergic to it). Also, add the spices (Bay, thyme, tarragon, fresh cracked pepper) at this stage. Especially the bay and pepper. You want that infused into the butter, and, in turn, the onions. \n\nAlso, once the onions are caramalized, add the sherry (and I did mushrooms) and let it evaporate, cooking into the onions and/or mushrooms. Next, NO MORE SALT. You reeeeally don't need that much salt. You won't be able to taste the delicious food you just made."

We used quality ingredients which came through but apparently too smooth a flavor profile. On the whole, the recipe works and was simple, but it doesn't deliver a punch. A two-star as that indicates that we \"didn't like it\" as we didn't want to finish the last bowl leftover after a few days (food waste - I know!). Your tastes may vary."

I used a little minced garlic too. Make sure to make translucent but get them golden caramelized. 30-60 min on med heat.\nUse some kind of wine to de-glaze pan is needed not optional.\nUsed 1tbsp of Worcester sauce and 1 bouillon cube with 4 cups beef broth. I used 1 bay leaf and dried thyme but would do fresh if possible. I Brought to boil then down to light simmer for 20-60 min covered.\nAfter done cooking, I added shredded parmesan, like you put on spaghetti, to the soup itself and added shredded cheese to bottom of my bowls before adding soup, then the toasted bread with cheese on top. (No swiss) since I had Brie cheese this time I use that."

"reviewBody": "Hubby said this was the best French onion soup he’d ever had!!! It is a great recipe as written, however, with a few modifications, you can knock it out of the park! Based on other suggestions these are the modifications I made; reduced the butter to1/4 cup (it’s plenty!) I sliced 2 brown and 3 sweet vidalia onions into 1/2” slices and caramelized with the butter. About 30-40 min. I then added 2 cloves of garlic and cooked until fragrant. Then I added 1/2 Cup Cabernet Sauvignon and cooked until reduced by half. Then I added 1 TBS Worcheshire. For the broth I used 5 TBS Better Than Bullion beef and a total of 10 cups of water. (In a glass 2 cup measuring cup I put in 2 cups of h2o and microwaved it until boiling then I added the 5 TBS of Better Than Bullion and mixed it until dissolved). Add to the soup. Let it all simmer for about an hour. In the meantime, I sliced a French baguette into 1/2” slices and toasted them on a baking sheet in a 375 degree oven until crispy. @10 minutes.I placed my ramekins on a baking sheet and ladled the soup in each one, leaving 1/2” or so headroom. I then placed a couple pieces of the toasted baguette on top of the ramekins of soup. Top each with a slice of each Swiss cheese, Provolone and a sprinkling of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Carefully set the tray of ramekins under the broiler for about 3 minutes until cheese is melted and just starting to brown. Watch carefully so it doesn’t burn. This recipe is a real treat!!! I will make it again"
