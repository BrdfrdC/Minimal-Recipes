I assumed I had the mozzarella but did not. I had ricotta left in the tub so I layered small spoonfuls in the center and on top then baked it. It was so easy and highlighted tomatoes from the garden."

"reviewBody": "Very easy and good. I made a double batch so we could eat some today and I will freeze the rest. I only use one egg, even for the double batch. I used real garlic. Another difference is that I have a large plastic tray that fits in my fridge. I dusted it with about 1/2 - 3/4 cup of semolina. I put the formed gnocchi on there and shook it a little, and rested them in the semolina for about 2-3 hours. The semolina and resting helps them firm up a wee bit, and for me, it made it easier to put the fork marks in and the grooves stayed present much better after boiling. I got the semolina idea from Epicurious. These need more towards 4-5 minutes boiling, not just 1-2, or they taste of raw flour. I made my own sauce - also a biggish batch. Now I will have 2 person portion sizes of sauce and gnocchi in the freezer for future meals when I don't really feel like cooking!"

I would definitely make it again."

I don’t use the Parmesan, reduce the salt, and add parsley flakes to the mix.\nThe best suggestion I have is to make a large batch (I do 4 times this recipe in one sitting). Lay the gnocchi out on well floured cookie sheets, and freeze. Once frozen, it’s easy to bag it and store in freezer."

Our gnocchi connoisseur guests had no idea it was only flour based.\n\nLeave out the garlic salt. It is unnecessary and an additive that overwhelms the gnocchi. Garlic and onion salts are not nutritious. \n\nMore important, your sauce should showcase the gnocchi not fight with it.\n\nDouble this recipe to serve 4-6 people."

The only change I made was a 15oz ricotta but that's because I wasn't paying attention and it didn't look like 15oz. Increased the flour by 1/2 cup to account for the ricotta. Otherwise, it was great. I froze what I didn't use the same night. Just had some tonight in the Italian Sausage and Ricotta Soup recipe from this sight."

Unfortunately, I ran out of white flour and had to use wheat flour, which gave the gnocchi a very, almost overwhelming, grainy flavor. I still enjoyed the meal, especially because the super simple sauce is AMAZING! I will certainly try this again and be more careful next time to have all the ingredients I need! The balance of cheese and garlic is perfect!"

I'm not sure if I did something wrong but it was really frustrating. I kept adding more and more flour and the dough was still sticking to my fingers. I almost gave us and threw everything out but I didn't have a back up plan for dinner lol. I was expecting it to taste terrible and extra heavy because of all the extra flour but it was actually quite delicious. If I do make this again I may use a stand mixer for the dough to make things a little easier.\n\n*** I have made this recipe twice now. The first time I used shredded parmesan cheese and the second time I used grated like the recipe calls for. I found the shredded parmesan cheese made the gnocchi more cheesy and delicious."

I found that I had to add quite a bit more flour to form the right dough consistency, but other than that it was spot-on. All I really did was strain the Gnocchi, sear it off in a pan with some butter/olive oil to give it some nice color, then I mixed it in with the sauce, added cheese, and popped it in the broiler. Out came a nice, golden, plate of gnocchi. Great recipe. Good job."

I used a spinach basil pesto recipe I also found on allrecipes which was delicious. The only thing I changed with the gnocchi was the cooking time. My only other experience with making gnocchi, the directions said to cook for 4-5 minutes. Those turned out well, so I decided to split the difference and cook these for 3 minutes, and they turned out great."

Next time I'll leave out the pepper, as I didn't like it in the gnocchi (I do like pepper, though - weird!) I did find that they really need to soak up some sauce, whatever kind you choose to serve with it, to be palatable. I served half with a mushroom, spinach, garlic white wine sauce, and I'm having the rest with my own marinara. I will make these again, as it's nice to have a different type of \"pasta\" once in a while."

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because there wasn't enough sauce. After the sauce was done cooking, there wasn't much there so I dumped about 8oz of tomato sauce in and added some basil and oregano and cooked it a bit longer. Even still there really wasn't enough sauce for everyone to their liking. I would definitely double the sauce recipe in the future. Also, I'm a cheese lover - and one of those who never can get enough cheese, but I didn't even put all the mozzarella cubes in the sauce because there were so many."

So, what I do is place the gnocchi on parchment paper. I then roll up the parchment (very loosely so you don't crush the gnocchi) and lower into the boiling water, holding one edge of the parchment so you don't scald your fingers. They release immediately, and just pull the parchment out of the water. Don't use wax paper because some of the wax will end up in the water and the paper tends to shred. Works every time!"
