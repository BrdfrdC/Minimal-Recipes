I didn't use all the stock (and I didn't even have enough to begin with), but I was worried that the rice would have been overcooked, so I stopped pouring it in before the container was empty. I also let the saffron sit in a tiny bit of wine to draw out the flavor and color. It was a beautiful yellow, delicious dish."

"reviewBody": "Ok now, this recipe is absolutely fantastic. I followed it to the T minus the bone marrow and it turned out amazing. One change I would make is to lessen the saffron by half or to taste. 1 tsp turned out to be quite a lot and it made the dish extremely aromatic, which is not a negative, however as a side dish the flavor was a tad overwhelming. One thing I would note to new risotto makers is the cooking time and the amount of broth are completely subject to external factors. So just keep tasting it as you go and it should be perfectly dente when the husk on the rice begins to become transparent."

This recipe still turns out great without it (the same can still be said when you omit the marrow). And keep in mind that you can swap out the Parmesan for another cheese to mix it up a little. For example, Gorgonzola works great. If using a different cheese, rely on taste as opposesd to the given measurements as stronger cheeses will require less and vice versa."
