I have never cooked with Truffle oil either and I am surprised at just how much that scent and flavor lingers around... I LOVE the stuff but I think this recipe could call for slightly less. I thought about just using calrose rice (what i had on hand) but I think this Arborio rice is a little better for THIS I'm glad I got some. I would recommend 1/2 (1 Tbsp. instead of 2). I think that will provide plenty of flavor without the overkill. Also, I used chicken stock instead of broth because that's all I had... don't get me wrong though this is a GREAT RECIPE and my Risotto came out perfect!!! Can't wait to try other Risotto recipes now that I know what's involved. Look out Chef Ramsey!!! ????"

I didn't really use parsley because I didn't have any. Finally I topped it off with the juice of 1 lemon and 1/2 cup of frozen peas. Mixed it all together until the peas were warmed and the cheeses and marscapone were melted.\n\nOh and while it was cooking, I put in two small parmesan rines to cook in (tip I heard on food network for another type of recipe).\n\nThis turned out pretty awesome!"

The aroma coming from the pan as it's cooking is irresistible, but going the \"low and slow\" route really pays off with this one.

I also left out the truffle oil only because the BF doesn't like mushrooms. Other than that I followed it exactly. Here's my tips and tricks. \n\nIf you have white wine in the house, i'm sure any kind would do, but if you don't, you can buy white cooking wine at the grocery store. It's usually with the vinegars and marinades. \n\nDon't boil the broth, get it hot, but don't let it boil. \nDo ALL your prep first and have it within reach.. You really cannot leave the stove once you start. \n\nUse a teflon pan and a wooden spoon. Nothing will stick that way, and the rice slides right off the spoon. The recipe says stir and STIR YOU WILL!!! It's pretty much constant...so be prepared for that. \n\nI used exactly 3 cans of chicken broth. \n\nThank you so much for this recipe. My BF and I had sauted scallops and asparagus with it, and it was a special anniversary meal and we had a lot of fun making it together. :)"

Low, slow cooking, adding the broth ladle by ladle, allows the beautiful Arborio rice to release all its starches and get all lovely and creamy. The wine, Parmesan, truffle oil and butter make this rich and intoxicatingly aromatic and decadently delicious. Not a grain of it was left."

"reviewBody": "This is a great recipe and I will definately make it again! I followed the recipe exactly - no deviations - &amp; it turned out perfectly. It does take time and you must stay on top of the stirring so it won't often make the week night rotation for us, but it's an excellent choice for special occassions or a Sunday dinner."

"reviewBody": "Delicious - I love white truffle oil and was excited to try this recipe. I followed it exactly (except using vegetable broth instead of chix because that was all I had on hand - I just added a few cubes of chix bouillon) and we enjoyed this dish thoroughly. Risotto was a bit thick when I served, but it was my first time - next time I will remove from the heat when I ladle the last bit of broth and serve immediately."
