"reviewBody": "I cooked medium grain (sushi) rice in our new Faberware instant pot on the rice setting (P03). Package said 1 1/2 cups rice to 2 cups water, so that's what I did, and it turned out perfect. While this was cooking, I heated the 2 cups milk with the 4 tbs sugar at a notch below medium on the gas stove in a sauce pan, stirring here and there with a wooden spoon until just about to boil. I poured in the 1/2 cup of milk with the 4 tbs corn starch, and 1 tsp vanilla (mixed with a fork in glass liquid measuring cup). I simply added cooked rice until I liked the consistency. About 2 cups worth. Cooked on stove after until it thickened up like how I wanted it to feel when stirring it. Looked about right too, with equal parts sauce and rice, or just so. Turned out great! My 83-year-old mom loved it. Had seconds. No cinnamon for her, though. Doesn't like it, but love this pudding. Thank you."
