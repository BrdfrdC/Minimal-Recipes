I used very thinly sliced steak, a can of Rotel and a can of green chiles, all the same seasonings, onion and garlic sautéed in a skillet. I loaded the tortillas then placed in baking pan. Covered in sharp cheddar and a can of green enchilada sauce. Baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Served with shredded lettuce, grape tomatoes and avocado slices."

I used the leftover roast I cooked in the crockpot from the day before. My meat was dry and after simmering for only 25-30 minutes the meat was moist and perfect in these. I used the small flour tortilla shells and garnished with shredded cabbage, avacado, and a very small amount of cheese. Excellent and Easy! Thank you!"

I didn't cook the tomatoes with the mixture, I chopped them for a topping at the end. I made them into a 'wet' burrito keeping off the lettuce and adding more of the mixture and cheese on top and into the microwave just long enough for the cheese to melt then added the fresh chopped tomatoes. Same concept just a little reconstructed. Thank you for sharing your recipe."

We also added some sour cream and refried beans to the burritos. Would for sure make these again and it sure doesn't hurt that they were super easy to make."

Since it called for precooked roast beef I went searching for a good Mexican style roast beef and I found Charley's Slow Cooker Mexican Style Meat (from this site) and I am really glad that I did. The two of these recipes work in perfect harmony with each other. I will make this again."

I followed the recipe as written, used the popular taco chain restaurant's jar of mild taco sauce, and I didn't add the diced tomatoes to the pan to cook, I added them to the burritos when I added the lettuce and cheese. I also added a dollup of sour cream to each! YUM-YUM-YUM-YUM...What a fantastic Lefover-makeover recipe!!!!! Nothing was leftover, not a drop, not a crumb, not even the tiniest morsel! D-E-L-I-S-H!!!!!"

Instructions omitted saying when to add so added it with the beef. I jullienned the beef because it stayed together better in the burritos. I drained the chilies too. I added half the cheese to the hot mixture just before putting together. After warming tortillas and assembling, I poured over any leftover filling and heated covered for 15 minutes @350, sprinkled on remaining cheese and heated only until melted. Served with lettuce and a dallop of sour cream. This is a keeper. Thanks for a great recipe."

Used some leftover roast beef (also from this site) and followed the instructions exactly. *The recipe calls for an 8oz. bottle of taco sauce but doesn't ever say what to do with it so... We added it to the skillet with the tomatoes (we used a can of diced tomatoes, drained) and simmered until it thickened (about 17 mins). This is definitely going into the rotation! Thanks!"

I followed the recipe except for when i had only 1/2 the taco sauce on hand and used salsa to cover the rest... at the very end, I took the burritos, folded them up securely and fried them in extra virgin olive oil until the tortillas were golden brown.....The crunchy/warm texture of the tortilla with the authenticness of the beef was just...WOW....So good...I ate 3 on the way to a texas hold 'em tournement cuz I couldn't leave 'em at home :)"

After filling and folding the tortilla shell i fried them for a (3-5 minutes per side) in a 10 in no stick skillet for a crispier burrito. They turned out wonderful will be adding this recipe left over ideas."

I left out the red peppers and taco sauce and used a can of hot green chili's and tomatoes instead.(including juices from the can) I then added a bit of water to the entire mix, boiled then simmered to reduce the water and some of the juices. Added shredded cheese and lettuce as toppings when done. These came out great and we will be having them again. Thank you."
