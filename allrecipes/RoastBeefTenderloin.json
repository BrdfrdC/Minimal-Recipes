"reviewBody": "Very Good. Made it for New Year's Eve. The technique to slow roast the meat worked beautifully. The result was tender, juicy and flavorful. I think the sear on the meat could be accomplished at a lower temp in less time per side than the recipe recommends. I got more of a char on the bottom of the pan than a fond. Between the char and the tarragon, the sauce had a lot of bitter notes. Still tasted good, but not out of this world. May have been my fault for overcooking on the sear. It was a great meal, but the sauce did not live up to the meat on this single cook. At the expense of this meal, it is hard to recommend the experiment, but it was a tasty plate of food."

Here r my changes only because I didn’t have the stuff......definitely use a meat thermometer.....we like medium rare so I pulled it at 125 and let it rest for 15 minutes under foil. Used white balsamic vinegar instead of tarragon vinegar, I used chic stock instead of veal stock. Note.....I had a angus beef ribeye boneless roast, not a roast beef tenderloin. Only difference is to leave it tied up until plating. Don’t cut string before plating."

I combined two of Chef John's recipes, using salt, pepper, and Herb de Provence to season the meat. Since I hate tarragon, I used sherry vinegar. I chopped an onion and used button mushrooms. I thickened the gravy with a cornstarch slurry once the roast came out of the oven. The cooking method worked very well, producing the best-roasted beef I've ever cooked. Just make sure to cut against the grain of the muscle in order to serve tender meat."

"reviewBody": "Ladies and Gentleman, \nThis was the first time I was ever cooking beef, and I made this recipe for Christmas for 10.... triumphantly! Essentially I doubled the recipe and followed the modifications in the video (chicken stock and white wine).\n\nThe beef was absolutely delicious, and I received raves.\n\nHowever - I was faced with some timing and juggling issues - we have one oven, and my husband was doing potatoes that needed 375degrees. I don't have a skillet that can also go into the oven. So, I put my big roasting pan on the stove and it worked just fine for the searing and starting the sauce. And it went into the oven at 375 for about 25-30 minutes. When I checked it for temp, it read 130-140, which was on target for this recipe, but higher than my butcher suggested for medium rare. \n\nIn the end, it was cooked about medium, but that's how I like it - I'm not a fan of too bloody - and the meat was soooooo tender and cut like butter. (...which was great because I didn't have steak knives).\n\nI wonder if the expense and search-time for the dried porcini mushrooms was worth it. I imagine I will use this method again, but perhaps with some less expensive investment with the porcini mushrooms...."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is amazing! I just made it for Christmas dinner today, and my whole family loved it! I am not the most experienced cook in the world, but for the most part, I followed the recipe, and everyone at the table raved about the tenderloin throughout dinner. It was spectacular, even cooked slightly longer than suggested since no one in my family likes rare or medium-rare meat. It was still so tender and flavorful. I did substitute the veal stock for chicken stock. Others who reviewed wondered why you wouldn't use beef stock, but I stuck with the chicken and it worked out VERY well. I was able to find the tarragon vinegar, and I was glad that I did. I do not agree that it was overpowering as one person said. I doubled the recipe for the gravy...I would suggest this...it's so delicious. I did not, however, use a 1/2 cup of the mushroom soaking water for the gravy, but I added another 1/2 cup of the chicken stock. I didn't have anything to really strain it with and I thought it might make the mushrooms just a little too pronounced. Other than that, I'm pretty sure I went by the recipe. My cream did curdle a little. I thought that it might since someone else mentioned it and because the sauce is acidic with the vinegar. It forgot to read up about this before I started, but after some reading tonight it seems that maybe my heat was too high. I would try to lower the pan temperature at the end next time to see what would happen. Nonetheless, I would HIGHLY recommend trying t"

"reviewBody": "Take care not to overdo the vinegar. A dry white wine may actually work better than the vinegar and I'll try that next time. It's definitely important to reduce the liquids by half, otherwise, it becomes a \"mushroom soup\" of thin broth. I did 3 whole tenderloins at once, though it's probably better not to or triple just because there's just so much liquid. It then becomes logistically complex, time wise, to reduce, and get it all in the oven. It worked out with persistence, and eventually, 16 guests enjoyed very delicious, tender roast beef tenderloin and lovely beef-porcini sauce with which to anoint their garlic mashed potatoes, to raving appreciation."

Thank goodness for Amazon, we were able to get everything we couldn’t get locally. Tenderloin, we were able to get from Costco. My husband watched the video and learned to trim the roast. This was one of the best things we have ever tasted. The sauce was spectacular. We made no changes to recipe at all.\nWe also served bernaise on the side. Try this, doubt if you will regret it!!"

"reviewBody": "Chef John’s method of cooking this cut of meat is awesome, and it really was fool proof. But I gotta say, the flavors of the porcini mushrooms and the tarragon vinegar and tarragon really overpowered this dish. Next time I’m going to substitute just regular mushrooms, add more chicken stock (instead of mushroom water), and use white wine in place of the tarragon vinegar. At the end I will add a little bit of parsley as opposed to fresh tarragon. All that aside - the meat was perfect. My tenderloin was 2.8 pounds. I seared it for 5-6 minutes per side and had it in the oven for exactly 45 mins. My thermometer read 130 - the meat was perfectly rare but not purple."

I used a top round and doubled the recipe...with 4 boys in the house we love leftovers. Also I wasn't able to get percini mushrooms so I used shitake. Nevertheless, it was delish and I would definitely recommend it. (It think the secret's in the vinegar. Lol.)"

Because it hits all the keys. It will turn a poor piece of meat into a decent meal and with a great piece of meat you have a restaurant quality meal. Add to that the ease and flexibility of the prep (I didn't have veal stock, no problem - still great). Would recommend and make again."

As everyone else has said, this is amazingly tender. \nI did find that my roast was past medium rare in 30 minutes (as opposed to the 45 suggested in the instructions), and I do have an oven thermometer, so just keep in mind the size and shape of your tenderloin, as this will influence the cooking time as well. It was still wonderful, so as long as you take into account your specific cut of meat, this is a fantastic recipe."

First, since I cooked a lot of bacon that morning I reserved the filtered grease from the bacon to sear the tenderloin. Next, since I couldn't easily get tarragon vinegar I used regular white wine vinegar. Also, no veal stock available so chicken stock it was. One hitch for me was that the shallots did not deglaze my pan as the video suggests so I added the vinegar just before the shallots were done. I served this with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and Chef John's asparagus, ham and lemon. Even the kids gobbled this up!"

As a side we had a scalloped potato dish and asparagus made with toasted almonds. \n\nI pulled it at 120 degrees and after the rest in came out as a perfect medium rare. The sauce was killer on this and I wouldn't change a thing. The funny thing is, this meal was even better the next day! I am tempted next time to make it a day ahead and then serve it. The flavors really infused into the meat and the sauce was even better.\n\nDo yourself a favor and just make it as intended. No need to get creative substituting this and that. You'll love it."

It adds a piquancy that blends perfectly with the shallots. The only thing I couldn't find was veal stock, so I used chicken stock instead. Chef John did the same thing in the video, which I encourage you to watch, too. Make sure you don't overcook the roast. The recipe calls for roasting in the oven for 45 minutes, but I took mine out of the oven after 35 minutes and let it rest for 15 minutes; it was perfect. This is another brilliant recipe from Chef John and it's easy to do, too. Definitely a special occasion dish due to the expense of the tenderloin roast but well worth the splurge. I cannot wait to make this again. Thank you Chef John - this was fantastic."

My company was raving days later that they had never had beef as delicious or tender and this was. I also didn't have tarragon vinegar so used white whine vinegar and couldn't find dried porchini mushrooms so used a combo of 3 kinds of mushrooms. I will find the correct ingredients next time. I had just sharpened all my knives and felt like a professional butcher following instructions for trimming and tying the roast. Took the roast out at 128 degrees, let it sit for 40 minutes tented....true perfection. Thank you so much Chef John!"

The second time I decided to follow the recipe exactly and it was even better. The beef is so tender and it absorbs the flavor all the way through the meat. I was curious as to the cost so I made my grocery trip specifically to pick up the ingredients, which came to around $65 total. I will do this again, probably for a special occasion meal."
