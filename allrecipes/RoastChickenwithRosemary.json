Put olive oil, kosher salt and ground pepper and chopped rosemary on the skin. I roasted breast side down for 30 minutes. then placed red and yukon gold potatoes, sweet potato, onion, carrots and garlic down and chicken back on veg base. used olive oil, salt and pepper over veg. used 14 ounces of chicken stock. I roasted 1 1/2 more hours covered, basting every 30 minutes. then additional 30 minutes uncovered. While chicken rested. I pulled out veg. and made gravy by heating juices and adding cornstarch slurry to thicken. Dear Hubby loved it. Next time, I will add more rosemary. I did not have the 1/4 cup recommended. I had 2 Tablespoons. WE love rosemary."

I added a garlic clove to the inside and oiled the outside of the chicken before salt and peppering. Cooked at 450 for 15 mins then reduced to 350 for the remaining time. I followed the 20 minutes per pound cooking rule and then let it rest for 20 mins and it was perfect."

The chicken gets double duty that way!\n\nThe only comment that I would make is that newer thinking based on studies suggest we should not be rinsing our chickens... doesn't really make them more sanitary, but it does through microscopic droplets of chicken juice everywhere in your kitchen. Instead just pat dry and cook."

A bit of rosemary that got on my potatoes &amp; carrots outside the bird was more flavorful. Maybe adding Rosemary to surrounding veggies yields greater results?"

"reviewBody": "I made this over the weekend- and it was AMAZING! I did use some of the extra ingredients that other reviewers have mentioned- such as using a little bit of olive oil and lemon juice along w the salt and pepper and rubbing down the chicken- the skin was wonderfully crispy and beautiful while the inside was so juicy! And I also added half a lemon into the cavity along with the onion and rosemary. I also roasted baby red potatoes on the bottom of the roasting pan which I just barely seasoned and drizzled a little olive oil over then- they came out delicious as well! I can't wait to make this again!"

"reviewBody": "I loved this recipe, but my wife thought there was way too much rosemary, and my dog wouldn't touch it. That may now seem germaine, but we feed our dog what we eat (less foods/spices that are taboo for dogs). Next time out, I'll use my own stuffing mix and include only 1 tsp rosemary and 1 tbsp tarragon; 4 slices of rosemary/olive bread, diced small; saute 1 sm onion, 1 stalk of celery and 4-5 cloves garlic (minced) until lightly brown, salt and pepper to taste; 1/4 apple, pealed and sliced thin. To this mix add 1/4 c beer (lager) and 1 shot of Jim Beam. If the mix needs more moisture, I add milk as needed. With these proportions, everyone in my family is happy and nothing is wasted but the bones. I love Italian food/recipes, but that was just outrageously over rosemaried for us."

"reviewBody": "This dish was delicious and succulent. I followed the recipe to the tee with the following exceptions. In addition to salt and pepper on top of the chicken, I also added a sprinkling of garlic salt and pepper. I also used a blend of fresh garlic, rosemary, thyme, and sage herbs to add inside the cavity of the bird, in addition to sweet onion. I followed other reviewers recommendations and placed fresh rosemary right under the skin of the chicken and added chicken broth to the bottom of the roasting dish. While roasting I basted the chicken every 25 - 30 minutes and also used an injector to further add flavor to the meat of the bird. I cooked it for about 1 1/2 hour and then an additional 30 minutes uncovered to brown the skin. Once done, the meat was so tender and nearly fell apart while carving. It was even more tasty the next day. I highly recommend!"

"reviewBody": "This chicken was exceptionally delicious, and very easy to prepare. It was done 'just right'. I added a bit of garlic powder &amp; some chopped parsley into the rub. I love rosemary, especially with chicken, so we loved the flavor. I roasted my chicken in the oven (on a rack over a sheet pan). I had a 5 lb. chicken, so I used my meat thermometer . I roasted the chicken until it reached an internal temperature of at least 155 degs. I then took it out of the oven and (loosly) tented it with aluminum foil (while I was mashing potatoes, and tending to my other side dishes). By 'resting' under the aluminum foil, my chicken reached the safe eating temperature of 165 deg. It was juicy &amp; delicious."

I did not have fresh rosemary so I used dried and only other change was I applied bits of butter on the skin which rendered the most delicious skin! The onion keeps the cavity so moist the meat fell from the bones and was delectable! I found letting the bird rest while covered was another good move! Can't wait to make the next one!
