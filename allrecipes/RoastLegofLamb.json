"reviewBody": "I love lamb! Used 5# boneless, seasoned night before. Beware, boneless can include a lot of gristle. Allow 60 min to bring to room temp &lt; cooking. Cooking time was WAY off; lamb should not be rare or pink or you'll chew forever. Cook to 150-160 F then rest (allow at least 2 hrs total). I started at 400 F for 30 min for a nice sear, then reduced to 350 F. Doesn't produce lot of drippings for gravy so I used packet of au jus powder + drippings (+ drippings from resting meat) + chicken stock; added flour till desired thickness. Mighty tasty meal with mint jelly, rice, broccoli. And dessert of gingerbread eggnog roll garnished with sugared cranberries."

The lava salt adds a really nice depth to the lamb. I did carrots and baby potatoes around the leg also. I wish I'd have thought about pear onions!! Oh, well, next time. This is a wonderful recipe!"

The lucky winner, yours truly, is given the honor of feeding the entire high school boys’ cross country team on the eve of their first practice of the new year. THESE. BOYS. CAN. EAT. But you already knew that. So, why not spoil these heroes of the track with the tastiest richest meat one can slow roast with potatoes AND carrots AND brussel sprouts, because these boys need a hearty helping of veggies to stay spry for the following morning. I assure you, every nook and cranny on these hunks of sacrificial flesh was STUFFED to the brim practically pulsing hunks of garlic and whole sprigs of rosemary. I don’t envy the boy at the end of the pack, because surely this group was sweating out some spicy smells over all those miles."

I had cut up lots of onions as suggested by the reviewer. I'll repeat her suggestions - 1 hour at 400 degrees to get a brown, then add two to three cups water and lower temp to 275, cover and roast for two and a half hours. Then I added one and a half onions cut in big slices and added to the pan for another half hour. I cut the meat from the bone and tucked it back into the pan with lots of juice and onions, for another half hour at 275 degrees. I'm not a big fan of lamb, but found this frozen leg of lamb in freezer and wanted to use it up. Made this way, I am a fan!!"

The Seasoning was very simple so i added some olive oil drizzled over and also used pressed garlic on the outside instead of inserting it in cavity's within. I flipped the Leg of lamb half way through to make sure it cooked evenly."

It was 25 mins per pound and 10 mins of tenting. I was amazed."

I recall her telling me that she always used just a little rub of white vinegar. Not sure it made that much of a difference, but this was pretty darn tasty! I roasted some potatoes, onions and garlic along with the lamb, and then served it with green beans. Made a great Sunday dinner!"

"reviewBody": "Simple and quick - my favorite kind! No prepping in advance. Here's a summary of my notes from various sources:\n\n- Remove lamb from fridge 1 hour before cook time to avoid hot and cold spots\n- Preheat oven 325 15 minutes before placing the lamb in\n- Consider a processor to chop garlic and rosemary before putting into lamb for better mouthfeel \n- Oil the lamb before coating it with salt and pepper\n- Add about 2+ cups water to the pan (lamb elevated) to catch the drippings for gravy, avoid smoke\n- Option: add potatoes or vegetables to roast on the side.\n\nRoast time depends on weight and preferred done-ness. \"Official\" USDA recommendations are geared to avoiding gastrointestinal mishaps and liability, so their numbers run high. Medium to medium rare seems to equate to internal temperature of 130-135 or 25-30 minutes per pound at 325. \n\nMine was boneless leg of lamb and next time, I'll undo the netting, put the processed garlic, rosemary and salt mixture into the meat and re-roll it and tie it with string. Why? For crispy skin in the last 15 minutes I raised the temp to 400 but the result was drier (grey) meat on the outside and lamb with a crust stuck in the netting. For me, 325 all the way~ or 300 over a longer period of time. \n\nThe rosemary and garlic are powerful and no marinating is necessary. You can add whatever additional flavor to the gravy afterwards - re"

The only negative with this recipe is that there is no cook time, which I think is pretty unhelpful if you are new to lamb. I cooked my lamb as I always do at 325 degrees for around 2 hours. I always add about an inch of water to the bottom of the pan, helps to keep it moist and makes excellent gravy!"

I made a gravy out of the drippings using chicken bouillon, cooking sherry to deglaze the pan, apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and pepper (used flour to thicken). It complemented the meat really well! I turned the leg halfway though. I also rubbed olive oil on the leg with the rosemary salt and pepper before baking, and added water to the bottom of the pan for the gravy.

We always take a small knife &amp; remove as much of the visible fat as possible. It is our belief that the only reason people serve mint jelly with lamb is to cut the greasy taste that comes from not trimming it. Also, people who say they don't like lamb have probably never had it cooked properly."

Turned out absolutely perfect and will be making my leg of lamb this way from now on. Great base recipe to give a beginner a good stepping stone! My one suggestion is to use a leave in digital leave in type thermometer that will measure as it cooks so that you get a perfectly cooked roast every time."

The slight changes I made were to rub olive oil on the lamb first and when I made the cuts to put the garlic in I also put some dried rosemary in the cuts as well. I took out of the oven at about 145 degrees on the thermometer and put foil over it for about 10 minutes. Then took off to slice. It raised another 10 degrees to 155 out of the oven. From the research I did you do not want lamb well done so I am not sure I would do it all the way up to 165-175. This was absolutely delicious and easy to make. Will definitely make again."
