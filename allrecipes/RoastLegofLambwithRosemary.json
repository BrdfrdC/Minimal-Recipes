Next time I think I would reduce or eliminate the honey."

I had a 3.5 pound leg of lamb, but made the full recipe for the marinade, which is for a 5-pound leg. The meat itself turned out perfectly cooked, but the marinade was way too strong. I think next time I'll leave out the balsamic vinegar and reduce the amount of marinade by about half. Lamb by itself has such great flavor that this marinade covered up. I'll make it again with these modifications."

"reviewBody": "Absolutely delicious! Didn't change the marinade (that would make it a different recipe) though I did use just a squirt of lemon juice rather than zest. Also had a deboned leg. Cooked for 20 minutes at 450° which created a beautiful crust and added 2 cups of water to the bottom of the roast pan. Reduced the heat to 350° and cooked until meat thermometer read 140° - a perfect medium - for about 1-1/2 hours without foil. I heated the pan drippings on the stove, whisking all the while and made a perfect gravy. I served with roasted garlic buttery whipped potatoes and turnip. Everyone loved the meal and we'll definitely have it again! While it makes a very impressive company meal, we just had it on an ordinary Saturday night. Felt very special. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!"

I followed the recipe exactly except I used a lamb shoulder instead of a leg. I waited until the temp was about 165 and it was perfectly pink for everyone’s taste. The drippings and resting juice was to die for when poured over the slices of meat. A wonderful recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Made this pretty much via the recipe. Technically, this came out perfectly. Flavor wise, I did not appreciate the sweetness. Would have preferred a simpler garlic and rosemary profile. \n\n I only had a very strong Buckwheat honey in the house, but picked my rosemary straight out of my pot, and let marinate overnight. I used a convection roast setting on my oven, so dropped each temperature by 25 degrees and cooked it to medium rare on the probe. I did NOT tent it as I like a bit of crust on my meat. Perhaps if I had adjusted with some balsamic as suggested in other comments - but as I have only a long aged (and hence sweet) balsamic on hand in these quarantined times, it would probably still have thrown me off. So easy to follow, technically perfect - but I'll go simpler and savory next time and skip the honey."

Super tender and I could taste it all; the rosemary, the Dijon, the garlic (and the ground fresh mint I added) that the long marinade infused subtly into the meat. It came out a gorgeous reddish tint with a fine crust/patina (ramped up the heat o 45 for the last 15 minutes). I WILL make this again and again.. totally worth adding some mint to the marinade and doubling the garlic."

"reviewBody": "I found this one of the best leg of lamb recipes that I have prepared. It is a big more complicated than the non-marinade versions, but it produces a very nice result.\n\nMy only major variations were that I added the juice of the lemon along with the lemon zest. I simply did not want to waste the lemon, and it seemed to work out well. I also used the minced garlic in a jar primarily because I already had that handy. My Dijon style mustard was Gray Poupon. And due to my work schedule, I started the marinade process the evening before, meaning that the leg of lamb essentially was marinaded 24 hours.\n\nMy leg of lamb was roughly 7 lbs, and the recommended cooking time was underestimated quite a bit. Instead of 50-60 minutes, it took me about 90 minutes or 1 bottle of malbec. Use a meat thermometer so that you can plan to have your sides ready when needed.\n\nI would recommend this recipe, and I would make it again. I would give it 4.5 stars if possible, primarily because of the cooking time estimate being a bit off, at least in my case."

By the time it had cooked at 450 for 20 minutes the marinade was completely evaporated/dry and starting to smoke. Thankfully I was able to pour about 2 cups of water in the roasting pan to slow the process and the meat didn't not pick up the scorched taste but the \"gravy\" was certainly scorched beyond using. Flavor of the meat was good but since I used a boneless leg of lamb it was very tough. Won't use boneless leg of lamb ever again because this has happened before."

I'd put some extra salt in and probably try to use a mixture of marinade and broth to make the gravy. Overall, very happy."

I put the oven on broil and seared my boneless leg on one side for 7 mins or so, then did same on other side. I then reduced heat to 325 and roasted to an internal temp of 135, then let rest for 15 mins. This resulted in a medium doneness. I did add water based on other reviews, 1 cup initially, and added as the water reduced. While the roast was resting, I made a sauce by adding red wine and thickening with a flour and water slurry. This was my first try with a lamb roast (I usually do chops), and I would definitely make this again. It was delicious!"
