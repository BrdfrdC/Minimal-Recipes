"reviewBody": "I bought a bunch of mini red &amp; yellow potatoes &amp; needed a decent side to go with baked salmon. Opted for this one, and it was okay. I’m not sure I would make as written again, though. I feel like it needs some altering. And that being: smaller crisps quicker &amp; larger is more hearty. Cut depending on who you are serving. These need more than 2Tbsp oil. I tossed in all dry seasonings, first. Then drizzled about 3Tbsp olive oil- placed in glass Pyrex 9x13 &amp; sprinkled w/ some Parmesan. At 20 minutes, they were barely heated through. I turned/tossed. Another 10 minutes was key, and that was when I added the sprinkle of extra Parmesan &amp; turned the oven off, but leaving the dish inside to mesh &amp; slowly cool. \n\nIt turned out very well! But, I do suggest modifying the spices to taste, and adding a bit more oil, otherwise you’ll end up with crispy but burnt if you don’t coat thoroughly. These were really good &amp; easy, but I would like to play around with the flavor &amp; cooking method a bit more than as written."

Didn’t have tin foil so used parchment paper soooo much better and dried them up with paper towels before seasoning. I didn’t have to turn them half way. Super moist inside crispy outside. I baked them for 30 min at 425. Perfect compliment with chicken, fresh tomatoes and cucumber and let’s not forget home made tzatsiki sauce. Yummy"

Just chopped up some red potatoes, tossed everything into a ziploc, and put them on an aluminum lined pan. Someone recommended NOT to grease the pan in order to get them crispy... so I didn’t. When I flipped them over, they all stuck to the liner! I felt like a dunce lol ALWAYS grease your pans if you’re cooking something like this. If your potatoes don’t come out crispy, I’d recommend turning up the heat in the last 3-5 minutes, and/or making sure every bit is coated in enough oil."

I am not permitted to have salt, so I substituted the salt for 1/2 tsp of Nu-Salt (potassium chloride instead of sodium chloride). I like my potatoes a little crispier so I put them back in the oven for an additional 8 minutes. One of the best dishes I have ever made.

Mine weren’t an even layer so I had to add an extra 10 min or so cook time. Topped them with a little sour cream (and chives next time) and they were an awesome side dish for our steak dinner tonight. Highly recommend. And sooooo easy. Ty:)."

I used the Bermuda onions to use up some left over I had and they tasted great. Used Olive oil to coat them and used a dark baking pan. I had to turn the temperature down to accommodate the baked chicken I cooked at the same time. I used 350 degrees for 25 minutes. The red potatoes browned nicely without burning the carrots and onions (well onions were a little bit too brown). They tasted great and the recipe is so simple!"

"reviewBody": "These were pretty good. I was out of rosemary, so I substituted tarragon, which isn't comparable in flavor but is still tasty. I also added a light sprinkling of cayenne pepper and a lot of garlic powder because I can't leave well enough alone. :-) The only major change I made was to roast the potatoes another ten minutes or so to make them extra crispy. It might have been due to the fact that I was using a skillet in the oven instead of a thinner roasting pan that the potatoes didn't get as crispy as I wanted after 20 minutes, but I would say, if the potatoes aren't as crispy as you like after 20 minutes, don't be afraid to leave them in for a few more minutes. Thanks for the recipe! I was looking for nice roasted potatoes with minimal fuss, and this fit the bill."

"reviewBody": "I took the advice of another review and added 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and sprinkled on some parmesan cheese. I think it made it much better than if I had made the recipe as stated. The garlic powder and parmesan were the dominating flavors and made it taste great. We baked it at 450 for 20 minutes as the recipe said, but the potatoes were not cooked at that point (I cut them into roughly 1 and 1/2 inch cubes). I had to turn down the heat to 400, as they were starting to stick to my baking sheet, and let them cook another 10 minutes. They came out perfectly though. I think this recipe on its own would be okay, but you need to tweak it to get a 5 star dish, therefore I'm only giving it 4 stars. Plus the cooking times vary dramatically from review to review, so know your oven and keep a watch on them so you don't over or under cook."
