Any hardware or gardening store carries them. My goodness, they made short work of what I thought would be time consuming, difficult and laborious. When I first read this recipe I was worried that it would come out dry. I needn’t have worried, this recipe was wonderful! A deceptively simple recipe that is packed with great flavor.. Compared to traditional turkey roasting, the bird cooked MUCH more quickly. Our 2021 spatchcocked turkey was moist and so delicious. Now it’s 2022 and I’m here to view the recipe so I don’t forget any ingredients when I make it again for 2022."

I had to explain it to him (remove the backbone) even though he said he’s been a butcher 30 years. There wasn’t any charge to have him do it... and saved me the effort!

I did leave my turkey uncovered in the fridge the day of, so the skin could dry out a bit and get crispier in the oven. It was easier to carve and was evenly cooked throughout. I only used half the oil on the bird and it was plenty. I think if my bird had been any bigger it may not have fit in my pan, which is a longer than regular roasting pan. I will be cooking every Thanksgiving turkey in this way from now on. And I think I will be grilling chicken next summer the same way!"

Pan drippings were great for gravy. When I split the turkey I cut off the bottom two sections of the wings and used them along with the backbone, neck and giblets to make stock. I roasted the bird on a rack on a shallow pan so the air could circulate all around it and I did rotate the pan every 30 minutes."

I needn't have worried, though because \"butterflied\" is the only way I'll be cooking Thanksgiving Turkey henceforth! Our bird was given to us, so it was 1/3 larger than the recipe called for--no problem! Cooking time seas easily adjusted, and, 2 hours later (no, REALLY!) We were crunching into the crispiest -skinned turkey imaginable. \nAt first, locating the backbone was tricky, but I peeked INSIDE the body/neck cavities for verification. After that, it was smooth sailing."

"reviewBody": "Excellent recipe!!! And so easy! The only thing I would suggest is anything over 10 or 12 lbs that you use a roasting pan. I cooked a 16 lb turkey and the baking sheet couldn’t contain the drippings and spattering. So I used an aluminum rectangular roasting pan. I just increased the time by half. In other words I cooked mine for a total of about 2 hours. I also used the convention bake option and that browned my turkey automatically. Great recipe! I will used it again!"

"reviewBody": "I had a 27lb turkey so split it in half and did half in the oven and half in the Traeger. Both were good and fairly moist. The Traeger took longer, by about half hour. The oven turned out a crisper finish on the skin. Will certainly do it again."

"reviewBody": "I brine my turkey each year. This year I've heard more and more about spatchcocking your turkey than any other year. I'm glad I found this recipe. Sounds simple enough. Though...being me...I'm debating right now whether or not I will spatchcock it before or after brining. I'm about ready to flip a coin to decide. Oh ...and yes it is after Thanksgiving....I usually only bring an appetizer or desert and then cook the full meal for my husband and I the weekend after."

"reviewBody": "I love making a turkey this way! I place my turkey on a bed of thickly sliced onions and celery placed on the bottom of the baking sheet instead of on a rack. I also add just a bit of chicken broth to the pan. This not only imparts a bit of flavor but it also keeps the pan moist and eliminates any burning or smoking from the pan drying out during cooking time."

"reviewBody": "Two thanksgivings in a row now and I am so happy with the results. I had to wrestle a little bit to get the backbone out but it's worth it. Juicy white meat that the family raved about. And because it roast so much more quickly than a whole bird, I had plenty of time to pull it out to rest, then bake stuffing, etc. \"Best turkey ever,\" said my guests. You really must try this!"
