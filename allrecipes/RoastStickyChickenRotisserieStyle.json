Stuffed the cavities with onion , garlic cloves and celery and cooked breast down in an aluminum roaster pan. 5 hours at 250 was just perfect for what I had. Oh my goodness, did this turn out wonderfully! Fell right off the bone with amazing flavor. There was plenty for dinner and lots left over to freeze for future meals as it’s just me and hubby. Got almost a quart of super rich broth that I froze as well. This is definitely a plan-ahead dish but well worth it!"

My next purchase is a good wireless meat thermometer so I can keep an eye on the temp of smaller chickens"

I have on occasion deviated from the spices ie 'a lemon pepper chicken' or upping a spice, or leaving out a spice, but the posted spice combinations is still the winner and well worth sticking to it. (no pun intended). At the end of the cook time, I switch to broil, on high, and watch it till the skin on the ckicken begins to smoke and then I pull it out with nice brown crispy skin."

"reviewBody": "ok .. saw this recipe thought it looked super good and was worth giving a shot. boy am I glad I did. this is the most amazing chicken I have ever had, store bought rotisserie included. the seasoning is perfect and it came out so juicy and tender. I did baste it about every 45 minutes or so to prevent the skin from getting crisp and to keep it moist. mine took about an hour longer than the recipe states because I opted for one larger chicken rather than two smaller ones. I also didn't have the white pepper, thyme or cayenne. next time I will probably see how it is with those but I think it was incredible without. also the drippings make the most flavorful gravy, seriously it's amazing. \nSide note: the recipe doesn't state this, I'm sure most people making this recipe already know but some may not, make sure you put about an inch of water in your roasting pan because otherwise your chicken is going to dry out. and I definitely recommend basting."

I love this recipe and so does my family!! like a lot of other reviewers, I made this seasoning in a big batch so I can quickly prep and throw the chicken in the fridge the night before I want to cook it, then throw it in the oven a few hours before serving dinner. Over the next couple days after making 1 chicken, we still have plenty left over to use in tacos, enchiladas, chicken salad, so many possibilities and very little effort/time needed. Also cost effective! In my area, while chickens are about $1 a pound."

"reviewBody": "Delicious! I used two young chickens, both were a little over 5lbs. Make sure you pat the chicken dry if you want crispy skin. I made the recipe exactly as written only I separated the skin from the breast and shoved tabs of butter between the skin and the meat. Doing this helps breast meat stay moist, I do it whenever I roast a turkey too. Sometimes I use a seasoned butter mixture for added flavor...anyways, then I liberally sprinkled my seasoning mixture all over my birds, shoved some onions inside them and put them in my fridge for like 5 hours...then into my oven uncovered at 250...4-5 hours later and BAM, delicious super moist flavorful chicken. I’m happy I kept the cayenne pepper the same.. it just gave it the slightest heat without really being noticeable. YUM."

I see some reviews were saying 5 hours is too long but for me it was accurate and I was cooking one chicken. I also was checking the temperature after 2 1/2 hours and then again around 4 hours. So each person's oven varies and you do what is best for your oven. Use the 5 hours as a gage as to how long you should roast it in the oven. And I am glad to see I can rotisserie a chicken when I want to. Thank you."

Both chickens were perfectly roasted and very moist. I shred one chicken and froze the shredded meat for future meals. Served with some roasted root veggies and it was a very nice dinner on a cold night!"

I did make alterations- I took the advice to leave out white pepper, half the cayenne and paprika (I have a kid that doesn’t like too much spice), and do a full tsp of garlic powder. I also did chicken breast instead and marinated everything with a can of chicken broth over night. Baked the breasts at 350* for 30 minutes. I will definitely be making this again and again and again!"

In a pinch once i roasted the bird without letting it sit overnight and it wasnt nearly as good and flavorful. the drippings from this make the best gravy, I use the fat to make a rue then add the juice topped up to 2 cups and a splash of wine. soooooo good! thanks for this recipe. it's a staple in our fall/winter meals."

Today I put a few pats of cold butter under the skin and basted it with the pan juices. A definite improvement, although I've yet to think its anything like rotisserie chicken. I will continue to make it again, but I think I'll try some sage in place of some of the thyme. Also, I made a gravy from pan drippings. Those drippings have a lot of good flavoring."

Starting off on high heat for 10 minutes, I turned the grill burners to low, put an aluminum foil \"boat\" to catch the juices. I let it go 2 hours like this until the internal temp hit between 160 and 180.\n\nThe chicken was pull apart tender, though strictly speaking, that was the result of a 4 hour brine; no-brine=dry chicken; brine=incredibly juicy chicken. But I liked this recipe. I'll try it again with a few minor modifications to suit my own tastes."

Like one reviewer said she added minced garlic, I did also, to the inside cavity and also all over the outside because we love garlic. Overall the flavor was good and the meat was juicy and fall apart tender. Just wish the skin wasn’t so dry and tough."

Shoved the onion and some garlic cloves into the chicken. Used the spice to give it a good COMPLETE rub covering. Slow roast at 250. Wow!!! This was great. Nice and crispy and flavorful. Cooked breast side up until the last hour. Emptied most of the juice for gravy and turned over. Be careful of over cooking . Also I didn't need to use all the seasoning to get a good coating. Definitely a MAKE AGAIN!!"

Marinated 20 hours in the fridge prior to cooking. Chicken only took 4 hours to reach proper temperature. Let it rest 1/2 hour while I made mashed potatoes to go with it. The chicken texture was fine, but the flavor was so bland, it was like I had never marinated it at all. Pretty disappointed. P.S. It tasted nothing like rotisserie chicken."

"reviewBody": "First, and most important, you do not cook poultry for a set amount of time, you cook until an internal temperature is reached. With this recipe, 180 degrees fahrenheit. I have used an inexpensive Acurite model 00993ST for years. $25.00. Or, google \"Best digital meat thermometers\" and pick your own. Second, your oven temperature. I would make a bet I think is safe that most ovens are not within 20 degrees of what you set it at. I used my Thermoworks IR-GUN-S laser infrared thermometer to check my oven.($33.00) A word about oven thermometers. The mercury bulb type are almost impossible to read. The round bi-metal stripe type are wildly inaccurate. Put an empty small ceramic dish, like a ramekin, in the oven, and put on 250 degrees. Aim the laser on it. Mine settled on 220 . So I had to set it on 280 in order to get 250. (As you can probably tell by now, I take my cooking very seriously) For my 4+ pound chicken, it took 3hrs 45min to come to 180 degrees. NOT 5 hours. It turned out great, but would have been like shoe leather after 5 hours.\n\nI have learned over the years to treat recipes as inspirational guidelines, not gospel. Happy Cooking."
