"reviewBody": "I made this with just olive oil, sea salt and cracked pepper at 350 degrees and it was THE BOMB. It got gobbled up before I even finished making the rest of our dinner!! The only thing is, it took much less time for some reason, about ten minutes. I would have cooked them for longer, but they started to pop and jump around in my oven haha! Definitely a win though, and they are pretty filling. I would imagine that this is a pretty good snack food for hiking trips etc., if you can keep hungry family members from snatching it all up before you pack it, of course ?? great way to save money and reduce food waste."
