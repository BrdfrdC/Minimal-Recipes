"reviewBody": "Note that I made this from the printed recipe in the Aug/Sept 2022 Allrecipes magazine. It is slightly different from the on- line recipe. I made it as printed. We really enjoyed this recipe. I did use a rotisserie chicken since I had some already chopped up. I had bought 2 at Costco, stripped them, chopped the meat, and then frozen the chopped meat. I used all 7 cups of the broth but it was more like 30 minutes for it to absorb. The printed version called for 2-1/2 cups of onions, which is more like 2 onions rather than the 1 onion called for on-line. I think it definitely needs the 2-1/2 cups. The 1/4 c. balsamic and 1/4 c. wine were just right- not too overpowering. Fresh thyme from my garden was perfect. This is simple to make, but like any risotto takes a little time. I prepped the onion chicken mix earlier in the day so the final prep was easy. Printed version called for carmelizing the onions for 18-20 min. rather than 15. Next time I would add garlic. My husband said he will gladly eat the left-overs tomorrow."

The rice should be creamy, not al dente. I used half as much balsamic vinegar (2 tbsp) and rotisserie chicken. I never needed to add additional salt even though I used low-sodium broth, and the lemon thyme I had on hand added an AMAZING accent flavor."

I added some parmesan cheese and a dash of cream because I thought it lacked the creaminess that risotto is known for. i also made it in the pressure cooker. learn how to make any risotto recipe in the pressure cooker by reading the cook's notes from the recipe on this site called saffron risotto in the pressure cooker. BTW, that recipe is awesome please go give it a try and a good review!"

I added 2 cloves garlic, used 6 cups vs 7 (because that's the box size I had and others said it would work), and cut balsamic vinegar in half. I probably would have enjoyed the 1/4 cup of vinegar, but my hubby ins't as big on vinegar flavoring. He had 2 huge servings of this and requested we have it more often. Highly recommend!"

"reviewBody": "OMG! Magnificent! This is, hands down, the best chicken dish I've ever made, and the whole family loved it! My changes were slight and not by choice. Circumstances dictated that my onions were caramelized and chicken breasts were roasted and shredded a day ahead. However, I had to make some fresh onions the next night, as my husband had to have some of the first batch. The third change was that I only had 3 cans of chicken broth, so just shy of 6 cups, but upped the wine to 1/2 c. or so. Whether any of that made any real difference, I can't say. But the result didn't lie! It was nice to have those ready ahead, though. On dinner night, I basically just sipped wine while pouring and stirring broth. That's relaxing dinner prep!"

"reviewBody": "Great recipe! I only used 5 1/2 cups of stock, 7 cups would have been soupy. To those who complained about it being gooey, risotto is a moist dish, not dry like steamed or boiled rice. It did take a bit longer to cook, closer to 30 minutes but a good risotto can’t be rushed. Also your stock should be kept at a simmer while you use it. As for the complaints about the balsamic, a good balsamic doesn’t taste strongly of vinegar, it’s sweeter and more like a good wine so we enjoyed the tang it added to the dish."

As for everything else, this is the perfect recipe to maximize consumption of leftovers to prevent food waste. Just with that, I have plenty a powerful reasons to make this again and again. I only had at the moment dried thyme, so I used 1 tsp and it was perfect with a bit more of an earthy flavor, just as good!"

However, if you are making anything beyond basic, it will take longer. I only use arborio rice (the easiest to find in the U.S., Italian short rice) when making my risottos, and it is the slow release of starch from the rice and the addition of butter at the end of cooking, which makes your risotto creamy. However, if you cook beyond the point of al dente, you will have a gooey feel in your mouth. It is all about the heat setting and, of course, ensuring proper and complete mise en place!"

Next time I will chop it up before adding it. Agree with other reviews. Next time I will use 2 onions. I sautéed one onion with garlic and used only 1 tablespoon of balsamic. I never made risotto before but I followed the directions and it turned out great. I heated up 5 cups of chicken bone broth and slowly added it to the rice. The trick is frequent stirring and adding only 1 cup or 1 ladle at a time. It took me about 25 minutes or so before the rice was done. I normally used dried herbs and I am glad I bought fresh thyme for presentation purposes. I also sautéed some mushrooms on the side and added this at the end (kids don’t like them but hubby and I do!). I topped it with shaved Parmesan and thyme. Perfect dish for left over chicken!"

I followed the recipe, but added mushrooms (baby portabello) and diced sauteed garlic--just threw them in the empty pan after the onions were done cooking and left it on medium low, stirring occasionally. About halfway through cooking the risotto, I added the cooked chicken to the mushrooms and garlic to warm it up. I also made 2 cups of rice instead of 1.5, to help balance all the extra ingredients. My whole family loved it and asked me to make it again! It has wonderful warm, complex flavors and is easy to make, although you are at the stove the whole time.\n\nGoing on our favorites list for sure."

"reviewBody": "I tried this recipe as written. However I like mine 10 star more. I use dry vermouth instead of wine matter of choice. I caramelize the onions remove set aside, in same skillet add 1-2 Tbsps. butter if available fresh chopped shitake, baby portabellas, oyster mushrooms and crimini, a combination of mushrooms is best, sauté when soft and cooked to liking, combine with the caramelized onion reserve for later. There should be enough butter/olive oil no need to add additional, didn't care for the balsamic vinegar so I omitted it. Stir in rice as instructed then add vermouth or white wine, until absorbed then begin adding broth 1 cup at a time until your risotto is done to your liking. It always amazes me how anyone can cook risotto in 20 minutes mine is always at least 30-45 minutes. You need to stay with this adding more broth as it absorbs. When done add the mushroom/onions stir in salt and pepper to taste. I also use fresh grated parmesan and I prefer parsley to thyme. I know I completely changed this up just though I would share my version"

I took to heart other reviewers thoughts about the balsamic being too much and halved it to only 2 tbs, instead of the 1/4c it calls for. Also, I used the stock from the previous night's roasted chicken, and added some chicken bouillon to it for flavor. In addition, I probably used closer to 3 cups of chicken, as it's what I had leftover. The result? Oh.em.gee. It was wonderful! I've never made a rissotto before, and I'm feeling pretty impressed with myself over it. One note: I did make sure the wine AND the stock were fairly hot when I added it to the rice mix, and it took far longer than 20 minutes for it all to absorb--\"20 minutes\" was much more like \"one hour\". But no matter--I'll be making it again, for sure!"

Without them, I could see this being way too heavy. Good balance, good texture. This is one of the few recipes I follow exactly every time! I have substituted basil for thyme depending on what I have on hand and it works very well, too."

"reviewBody": "Delicious.\r\n\r\nHere's how to roast the chicken (I used three smaller boneless/skinless breasts): Just pour a small amount of olive oil (other oil probably would work) in a casserole dish. Take the breasts and put them in the casserole dish and then turn them over so they have a thin coating of oil on both sides. Then just put a little salt and pepper and put in the oven for 25 minutes at 350 degrees if small breasts or 30 minutes at 350 if larger. Alow breasts to rest about ten minutes and then cut into small strips or cubes. And that's it.\r\n\r\nYou can actually cook the onions and the risotto at the same time. So I had the onions carmelizing on one burner, the risotto simmering on a second one and then the chicken stock/broth simmering on the third so it was hot to stir in. \r\n\r\nOnce done, I did mix in a little parmesan cheese in addition to the butter is calls for.\r\n\r\nServed with a ceasar salad. Really, really good. I'll definitely make it again. Leftovers were delicious too.\r\n\r\nThanks for the recipe. It's a keeper."

The chicken needs to be seasoned or it will be very bland against the rice. We sauteed small cubes with some salt, pepper, garlic powder, and thyme and that went very well with the other flavors already in the dish. Rice definitely takes longer than 20 minutes to absorb- plan on a good 45 for a real slow-cooked risotto. We also added a couple of cloves of pressed garlic to the onion mixture and chopped the onions very small so as not to have too much crunch in the texture of the rice, but that's just a matter of preference. Overall, nice flavors- just takes a while!"

The 20 minutes to stated for broth to be absorbed took nearly an hour. Heating the broth before adding (and re-heating between pours) helps the absorption speed a bit. If you have the time, it's worth it. -- I have to add that the thyme is really a great garnish for this!"

The only thing I did different was when I was done cooking the onion I deglazed the pan with white wine and cooked the chicken in it and sliced it into small pieces and it was really good cause all I had was boneless on hand. Excellent dish Michele"

"reviewBody": "It was ok. I didn't have Risotto, and our store didn't carry it so I had to substitute it with brown rice. It had great flavor, I added some garlic to the rice while it was cooking just because every review said it need some help on flavor. I also did what others did with cutting down on the balsamic vinegar, I just sprinkled a little on the onions and mushrooms (also what reviews advised) and tossed. I liked it, but it wasn't like awesome or anything. Nothing to rave too much about, but was good enough to eat and not have to use the backup pizza for (haha)."

"reviewBody": "We followed the recipe pretty close and felt like it was good but needed something. Like possibly bacon...ha. I know, bacon makes ANYTHING good. But for all the time it took (a good hour and a half) we didn't feel it was worth the time. Couple things we would change: add into the actual recipe part a step to heat the broth before adding because we totally forgot to heat it before adding. Not a huge deal but I think it would have cooked much faster. Also we felt 2 Tbsp thyme was too much. It was definitely creamy though and we just cooked the chicken in the same pan after the onion mixture so maybe if we had gotten a rotisserie it would have added to the overall flavor."
