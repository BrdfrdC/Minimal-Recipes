"reviewBody": "Excellent! The leeks were buttery-melt-in-you-mouth and the outsides were crispy. I want this again tonight already. Didn’t use all of the lemon butter or oil and it was still delicious - would probably use the full amount for guests. Also we don’t use a microwave so I just melted the butter in a pot, which kept it warm and ready to top the leeks with. Great intro to roasted leeks, thanks!"
