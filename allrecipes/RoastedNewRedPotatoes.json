I put both the potatoes and onions in a bowl, drizzled olive oil and sprinkled garlic powder, black pepper and salt over them. Tossed them a bit and then added more of the oil and seasonings before tossing them again. I them layered them on a cookie sheet that was lined with foil and sprayed with butter spray. I then sprinkled alittle seasoning and garlic salt before baking it for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, I moved around the potatoes and onions to make sure they weren't sticking and then I baked for an additional 15 minutes. I then covered it with shredded parmesian cheese and let it sit in the (turned off) oven for a few minutes. Very yummy!"

Then I stirred again after 20 minutes, and they were beginning to stick - by the end of the cooking time, every potato touching the bottom of the dish was stuck and had to be pried off, leaving the best part of the potato - the crispy part. I read through several reviews and saw no mention of this issue. If there's a solution, I'd love to try this dish again."

I added kosher salt instead of regular and just mixed a bit of italian seasoning and garlic powder with fresh ground pepper into the olive oil. Tossed it all around in a bowl and got the potatoes nicely coated. The hot oven made them deliciously crisp on the outside and nice and soft and fluffy on the inside. I added some bits of onion during the last ten minutes and the flavor was amazing! My guys gave it rave reviews!"

I cut the potatoes in half and followed the original recipe, using ground salt and ground peppercorns, and also adding garlic powder to the mix. They took about a half an hour to roast and came out to perfection. Here is my tip: nest a big baking pan inside of another baking pan. This creates an air baking effect, keeps the potatoes from sticking or burning, and makes cleanup easy."

We actually quartered the larger red potatoes, halved the smaller ones, added lots of crushed garlic, about 5 large cloves, and about 3 TBSP of fresh, chopped rosemary. We let the potatoes marinate for about an hour before baking and we turned them carefully a couple of times during baking."

I cut my potatoes in eights. In addition to the olive oil, salt and pepper, I added minced garlic, minced dried onions, sprinkle of mestique, garlic powder, Thyme, and red pepper flakes. Some members suggested Rosemary. I tried it, but didn't like it. I'm really not a fan of Rosemary. With the much needed spices, it tasted good."

I only need about 1Tablespoon of olive oil to cover with a couple of pinches of kosher salt and enough freshly ground black pepper to taste. I have added granulated CA style garlic powder (a couple of shakes) so far. My husband has declared that these are by far his favorite way to enjoy red potatoes. A definite keeper."

As always, I look through the comments and ratings to see what others thought and how they adapted the recipe for themselves and I fully agree with several other posters to add the garlic, oregano, thyme and onion. However, I personally would put the onions in for the last 15 minutes as I would’ve liked to have had them soften up a bit more. Everyone in my home loved it, all three of my boys, my husband and myself... and we can sometimes be a tough crowd. I’ll definitely be making this again!"
