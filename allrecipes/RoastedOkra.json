Mixed olive oil, black pepper, Sriracha salt, old bay, minced garlic, onion flakes in a small bowl and spooned over okra and turned over gently. Spread on foil and sprinkled with grated Parmesan cheese. Cooked about 25 min till lightly brown and okra starts to get a lil’ wrinkly like my skin. Turned off the oven and let it stand in hot oven while pan frying ham steak. Served with black eyed peas. Okra was very zesty, firm, not slimy and definitely a keeper. This recipe can be altered a bazillion ways . No picture; got lost in the moment."

Probably no more than a 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. Can substitute almost any spice for the salt/pepper. I frequently use a cajun-style seasoning on mine."

"reviewBody": "Wonderful! Nice alternative to fried okra which is a staple here in the south. I have made this many times, the first several I followed exactly. Turned out fantastic. Since I have experimented and found it work well with larger pieces up to 1/2 inch. Works best with large okra. Never cook okra if it’s hard and woody, but the more tender large ones work well at 1/3”. Smaller okra including the very small most tender work at 1/2”\nOr a little more. \n\nI have also experimented with the seasoning. A little salt and some Cajun seasoning like Tony’s (Cacheres) is our favorite. Season salt was good but we enjoyed a little heat from the Tony’s. Tony’s is good on everything!\n\nYou also have to experiment with your oven and temp. Mine seems to come out better closer to the element and at 450° rather than 435°. \n\nGood recipe."

"reviewBody": "Nope. Not for me. Cannot compare to fried. I don't fry my okra in a deep fryer and I don't use a wet batter. I cut in circles into a colander, wash, then sift salt and pepper and stone ground corn meal through the okra in the colander. Makes a bit of a mess in the sink, but makes the okra lightly battered, not that heavy mess like frozen okra. Then I fry a level spread of the okra in a half inch of hot oil inside a heavy skillet. Nothing else comes close to the delicious crispy texture of okra done this way."

Of course, I ate all I had (so much for servings). Just a note, the okra I bought was soooo fresh, pods about 3-4 inch long, a big, heaping handful. I rinsed, cut into 1/2 inch pieces, put all in a zip-lock bag, then did the oil, salt, pepper thing (saved a mess). Tossed them up to evenly coat. Did the aluminum foil on the baking pan (mess saver). I only cooked mine for 16 min. Wasn’t crispy, so could have probably cooked 2 minutes more or so. Even though soft but cooked, flavor was awesome. Take it easy on the salt. NOT SLIMY. Definitely going to run out and buy some more. Totally enjoyable. Thank you ncope for a great recipe."

The recipe calls for 2 tsp. Even the 1 tsp. is too much. Next time, I will start with about 1/4 tsp. pepper and a higher temperature so that they crisp up a little better. This is merely the beginning!"

Make sure you slice them exactly half an inch to 3/4 of an inch... any bigger and they are not roasted properly. I increased my roasting time to 30 minutes and roasted them at 430°. I used a very little bit of cayenne pepper to give it an extra sassy kick! Next time I plan to add a tablespoon of lemon juice pre cook. Oh, and I put the oil, salt and pepper in a gallon ziplock to evenly coat. I didn't use foil but Pam on cookie sheet and they came out great. Definitely a fabulous recipe"

I couldn't imagine TWO teaspoons of salt &amp; pepper on that small amount of food, so I slashed it over HALF (1 scant tsp) and it was still WAAAAAY too salty (and I *love* salt), although the pepper had a nice bite at 1 tsp. so I'll leave that. \n\nBut on the next one, I'm using 1/2 tsp. of salt. Yikes. \n\nBUT, with that said: this recipe is now my very favorite way of eating okra. More than battered &amp; fried, more than gumbo, and more than stewed with tomatoes! It's amazing."
