Simmer in lightly salted water with a TBS of butter until all water has evaporated. This concentrates the salt. Stir in a couple TBS more butter and spread out on 2 pans. It does take longer than times listed, but the results are crisp, and delicious. I went with simple seasoning. Yum! Thanks!!"

Added all the seasonings into the melted butter first then tossed them into the pumpkin seeds and cooked on the top rack. Absolutely addictive, taste like candy!!"

"reviewBody": "To compliment a few other posts, it's a real good idea to boil the seeds first in a salt water solution to incorporate salt into the seeds. Also, I've found that rinsing the seeds/guts in cold water prevents them from getting too soggy prior to putting them into saltwater. Lastly, allowing them to partially air dry on a towel before baking can shorten cook time (@ 250°) and can make them a little crispier when done."

I’m way too lazy and impatient to do that but I have another tip that worked out very well. I took my kosher salt and blitzed it in my nutribullet to make it a fine powder and the result was excellent. Definitely blend up more than you need as it’s tough to collect the powder then toss it in a bowl with the butter or oil to ensure it’s equally distributed and the result was excellent and well seasoned. An old restaurant trick someone taught me."

"reviewBody": "This is the simplest recipe for someone just starting out. I've been roasting seeds for years and my favorite is this: gut the pumpkin and separate the seeds. Rinse and then soak the seeds in salt water over night up to 24 hours, then I lay them out on parchment paper and paper towels to dry, typically overnight to 24 hours. I then take them off the paper towels and spread them out on the parchment paper to continue drying. Once I'm happy with how dry the seeds are I then follow the above recipe. I suggest roasting the seeds in multiple batches to prevent them from being under cooked or potentially burning. I do this in multiple batches depending how many pumpkins I have. My way is not hard, it just takes several days to do a batch, but they come out perfect every time."
