I kept it simple as I had many other flavours within the Christmas lunch. I cut the skin and simply melted the butter, basted the turkey leg and added lots of salt and pepper and it crisped up beautifully. Cheers!"

Why do the celery sticks before every other step? celery keeps falling out. I finally melted the butter and gave up on buttering and salting under skin. This is a poor recipe for beginners. Hope it tastes better than making it was. make what should have been easy into a very frustrating experience."

I used salt-free seasoning (because I liked the herbs in it) but did add salt to the legs, as well. I used chicken broth in place of the water and had to add more about half-way through because it was drying out. I covered loosely with foil for the first 45 min and baked another hour, turning once. I would have liked them a little crispier, so I'd turn the oven to 400degF for maybe the last 30-45 min. These were OK. I may make soup or turkey salad with the remainder."

I rubbed fresh sage and various herbs into the butter, which went under and above the skin, and followed various advice from other reviewers here. And they came out crisp on the outside, and juicy and flavorful on the inside. I added simple gravy on using a bouillon cube based recipe, and soaked some extra sage in there, and added in some canned mushrooms. Delicious meal that I will make again! Yum. \n\nOh and most of my modifications were based off of this particularly useful review: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/84456/roasted-turkey-legs/reviews/1578810/"

Sat it on a few celery stocks and broth and slow roasted at 325 for 3 hrs. basting every so often. Surrounded it with red potatoes and asparagus the last hour till both were tender. The skin was to die for and the flavor permeated throughout the meat and making it tender also. For in the middle of the week dinner it was just wonderful for us.

"reviewBody": "I too put in brine (Boiled water with salt, so the salt will dissolve, bay leaves and some vinegar). I did that before finding this recipe. Added salt, pepper, Thyme, Paprika, a little olive oil and garlic. Rubbed. I put Basil in the pan, not on the Leg. I added a little chicken stock in the pan. Covered loosely for 1-1.5 hours at 400 degrees. Took out of over and let sit. Very good! and moist!"

"reviewBody": "Great recipe. I made a few changes, though. 1: I added thyme, rosemary, parsley, cayenne pepper, and red pepper flakes to the butter and made a rub I put under the skin and all over each leg 2: I punctured a whole in each leg near the bone and put a half clove of garlic and a roughly cut cippolini onion in 3: I added baby red potatoes, carrots, celery and onions all around the legs and used the remaining butter mixutre to coat each 4: I put a cup of chicken broth over everything. I cooked uncovered like the directions ask, but I turned up the oven to 375 to get them more crispy. They came out juicy and delicious and I didn't need gravy as the juices at the bottom of the pan were gravy enough. Definitely will make this recipe again!"

My only recommendation is to make sure the turkey legs are moderate in size, I made it once with huge legs and it wasn't nearly as good. I also add some onion in with the celery and don't use as much butter. This has become a favorite in our house."

Then instead of salt, I used the \"dry rub for all occasions\" (see recipe - http://allrecipes.com/recipe/dry-rub-for-all-occasions/detail.aspx) and instead of water I used chicken broth. The meat was tender and juicy, the outside was browned really well and the taste was OMG!!! My sons (who are my biggest critics) loved them. Will be using this recipe over and over."

"reviewBody": "Use a variation of this recipe, time and time again. I usually have to refer to this for the baking temperature. I foil-line a cookie sheet and rinse the turkey legs off and pat dry. I melt a little butter in a bowl in the microwave and brush it all over the legs and swipe some on the foil to prevent sticking. I then salt the legs, sprinkle thyme, then pepper them lightly, flip to the other side and repeat, reapplying the butter if it looks like it needs it. We prefer thyme on our turkey as opposed to other herbs like rosemary, as it can overpower the taste sometimes and we usually like something a little basic, but with flavor. Generally, this finishes before the 2 hour mark in the oven and I always make my special mashed potatoes with it. I remove the legs from the pan and scrape the drippings off the foil and put them into a pan, add about 1/2 cup (i don't measure) of milk and heat until the drippings blend well with the milk, THEN I add about a tablespoon of flour and simmer until blended and desired thickness (usually a minute or 2). Turkey drippings make THE best gravy, no seasonings needed, it's already there. Serve with another side like green beans or whatever I have on hand. AWESOME. Simple &amp; fool-proof."

I cooked with white rice, collard greens and corn bread(like another reviewer). However, to cut time I purchased collard greens in a can by Glory ( I added onions, hot sauce, salt, pepper, &amp; apple vinger), and purchased the corn bread from Publix bakery. YES, YES, &amp; YES! just as good. I will try to post the picture, but I started eating then realized I did not take a pic. I normally get recipes from here but rarly have time to comment, but I had to post one NOW. This is my first time cooking smoked turkey drumsticks. This was SO SIMPLE and best of all ALL the ingredients are what you would normally have ON HAND."

When I did did the butter part before I put the skin back I seasoned the meat with mckormicks perfect pinch all purpose season. Then I rubbed the outside with a little little olive oil for sticking purposes. Seasoned the outside . Then I used aluminum pan.( didn't have a roaster) and let's just say I had a great night....I made two. Took about 2 1/2 hours ... loved it. Oh the oil was cause o used very little water. I didn't want them to stick. I wanted crispier skin..... Now that I have made this several times... when I make the pockets and stuff the butter and the onions down in them, I sprinkle it heavily with McCormick Hamburger seasoning (its a must) pepper salt season salt garlic .powder/salt . Sometimes I make an herb butter to use inbetween the skin... I stuff it really really full ... seasoning every section as I stuff it. .. makes a huge difference!!"

Put butter under thighs in pan also. Needed to add about 15 minutes cooking time. Worked great!!! I will def make this again."

The first time I did not have any celery so I used slivered onions instead (very tasty). But last Sunday when I did have some celery I tried it again and OMG! The flavor those stalks put out was superb! I thought that the celery would be mushy and it was not. If was soft yet still had a firm feel when eaten. I seasoned my turkey with salt, pepper, garlic powder and a little parsley (for color). My meat was tender, juicy and fell right off the bone! We had with greens (with turkey necks), mac-n-cheese and cornbread (I uploaded a pic. I had to stop eating in order to actually take the picture. LOL). I will DEFINITELY cook my turkey legs this way from now on. I've shared with friends and they too enjoyed the recipe. Reminds me of the food my grandmother would cook everyday.

In my 54 years of eating other people's good cooking (my Mom, sisters, etc.), I have to say, this is about the best turkey, the best potatoes, and the best carrots I've ever had (and I made it, still can't believe it). Thankyou so much for this. And it took 15 minutes of shopping and 15 minutes of prep time!"

Mixed butter with sage, thyme, rosemary and bit of salt/ black pepper and put that between the meat/skin. I placed the legs in the pan, and sprinkled black pepper on top of skin. Poured 1 can of chicken broth in the pan and added baby carrots in the pan on the outside (love the taste), loosely cover with foil. And baked at 400 degrees instead of 350 (since I was using a small toaster oven - not the big oven, I was afraid that it wouldn't be hot enough) for 2 hours. About 1 hr 10 later, took out the foil and basted them occassionally. 30 min before taking it out, I sucked out a lot of the broth (using the baster) and used that for the gravy. This allowed for the skin to brown and crisp up. Served with potatoes, gravy and corn. It turned out good, meat broke off the bone cleanly and the skin was nicely brown and crispy. Next time I would probably keep the foil on there a bit longer and take it out a bit earlier probably 1 45 min instead of the full 2 hrs."
