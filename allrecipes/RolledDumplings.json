I sometimes add some herbs, onion, or garlic powder to the mix just to add something extra. Most of the time, I just stick to this basic recipe. I don’t flour my surface, I simply make my dough, let it rest in the fridge wrapped in plastic wrap for an hour (or more), then roll portions of it out between two pieces of parchment paper. Easy clean up."

This is the way I make it, too, and I think I'm the only one left in my family who makes them. Let them simmer at a very slow bubbling point. Dumplings cook from the steam, and if you boil them to hard, they will dissolve into your broth."

"reviewBody": "100%, this is the perfect Southern dumpling recipe. What makes them perfect is the al dente texture. I made them exactly per the recipe, including making sure to roll them extremely thin because they increase by about 30% in thickness.\n\nAs mentioned in the instructions, this is a *very* dry dough. I made it in a bowl, then kneaded it a few times, then pressed it into the bottom of the bowl to sit and hydrate while I did other things. It was still very dry, but it rolled out great. Resist the temptation to add more milk, if you do they'll puff up way way bigger and they'll also have a soft undesirable texture.\n\nI'm a huge fan of butter and rarely use shortening for anything, but you absolutely cannot use butter in this recipe.\n\nThe one change I made was to use butter flavored Crisco for the shortening."

I saute chopped onions, celery, and carrots first then add the chicken broth. Then I add 1 tsp each of dried thyme and rosemary while the dumplings are cooking. Finally I add pulled chicken meat and some fresh ground black pepper. If I don't cook the chicken myself a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket works great. This is my wife's favorite cold weather dish."

I put celery, carrots , poultry seasoning and rosemary as if I were stewing a hen (Also I used leftover turkey I had froze from Thanksgiving. Let it simmer while I rolled out the dumplings. Brought the broth to a boil, dropped the rolled dumplings in and then covered the pot, turned the heat down to a slow simmer. The family loved it and said it was the best Chicken &amp; Dumplings I’ve ever made. They have/had no idea I used turkey or cheat-a-broth.\nWill definitely make this again!"

They've turned out great EVERY single time!\n\nI've only made a few changes. I double, or triple the recipe. I don't sprikle the dumplings lightly with flour, I coat liberally with flour which helps thicken the broth. I also usually add a whole chicken or a few chicken breasts. I use a few spoonfuls of Better than Boullion chicken flavoring to enhance the flavor too."

Rolling them out 1/16\"-1/8\" gives you a light, noodle-like dumpling. These are NOT the puffy, biscuit dumplings. These are dense and taste more like homemade pasta."

My 76 year old mom came to dinner and raved about how the dumplings were better than her aunt's.\n\nLast week I still had some of the chicken broth (with plenty of chicken in it) in the freezer and was hungry about 10 PM:) I didn't have any shortening so I substituted with 1/4 cup of bacon fat (I always keep left-over bacon fat in a cup in the fridge after I cook it)...it turned out \"OFF THE HOOK!\". The extra flavor from the bacon fat added another dimension!\n\nI don't understand why people say that cooking can be so difficult. My secret is to cook a big piece of meat on Sunday (Chicken, beef, pork shoulder, etc.), then I have plenty of left-overs the rest of the week to be creative and fast with meals for my husband (tacos, enchiladas, pot-pies, soups, etc.). Get the major cooking out of the way with a big piece of meat on a not so busy day and the possibilities are endless!"

It takes almost an hour for them to cook all the way through, and I do roll them thin. The flavor and texture are good after cooking, but they aren't close to done after 10 minutes. The other negative is the shortening. Nothing but hydrogenated oils. I will need to try it with butter, or even regular oil and see if it turns out. This recipe is a great starter, but not a 5 star recipe."

It only took 30 minutes tops and it was satisfying. I used 1 box and 3 cans of chicken broth, parsley flakes, shredded chicken breast (had extra chicken after I made quesadillas) salt and pepper. Boiled it. Made the dumplings and cooked until it's consistency was just like chicken and dumplings. It was delicious! My only complaint about this recipe is the dumplings weren't as firm as I like them. They were a bit soft and you can forget about them being solid to reheat them. Either way, these were great the way I made them and I WOULD give this recipe to a friend. Thanks for sharing, Jessica!"
