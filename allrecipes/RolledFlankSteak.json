I think I could make earlier in day and just remove from fridge early enough to bring meat back to room temp before searing them."

"reviewBody": "I had a frozen flank steak and butterflied it while still slightly frozen, which makes it easier to cut. The steak was delicious but pretty salty with steak seasoning, soy and bacon. You could go low sodium to reduce the salt. It probably doesn't matter what you stuff with. I used shredded cheddar (barely noticeable flavor), spinach, medium spice pre-roasted hatch peppers, and bacon. I would definitely pre-cook the bacon a bit. I also like rare red meat but the men prefer well done, so i had to cook it until 155 degrees . I Loved it!"

I followed the recipe with the exception of rolling the steaks in bacon. I opted to use a smoked gouda and used frozen fire roasted peppers and onion blend that I defrosted in the microwave and chopped fine,along with the mushrooms. I rolled baby spinach leaves,gouda,and mushrooms into the two bundles and secured the mixture ends with toothpicks. Taking the hint from another reviewer,I sprinkled the rolled steak bundles with garlic powder,fresh ground pepper,and a sprinkling of dried thyme. Came out superb! Cutos Angelshark.:)"

We ended up eating this tonight - a good 24 hours after I made the roll, and it was delicious! We like our meat medium-rare, so I cooked it only to about an internal temp of 125, then let it rest. Next time - I will pre-cook the bacon a bit before making the roll because of this. It was so juicy and flavorful! Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!"

After reading through the previous reviews here are my tweaks to this; I did not have a flank steak, so I used very thin sliced sirloin and made individual rolls. I used frozen spinach instead. I precooked the bacon. I rough chopped the mushrooms, red pepper and bacon, plus added onion and gorgonzola along with the provolone. I sprinkled garlic powder over it all before rolling the steak (b/c we don't cook anything w/o onion and garlic). I rolled and placed seam side down on foil lined pan. Sprinkled sea salt and pepper over top of rolled steaks and baked for the 1hr--which was perfect. I made a sauce from the drippings, added beef broth and a splash of red wine and cornstarch---YUM. I served with asparagus and wild rice in which I added the left over mushrooms, red pepper and onion. Looked wonderful and tasted great! Oh, and I only marinated for 3-4hrs, which was plenty."

Also, keep in mind that the mushrooms and spinach will release a lot of moisture, so I actually drained my filling before rolling it, which made rolling much easier and less slippery. The man at my local meat department said he had no idea how to butterfly the flank, so I had to do it myself, which of course was a massive balls-up. HOWEVER, a few healthy whacks with a meat mallet quickly set it to rights. I served it with a salad and some roasted potatoes and my family loved it. I'll definitely be making this again to hone my knife skills!"

"reviewBody": "Followed recipe as written, with the exception of taking one steak out after 50 minutes, as we prefer our steak medium-rare; also omitted mushrooms. I had two steaks, with one being thicker than the other - the thick one I baked for about 70 minutes for medium, so thickness will make a difference. I marinated over night, and rolled tightly in the am; kept in fridge til ready to roast. Voila! \n\nI researched numerous recipes on cooking \"rolled flank steaks\" and went with the baking method, as this was for a party and baking was the easiest way to go. But if not in a rush, next time I will make pinwheels (individual slices using toothpicks) and use the \"sear, then bake\" method (sear one minute per side, then bake for 10-15 minutes in 350 oven). I think this would be a 5 star with the meat being seared - I think it would also improve the presentation. Marinating and ingredients go very well together."

I used inexpensive, thin bacon, which made it easier to roll. I was also worried that there was too much cheese, but it worked out fine. Served it with smashed potatoes; broccoli w/cheese sauce; and a spinach salad with feta, craisins, mandarin oranges, &amp; raspberry vinaigrette. Simple, but festive. It got rave reviews. Thanks!"

For the marinade: I used half a light beer (I've found Corona or Stella are best for this), 1/2 cup of olive oil, the red bell pepper slices, 1 medium white onion (sliced into half rings), parsley and cilantro to taste, I used a tbsp of each. Also instead of the steak seasoning I added Trader Joe's \"21 seasoning salute\" (about a tsp). Let it marinade in the fridge for 2-3 hours. I added the veggies from the marinade inside the roll, along with some spinach, grilled leeks and muenster cheese instead. Making this again for sure."

I used teriyaki sauce and soy sauce in the marinade because I didn't have enough soy. Then I added garlic powder with parsley and onion powder along with the olive oil. I did cook my bacon first till it was just crisp. I added about 2 tbs of chopped red onions to the roll. I also only marinated for about an hour as I got started late. The sauce was delicious. This was one of the prettiest dishes I've made by far. Thanks so much for sharing!!!"
