So easy and quick to make for a simple snack anytime."

I cooled them by an an open window. It is very cold where I live, so they were set solid within ten minutes. I've packed 16 up in little Dollar Store decorated Xmas tins as gifts for my sisters, brother, four of my closest friends and two for me. They are so delicious when the chocolate and caramel is still a bit soft. Yummy in my tummy and I think this will become an annual thing for me."

"reviewBody": "These are sinfully delicious &amp; completely addictive ! They are the perfect mix of both sweet &amp; salty flavors . Ive never come across anyone who doesn't absolutely devour and rave about them. They are also incredibly easy to make, (although if you have the choice, I recommend purchasing the Rolo's as individual candy bars (usually found at the check out lanes in grocery stores). They are not wrapped individually in this form, unlike in the larger bags of candy. Having to unwrap each Rolo from the large bags can be a bit more time consuming, especially if you are making multiple batches. On the flip side, buying the larger bags of candy, is less expensive, &amp; definitely much more cost effective. I usually make at least 4-6 dozen ahead of time around the holidays and I keep them frozen until needed. I then pull out however many are needed, thaw them &amp; then keep them refrigerated."

"reviewBody": "I read many of the reviews, and also watched the video. The \"chocolate covered caramel candies\" were obviously Milk Duds, so that is what I used. I chose to use the square pretzels, based on other reviewers suggestions. They were ok, but I think I would have liked them better using a higher grade candy. And because Milk Duds are somewhat small, the square pretzel flavor overpowered the chocolate/caramel and pecan. I did toast the pecans ahead of time, as I always do for all nuts in recipes, it makes all of the difference. If I made these again, I would use a higher grade candy and a preztel that is smaller."

I wasn't expecting much from this recipe, tried it &amp; was pleasantly surprised Using small pretzels, letting Rolos candy melt 5 - 6 minutes in oven, gently placing roasted pecans spreading out the melted chocolates ended up with perfectly chocolate caramel goodness. After looking at photos, I feared it would become no more than a slightly melted &amp; re-hardened candy on a pretzel. Not the case with care. Appearance &amp; taste are Great! Thanks for the idea."

Had extra Pretzels so I decided to experiment using some plain Hershey Kisses, they did not melt as nice as the Caramel squares, so I would not recommend using those as a substitute.\n\nReview that I found most helpful was from \nMarshmay – “MAKE IT SIMPLE!!!! Put your square pretzel on bottom, a Dove caramel chocolate next, and then the pecan half. Bake for 3 to 4 minutes at 300* Put it in the refrigerator immediately to cool for about 20 minutes. Don't make it harder than it really is people!!”"

"reviewBody": "Candies tried: Dove Milk Chocolate Caramels -melts quickly (3 min), completely covers the pretzel, takes longer to cool, caramel is very soft, chocolate is light in color. Hershey's Milk Chocolate Caramels - melts quickly, takes longer to cool, caramel is medium soft, completely covers the pretzel, chocolate is darker without being dark. Hershey's Dark Chocolate Caramels - melts quickly, takes longer to cool, caramel is medium soft, completely covers the pretzel, chocolate is dark. Rolo - melts a little slower (4 min) but firms up quickly, caramel is medium soft, leaves some pretzel showing, chocolate is a dark milk chocolate color. Milk Duds - takes longer to melt (4min) but firms up quickly, 2 leave some pretzel showing, 3 covers completely, caramel is firm and sticky (just like the plain candy), chocolate is a dark milk.\n\nOf all, my favorite ended up being the Rolos for ease of use, looks and taste. The caramel was soft and the chocolate was a good in-between dark and milk, and had the right balance between candy, pretzel, and nut. That said, they are all delicious. It appears you just can't go wrong with these."

I used square pretzels with rolos and balanced a half pecan on top of each one. 4 minutes later I had a melted gooey mess on my tray. They all stuck to the paper and could not be peeled off without taking pieces of paper with the pretzel. Unfortunately, they could not be saved. :( This time, I did exactly the same thing but removed the pretzels from the oven at exactly 3 minutes. I pressed the pecan on top and allowed them to cool. Perfect! So, watch the time."
