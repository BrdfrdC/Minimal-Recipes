"reviewBody": "Good flavor. Hope it is better on day 2. From the other comments, it seems like the size of lamb shanks vary. I made four instead of six and adjusted the liquids accordingly. I also added a corn starch slurry, and that helped a lot, in addition to cooking down the sauce. What I will definitely do next time is use a spice pouch or bag so that I don't have to strain the sauce at all. Last thing added was some orange zest to brighten up the sauce at the end. Thank you for a great recipe!"

Lots of fresh garlic. Onions. Dried apricots. No broth. Carrots. Water. Cooked on a pressure cooker for one hour. Added the carrots and dried apricots. Cooked an additional half hour. Topped off with fresh parsley. They were tender and delicious. Served with orzo risotto."

I also added celery to increase the vegetable portion, and used a can of diced tomatoes, as well as dried thyme and rosemary, since that’s what I had on hand. \n\nI browned the shanks in the Dutch oven on the stovetop, then removed them and cooked the vegetables as per the recipe. Then I added in the tomatoes and liquids, substituting vegetable stock for beef stock, because that’s what I had in the pantry. I did use chicken stock and red wine.\n\nI returned the shanks to the pot, submerging them and stirred in a 1/4 cup of water to completely cover. I brought everything to a boil, then put the cover on and placed the Dutch oven into my main oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes, then reducing the temperature to 350 for another 90 minutes.\n\nFinally, I removed the cover and let it all simmer for another 20 minutes in my main oven. It was fall-off-the-bone, and the sauce was perfect for pouring over the shank on the plate. Absolutely delicious! I will make this again. Thanks to the original author for posting this recipe!"

One lamb shank was almost enough for my family of 4. I saved the flavorful stock and will use it tonight to make risotto. Will use a bit more wine next time!"

There was lots of spiting and the shanks stuck to the pan. Then \"Medium low\"was too high for simmering.\n\nIn the end, things turned out ok but the amount of time and effort wasn't worth the final result. I won't be making this again. \n\nGrilled lamb chops taste much better for a lot less effort."

I then saute the veggies, add the liquids and herbs and pour that over the shanks. Cook on high for 4 hours, on low for 7. When they’re done, I remove the shanks to an ovenproof casserole dish. I strain the liquid into a saucepan. I gently boil the liquid until reduced by about a third. I thicken it with a mixture of cornstarch and water and pour over the shanks. You could serve it then but I always cover and refrigerate, reheat the next day. It is so much better the next day. I often halve the recipe, turns out just as well."

It's a fantastic recipe. I've noticed a few other that thought it fell a bit flat which confuses me. I wonder if they under-seasoned and under-browned the shanks prior to the braise. I'd also wonder what wine they used. Be generous with the seasoning and the sear and use wine you'd happily drink."

Bonus...there's a lot of it, much more than we'll use with the shanks. I plan to add it to an upcoming lamb stew, because YUM!"

After the initial 2 hours of cooking, I took the carrots out (as many as I could) along with the shanks. Keep them warm in a low temp oven. I reduced the sauce for about 20-30 mins. Add the lamb and the carrots back in and simmer so the meat absorbs the reduced sauce. Served over very thin pappardelle (Cipriani). Excellent with modifications!"

I cut the ingredients back a bit b/c I only used 4 lamb shanks. I followed as is except I used a little more garlic, added 1/2 can of tomato paste, and in addition to the herbs called for, put in two sprigs of thyme and pulled them out before reducing. Because I use reduced sodium stock, I added a little salt and pepper and then reduced at a full boil for just shy of 20 min. The reduction was absolutely delicious!

"reviewBody": "Fabulous. I've made this dish so many times and never been disappointed. I usually reduce the amount of wine called for, and I like to use a good Zinfandel, but I've even used ale. I grind my salt, red pepper flakes, dried rosemary, and some dried oregano and add this to the onions and garlic when I sauté them. I use my own homemade bone broth (usually made from chicken and turkey) for both the chicken and beef broth. Then I add fresh bay leaf and thyme to the Dutch oven before I cover and braise in the oven. I never have to reduce the sauce if I use my Dutch oven and cook in the oven. Our favourite way to eat this is with a creamy garlic risotto but we also love it with mashed potatoes. It is our favourite fancy dish and what my husband always requests on his birthday or around Christmas."
