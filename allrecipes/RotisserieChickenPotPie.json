"reviewBody": "I really liked this pie. It was easy to make which is always a big bonus in my book (I did use already made Pillsbury pie crusts). I didn't prebake the bottom crust, and I was afraid it might be soggy, but it wasn't. This made a good-sized 9\" pie. In addition to the salt and pepper, I added some garlic powder and poultry seasoning. I will definitely make this one again. Thanks, Lynette!"

It worked well with GF pie crusts, GF flour, (I used Trader Joe's), DF butter and unsweetened almond milk. I did add 1/2 tsp garlic powder, but that was the only flavor addition."

"reviewBody": "This is a really good starting off point. The amounts of butter, stock and milk are perfect, but it definitely needs more seasoning. I used a leftover smoked chicken, I also sauteed fresh carrots and celery and added some leftover grilled corn, frozen peas and frozen green beans. I also added additional poultry rub and salt and pepper to taste. It was perfect served with Frank's hot sauce on the side."
