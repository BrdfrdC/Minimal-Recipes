I left half a can of the red bean juice in the bowl and separated all the white and the other half red in a bowl as suggested before. White had way more sodium! I used butter instead of bacon grease to simmer the onions and garlic. I added a can of chipotles in adobo sauce, which adds the missing smoke flavour from the bacon and the heat I like(!), to the beans and used an emerson hand blender to get the consistancy I like. I did end up adding sea salt after so not sure if adding the white kidney bean juice would have been better? I fried up these beans until they were thick enough for enchiladas and omg, I am SO happy with the turn out! This is going to be a staple recipe in my kitchen!!"

"reviewBody": "These were delicious! The only complaint I have is that the serving size should be \"1\". I could have eaten the whole dish by myself. I would seriously recommend that you double the recipe for 4 people. The only changes I made was that I used 1 T bacon fat and I doubled the onion (only because I got carried away when I was dicing the onion). I totally DISAGREE with some of the other reviewers when they said not to use all of the liquid in the can. I poured the can into my pan, let the beans heat through and then mash them with a potato masher. As the beans heat through, the liquid evaporates and the consistency is perfect. I suppose its possible that different brands have different amount of liquid in the can, but I think you need the whole amount. If your beans are too runny, then just cook a little longer stirring as you go."

They’re not very appetizing looking and neither taste very good either. But not this time! While these still leave a lot to be desired in terms of eye appeal, the flavor is startlingly better than most. I reserved and crumbled the bacon I fried to create the required bacon grease and I think the addition was a bold flavor contribution, as was the chopped green onion I garnished them with. This takes the lowly Mexican bean side dish to an elevated level. Just needs salt and pepper."

"reviewBody": "This was really good, however CAUTION, CAUTION, CAUTION, do not under any circumstances just throw the whole can with the juice into the pot as it is way too much liquid; fortunately I figured that out before I dumped it in and actually only used about half of it. What I did to make the mashing easier is to drain ALL of the liquid into a bowl (much easier when they're not swimming), use a stick blender to mash the beans, I like mine chunky, add your seasoning and then add the liquid to the consistency you like. Me, I like mine thick not runny like you get in most restaurants. \n\nThese were absolutely delicious and I will never buy refried beans in a can again (they always taste like the can!) when these are so simple and tasty. Remember to add the salt, this has none listed. I usually make 4 to 6 cans at a time so I don't have to make them as often. \n\nA substitution for bacon fat is lard. It will give the same mouth feel but not overwhelm the flavor with smoke from the bacon. Still just as good but more appropriate with certain dishes. I keep the lard in a jar in the fridge so it won't spoil."
