Disclaimer* that’s the only time I’ve ever had borscht. I also did not measure this exactly. That’s not how I cook, with the exception of baking. That said, this was absolutely delicious, once I seasoned with salt to my taste. (MIL has sodium restrictions.) A huge dollop of sour cream and this will absolutely be a routine dish in our house. I found my food processor to be invaluable. I shredded the cabbage and beets, then sliced the potatoes with it. I also cooked it in the instant pot."

To improve the consistency of the soup I used a hand blender and blended it a bit so the soup was creamier. I omitted the honey as the farm carrot was plenty sweet. It is a fantastic recipe that you can modify to accommodate what you have in your pantry. Do make this borscht--you will be glad you did."

I started with sautéing the onions, celery and added 3 cloves of minced garlic (What? No garlic in borscht!? Unimaginable!) then added the broth, potatoes, carrots and doubled the amount of beets and let it cook for about 30 minutes. I then added the rest of the ingredients (maybe a bit more cabbage than called for) and let it simmer for about 30 minutes. I will add a little more liquid next time, as the soup turned out quite thick. Absolutely wonderful soup!"

The apple cider vinegar scared me a bit as I can't stand the smell and I find it off-putting in salad dressings, but I couldn't taste it. I used homemade chicken broth instead of veggie stock, and used a bit less salt and honey than called for, but it still sings with flavour. I left out the caraway. Mine turned out more pink than red as my beets were a lighter colour variety. I didn't have tomato purée but used 1/2 the amount of tomato paste instead. Lately, I tore up the beet greens and threw them in 15 minutes before the end of cooking time. It was perfect."

And, the can of tomato puree I bought was 10.5 ounces, so I just added the whole can instead of wasting the last 2.5 ounces, or trying to keep it for something else.\nThis recipe made my husband (who doesn't like beets) ask how I got the beets to NOT taste like beets. \nIt was fantastic, and my first attempt at making borscht - I will likely make it again."

In the end it all goes together to simmer in soup for a prolonged period, so I don't really think all the separate preps for different vegetables is really necessary. I didn't bother with using a stock, with all the strong vegetable flavours, water works perfectly fine. But this will be my go to borscht recipe."

It was great with both and I would definitely make it again.\n To say that one recipe is authentic and others are not is like saying your chicken soup recipe is the only authentic chicken soup."

Hmm. OK. This was to be my first, but I like it so much I will not make the others! \n\nI scrubbed and shredded all veggies, removed no skins. Shredding meant the pieces were all uniform, I finely chopped the onion and celery. My only substation was kale instead of cabbage. (I thought I had some, I was wrong!) O.M.G. this turned out great! With the golden beets, I have more of a yellow soup, but, as I said, it's wonderful! Definitely will make this one again!"

This recipe is the first Russian/Ukraine food I've ever attempted, so I did not dare change a thing. And it was fabulous. I recently ate at a reputable Russian/Ukrainian restaurant in Chicago with this same Russian friend, and this borscht was far better than that which I paid $9/bowl for. I will likely add another 1-2 cups of stock to help it go a little further. And definitely serve it with a dollop of sour cream. (And thank you to the reviewer whom suggested using Trader Joe's precooked beets.I will try that next time.)"

"reviewBody": "Been living in Russia for 10 years, and this was one of the best I've tried. There are several types of borsch - sweet or sour, tomato-ey or beet-ey. This is a beet-ey, sweet one which is just the type that I love. Tasted very authentic. I put in two medium sized beets (more than the recipe called for), and about 1.25L of broth (also more). I also added 350g of cubed beef. Simmered for about 4 hours. I would say it could about 4 people. \n\nNo need to debate the merits of certain ingredients and whether they should or shouldn't be in a \"real\" borsch recipe. The end result is that this tastes exactly as borsch should."

"reviewBody": "Being Russian myself I have a courage to say this is a great borscht recipe with Russian flavor. Believe me. Remember the main thing: there is not the one authentic borscht recipe, every single family make this dish on its own way. There are thousand variations and interpretations of this dish. We have the main ingredients - beets, cabbage (not exactly red, you can easily use a regular white cabbage), potatoes, carrots and onions. And then use your imagination. Some people make borscht using pork or beef, some add mushrooms, I`ve heard of even adding prunes. As to this recipe I would change the proportions a little just for my taste. I would use 1 1/2 cups beets, only one large onion and less tomato puree (tomatoes are optional but the borscht will be tastier). Don`t substitute cumin for caraway seeds. Cumin has an oriental flavor that can ruin Russian flavor in borscht. If you don`t have caraway seeds just omit them, they are optional. And definitely serve the borscht with sour cream, very traditional. The borscht consistency ends on your personal preference, if you prefer thick, add less water or more vegetables, if you prefer watery, add more water. So if you want to try Russian borscht, this is a great recipe to start."

To me, the caraway seeds are NOT optional. I have no knowledge of authentic borscht, but this tastes wonderful. It's a mainstay at our house, especially in the winter! We sometimes add pork to it as well."

Instead of red cabbage I used a bag of coleslaw mix (green cabbage with carrots)Didn't have cider vinegar so I did without it altogether. Also didn't have caraway seeds so I used cumin, though I only used 3/4 of a tsp because I was a bit nervous it would overpower, but it was fine! Had a package of fresh dill and added pretty much the whole thing. For the broth I used Organic PC vegetable stock. VERY YUMMY!"
