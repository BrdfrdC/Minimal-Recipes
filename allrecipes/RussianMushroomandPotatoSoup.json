"reviewBody": "I made this the first time as is and found it to be OK, a bit more American (kind of bland) than the eastern European soups I grew up with. The mushroom taste wasn't strong enough and it was missing a certain kvas (sourness/tanginess). So the second time I added 2 packets (total 2oz.) of dried mushrooms (porcini) and restricted some of the cooking liquid so I could add some pickle juice at the end but lemon/sauerkraut juice/cider vinegar/citric acid would probably work ok too. It's funny how little seasoning decisions transform a dish culturally."

"reviewBody": "This is an awesome soup! With 900+ five star reviews it's pretty hard to go wrong. I cut the recipe in half as my wife hates Mushrooms, therefore I rarely make anything with them in a recipe. This one was all for me!\nI only had russet potatoes so I cut the time to 15 minutes so they'd hold together. I only had onions and no leeks so that was a substitute. \nThe big change I made was to use Better than Bullion roast beef soup base. So much better flavor than boxed soup broth and cheaper! One little jar makes 9.5 quarts of broth! Under $4 at Walmart.\nI did follow one suggestion from another reviewer who skipped the flour and half and half thickener and I used about 1/3C of sour cream. Just be sure to temper it before you stir it in so it won't curdle.\nIt is Mushroom Nirvana!"

Stick to the recipe as I did the first time around and it's awesome a definite keeper if you love mushroom soups!!!"

Recommend trying it; it’s worth a go."

It's ridiculously delicious for the ingredients it uses. Definitely will make again. With no description of what mushrooms or potatoes were preferred, I used portabella and white mushrooms and russet potatoes. It took much longer for the potatoes to become tender than indicated in the recipe, though I cut them quite small. None of these detracts from my five-star rearing."

"reviewBody": "I’ve made this twice. Once, following the recipe, exactly and once with the following changes; before adding the dairy, I removed 1\\2 of the mushrooms and potato’s and used the hand blender in the rest of the soup. I did this to check if it would thicken without the additions. It did, so I added the reserved mushrooms and potato’s back into the soup and did not add 1/2 &amp; 1/2. I garnished each bowl with a dollop of sour cream and fresh snipped dill. I would always use leeks as they are very nutritious and the leek flavor is important, in my opinion. If I wanted to thicken the soup further, I would use my ‘go too’ method; kneed flour into a tbls or so, of butter until well incorporated, then add to the soup and simmer on low. It will thicken beautifully. So...the original recipe is still a 5 star!"

Also, I didn't have fresh dill, but added a bit extra of the dried and that seemed to work just fine. I will absolutely make again for company. Might make a batch this weekend to freeze and see how it does."

Really easy to make, and super hearty and flavorful- definitely makes the cold winter day a little bit more bearable! Potatoes and carrots cooked to the perfect consistency. Get a slice of crusty bread to dip straight into the soup and you're all good to go!"

"reviewBody": "This was absolutely fantastic. I halved the recipe since were 3 of us eating it for dinner but did not change the ingredients except adding a little more butter to saute the mushrooms since half the butter wasn't enough. The major change I made was to use an immersion blender at the very end after almost finishing the thickening so I could make a \"creamed\" soup. I used the blender until it was a medium-fine puree with little bits of the ingredients vs completely pureed. Then put it back on the burner on med-low until it completely thickened. It was AMAZING. My somewhat picky daugher loved it and my husband had 2 1/2 bowls of it. Will absolutely repeat it - one of the rare recipes where no tweaks are needed, even the salt levels which are normally horribly high to me."

But that’s the chef not the recipe! I’ll definitely be making this again!!"

Found this recipe and it was a perfect comforting welcome home soup for the family. The only thing I didn’t have were leeks so sautéed onions instead. I’m sure leeks would make it even that much better. This soup will definitely become part of our family!"

I didn’t have any cream or half-and-half so used regular milk and a dollop of sour cream. It was delicious as is and this is my second time making it. This time I added some pork roast that needed to be used. I chopped into small cubes and sautéed first and then re-added towards the end. The soup and pork flavors really complimented each other and it was just as delicious the next day for lunch."

Also later when it’s time to add the mushrooms back in, I let it cook for a bit to let the flavors come together. This also helped the potatoes break brown"

Thank you for this recipe, this is definitely a permanent winter addition in our house."

I took out about a quarter of the soup with a little broth and put it in a blender and then put it back to thicken the soup(instead of using heavy cream and flour). I also added some garlic powder and complete seasoning to the veggies because I must add those to everything I cook. The soup is delicious. I will add bacon and a little cheese and sour cream because I can!! Thanks for the great recipe!"
