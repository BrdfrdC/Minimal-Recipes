"reviewBody": "I made this the first time as is and found it to be OK, a bit more American (kind of bland) than the eastern European soups I grew up with. The mushroom taste wasn't strong enough and it was missing a certain kvas (sourness/tanginess). So the second time I added 2 packets (total 2oz.) of dried mushrooms (porcini) and restricted some of the cooking liquid so I could add some pickle juice at the end but lemon/sauerkraut juice/cider vinegar/citric acid would probably work ok too. It's funny how little seasoning decisions transform a dish culturally."

"reviewBody": "This is an awesome soup! With 900+ five star reviews it's pretty hard to go wrong. I cut the recipe in half as my wife hates Mushrooms, therefore I rarely make anything with them in a recipe. This one was all for me!\nI only had russet potatoes so I cut the time to 15 minutes so they'd hold together. I only had onions and no leeks so that was a substitute. \nThe big change I made was to use Better than Bullion roast beef soup base. So much better flavor than boxed soup broth and cheaper! One little jar makes 9.5 quarts of broth! Under $4 at Walmart.\nI did follow one suggestion from another reviewer who skipped the flour and half and half thickener and I used about 1/3C of sour cream. Just be sure to temper it before you stir it in so it won't curdle.\nIt is Mushroom Nirvana!"

Stick to the recipe as I did the first time around and it's awesome a definite keeper if you love mushroom soups!!!"

It's ridiculously delicious for the ingredients it uses. Definitely will make again. With no description of what mushrooms or potatoes were preferred, I used portabella and white mushrooms and russet potatoes. It took much longer for the potatoes to become tender than indicated in the recipe, though I cut them quite small. None of these detracts from my five-star rearing."

"reviewBody": "Iâ€™ve made this twice. Once, following the recipe, exactly and once with the following changes; before adding the dairy, I removed 1\\2 of the mushrooms and potatoâ€™s and used the hand blender in the rest of the soup. I did this to check if it would thicken without the additions. It did, so I added the reserved mushrooms and potatoâ€™s back into the soup and did not add 1/2 &amp; 1/2. I garnished each bowl with a dollop of sour cream and fresh snipped dill. I would always use leeks as they are very nutritious and the leek flavor is important, in my opinion. If I wanted to thicken the soup further, I would use my â€˜go tooâ€™ method; kneed flour into a tbls or so, of butter until well incorporated, then add to the soup and simmer on low. It will thicken beautifully. So...the original recipe is still a 5 star!"

Also, I didn't have fresh dill, but added a bit extra of the dried and that seemed to work just fine. I will absolutely make again for company.

Really easy to make, and super hearty and flavorful- definitely makes the cold winter day a little bit more bearable! Potatoes and carrots cooked to the perfect consistency. Get a slice of crusty bread to dip straight into the soup and you're all good to go!"

"reviewBody": "This was absolutely fantastic. I halved the recipe since were 3 of us eating it for dinner but did not change the ingredients except adding a little more butter to saute the mushrooms since half the butter wasn't enough. The major change I made was to use an immersion blender at the very end after almost finishing the thickening so I could make a \"creamed\" soup. I used the blender until it was a medium-fine puree with little bits of the ingredients vs completely pureed. Then put it back on the burner on med-low until it completely thickened. It was AMAZING. My somewhat picky daugher loved it and my husband had 2 1/2 bowls of it. Will absolutely repeat it - one of the rare recipes where no tweaks are needed, even the salt levels which are normally horribly high to me."

Iâ€™m sure leeks would make it even that much better. This soup will definitely become part of our family!"

This time I added some pork roast that needed to be used. I chopped into small cubes and sautÃ©ed first and then re-added towards the end. The soup and pork flavors really complimented each other and it was just as delicious the next day for lunch."

I also added some garlic powder and complete seasoning to the veggies because I must add those to everything I cook. The soup is delicious.
