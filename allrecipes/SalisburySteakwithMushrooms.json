I also use finely ground pork rinds for bread crumbs. I do a large batch and store in freezer. Freezing them removes the odor and flavor..they taste and smell like bread crumbs. I also use flour instead of cornstarch for thickening."

Saut√©ed onions and mushrooms in the pan for 10 minutes then added about two table spoons of the flour/S&amp;P dredge I had left over and mixed in well to the onion and mushrooms until all the flour was well incorporated and let cook on medium low for 3-5 minutes, then added about two cups beef stock and a tablespoon of beef bullion, and about 1/2 cup of heavy cream and stirred I. Well to fully incorporate. Seasoned again to taste, layer the steaks on top of the onion/mushroom gravy and put in a 275 degree oven for about 2.0 minutes while I made the mashed roasted garlic potatoes and saut√©ed green beans. Turned out amazing!"

"reviewBody": "The flavor definitely takes me back to my childhood when I had Salisbury steak and mashed potatoes in the foil tray with the berry crumble‚Ä¶except it tastes homemade, the beef isn‚Äôt mushy, and the onions and mushrooms are fresh! You can make this as organic/grass-fed and healthy version as you want! I followed the recipe, but I did saut√© the onions and mushrooms and transferred it onto a plate before I browned the patties. Then, I deglazed the pan after the patties browned with some red wine before adding the stock. It was simple and delicious, like a warm hug of a meal from the past. If you‚Äôre feeling nostalgic for the foil tray of yore, this is it! Even if you‚Äôre not, this is a tasty, hearty and simple dish ??"

Flour sprinkled in AFTER browning the patties in butter and olive oil.. removed and cover on plate to keep cozy.\nGetting back to the onions, mushrooms and flour...add 1 T. Ketchup or tomato paste to saut√©, stirring add 1 glass of dry white wine, a few minutes later add beef stock and a few sprigs of thyme adjust S&amp;P and I like to whisk in a tsp. of Kitchen Bouquet browning sauce. Add the patties or football shaped thick patties is what I like back to the sauce and cover on lowest heat for 10-20 minutes spooning sauce/onion, mushrooms over.\nI add chopped flat leaf parsley to finish and serve with egg noodles.\nI know it seems I totally hijacked this recipe but this recipe needed to be edited."

Perfect winter comfort food. I follow the recipe as stated. It has a few important steps and to me, is actually kind of fun to make. Pair this with thick, homemade noodles and you‚Äôve really got a winner."

If your family isn‚Äôt a fan of onions, remove them from the patties but don‚Äôt omit them from the gravy!! They are essential to the flavor. My husband will eat two patties and my kids eat one each. And my kids are super picky!! It‚Äôs an easy, go-to when I‚Äôm short on time and ideas. I usually serve this with potatoes-mashed, fried, or baked stacks-and fresh green beans. I might do a grilled zucchini dish next time just to change it up. This recipe will definitely stay in my favorites."

When ever I want to make something I Google it and look for the one that has the highest rating, I open them and read the recipe and decide if that's the one l want. I looked at a lot of recipes and this one really stood out. It's easy, no obscure ingredients that you'll only use once. I went by the recipe and did not alter anything. It is perfect just like that. It's now the only one I use when I make it. I have over 50 different recipes, from right here. I just never thought to put them in my collection. And I have an account. But I will be saving them from now on. Really good."
