Though I cut back to 1 1/2 Tb. salt (on a hunch that 2 1/2 could not be right), it was still way, way too salty. Fixed it by diluting with more lemon &amp; lime juice. Appropriate amount is probably more like 1/4-1/2 tsp as others note. So to prevent future mistakes, could Sarah Zeigler please edit the recipe? Otherwise, it's divine! Agree with other reviewers who recommend alternative fish, if desired. Also nice to add diced green/red peppers."

I really think the uploader meant to put teaspoon instead of tablespoon, either way I cut the salt in half and it still was extremely salty.\n\nI added mango, peach and bell pepper as that is what the ceviche's I've had in the past used and it helped to absorb the salt. All in all it's a great combination of flavors but the salt is overbearing."

"reviewBody": "We really liked this recipe. I followed another reviewer and used flash frozen wild caught salmon from Trader Joe's. it worked great. I used only 1 tablespoon of salt. I actually thought maybe folks were not using sea salt. I did and it was a little on the salty side with a tablespoon. Secondly I will chop up the salmon next time instead of slicing. It was just weird eating it sliced. I also needed to use 1/4 of lime juice plus two extra limes. A quarter cup was just not enough to \"cook\" the amount of salmon. The taste was spot on and we enjoyed it. Would like to try it with a lot less olive oil to see what happens. Thanks for sharing."

I have used a very similar recipe with tilapia and pollock resulting in a more delicate dish. This recipe is very good and I wouldn't hesitate to use a lighter fish with it. Unlike others, I found the salt content perfectly acceptable."
