I also used powdered milk and made it thicker than normal for the evaporated milk. It worked great and you couldn't tell it wasn't evaporated milk. I didn't have creamed corn so I just threw in frozen corn. It was delicious and I will definitely be making it again. I used garlic cloves not powder."

"reviewBody": "This turned out great. Sooo tasty. I made a few changes, not all were planned! Turned out I had no celery, so I used about 1 tsp of celery salt instead of the celery and the salt. For spiciness I added 2 chopped jalapenos when the onions were cooking and it added just a little heat. I could have doubled the jalapenos. I had no problem with the canned salmon, I just removed what skin I could. I followed the recipe amount which we like, though it was meaty and you could halve if that's your taste. we like a chunky soup so I kept the carrots. I forgot to add the liquid smoke (suggested by others) and the cheese at the end, and it didn't need it. For leftovers I will sprinkle some cheese on top. Froze half so we can see how that does. I will definitely make this again."

I used 12 ounces of half-and-half instead of condensed milk. Because I was light on fish I added an extra cup of potatoes. And I had a little bit of corn in my fridge so I added a little bit more beyond the cream corn. I did not add cheese into the soup, but had sharp cheddar cheese on the table for people to add to their bowls as they desired. I also had red pepper flakes on the table for those who wanted to give it a little bit more zing without changing the flavor. It was delicious!"

"reviewBody": "I made a number of changes based on other reviews and my family's food issues. I used oil instead of butter, soy milk instead of evaporated milk, and left out the cheese entirely to make it non-dairy. I used malanga instead of potato to avoid nightshades. I used one 14.75oz can of salmon, fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, and left out the carrots. I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. The resulting chowder was very tasty! Even my husband asked for seconds, and he rarely likes soups and stews. It was a little peppery, so next time I may reduce the black pepper by half."

The soup we had there definitely didn’t have any corn or Cheddar Cheese in it! 1 tsp of pepper is too much and the entire can of evaporated milk is too much(20 calories per Tablespoon). I doubled the broth and used a 1/2lb of fresh salmon placed in the soup raw and in chunks. Going to try someone’s review that said use fat free evaporated milk next time."

The ‘bones’ of this recipe is great, yes 2 pounds of salmon is probably a typo. I sauted some fresh salmon chunks, removed from pan cooked veggies as described. I didn’t have evaporated milks so used a can of condensed celery soup and some 1% milk. Didn’t have corn but added crab meat. Went easy on potatoes and cheese (used about 1/4 cup asiago shredded). And oh my stars, this was delisious!"

I also substituted diced Mexican \"queso crema\" (a hard white drier cheese) for the cheddar cheese. OUT OF THIS WORLD! Thank you!"
