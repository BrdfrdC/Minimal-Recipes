I put it on a serving platter with an assortment of crackers about 2 hours before guests arrived. Rave reviews! The fresh tarragon is one of the secrets to the success of this dish. I can’t wait to make it again because I barely got to have any myself!"

If you are serving it for 12, make another appetizer because this is definitely not enough for 12 as it is sooo good. I did as the footnotes suggested and made it the day before and served it at cool room temperature of about 60°. I also served it with 1\" baguettes that were untoasted along with crackers and toasted baguettes. The untoasted baguettes where the most popular to serve with the salmon."

Easy to make and I minimized the tarragon (used dry) and of course, didn't poach any extra salmon. Looking forward to sharing with my friends and neighbors."

She made it again for a party I had and again, it was nearly the first thing gone (we hid some for later). It's great as an app, as a \"dip\" with bread/crackers, as breakfast on bagels or toast or on a salad (good luck saving any). Now that I have this recipe, this will be in heavy rotation. Thanks!"

"reviewBody": "This seems almost infinitely variable, as long as you mix fresh with smoked salmon and toss with oil, and don't overwhelm the subtle taste of the fresh salmon. So, poach the salmon with dill and whole peppercorns, or bake, or grill. Oil can be olive oil or mayonnaise. Then some kind of mild onion: chopped green onion, finely chopped Vidalia, shaved or chopped shallots. Here you could stop, or add chopped fresh parsley, cilantro, tarragon, etc. Perhaps something piquant liked chopped dill pickle, mild capers...And put on French bread, or salad."
