"reviewBody": "When shopping and preparing, I was impressed by the list of ingredients, some I don't usually work with, and I liked that the recipe is healthy. But, with so little smoked salmon, I couldn't taste it in the dish (this is not good after buying this expensive ingredient). Also, the quiche released a great deal of liquid after it was cooked. It kept doing so even when I put the leftovers into the fridge. If I made this again, I'd use way more eggs and much less milk. This recipe had a disappointing finale."

"reviewBody": "I made it as a frittata and used 8 eggs and a half cup of milk. I think 2 tablespoons of smoked salmon should be 2 ounces. And it cooked in 20 minutes in the oven. The calorie count doesn't jive either. Mine came out to 216 per serving. Regardless, tasty!"
