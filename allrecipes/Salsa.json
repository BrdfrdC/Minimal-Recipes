Used the little kitchenaid mini-food processor, just pulsed a few times to get a good consistency. (Note - the jalapenos and the serrano were home grown and seemed very mild anyway, my changes did not make it super spicy, just enough heat. :) ) Added probably a bit more garlic than it called for and used a sweet vidalia onion, to offset the extra heat I threw in. It came out super tasty! Do not skip the lime either."

"reviewBody": "I had to come back here and find this so I could rave. I made several batches of this salsa at once and hot bath canned it. I took out the salt and replaced it with a tablespoon of vinegar for each recipe since I have found that the vinegar tames the peppers some and I don't like it when my food hurts. I canned this in pints and half pints and I've been doling it out here and there to friends. Last night I realized that I'm going to the Farmer's Market next week and last year's canning has to be consumed. Imagine my delight when I found four half pints of my favorite salsa, tucked away behind the potatoes, spaghetti sauce and carrots from last year. These four are mine, and I couldn't be happier. Generosity is all well and good, but this salsa should stay home, too. This year, I'll do two big batches. One to gift and one for me! Excellent recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This was delicious! I took the advice of the author and only added 1/2 of the jalapeño and it was plenty spicy for my northerner tongue! I used Ohio homegrown tomatoes which added a sweetness. I also followed other reviewers recommendations by not adding as much onion (used a little more than 1/2 cup chopped) or garlic (used 2 cloves). I pureed in a blender 1/2 of the mixture to give it more of a restaurant-salsa consistency but it was very liquidy and a little frothy so next time I might not do that. I had to put away the chips to stop from eating the whole recipe! ;)"

"reviewBody": "This is a delicious and fast treat for an appetizer, a party or anytime. It only took about fifteen minutes to make and the flavor is really excellent. I had 8-9 garden tomatoes left after giving some to family and friends and IDK what to do with them. I didn't have enough to make sauce but my wife suggested we try to make some salsa. I thought that was a great idea; plus it was my birthday the next day and we were having some family home for dinner and cake. So we made the salsa and everyone really loved it. \n\nI did everything just like the recipe said and it came out perfectly. I have to admit that it sort of bugs me when ppl give a recipe one star and then go on to explain that they didn't have half of the ingredients and they substituted the other half. So we did it exactly as it was written and we all thought it was great. Much much better than jar salsa. Even better than take-out salsa from the fresh section of Whole Foods. IDK how long it keeps in the fridge because we ate it all! It was a great use of our homegrown Jersey tomatoes and a new favorite for my family."

I've always known it was \"easy\" to make but I'm not much of a cook, so I hadn't gotten around to giving it a try, until this past week I discovered that the last onion-free salsa had been reformulated and was now out of bounds for me.\nFor this recipe, I simply left out the onion and kind of eyeballed everything else, then pulsed it a couple of times in the blender. Both my husband and I loved it, and I can only imagine it will be even better tomorrow once it's melded more."

I used 1/2 of a vidalia onion (diced that in a mini food chopper/processor), added 1/2 tsp cumin, instead of only using large tomatoes, we cut up a variety of tomatoes (by hand, not a food processor as we wanted chunky) - cherry/grape tomatoes, roma and a beefsteak so that there was a variety of flavors - total of 3 cups. We threw in 2 jalapenos (used the mini food chopper/processor). At 1st it was on the spicy side so threw in a little bit of sugar to cut the heat. RAVE reviews from the party we went to. THANK YOU for posting!!"

"reviewBody": "This is pretty much the way I have made salsa for years. I never really measure anything, but everything looks about what I do except maybe I add more cilantro. I do add about 1 t. of cumin for some pep. I also seed my jalapenos, spray them with Pam, and then broil them until the skin turns black before using them- it gives them a smoky flavor. I vary the amount of jalapeno depending on the crowd. To make this super easy, I do everything in my food processor. I start with the items that I want more finely diced: start with jalapenos and garlic, pulse it til small, then add everything else but tomatoes. I pulse again until well chopped and blended. I add tomatoes last and only pulse til they are roughly chopped."

For this size I tripled the Jalapenos, added a couple milder red cherry peppers, about a teaspoon of cumin, and half a teaspoon or so of chili powder.\n\nThis is a good recipe for a base or for those with mild taste buds."
