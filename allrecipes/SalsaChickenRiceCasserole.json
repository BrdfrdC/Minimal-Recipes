"reviewBody": "I really liked this recipe! It wasn't too labor intensive and was pretty cheap to make, too! I needed one that I could freeze, and I will definitely make this one again. I did make a good bit of adjustments, though: - I actually didn't use the salsa at all (I don't really love jarred salsa and didn't feel like making my own). Instead, I topped with sour cream and hot sauce (I think next time I'll try a buffalo sauce instead). - shredded a whole rotisserie chicken instead of baking chicken breasts - sautéed the onion before baking, along with 4 cloves of garlic, two large jalapeño peppers (seeds included), and one medium yellow bell pepper. Will probably add another jalapeño pepper and a green bell pepper next time (veggie lover). - substituted Monterey Jack cheese for pepper jack, per another reviewer's suggestion - covered dish with aluminum foil before baking I usually get tired of eating the same thing more than 2 or 3 times in a week (partly why I wanted a freezer friendly meal), but I've already eaten half of it and am nowhere close to sick of it!"

I did make one change: put the rice and water in the pan first, uncooked after preparing the chicken (because I wanted to use only one pan). I added 35 minutes to cooking time to make sure all the water was absorbed by the rice (timed to make sure rice was fully cooked). But otherwise, I followed the recipe faithfully - Added my own fresh salsa recipe on top when serving (onion, tomato, cilantro, seeded jalapeno, and a pinch of cumin), and added a side of steamed broccoli, and a good meal was had by all."

He cooked the rice for me in the instapot and added the onions when he cooked the rice. We also added a can of drained whole corn. We mixed the rice, onions and corn with the soup mixture. Did a layer of rice mixture, lauer of chicken cheese then rice mixture topped off with more cheese. Super easy and tasty."

Cook 1 and 1/2 cups brown rice in a large pot. Mix cooked chicken and rice. Mix in about 6 oz shredded cheddar, about 4 oz shredded pepper jack, and 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and one can of mild Rotel tomatoes. Mix very well and place in greased/buttered baking dish. 350 oven about 30 minutes. When bubbly, top with another 2oz each of cheddar and pepper jack until all melty. Yum! Basically cooking what needs cooked and then just mixing it all together, No layering, easy and just as tasty!"

I think the level of spiciness depends on the salsa you use. I used mild. I also used 2 cups of rice that I had frozen. (Make a big batch in the Instant Pot and save it for later in the freezer.) I also used 2 cups of Costco precooked rotisserie chicken. These 2 steps saved a lot of time and effort. My husband had seconds each time I served it. That's what I consider a success."

I used hot salsa, (may try spicy green instead of red next time), and at least a tablespoon of garlic and a teaspoon of cumin. I didn't have it, but next time I'll replace the mushroom soup with a 1/2 or full cup of Mexican crema. I chopped up pickled jalapenos and sprinkled them on top. It was very tasty, and worth making again. I also think that next time I'll sprinkle taco seasoning over the rice before putting the chicken in."

I made a couple of modifications...I used a rotisserie chicken (shredded), and I used medium salsa instead of mild. I mixed the soup mixture in with the chicken before spreading. I also made this into more of a “lasagna” by layering flour tortillas in as well. I topped mine with sour cream &amp; my husband topped his with guacamole, and we both had a few pickled jalapeños and a side of blue corn chips. Our son ate it as-is with a side of chips. It seemed to be lacking just a little bit of freshness, but I’m not sure what else I would change to bring that to the dish...maybe top with lettuce &amp; tomato. All in all, I think this one will be added to our Sunday casserole rotation."

His Majesty actually made this and was so proud of himself. We like a little spice, so we are thinking about increasing the salsa next time, and perhaps using a medium or spicy salsa instead, or adding a bit of hot paprika, ancho or chipotle chili spice to kick it up a bit. We're definitely making this again! For any make ahead cooks out there - we will be experimenting with making this then vacuum packing the container and freezing. Our plan is to take it camping then throwing the frozen casserole into a pot of water and bringing it up to a boil. Easy heat and eat. We'll report once we've tried it. Thanks Gweneth for a great recipe that my hubby wants to make himself. It's a real keeper of a recipe."

Here are the changes I made. I used 2 packs of Knorr Spanish Rice. I used 2 cans of Kirkland brand chicken. I sauteed the chicken in olive oil along with onions and green peppers. I combined cream of chicken soup and the salsa and added that to the chicken mixture. Tossed in a can of drained black beans and fire roasted corn. Topped with crushed Doritos and Mexican style cheese. Covered with foil and baked 40 minutes. I omitted the sour cream because I'm lactose intolerant. Hubby and kids added it to theirs. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing."

I used a black bean and corn salsa mmh. I also used 2 cream of mushroom instead of chicken. Over all this was good. I also saw no need in layering all this separately. Once the chicken was done I added the other ingredients followed by the rice. I did layer with Cheese in the middle. My husband and son liked it which is saying a lot. I still thought it was slightly bland. I topped it off with a little salsa and sour cream which did the trick. Next time I make it I will tweak it a little more and either do more salsa or take out 1 can of soup. I’m thinking take a can of soup out. Over all it is a good recipe!"
