The were like a cross between a French fry and fried potatoes. Love the taste and the addition of butter. My husband said we will be having these again instead of regular fried potatoes. There is a definite difference between fried taters and these with butter. Will also try with peanut oil and butter."

You should use alot more oil so you can make the frying process quicker. Especially if you cut your potatoes thicker. I hope y'all enjoy eating and making these!"

"reviewBody": "Wasn't a fan of these overall. Seemed more like greasy home fries. I precut my potatoes and kept in cold water until I was ready to cook them. Dried the potatoes thoroughly and proceeded with the recipe. It definitely does not take 20-25 minutes per batch to fry. I did drain on paper towels and they seemed to crisp more, but then seemed a bit soggy/limp after. Maybe I did something wrong? Sorry, but this simply wasn't for us."

I didn't measure the oil or butter--just eyeballed both and put in what I thought would be half as I was only going to cook so many of the potatoes I had pared and cut up. They turned out pretty well. I put a lid on the pan and set the timer in 5-minute increments so I could check on them and flipped them about halfway through. I didn't have the cracked pepper or coarse sea salt so just used regular salt and pepper (although I normally don't put pepper on potatoes). Will make these again."

It was harder than deep fried fries and I had to turn them all individually and keep watch over them to get evenly cooked sides. I had some confusion understanding how to cut the potato into 1/2 inch circles. My husband didn't like these at all but he isn't a french fry fan. I loved them and made 3 potatoes for the 2 of us and it was just right. Thanks Miskyn, these were great!"

You do need to keep stirring to evenly cook and I got pretty hot doing that...much better cooking outdoors."
