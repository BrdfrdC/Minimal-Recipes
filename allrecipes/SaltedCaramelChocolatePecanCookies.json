I didn't want to waste ingredients- so I pressed each spoonful into a ball and carefully put a indentation in. Once you get to this point- chocolate and caramel can cover anything- BUT the dough portion does not work."

"reviewBody": "Delicious! A crowd favorite! Three adjustments needed. 1. Like the other reviewers, I added 1/2 cup less flour. 2. AND...the recipe listed is incorrect. It says to add half the amount of butter than it shows in the video. At first I followed the recipe and the flour was a crumbly mess. I then watched the video and saw they added twice as much butter. I added it to my dry flour mixture and it turned out perfectly. 3. Thankfully, I added about 1 teaspoon rather than a tablespoon of oil to the chocolate because it made the chocolate too thin to dry. Next time I won't add the oil. I don't think it's necessary."

After I scooped out batter &amp; attempted roll into a ball they just crumbled into pieces. So, instead I squeezed them into a ball shape. Next time will DEFINITELY CUT BACK ON THE FLOUR. In addition I used 3x more nuts to roll the batter in"

These cookies are very easy to make and they turned out exactly as pictured. This is a firm shortbread pecan sandy type cookie. I halved the recipe and added about 2 Tbsp of flour due to high altitude but I'm not sure it was necessary...mostly it's out of habit. I also had leftover prepared caramel for apple dipping so I substituted that for the caramels and cream. Taste was great, but I'm betting the real caramels and cream are even better. I also baked these on parchment for easy clean up. Thanks for posting... I look forward to making more!"

And press with a spoon after they come out of the oven cause obviously they will be hot to touch. Overall the process wasnâ€™t too bad. They came out really good and Iâ€™m not a huge sweets fan. Nor do I really love caramel, but I am making these for someone else. My 11 year old loved them. I did half pecan rolled and half almond rolled, because I thought I had enough pecans. Wrong. Oh well. Both came out very good. Recommend drizzling the chocolate with a fork. I tried a spoon and got globs. #notabaker"
