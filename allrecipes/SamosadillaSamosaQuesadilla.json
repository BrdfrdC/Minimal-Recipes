"reviewBody": "This recipe got my creative juices flowing!! I used low-carb tortillas and cut them in half, so I could make individual triangles. I made the filling, but I added chopped broccoli because I only had a few peas. I made my own garam masala and ground my own cardamom. To assemble the samosas, I used 1 1/2 T of filling at one end of the halved tortilla, then I wet the edges of the tortilla, folded it over and pressed the edges with a wet fork. I pan fried them in a light layer of vegetable oil for 2 minutes each side. I made a Mayo-sour cream dip with curry, garam masala, cilantro, turmeric and cayenne. Delicious!!"

I also made a tamarind chutney like the ones served in many Indian restaurants. The sour dipping sauce included in this recipe juxtaposed to the tamarind sauce was a nice contrast."

"reviewBody": "Wow, who knew you could simplify the samosa process by making it into a quesadilla?! I still love a good, deep-fried samosa, but this is a delicious alternative for when I just don't have time for all that (which is most of the time!). I was a bit nervous on the spice level and cut back the cayenne to a 1/4 tsp. It definitely still had a good kick, but was just right for my taste buds which tend to be a bit on the wimpy side. I did not make the sauce as I had a bottle of tamarind sauce from the Indian grocery in the fridge. I'm a major fan - I'll be making samosadillas often! Thanks Chef John!!!"

The ingredients all come together in a delicious way. I'm not sure if it's because we used potatoes from our garden that everything turned out so great. We kept to the recipe, except I have a ton of pepper plants and I don't know if any are serranos, but I know that they are hot, so I might have used a thai chili pepper of some sort... Anyhow the result was amazing and the sauce... OMG! The sauce was so flavorful! Definitely keeping this as a regular. Thanks Chef John!"
