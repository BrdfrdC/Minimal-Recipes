I go to a local farmers market and have tried all the samosas for sale and these ones are comparable. In fact they are better than half of the vendor's ones. Fabulous! If you are having trouble with the dough you can use wonton wrappers for mini samosas or egg roll wrappers for larger ones, however they are not very authentic."

"reviewBody": "I was having my doubts about the dough mid way through making it. I ended up using more water to get the dough more \"elastic\" - I was reaching almost a full cup but then I just stopped and dealt with it as is, for fear up messing up the entire recipe. The meat (beef not lamb) cooked fine. Smelled even better. But when I had to add it to 4\" \"half circles\" I laughed. No way that can be done is such a small tiny bit of space (not without taking an hour to assemble them/using all the dough called for). So I started making bigger circles, but half way through THAT I noticed that the \"completed\" ones sitting out waiting to be fried were oozing some liquid. They were not by any means full or stuffed. But the oiliness from the beef makings made the seals open. I tried to fix them but I made it worse. Next time someone might take the time to follow their own recipe and make sure the instructions are well written and yield good results. *I'm now going to try and find a recipe to use for that left over samosa beef*"

I only had enough dough for 16 samosas because the circles were too small to cut in half, so I made them in the shape of pierogies. I threw some finely diced potatoes in th the meat which was a nive touch."

Perfect blend of spices, and given that it's a somewhat lengthy process the end result is worth the time. Also - we had to add a lot of extra water to get the dough to be able to be kneading, probably more than twice as much water as is called for in the recipe. This is kid friendly when it comes to making the samosas - but not the frying parts of course."
