I make it as stated except I leave out the Maraschinos and use a $10-$12 bottle of Spanish Riojo wine and cut with lime La croix before serving for those that want less alcohol. I always make a double batch and it is easily gone. As others have mentioned it is very important to give it time to marinate. If you try to serve it right away you will be disappointed."

"reviewBody": "I don’t like wine. Made merely palatable by most sangrias I have had. It all tastes like rotten grapes. But my sister in-law gave me this bottle of red wine that sat unused for over a year. But during the social isolation period of 2020, I figured what the $&amp;@? I will make some sangria. So I had to use what I had in the house. Bourbon in place of brandy, lemonade mix (in a cup of water, used 1/3 c in recipe) in place of frozen concentrate, and no soda water which I always thought watered it down anyway. Results.... amazing! A use of wine I can get behind. I added a tablespoon of sugar dissolved in a cup of the mix the next day, to break up the tartness from the lemon. If you prefer a sweeter sangria you will want to add some sweeter elements, this is bold, reminiscent of port."

Absolute crowd fave at every party."

This will definitely become a motorhoming staple."

I use inexpensive red blend wines, doesn't matter what kind, they all come out great... I don't add the white sugar, you don't need to... and I use a single serve bottle of 7UP (instead of carbonated water) for the carbonation and sweetness and I add it right before serving... I also cut up all kinds of fruits to add, not just the orange, lemon, &amp; lime as the recipe lists... I use apples, strawberries, peaches, etc... Again, it doesn't really matter... this recipe allows you the freedom to play around without screwing it up AT ALL... I will say making it the night before does seem to make a difference to the complexity of the flavors... But I've also made it and served it 15 minutes later because someone asked me to make 'that awesome sangria' and it's still fantastic!!"

"reviewBody": "Excellent sangria recipe! I made it as listed, and chose the option to not use the sugar, and used ginger ale instead of club soda. The brandy I chose was black cherry brandy. Threw some frozen strawberries in too. Made it the day before (added the ginger ale just before serving). It was delicious... and dangerous! LOL! This stuff tastes like punch but packs quite a punch! I'll definitely make this again. Next time, I'll cut the lemons, limes, and oranges into smaller pieces... while they looked pretty in rounds, they made it difficult to put some fruit in to each person's glass, and the smaller fruit was stuck at the bottom of the pitcher. By cutting them smaller it will be easier to use a slotted spoon to put some fruit in each person's glass before/after pouring."

Do not skip any ingredients. It will not disappoint."

"reviewBody": "Delicious and very strong! I didn't have frozen lemonade concentrate and left that out. I added fresh apple and blackberries. I used 2 bottles of semi-sweet red and 1 bottle sweet red wine (nothing fancy!) and halved the sugar. I let this sit overnight and added 2 cups of carbonated water (used my Soda Stream) in the morning. I tripled the recipe for approx. 15 people and this was a huge HIT. It was gone only halfway through the party and people were asking me to make more! The flavors and fruit come together beautifully in a rich, deep red color. \n\nI was not expecting this to be so strong though, you can't really taste how strong it is. Definitely a creeper! I think I could easily make this using half the triple sec and brandy and still have it taste delicious. I plan on adding more fresh fruit next time around. Great recipe!"

The club soda makes it a spritzer lighter version so some folks didn’t use it.\nAfter cutting the fruit I sprinkled it with sugar and let it soak a few hours then I made the sangria and poured it all in a large pitcher.

The ginger ale added a subtle taste and a little fiz when added just before serving. The fruits were sweetened over night and we ate them, even the lemons slices, too, after we tossed back the drinks. Easy to make and impressive when served in fancy glasses. This is a fun drink to serve with tapas or your favorite appetizers."
