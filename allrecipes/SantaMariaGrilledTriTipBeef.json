It is served with salsa, not pesto sauce or orange sauce. It's also served with garlic bread, green salad, and pinquito beans (which are becoming harder to find). The beef must also be cut correctly."

Chef John has taken a lot of work out of some of the more involved recipes for this roast. It just really works! I have used this recipe at least twice a month on my 20 year old Weber charcoal grill since Chef John first published this variation. My only suggestion is to use lump charcoal as opposed to briquetts."

"reviewBody": "I mixed everything into a ziploc bag before reading directions- been cooking 40 years plus- anyway, the mustard,vinegar,oil went in with the spices let it come together for 18 hours first time I made it and 12 the second time. Longer is better. I also prepared it over charcoal just made sure flame was hot but not going to burn the beef, turned it according to Chef John times and it was perfect. Set a timer and donâ€™t leave it because fire can flame up and burn your delicious food. I fried up corn tortillas in peanut oil, chopped cilantro tomatoes seeded, chopped onion it was perfect. I also added the marinade on the meat while it was on the grill each time I turned the beef, with the exception of the last 10 minutes, I didnâ€™t want raw meat juices on my dinner. I donâ€™t care for paprika so used 1/2 smoked paprika and added Chipotle 1/2tsp leaving out cayenne as the first time I made it according to recipe, it was missing a little something, this made a big difference. Enjoy"

Had some trouble with the marinade causing the gas grill to flame up. Should be corrected by dabbing on instead of pouring. Need to get a meat mop for this. Cooked a 2-lb roast for 20 minutes on high, flipping it 5 times, and it was perfect medium rare! This is a very affordable cut of meat and prepared like this it's every bit as good as a fine, expensive steak!"

Maybe 25 minutes prep with easily accessible ingredients. \n\nRub and brush on marinade are terrific. We're major tri-tip fans (California!) and often get Santa Maria style from market. This is better and with a cheaper cut, where you cut away the fat, it's easily better than marinade TT you get in store.\n\nMake sure you pull Tri Tip off grill at about 120 - 123 F. After about 115 temp rises rapidly after that so keep an eye on it. No more than 2.5 minutes at that point."

My roast had a thick fat layer on one side which we left on top and it made a crispy flavorful crust. However it was pouring rain n this day, so we switched to the oven roasted version Chef John has on here, and skipped the basting sauce. It was just wonderful and we canâ€™t wait to try it again on the grill with the sauce. We will be using this rub for other beef, too!"

This recipe was so outstanding good that tri-tip is now one of our favorite cuts of beef. The only change I made was that I cut the amount of salt by half (watching our sodium content). My husband seared it as directed in the video, but finished cooking it indirectly thereafter. Topped it with a cherry tomato relish. Served with Chef John's Santa Maria Style Beans, FrackFamily5's Grilled Salt and Pepper Bread, and a salad. Will be making this recipe and meal again. Thanks for the recipe!"

I cooked it on a gas grill at about 500*F for about 30 minutes turning and basting just like the recipe called for. I will definitely cook it again. it was incredibly juicy and had a range if levels from medium well at the edges to medium rare in the center."

"reviewBody": "I made this with a 2.8 lb tri-tip roast. It was good but not amazing as I was hoping. A couple things fell short for me flavor-wise, and it wasn't as easy to grill as it appeared to be in the video. I'm going to try it a few more times though. \n\nThe amount of rub just barely covered the roast. If I make it again I would double all of the ingredients except the salt. You will end up with more than you need but you can just toss the extra.\n\nGrilling was tougher than expected. The juice from the roast and the basting sauce continually fell into the fire causing the flame to rise. The roast caught on fire several times. So I had to move it over to the other side of the grill, wait for the flame to go down, then move it back over. I understand the video shows a high flame, but if I kept the roast in that high of a flame for whole time it would have been charcoal on the outside.\n\nIt took 35-40 min to cook. That could be because it was 0.3 lbs more and/or because I had to keep moving it aside. I definitely recommend using a meat thermometer. You won't be able to tell when it is done from looking at the exterior or by the amt of cooking time. \n\nIn the end, the roast was flavorful. The ends were well done and the middle was medium, just like the video. The outside was crispy and tasty. Though next time I would double the ingredients except for the salt.\n\nOne small modification was that I replaced paprika with chili powder because of a food allergy."

I saved this video recipe to that pretty awesome web clipping app that grabbed the video and the recipe nicely formatted. Then went belly up w/o silicone valley investors. Evernote/OneNote and recipe software apps like AR/BO nicely format recipes, though. So glad it's here on AR!\nThis is DELICIOUS! The part I have to remember is to start the rub and get the meat up to room temperature before it's time to start cooking it on the grill. The mix of spices just get into the meat and it's so darn good. \nIt's amazing when I follow the directions. Better than any restaurant! Yummy!!!! I've used this for years, now!"

Let it sit for about 20 hours in the fridge with the seasoning. When flipping every 4 mins I rotated just a tad. I had a water gun ready for flare ups. Grill heat was high till 8 mins then med high for another 24. Came out med well juicey and perfect for my family tastes. Didnâ€™t cut into till after a 10 min rest. Served with grilled potatoes, grilled zucchini and maple baked beans."

Juicy and delicious! And not too salty - though I didn't follow the recipe exactly for the rub - I didn't have some ingredients, but I had a Trader Joe's Seasoning Salt that had most, plus a few extras, and I added rosemary, sage, dill, and a little extra salt - actually, I think that was the rub from the Oregon herb tri-tip rub recipe I found on here, but whatever - it was delicious! I didn't have red wine vinegar for the basting, so I added a little red wine to the white wine vinegar mixture. And we ran out of propane during pre-heating and didn't notice until we put the tri tip on the grill - we changed, put it up to high, and didn't baste until the 3rd flip when it was up to temp, and it still turned out great!\n\nNext time we're making this for guests and serving Margaritas with it!"

It is very difficult to keep it over a hot direct fire for so long (I cooked it 24 total minutes, 4 minutes a side basting every turn) if you're like me and usually cook a ribeye but my oh my it sure was worth it. I let it rest a full 20 minutes after I pulled it from the grill tented in aluminum foil and it was worth the wait. \n\nDon't forget to cut across the grain! I ended up cutting mine into two pieces because the grains on my cut changed direction. \n\nP.S. if you're hesitant to use rosemary because it isn't a favorite spice like me just go for it! The rosemary flavor is very subtle and pairs perfectly with the red wine vinegar baste!"

Even my 3 year old granddaughter ate it up. \n\nI was so unsure of the vinegar mix. I just wanted to follow the recipe, so I actually made a special trip to buy apple cider vinegar.
