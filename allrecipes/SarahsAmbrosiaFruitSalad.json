Donâ€™t skip the coconut, it lends a bit of a chewy texture, varying textures being the main component of this salad. Iâ€™ve made it with fresh blueberries, dried cranberries instead of coconut, using the light sour cream gives the salad a slimmer calorie count but whatever you do, donâ€™t (ever) skip the mini marshmallows!"

"reviewBody": "Really yummy! We use Greek yogurt instead of sour cream - I used about 10 ounces of plain Greek yogurt plus a 10 oz container of thawed cool whip. Gave a great fluffy texture. I'd made this recipe before and it was a bit soupy, so I made sure to drain the fruit really well. The natural juices that are released when the salad is stirred will add juicy sweetness. We have a couple of non-coconut, so I left it out this time. Still turned out great, but I think the coconut would've helped soak up some of the liquid. I think the cool whip did the job this time around, adding the fluffy texture without too much extra flavor or sweetness. I used pineapple chunks, they were too big. Gotta hunt down the tidbits..."

One of my sisters uses vanilla pudding (straight out the box) instead of cool whip, yogurt or sour cream. Best when refrigerated at least 24 hours."
