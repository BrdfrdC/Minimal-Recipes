"reviewBody": "The recipe was delicious and the texture was very light. The reason I give 4 stars is because I made quite a few small changes and as such I can't evaluate the recipe alone. The changes I made are as follows:\n - Bake at 325¬∞ for 30 minutes\n - 1/2 cup of sugar and 2 egg yolks, with 1 egg white\n - 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and pinches of cloves, nutmeg, allspice, ginger, and cinnamon added to the finished batter before pouring\n - About 3/4 teaspoon baking soda (I left a bit in my teaspoon) instead of the full teaspoon and about 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder (also an estimate) added. This reduces the baking soda flavor that is common in banana bread."

But, I was concerned that I didn't have enough mashed banana so added about a 1/4 cup applesauce. I also inadvertently chopped a bit too many walnuts and didn't want to waste anything. I had about a 1/3 cup of walnuts. I don't think either of these made any significant difference to flavour or texture so I will rate it the same as I would have otherwise. My husband and I both thought they were very good. The texture was nice. I will make them again."

We omitted the walnuts as we're not a family that enjoys any form of nuts in our baked goods! We may substitute coconut sugar next time we make as founf them quite sweet or will adjust the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup and 1 tsp of vanilla."

"reviewBody": "I‚Äôve made these about 20 times so far. I first made these muffins using mini chocolate chips instead of walnuts and adding cinnamon sugar to the tops before baking. They were fantastic!Here‚Äôs where the happy accident happened.Typically, some of the cinnamon sugar spills off when handling. One day, I prepared a batch early and left the unbaked muffins on the counter for several hours. After baking, the cinnamon became a crunchy topping. The guests raved about them (at three different brunches!) and thought, because of the fancy topping, that they were from a bakery.Apparently the cinnamon sugar had soaked up liquid from the batter while sitting out and this formed the crunchy topping. So now, rather than leave them out for several hours, I spritz the cinnamon sugar a few times with water before baking."
