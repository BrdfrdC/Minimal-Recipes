And I added extra garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, and chili powder, and salted \"to taste\" as I cooked it. I used a can of Rotel tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. The cooking method was \"spot on\" and the chicken was very juicy. Since I didn't use tomato sauce, I added a little chicken broth when the pan started getting dry. It was great!"

Once cooked (no red inside) pull the chicken from the pot to a cutting board. The chicken is so soft at that you can use to dinner forks to shred the chicken. It's not as easy as a processor, but if you don't have one this works just fine. Enjoy!!"

"reviewBody": "First I make as instructed in order to give an accurate rating. It was okay, but it was bland to me. I have some suggestions for those that may feel something is missing. Use boneless skinless chicken thighs instead, it's more melt in your mouth tender and has more flavor due to it being the fatty part of the chicken. It's also not as costly as breast. Always remember the best chicken meat to add to compliment dishes that require added condiments such as this, a stirfry, or chicken casserole rice or noodle or dumpling dishes choose short thighs. It's more cost effective if you aren't a cook and keep a cabinet full of spices on hand, to just buy McCormick season package and keep them on hand. Take up less space too. I redid this using short thighs and a package of McCormick fajita season. I also used a salsa instead of tomato sauce, I added 2 tsp of minced garlic. I used my processor to finely chop a small onion. Stirfry the garlic and onion in the pan with 2 tbs of cooking oil or bacon fat until onion start to look iridescent then add cooked shredded chicken and follow McCormick packet instructions."

I simply added the chicken and spices and tomato to the onion and cooked on low for 10 minutes to blend all the flavours together. The chicken was a bit bland but as you are adding all your taco toppings it was the perfect base from which to build upon. My family loved it. Would make this again."

I followed all directions but added a bit of water at the end for simmering because the chicken was dry. Even after the tomato sauce. I would reserve some of the water from boiling the chicken and use to moisten it a bit while simmering. Was simple and flavorful. I used for tacos, then quesadillas and ultimately sopa da fideo."

We were at the end of a pay period, so very low on funds and doing the “let’s see what we have already” thing, in order to make up a recipe and avoid a grocery run. I typed in a search for shredded chicken tacos and this was the first thing that came up. I tweaked it abit due to not having everything listed and it was surprisingly good! For something that is so simple, it was popular with everyone. I didn’t have onions, so used a teaspoon of onion powder, added a tsp. If garlic powder, and put 1/4 tsp. of the other listed ingredients and diluted tomato paste to make sauce, and added some salt, and served on hamburger buns with lettuce. Was gone within a few minutes! Thank you for posting this recipe."

The general idea of the process as depicted in this recipe is good, and that is what I'm rating (in other words, I didn't follow through with the rest of the taco seasoning), however, the other recipe that I saw suggested boiling/simmering the chicken in chicken broth, reducing the broth after the chicken is done, and storing the chicken in the reduced broth. I think that that helped to keep the chicken soft and moist. All in all, not a bad recipe."

"reviewBody": "Very good and easy to make. Read through the reviews to find Holiday Baker's comments on this recipe. It seems this was meant to be basic and adjustable to taste preferences, hence the reference to 'pinches' of dry ingredients. For 1.5 lb chicken breasts, I used about 1.5 tbsp home made taco seasoning since I ran out of chili powder. I also added 4-5 oz Herdez salsa-medium (canned) -- yes, I was out of tomato sauce too and was too tired to puree the the salsa, also thinking this would result in enough liquid. I ended up adding about 1/2 cup water. This recipe serves as a good base though for using chicken breasts for tacos instead of slow cooker. Made this dish along side \"Best Spanish Rice\" (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/33385/best-spanish-rice). UPDATE 2.9.18: Still making this and love it! I usually boil the chicken with 2-3 garlic cloves, 1/4-1/2 white or spanish onion (quartered), bay leaf, 4 whole pepper corns, and salt. Reserve broth to be used in other dishes. Add about 1/4-1/2 cup chicken broth to the skillet, depending on how much meat I use and if I finely shredded the meat. Otherwise, the meat might seem dry. Add more tomato sauce as needed (in a pinch use canned/jarred salsa)...you'll be able to tell if more sauce is needed as you stir all to combine. You don't want too much liquid, but don't want it dry either. This recipe remains my go to for super quick and easy chicken tacos and the versatility of it is awesome! Thank you again for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I had a lot of gardening to do (it's July) so I put a couple of chicken breasts in the crock pot and the rest of the ingredients, it didn't seem like enough seasonings for our tastes so I added a half envelope of Old El PasoTaco Seasoning. When we were ready for dinner I put about a half cup of the shredded mixture on a large flour wrap, some chopped green onion, a small handful of shredded Monteray Jack and a few dabs of cream cheese then topped with another wrap to make Quesadillas. I put it in a hinged rack about 14 inches in diameter so it could be flipped over on the grill without falling apart. Topped with sour cream, a sprinkle of cilantro. Served with a green salad of chopped Romain, chopped tomato, sliced red onion and shopped avocado with a simple dressing. So Good and So Easy. I'm not sure who mentioned making Quesadillas with this mixture but it was a good idea, Thanks a bunch"

Also 2 pressed cloves of garlic, diced colored peppers, tossed in some canned rinsed black beans and 1/2c. chicken broth, splash of strong coffee, dash of worchestershire, then made my flavour twist with 1/4c. smoky BBQ sauce. A drizzle of maple syrup completed my dinner direction of delicious shredded chicken sitting on lettuce on a toasted bun topped with cheddar &amp; a green salad on the side. This would also be tasty in a bowl with assorted toppings and using tortilla chips to scoop up, as a snack idea. Letting it simmer on low is the key to flavour. Be as fancy as you like or as time permits! I believe most recipes are guidelines only! Enjoy!"

So, I boiled the chicken meat and shredded it like directed but instead of simmering in the pot. I combined the seasonings, onion and tomato sauce in the bottom of a slow cooker along with some garlic and a few splashes of chicken broth. I then added the shredded chicken and mixed it well. I While I prepared everything else, I set my slow cooker on 3 hours on low and let it stay on warm to keep it heated. Turned out WONDERFUL! I had leftovers in which I made a vegetable &amp; chicken soup out of. This is versatile and can be used in lots of different things, not only some tasty tacos... Thanks Baker Bee! :)"

I also add some onions &amp; garlic to the water when cooking the chicken and save the broth, then add some of it to the shredded chicken mixture and simmer it down. \n\nAlternate serving suggestion: use this filling to make enchiladas by rolling it in flour tortillas. Put 4-5 enchiladas in a greased baking dish, cover with homemade salsa and shredded cheese, then bake at 400 or so until cheese melts. Serve with mashed sweet potatoes and black beans on the side. (Add chopped green chiles to your mashed sweet potatoes for extra Mex flavor.)\n\nIt is also possible to use canned chicken as a shortcut in this recipe (saves a lot of prep time) but it's not as good as fresh shredded chicken. If you do go for the shortcut, be sure to buy some good canned chicken, season the heck out of it and simmer it a long time."

I intended this to be quicker than 6 hour crock-pot recipes, which was all I kept finding, and mild enough for children or adults. It shreds very easily and works great in a hard shell taco with lettuce, tomato, and cheese. Not an authentic recipe for shredded taco chicken, but a quick method for those pinched for time and want a healthier option, in addition to, or to serve with, traditional ground beef. Thank you for trying my recipe and this very easy method of cooking shredded chicken!"
