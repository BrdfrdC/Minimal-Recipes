I thought what the heck, I was going to throw them out anyway. I made exactly as recipe called for using 8 of the small apples as they would suffice for 4 regular sized. It turned out DELICIOUS. Easy and I didn't waste those apples. For some reason applesauce has really increased in price -- so glad I used those apples up for applesauce. This is a WINNER!"

Instead of using sugar water, apple juice or cider would be a great improvement. Maybe with maple syrup, lemon juice, or nutmeg as options too. The biggest issue with this recipe is that it doesn’t specify the size of the apples though"

So obviously, there are a few thing that I have changed up. First, I use at least two different kinds of apples. As Fujis are my favorite, I always use those and then whatever else I have lying around. Most often it’s the apples you get at Panera because I don’t really like them, but they are great mixed in with other apples. Additionally, I do not add sugar. For my pallet the Fujis are sweet enough. I also add a small smidgeon of sea salt and finally, I squeeze in one lime or lemon wedge, either is fine; I just like to add a bit of acidity. Get creative!"

"reviewBody": "Loved it but I did tweak a little. I added a bit more sugar and did a half and half of white and light brown. After it cooled I used our ninja blender to blend instead of mashing because even after 20 mins I was having a difficult time getting a good texture. The blender made it REALLY smooth so of you like it chunky you're better of mashing. For us, the smooth apple sauce was amazing. Everyone loved it (two picky teen Girls included) and we've made it to add to pork chops or just to have as a snack.. Great recipe!"

My 2 year old niece loves this applesauce. When guests come over and it's served, they ask what brand and surprised it's homemade. Will definitely be making this again."

I used about 3/4c water, 6tbsp of sugar substitute (Swerve), and just sprinkled cinnamon as to not overdo it. I simmered for about 30min and I didn't need to mash a thing- all I did was stir and the apples mushed themselves all up. It's gotten raving reviews so far and I plan to make another batch tomorrow as well. This is my new go-to applesauce recipe. Do yourself a favor and make it!"

I doubled the recipe except for: water used 1 cup.\nChanges I made:\nInstead of Cinnamon I used Apple Pie Spice.\nInstead of sugar, I used Stevia extract which is 8 to 1 as a sugar replacement. I actually used 1/2 tsp. and half a packet of 5 gs. of Sugar in the Raw.\nWhen water is almost reduced, I added a sprinkle of cinnamon and simmered until ready to remove from heat.\nMade just over 4 cups of homemade applesauce. Not overly sweet.\nWould be wonderful for diabetics and dieters."

I will say though- that from making it for my daughter when she was a baby, I learned that if you steam them first And then blend and combine ingredients, you get the most nutrition from the apples! So I would personally recommend doing that instead."

"reviewBody": "So yummy!! I’ve made this fun recipe 2 times now and the first time I ate all of it in one night, (because it’s that good) and so the second time I doubled the recipe. I recommend adding slightly less water and cinnamon then called for, substitute half the white sugar for brown sugar and you definitely want to peel all the apples first and then chop them all together. Make sure to stir the mixture while it’s cooking sometimes because otherwise there is a chance it could boil over. It’s unlikely so don’t worry. Also, peeling and cutting the apples definitely took the longest, so get started on that right away! Wonderful recipe, especially since I have braces right now and it’s hard to find things to eat Thank you!!"
