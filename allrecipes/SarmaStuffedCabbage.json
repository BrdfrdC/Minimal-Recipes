She used only ground beef (I tried lean once and the meat was too hard, less flavorful, I only use 20% now) and ground pork sausage. She also didn’t freeze the cabbage first. I think I read somewhere that freezing it makes working with the cabbage easier? I’ll have to Google that one. I just boil a whole fresh cabbage and let the leaves fall off naturally."

Unfortunately a few months back her Dad suffer a stoke, and is unable to communicate or look after herself. I made this tonight, for my wife, which she absolutely loved. It was so emotional eating this meal, she was cry tears of joy with every bite. I followed the recipe exactly, I just omitted the tomato juice. (For I don’t recall her father ever having tomato in his). Thank you once again for sharing this recipe."

When I ask him what would he like for dinner he often says \"SARMA\"... This is not a Serbian or Romanian recipe as some have said it is. There may be some variations that Serbs and Romanians would use, but this recipe is definitely Croatian."

Separate the cabbage leaves (this uses about 2 heads) in whatever way works best for you. Pare the thick vein. Put a spoonful of the lamb mixture in the center of the leaf. Fold and roll. Place in a stock pot with chicken broth. There should be enough stock to go to the top of the rolls. Cover &amp; boil. Turn down to simmer for about 3 hours. 1 tablespoon of sour cream goes on top of one cabbage roll. Good leftovers, too."
