"reviewBody": "I used a similar method as another Reviewer, \"camprunfarm.\" Used the slicing disc on my food processor, packed in a food grade bucket (disinfected with a diluted bleach solution and rinsed really well). I used a plastic canister as a muddler to do the packing - this covered a lot of area instead of using a spoon or dowel. I always use sea salt. Topped with a heavy dinner plate and a jug of water w/lid to hold everything below the brine, and used an inverted large bowl as a lid for the bucket, then covered with a heavy bath towel to keep it dark. Checked it daily; no scum ever formed! I've packed it in individual jars before now, but with the jars you have to pack it down every day to keep it below the brine so nothing gunky will form. :-) Bucket method is awesome when processing 3 or more heads of cabbage at once, and you can get one at your local hardware store for only a few bucks."
