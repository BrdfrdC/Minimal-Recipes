The only additional ingredients I add are 1/2 cup parmigiana cheese, go garlic powder, paprika and Cajun seasoning..I particularly liked it because of the 2 cups of the biscuit mix. Most of the other online recipes call for 3 cups of biscuit mix which makes the sausage balls a bit dry and flavorless, in my opinion.. I have 3 children with spouses and 11 grandchildren who rave over them. You won’t ever regret taking an hour of your time to make and bake these appetizers! Sincerely Erin"

"reviewBody": "It's not Christmas around here without at least a single batch of these. I've been making them yearly for over 20 years and here are the changes I make that make people say \"yours are always the best, Bev\": The hot variety of sausage for the bite. New York Sharp or Extra Sharp cheddar, grate it yourself because they dust the pre-shredded stuff with anti-caking powder. A little less than the full 2 cups of baking mix, they come out more moist and intensely flavored. 1 3/4 is good. Let the sausage sit out for 20 minutes before you work it so that it blends easier, and dump all ingredients into a gallon zip bag, squeeze out excess air, to mix together, it's less messy and one less bowl to wash. You'll know you're done when it releases cleanly from the inside of the bag. Cook on parchment paper or non-stick aluminum foil if you prefer a lined baking sheet, regular foil makes them stick too often. Let them sit and soak up all of that rendered fat as they cool. It's where the flavor is. Most of us cook things to our taste, and there are dozens of variations you can try, this is what works for me. They're probably going to disappear quickly no matter which way you make them."

"reviewBody": "Absolutely horrible. I am an experienced baker and cook, for the past 50 years. First of all, the proportions of cheese to meat and Bisquick are way off. 16 oz shredded block cheddar cheese = 4 cups cheese, mixed with a pound of sausage and 2 cups Bisquick. I mixed it well. The cheese took over and melted everywhere. This is so greasy, it's inedible. I used one Jimmy Dean sage sausage roll. All I can taste is cheese. I would have used half the amount of cheese, 2 cups (8 oz shredded) would have been much better. I'm annoyed that I spent $12 on ingredients and no one will touch it. Like lead balls of pure grease. Epic Fail."

Some people even tried adding milk.....EEEEWWWW...... Per pound of sausage, we only use 1 cup of bisquick, Hot sausage, a spash of worcestershire sauce, and one large pkg shredded sharp cheddar. About 30-35 min at 350 degrees, and they disappear in record time!!"

Finely chopped chives fresh or dried work well. Fresh can go right into the mix. If using dried, I pour 2-3 tablespoons of milk in a bowl with equal amount of dried chive, then let them reconstitute for about 10 minutes. There isn't an exact measurement to this. It is up to you on how much onion flavor you want. 2-3 tablespoons works quite well. 1:1 ratio."

I've also added chives, fennel seed, savory, sage, Chipoltle Tabasco, and onion and garlic powder. (Individually....not all at the same time). I've tried different cheeses too like smoked gouda or English cheddar but sharp cheddar is my favorite. I may try adding some blue cheese with the sharp cheddar to my next batch. There are so many variations to try I make these year round."

One cup Bisquick with One pound of sausage is enough because two cups of Bisquick made it difficult to mix and made the mixture too powdery and doughy. I’d also add an egg to bind the ingredients better and plus the egg adds some moisture. Adding the cheese after everything is mixed is a great idea because it mixes better."

The only user suggestions I used were to let the meat sit at room temp for 20 minutes before mixing, finely shred the cheese, and work the meat for a loooong time. These were so dry that my family refused to eat them. I however, truly loved the flavor and decided to give it a second go. If you found these to dry too it's very simple... reduce the biscuit mix! 1 1/4 cups seems to be the best ratio for us. This has become a regular go to for quick easy meals."

The water was to get rid of the powdery mix, which I blended with the sausage prior to adding the cheese. My tip is to use a small cookie scoop - faster than rolling each one. I made this the night before. Highly recommend this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe is certainly a good one. But be aware that if followed precisely then it’ll make very “biscuit-y” balls. If you like yours a tad more meaty/cheesy just cut the bisquick in half. I used 1 cup instead of 2 and it was perfect consistency for my personal tastes. Also, one other reviewer advised mixing the sausage and bisquick FIRST before adding the cheese. This is INVALUABLE advice. Way better to do it this way. Lastly, extra sharp cheddar is the way to go. Not overpowering at all but does a great job standing up to the sausage flavor for a well rounded taste."

Added 2 tablespoons of finely minced garlic and about a 1/4 cup Grated Parmesan Romano Cheese to the sausage before adding the bisquick and cheddar cheese. They were very tasty, but next time I will add 1/3 lb more sausage as I like a more pronounced sausage taste. It's a great basic recipe to make several different flavors for appetizers. Best of all you can make them ahead. Each batch yielded about 54 balls."

I definitely recommend either leaving the cheese out to get to room temperature or this was my \"hack.\" I used a metal mixing bowl but put it on top of the heated oven for about 5 minutes to kind of soften the cheese. The balls came out perfect after that! 3 stars but might be due to not using super flavorful sausage and used a mix of cheddar (super sharp-had to shred plus preshredded cheddar blend). I think maybe adding chives like another reviewer suggested might add some flavor."
