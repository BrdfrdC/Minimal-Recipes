I used hot Jimmy Dean sausage and added some diced red bell pepper and white onion cooked along with the sausage. I used fresh grated sharp cheddar cheese and Daisy 4% cottage cheese. I had a package of Simply Potatoe hash browns that I used with the melted butter in the bottom of the dish pressed down. I also added a small can of Ortega mild chilies. Three normal size eggs and only cooked the smaller size for 45 minutes. I served it with a cup of fresh chopped fruit and homemade banana nut bread. This would be good for either dinner or breakfast and I will definitely make it again."

"reviewBody": "This is a delicious recipe as-is, but I love how versatile this recipe is. We have chickens and often have more eggs than we know what to do with, and it is an easy way to use lots of eggs quickly. I usually double the number of eggs. It makes it go farther. I use the cubed hash browns sometimes, and I almost always add more hash browns, because there aren't enough to go up the sides of my casserole dish at 3 cups. I'll do 4-5 cups and just pour the butter over them in the casserole dish. I didn't have enough cottage cheese today and did half cottage cheese and half sour cream. That actually worked really well. You can add mushrooms, diced green chiles or rotel, spicy cheeses, etc. to give it a different type of deliciousness. If you double the eggs, just add a bit more of everything else... doesn't need to be precise measurements, but if you like precise measurements, just 1.5 everything else. Great recipe!"

I also used frozen hashbrowns, because why not! We did not prebake. We cooked onion with the sausage (white onion with ground sausage). \nUsed probably closer to 16oz of mixed cheeses for a little zing. \nIt turned out wonderful. Next time we will add more sausage as I think it needs another 1/2lb and it could be a bit creamier. Maybe more cottage cheese or sour cream?"

My sausage came from a butcher and didn't list all the spices so I added 2 cloves of garlic, sprinkled some sage powder and salt while cooking. I think I ended up shredding closer to 14 oz of mild cheddar cheese, but since when to people complain of too much cheese? I know I don't."

Made a couple changes..can’t stand cottage cheese, so sub’d cream of chicken soup (was thinking like a cheesy potato egg bake), which added awesome flavor!! Also sautéed leeks with the turkey sausage, and added some red pepper flakes to give it a little kick. We were so happy with how it turned out, felt like even a little more flavorful than my MIL’s (sorry Denise)! :)"

Don’t get me wrong, it is really good, but I think the ketchup or hot sauce would take it over the top. Great for a group. Love the cottage cheese. I cooked the sausage with a chopped onion and red bell pepper. Stored in the fridge overnight. Next day I greased a deep dish 9x13 and poured in a big bag of O’brien potatoes. In a separate bowl I beat 8 eggs and cream cheese. Then added sharp cheddar, and the sausage/onion/red pepper mix. Baked at 375 for an hour."

I seasoned the butter that you pour over them with chipotle seasoning, salt, pepper and garlic. I used 1/2 cup of cottage cheese and 1/2 cup of sour cream instead of all cottage cheese. i feel like some cream of mushroom soup would be delicious in this also. It was so good. Next time I will use more egg, and more veggies like peppers, spinach and maybe some tomatoes as well."

I'll add an extra half pound to a pound of meat and I have found it better to mix the potatoes in with everything else and to split it between a 9X11 pan and a smaller square cake pan. It's not as thick but makes it stay together after freezing and re-heating instead of splitting into layers and falling apart."

I can focus on getting the kids fed and ready and my husband and I can heat a slice of this up and take it to the game and have a delicious breakfast on the run. I have added chopped bell pepper and diced mushroom for variety. It's so Good! I also use 8 eggs and a bag of frozen shredded potatoes. Leftovers go great in my husbands lunch. He takes lunch around 10 am so it's a good meal (he works on a golf course). Its great to heat up after I get the kids off to school and Mama can sit back and enjoy :-)"

This was no different but 3 are adequate! \nBowl 1)\nI used a large bag of Ore-Ida shredded hash browns (about 5 cups), I followed others suggestions and buttered 13x9 glass dish and spread hash browns into it and let set up in oven for about 15 minutes. Added garlic powder, salt, pepper\nBowl 2)\n10 large eggs beaten, with salt and pepper to taste.( Biggest change because of large group.) \nBowl 3)\nI sauteed a freshly diced jalapeno with 1/4 cup purple onion with regular flavored pork sausage. Let it cool BEFORE adding to egg mixture! Fold into to hash brown dish. Took about 55 minutes to cook. The texture was beautiful, a little darker than I wanted, so I covered with foil for final minutes. Garnished with more shredded cheese(YES!) and served. LOVED by all 17 of my guests. Thanks for the recipe! No photos - it was gone!"

Thank you so much for a fantastic recipe! \n\nI had some cream cheese in my fridge I needed to use up, so I substituted the cottage cheese with 16 oz. of cream cheese - thinned a little with sour cream to get the same consistency. Next time I'm going to try the cottage cheese. I got some pre cut peppers and onions at the supermarket and sautéed them with the sausage. I also used the pre-shredded but not frozen hash browns - (like Simply Potatoes but used store brand instead) - and pre-baked the crust for 30 minutes. Topped it with cracker crumbs to keep the eggs really moist underneath and add some crunch.\n\nI mixed this all up the night before because I'm trying to prep to meals on nights I have the time to cook. My family was raving about it served up with flaky layers biscuits."

I prepped what i could the day before, then mixed and baked the casseroles the day I served. I cooked the sausage and poured off most of the fat and chilled it. I cooked double the onion in the remaining sausage fat and chilled it. Next morning I measured out the fat and added butter needed and tossed with potato cubes and baked in greased pans while I mixed remaining ingredients, substituting sharp cheddar, 9 large eggs, and adding 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 3/4 teaspoon pepper. Once in pan, I tossed well and baked. Even the kids were saying they loved it!"

So, it turned out wonderful.\nNext time I try it, I might add broccoli, as that is a husband favorite too. And, boy, was this easy. I'm excited to have been so successful with this dish.
