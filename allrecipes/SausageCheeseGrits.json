It got a big thumbs up from my hubby, who said it tasted very like a dish he often orders from that big waffle chain restaurant that we don't have in our town, which is great, cause that's what I was shooting for. I'm personally not terribly fond of grits, but I'll make it again for my hubby every couple of months or so, especially for cold winter mornings. I like the idea of being able to make it ahead and bake it after church. I also like the fact that it's not terribly high in calories for a relatively decadent dish. Thanks for sharing."

I had some Jimmy Dean turkey sausage links (two, thawed in the microwave) that I chopped up and tossed into the grits once they were done. I added a handful of shredded cheddar (in place of the gouda) and scrambled two eggs up with a little hot sauce, salt and pepper. The grit mixture went in the bottom of a bowl with the scrambled eggs on top. SO good! I will definitely make this again for a crowd. Thanks for the recipe!"
