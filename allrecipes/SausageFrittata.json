I had sausage crumbles leftover from breakfast burritos yesterday, so I diced up two small potatoes, put them in the microwave with a splash of water, covered and cooked for 5 minutes, stirring halfway through. Meanwhile, I had the sausage reheating in the skillet and mixed up the egg mixture. It's good as is, if not just a little bland, but we decided next time we will spice it up a little with a little salsa on top instead of diced onion and tomatoes. You could change it up to suit your mood."

"reviewBody": "This is very tasty, however I gave 4 stars and not 5 because I had to put my skillet under the broiler because after 17 minutes the middle of the skillet was far from done. I put the skillet on my stove's biggest burner and it still wouldn't cook. When I put my skillet under the broiler to cook the top it came out wonderful.\n\nI put my onions in the skillet while my sausage and potatoes cooked because raw onions on top just seemed odd. Having them sautéed with the sausage and potatoes gave great flavor. This is a great recipe because you can use it as a base and change so many things like which kind of cheese you use, adding veggies, etc. I would even make this with ham cubes instead of sausage in the future."

"reviewBody": "Link sausages sliced in 1/4\" slices pre-cooked in skillet works fine &amp; may be cheaper than the crumbles but does add an extra step. For a veggie version; omit potatoes but add 1 c. chpd zucchini, 1/2 c. each yellow onion &amp; red &amp; yellow bell pepper chpd. Top evenly with 1/3 c. crumbled goat cheese &amp; freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano chs; 1/4 c. fresh flat leaf parsley &amp; 1/4 c. fresh basil, sliced. Add 1 or 2 more egges plus add 1 c. heavy cream. Bake in 9x13 dish ahead of time at 400* oven for 25-30 min. or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. Serve immediately OR cover with foil &amp; chill until the next day (I have also frozen this frittata for up to one month). Re-warm in a 250* for 20-30 min. Fresh goat cheese is better than the pre-crumbled kind but it works too."

Then back to the pan and cook a bit more, loosen the edges and one more time under the broiler until it's slightly browned. I also used some good loose breakfast sausage from the butcher instead of pre packaged brand name sausage. VERY good recipe. Thanks for posting it!"
