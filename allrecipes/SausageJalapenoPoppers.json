The best way I have found to wrap with bacon is to microwave a couple of pieces at a time for 45 seconds and then pat off excess grease on paper towels. I then cut the bacon in half length wise and the in half cross wise giving you 4 pieces out of one slice. I then rub a little honey on each piece and wrap around pepper and securing with a toothpick. These freeze well. Bake straight from freezer on foil lined pan for easy clean up."

The bacon was thick pepper bacon and my DH grilled them rather than baking them. Loved the added sausage in the cream cheese mixture. Served with 'Bronco Burgers' from AR and grilled peppers, onions and potatoes. Loved that all items were cooked on the grill. Made for easy-peasy clean up. (5-stars)"

"reviewBody": "I made these at a family gathering, and they were AWESOME! Even the little kids loved them. A few tips: they're delicious grilled, but if you bake them, be sure to use a broiler pan or a rack. Boil or partially cook the bacon first, and broil at the end for a few minutes to crisp it up, if necessary. Where gloves through the whole process (my 13 year old was pinching off bits of the raw sausage for me to stuff the peppers, and got completely oogied out by the slimy feeling.) To keep them as mild as possible, but with great flavor, make sure you completely remove ALL the seeds and the ribs. A pretty time-consuming appetizer, but totally worth it. YUMMO!!!!!!"

Also wrapped in one whole slice of hickory smoked bacon intead of half &amp; baked on a rack so that they don't sit in juices and get soggy. Thanks for the great recipe!"

I cooked them on aluminum pans so no clean up. \nThese did take longer than the 60 minutes but the second time I prepped the jalapeños at home. I used hot Chorizo from my favorite butcher and it was not hot at all. The next time I make these, I will precook the bacon so it will crisp a little faster. \nNo one in camp was disappointed from the youngest 8 year old to us older folks. \nI will definitely make these again using one of the previous tips by precooking the bacon a little before wrapping just to help crisp the bacon. Thanks for the recipe it's awesome."

My daughter was the one cutting and cleaning them without gloves. Poor baby looked like she was sprayed with pepper spray for hours. Both of our hands were also burning for hours. So not worth the end result imo."

Be sure to where gloves and clean out all those seeds. This are yummy and I will make again. I did add a small bit of cheddar cheese at the bottom of a few of the peppers before putting in the stuffing mix and instead of wrapping them with bacon, I just topped them with a small slice of bacon and let the bacon brown on top,. Yummy indeed."

I followed a few tips from other posters that helped: I cleaned the jalapenos under water in a dish, I microwaved the bacon to get it started, I put a touch of honey on the bacon as well (you could taste the touch of sweetness), and I broiled the poppers for 5 minutes after the suggested 20 minutes of cook time, which made my bacon a bit crisper and gave a better presentation. Some advice though, be careful washing any dishes the jalapenos touch. The next day I washed the bowl (without gloves) that I cleaned them in and my hands burned for over an hour. :)"

Instead, while they are cooking I fry and crumble the bacon. I grate 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese into a bowl and then add the (cooled) bacon. The last five minutes of baking I add the cheese and bacon mixture to the top of the peppers and broil for a few minutes. This is the best way I have found to get the crunch of the bacon."

The BBQ gives the bacon a delicious flavor and really makes these “pop”!"

"reviewBody": "These are awesome and are always very popular at parties, if they make it there. We use chorizo for extra spice, and leave off the bacon (we are bacon fanatics, but with the chorizo, it's not really necessary...especially if you plan to eat 10 and don't want to regret the calories even more). Believe it or not, these are awesome if you make them with a good canned jalapeno; the kind that comes in a giant can, pickled with carrots, is the best! The brand name escapes me at the moment. Pickled jalapenos and chorizo together make a *very* spicy combination. I love the idea of honey on the bacon, however, so I think I'll try that next time, with regular sausage instead of chorizo."

I used chopped shrimp instead of sausage, used a spinach and artichoke cream cheese and added an 8 oz tub of sour cream. If you like your bacon done, count on leaving it in the oven an extra 10+ minutes to brown up. After loading up all the jalapeños, I still had a bit of the mixture left, so I put it out as a chip dip. It was all pretty tasty!"

It was just for our family so I just placed the bacon on top rather than wrapping and I think is actually a good way to go. This was after putting the bacon in the microwave as others had suggested. It was good after our own favorite seasonings and will make it again with these additions."

"reviewBody": "SO GOOD!!! Stuffing jalapenos is what I call a labor of food love, but this recipe is worth the time and effort. I cut the recipe in half for two of us, but I accidentally used a full piece of bacon on each jalapeno, which, as my husband said, was not a bad mistake at all. The jalapenos at the market happened to be huge, so a full piece of bacon covered each half perfectly without toothpicks. To the cream cheese mixture I added ground garlic and onion, salt, cilantro, green onion, and some shredded cheddar cheese. I baked these on a rack at 375 degrees for about 55 minutes. I was concerned that the cream cheese filling would run out, but it did not. \n\nFor those who have not worked with fresh chilies before, get yourself a box of rubber gloves before you make this recipe. I also wear glasses and sometimes wear a mask over my nose and mouth if the chilies are particularly hot. Cutting them under water is an excellent method. I find that with a glove on, I can easily scrape the insides out with my thumbnail. You don't fully respect the power of these little guys until they hurt you, and then the pain lasts for hours. This includes touching them and inhaling the fumes. Beware that they have oils in them so that even after you wash your hands, you can still rub your eye and be in trouble. I have learned all of this the hard way. Just be cautious!\n\nThanks so much for the excellent recipe. These are a real treat!!"

I added a little ranch dressing mix and diced red, orange, and yellow bell pepper only because I had it sitting in the fridge. I think the additions for this recipe are only limited by your imagination. I followed other reviewers ideas about microwaving the bacon first. Easy to do and delicious. Thanks for this keeper."

They are excellent.We call them Armadillo Eggs because we use a whole slice of bacon to wrap them, and when they cook down in the oven the look like egg shaped armadillo shells, lol. Also have found at my parties that the guys love to pile these on a burger!\r\n The nice thing is if you are making them for people who can't handle jalapenos, you can substitute any kind of peppers. I have used banana peppers, goat horns, anahiems, pablanos, anything. The pablanos are hotter than a bell pepper but not a great deal, they are much larger, we have made them as an entree!"

Ratrher than wrap the pepper with bacon, I cut the bacon in pieces just long enough to cover the pepper and laid it in top. Fewer calories and still had the bacon flavor. I'll be making them again this weekend. This time I'm going to add some cheddar cheese as suggested below and will use one package of regular and one package of hot sausage to add a little more punch."

Everyone wanted the recipe.\n\nI did add 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper and 4 chopped green onions to the cheese mix as well as precooked the bacon and brushed a bit of honey to it before wrapping it. I found the wrapping the pepper with the precooked bacon was a bit difficult, so I ended up just placing a strip lengthwise on top of the jalapeno. Still looked, smelled, and tasted amazingly! Now there is no turning back with requests for these at every company event."

"reviewBody": "Good make-ahead appetizer! I assembled them and refrigerated them overnight, and added 10 minutes to the cooking time. I used reduced fat sausage and reduced fat cream cheese. I added a cup of reduced fat shredded cheddar to the filling.\n I didn't wear gloves when cutting the jalapenos. It wasn't until 30 minutes later that my skin started to burn (for the next 12 hours). I had to be extremely creative in finding a way to take out my contact lenses! So bottom line, as nice as it is to save a dollar, the gloves are probably a good investment.\n Besides that, I'll make these again. They'd be good for company and they hold up well in the fridge overnight before baking. Very attractive little snacks!"

"reviewBody": "Excellent recipe but needs clarification as to cook time and fill amount. I followed the recipe exactly and these are my findings:\n\n1) FILL AMOUNT: Very hard to fill 60 half jalapenos without knowing how much to fill them. My advice would be to fill them so they're more than filled flat but don't try to hump the filling to reconstruct the size of the original jalapeno. A gentle arc over the top for each one will fill them all. First time I had too much filling; second time I had too little. \n\n2) COOK TIME: The bacon needs far more than 20 minute (like 45 here) to crisp. Basically after that time I took them out but they were still soggy on one side. I honestly think you need to turn these to get the bacon crisp. \n\nI used a large turkey size roasting pan wrapped in foil, and a flat rack sitting on top, so the bacon grease would drain. You DO NOT want the poppers lying around in the bacon fat or they will not bake, they will attempt to fry and won't get hot enough to do so. Even on a rack, bacon remained soggy. I wonder if I should have used higher heat.\n\nAlso, with this arrangement I still needed to cook these in two batches.\n\nI used \"thick\" bacon. I used \"breakfast sausage,\" locally made, and in a plastic tube, singly wrapped (ie., no casing). I used fairly large sized jalapenos. \n\nSUMMARY: Once you have figured out the cook time and fill level, you will have an excellent jalapeno popper. Feeds an army."
