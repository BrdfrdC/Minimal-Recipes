"reviewBody": "I’ve made these several times - most recently tonight for the Super Bowl. They are always a hit and I don’t change a thing! I buy 20 jalapeños and cut in half and have the perfect amount of filling. I choose the medium sized peppers if I can - too big is just too much pepper. These are easy to make but cutting and deseeding the pepper can be a bit labor intensive. I wear disposable gloves and a mask (Covid has made this easier). You’ll burn your hands if not protected. The mask helps a lot. The fumes from the pepper can be intense. I cut off the stems, slice in half and use a spoon to scoop out the seeds and then rinse the pepper half. If you prepare the jalapeño halves and brown the sausage the night before, prep can be super easy. I use Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage in the tube wrap. Make sure you put your cream cheese out to soften, mix it to loosen it up and add the browned sausage and and Parmesan cheese. I fill the peppers, put on a tray and cover until I’m ready to cook. Great dish to prepare ahead of time and pop in the oven when you’re ready. I don’t serve with ranch - it’s so good without. These are actually even good when they’re cooled off after an hour or two. There will be none left!"

The trick is to keep them in a warming container so they do not get cold. But they get eaten so quickly that rarely has it been a need. Have seen prize winning casseroles languish as these are more preferred. We have also used hatch and poblano chilies as well. mix and match. We have mixed in habanero chilies with the cream cheese for those who like to suffer when they eat. We have varied the meats/sausages as well. lamb, duck, venison, chicken, bison, beef, pork, and even salmon, crab, and shrimp. Various cheeses and cheese blends have also been used. One is only limited by one's imagination."

And be sure to wear latex gloves when slicing and seeding the peppers! I have pre-baked the emply peppers for 8 minutes or so, and also not pre-baked. I find I like the firmer texture of the pepper better by NOT pre-baking. The filling makes enough for 20 peppers, 1 Tbsp each (40 halves)."

I was a little worried, but the jalapeños weren't too spicy after being cooked. I used a small pampered chef scoop (any will do) and then rolled/squished the filling into the shape (cigar) of the jalapeños. I didn't buy the suggested amount of jalapeños (didn't want that many) and had leftover filling, which I baked in the shape of the scoop, along side the others. We ate those too. I'd buy more jalapeños next time knowing now that we all loved them. Just finished off the leftovers and just as good the 2nd time around."

It is always hard to get that sausage to behave in the fry pan. There is something stringy about it that always made it hard to break up into the small pieces that you need for yummy poppers. What I settled on was to buy the premade (hot) Italian sausage patties - four to the pound. I fry it up in its own grease and then here's my secret. I use kitchen scissors and cut the cooked patties into small pieces maybe the size of a quarter. Then I throw these pieces into a Vitamix (although I bet most blenders would work fine) and zoom them for a few seconds on a low speed and \"viola\" -perfect popper sausage every time. You're welcome."

"reviewBody": "I have made these peppers many times and they are ALWAYS gone at parties, even when I’ve made more than the basic recipe. If they’re still on the platter people keep eating them. Gave it 5 stars because the basic recipe is so good but I have changed it up from time to time. I always use HOT pork sausage (remember, the peppers themselves aren’t hot if you remove all the seeds and white membranes), and sometimes I mix in a little shredded cheddar blend or some pecorino Romano, just depends on what’s in the fridge. Even people who say they “don’t like hot stuff” that try them always love them, it’s the perfect blend of soft baked peppers, sausage and CHEESE!"

"reviewBody": "I tried this recipe with a mix of jalapeño and sweet peppers since I was not certain how spicy the recipe was. I used store bought peppers. I was able to use one recipe for 22 peppers. The jalapeños were not too spicy. Next time I’ll use them exclusively. We did not need the salad dressing. I had ranch dip and onion dip available for dipping but the peppers were so yummy and cheesy they were not needed. One family member who likes spicy, has made jalapeño poppers himself said these were really good. He typically wraps his in bacon and cooks them in the smoker. I think he was surprised at how good these were and soooo easy to make."

I used Parmesan and shredded mozzarella cheeses. I just mix all ingredients together in the rinsed pan after cooking the sausage. It mixes easily that way. Be sure to cook the cleaned/halved jalapeños in the oven on 350 degrees for about 12 minutes before stuffing so they will be softer. Wear gloves when cleaning the peppers! U can make the day before and just bake the next day if you store in air tight container in fridge."

"reviewBody": "These have been a family favorite for years, they all insist we bring them to every family function. We make ours slightly differently but they taste almost the same, if not... a little better. We use 1 pckg of bulk sausage, 1 8oz pckg cream cheese, &amp; Old Bay seasoning (to taste, u have to keep adding until u get to desired saltiness &amp; flavor.) I usually cook the filling a day ahead of time bc it’s easier to handle &amp; stuff the peppers when it’s chilled. I bake them at 375 for about 30-35 mins. I fill the baking sheet w/ as many peppers as I can, that’s why I bake that long. If I’m only making a handful then I bake for about 20 mins. This also depends on size of peppers. I look for the really big ones because stuffing peppers is fairly tedious. Make sure u use gloves when working w/ peppers, I’ve gotten some bad burns from them!!! Once you try these, you will be addicted!"

I scooped out all the seeds and they were just the right about of heat. Real heat lovers could probably leave some of the seeds.\nHad 2 left over so I wrapped them in plastic wrap and froze them. Later, took them out, put them in the microwave and they were ready to go. Nice to make some ahead and have a few whenever you want without all the mess to make them \nfrom scratch.

People tend to like the texture of knowing there is meat in there. \n You could substitute cheddar or other cheeses. I used spicy sausage that really wasnt that spicy. so i add some crushed red pepper flakes and diced onions when i was cooking sausage. \n It turned out excellent. Thank you."

I used 11 large jalapeño peppers, cut in halves and gutted with tiny measuring spoon, kept tails on; i used hot Italian sausage, although it turned out too mild anyway, next time i will add red hot flakes, or cayenne. I used only half of Philadelphia amount; I used Parmesan half in half with mixed shredded cheeses we had at home, total amount as in original recipe. I fried and drained sausage, and at the same pan caramelized two table spoon of chopped sweet onion and two little cloves of garlic, chopped, and aged to the meat. I shaped by hand little “sausages” from staffing and inserted into the peppers halves, easy and quick. I used baking as one review suggested 350 F for about 30 min. All proportions were ideal, all peppers were stuffed and no leftover stuffing. Everybody liked it."
