It was from my husband's side of the family who's Polish. They always called it 'Kapusta'....but I'm not sure if that's the correct name for this recipe. Anyways, I followed this specific recipe to a T, but omitted the caraway, as it gives us heartburn. The recipe was great! Tastes just like my husbands grandmother's recipe!! Superb"

I was even confused with the part when I had to simmer the sauerkraut mix, I was like, there's no liquid how is it going to simmer but it did and I stirred it every 15 min. I didn't deviate, not once, did recipe exactly as it's written. I used bollio bread and typed with mustered for everyone else but for my sandwich I used the Russian sauce that would normally go on a Ruben sandwich. Perfection, let me tell you. Thank you, excellent dish and was worth the time cooking it. I will be making this again. :)??"

I ended up wishing I had just grilled the sausage, added sauerkraut and served it in just a few minutes as the taste was comparable to that method (what I've done countless times over the last few decades) instead. So sorry as I had so wanted this to be one that I would make repeatedly."

"reviewBody": "I made this Dish for our New Years Family dinner and wow was it a Hit!! The sauerkraut had a very balanced taste with the added brown sugar and sliced apple slow cooking together. The bacon and onions brought all the delicious flavoring together and cooking the Keilbassa In the bacon grease enhanced the flavoring even more!! I stayed in line with everything in the recipe, aside from caraway seeds (bc I don‚Äôt care for them). The sauerkraut mixture didn‚Äôt need anything extra, in my opinion. I think if I would‚Äôve added some kind of extra juice to it, it would‚Äôve thrown the balance off or sweetened it too much. I kept it covered for 2 hours which keeps moisture in while stirring occasionally. Once you add the bacon/onions to it and then the kielbasa, it adds some extra moisture to the sauerkraut and really is perfect flavoring, just as the recipe says! The one thing I would say is to give yourself enough time to saut√© the onions/bacon/kielbasa, probably more like 20-25min to saut√© up the onions/bacon for good crispness as well as the kielbasa for browning before adding it all the sauerkraut mix. The flavorings bake all together in the oven and the smells in your kitchen are amazing and will bring anyone in your house over to ask, ‚ÄúIs it ready yet!?!‚Äù Yum!! Definitely have this recipe saved for one of my future family holiday meals! Thanks for sharing this recipe!"

When I cooked the bacon/onions, I scooped it out with a slotted spoon to allow as much excess grease to drip off as possible. When I browned the sausage, I put it on a napkin and also pressed it with more napkins before transferring it to the sauerkraut mixture. I also went through 1-1.5 cups of apple juice while cooking the sauerkraut because it started to get dry. I also bought (unknowingly), Bavarian Caraway Seed sauerkraut, so I didn‚Äôt add the additional seeds called for in the recipe. Next time, I know to buy very specific and plain sauerkraut. I tried to cut out as much excess grease as possible but still stick to the recipe as closely as possible. I know it will be very good served over mashed potatoes with a side of lightly dressed baby spinach. Just be aware that this is very greasy, pops a lot, and is best made outside if possible lol. I live in a small apt and this cooking smell will stick around for a few days."

Makes a big difference if you have quality kielbasa and bacon, which I bought from a local meat market. I followed the recipe, with the only variation of decreasing the bacon a bit. Don't omit the caraway seeds; once it is all mixed and baked the caraway flavor does not scream at you, but it does add to the flavor of the dish."

I cooked the sauerkraut for about an hour before adding the rest of the ingredients. It was so good that I will definitely plan ahead next time and try the recipe as printed. The idea of slow cooking the sauerkraut is a new one to me, but is obviously worth it."

My one comment would be it does tend to be a bit on the sweet side so if you prefer your sauerkraut more on the savory side, consider dialing back the brown sugar. But coming from someone who doesn‚Äôt particularly care for sauerkraut, this is a very good recipe."

"reviewBody": "I made some minor changes in the approach since I was nearly tripling the recipe for a New Year's Day family dinner. Used 6 lbs of Polska Kielbasa, 3 lbs of saurkraut plus 1/2 head of red cabbage, 3 granny smith apples, 2 large sweet onions diced. Didn't have caraway seeds and used fennel seeds instead, just 2 T, plus only 1/2 cup of sugar (for the tripled recipe). I put it all in a large oven-proof covered pot and skipped the stovetop step. Since it had very little liquid, I added 3 x 16 oz cans of Michigan hard cider. I cooked it in the oven at 325 for 2 hrs and then another 1-1/2 hrs at 300. Took it out of the oven and just let it sit on the stove while I finished the potatoes (smashed baby potatoes, very tasty). Even my doubters who were not fond of saurkraut (because it was too acidy) loved it! Not a hint of acid. The final verdict from the 12 family members at the table, from 1-1/2 yrs to 80 years old - YUM!!!! We'll be making it again next year, for certain!!"

Due to the sizes of the ingredients at the store the kielbasa was 5 oz less than the recipe and the sauerkraut was 8 oz. more. These are minor changes and, if I can buy the called for amounts of each, I will switch to that.\n\nTo those who don't hate caraway seeds, make sure you add it. \n\nMy one mistake that I will not repeat: I browned the kielbasa a little too thoroughly. The kielbasa came out a little dry, but I think that was my fault.\n\nA great recipe!"

That's what I thought too). My heritage is German, so I picked Germany. This recipe is the closest I've EVER come to the sauerkraut recipe that my grandmother used to make! I followed the recipe BUT used 4 lbs. of sauerkraut, added a smidge more caraway seeds and a little more than 1/4 cup brown sugar. THEN...my roommate came home and suggested I add beer....so I added 1/2 bottle of Blue Moon. O M G...this was not only good...BUT...it was a hit with the coworkers that liked sauerkraut. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!\n\nOne more thing...I browned the bacon and onions...cut up the sausage and browned it in the bacon grease and then threw everything in the slow cooker overnight. PERFECTION!!"

That said, I love the things that traditionally come with sauerkraut...Reuben's, etc. (I just have it taken off or VERY light on the serving). But this recipe sounded great, and with a fair degree of trepidation...I made it. (All the while thinking my family is going to hate it, and complain about the smell of cooking sauerkraut.) Bottom Line...IT IS SUPERB! And everyone loved it. I was so impressed and surprised and am so glad I made it. Cooking ahead with the brown sugar and apple certainly does mellow out everything I normally hate about sauerkraut. It made it into a nice garnish that blended perfectly...and did not overpower the meal. I did go lighter on the sauerkraut than the recipe called for (as I couldn't believe how it would turn out) but will go closer to the full recipe next time. Be brave sauerkraut haters and enjoy this meal."

When the sauerkraut is almost done, I add the kielbasa until heated through and browned. Thanks for the alternate bake option (for me, anyway). It will cut down stirring to prevent burning and constant watching. Oh, I don't add bacon; in my opinion, it would fight with the flavors of the kielbasa. Seems everyone is adding bacon to everything these days. If anyone is worried about the extra grease, leave this out."
