He had another recipe to use, but I couldn't find it so went to my trusted all recipes website. We had a can of stewed tomatoes and tomato sauce to use for his recipe. I decided to had half of each just to give this gumbo more flavor and color. In my opinion it might have been a bit bland without the added tomato. Otherwise, great recipe and I'll make it again some day :)."
