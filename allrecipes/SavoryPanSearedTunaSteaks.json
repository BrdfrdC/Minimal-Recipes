Initially I only made this for myself, as no one else in my family likes tuna. however I let them each try it and each and everyone of them said they would definitely eat that the next time I make it!!! FYI…I paired it with a sautéed asparagus and baby bell mushroom dish that complimented it very well."

I know that sounds like a lot but the internal temperature was only 90° - 100° so I finally took it off. It was lovely! Charred and just warm in the center. The flavor from the marinade was most delicious. 5 stars!"

"reviewBody": "This was my first time making tuna steaks, and it turned out great. I used the exact ingredients with the exception of substituting crushed red pepper flakes and adding some thinly sliced green onion. It was unbelievably easy to pull together, and cooked faster than instant oatmeal. The next time I make it I am going to back off slightly on the ginger at hubby’s request, and we both decided we would like the ahi to spend even less time in the skillet. We love it raw in sushi, so I intend to do maybe 30 seconds a side. After removing the tuna steaks from the pan, I added the marinade to the skillet to heat it, and stirred in some prepared rice noodles to coat in the marinade. They made an excellent side dish, although it was the first time I had ever made rice noodles and after cooking half the box we wound up with a mountain o’ noodles. Taking only about 30 minutes from refrigerator to table, this is a restaurant-quality meal that can fit into about anyone’s schedule...at about $5 a serving! (Our ahi steaks were just $16 for a package of 5 steaks at Sam’s Club.)"

The molasses sure burned onto the pan (I don't have a non-stick frying pan, so I used oil). It also helps to have thicker pieces of tuna."

Also, I had sushi grade tuna and therefore I did not need to cook it to 140 degrees. A lower internal temperature left the fish more moist. Family loved it and we will make it again. A good alternative for when it is too cold to grill outside!"

I used a non-stick pan, 2 TBSP of vegetable oil and waited until the oil was hot before I put the steaks on. I cooked for 2 mins on one side and 1.5 mins on the other. I served with sautéed sugar snap peas and sake. It was a great dinner. The marinade made a nice caramel color on the outside. The flavors were great. I used a previously frozen non sushi grade steak. There was no \"fishy\" flavor and the inside was pink. Will try again. Thank you!"

We're gonna keep this one, but probably change it up a little.\n\nWe seared the steaks for two minutes on each side, but my wife was a little skeptical of the \"done-ness\" of the tuna. We fixed that by putting them in the oven for five minutes. This wasn't a problem with the recipe. It was more about personal taste for us."

If you are like me and prefer your tuna medium rare, cook as the recipe suggests. My husband likes it a bit more well-done, so we just put his back on the heat. (But keep in mind, if you let your tuna sit/rest 3 to 5 minutes off of the stovetop, it will continue to cook a bit more from its own internal heat. That way you can be assured that it won't get dry from overcooking, which is always a concern with seafood.) This recipe is a keeper. It's the second time I've made it this month."

"reviewBody": "Not my favorite. I have never made seared tuna before, but have really enjoyed the stuff I've had at restaurants. This recipe was not on par. I think it cooks the tuna for too long at too low a heat, so it ends up overcooked and tasting somewhat like canned tuna. We did not marinade the tuna for a whole 20 minutes (due to time constraints), but otherwise followed the recipe perfectly. I'm glad we didn't marinate it any longer, otherwise I think all we would have tasted is soy sauce. The marinade was very salty and really clung to the tuna steak. I would advise rinsing off the marinade thoroughly before cooking to avoid a too strong soy sauce flavor. Unfortunatly, I would actually just skip this recipe all together."
