I think I would actually love to try this recipe with the slightest hint of lemon."

I reduced the salt to 1 t, just because of personal preference. The flavor is fine with that extra 1/4 t, and my 5 year-old ate them that way with lots of \"mmm\", \"yum\", and \"these are SO good!\". She's is a picky eater too! I stirred halfway through the bake time, just because I wasn't going to take the time to make sure all of the seeds were single layer. I have this recipe saved, and I will definitely be using it in the future!"

I baked it for 1 hr at 275°as someone else suggested to account for the wet seeds. it is fabulous!!"

Soak your seeds in salt water overnight, add a splash of soy to the butter, half garlic salt half sea salt, and I just added a few red pepper flakes to the butter but not too much. I also set a timer every 20 minutes to stir while baking. I will make this again"

"reviewBody": "Had to adjust the recipe for a half cup or so of hubbard squash seeds. First I mixed 1 T sugar, a couple pinches of kosher salt and 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and set aside. Then I used an 8\" cast iron frying pan on the stovetop (seemed a waste to heat up the oven for such a small amount) and toasted the seeds. When they looked golden brown, I tossed in 1 T of butter which melted fast in the hot pan, then quickly sprinkled the sugar/salt/spice mix and stirred to coat all the seeds. When they were all coated, I emptied them onto a plate and spread them out to cool. By \"cool\" I mean still warm but not hot enough to burn my tongue! OMG delicious! I plan to try it this way again with a larger cast iron pan and pumpkin seeds and will spread them out on a cookie sheet to cool so they don't clump."
