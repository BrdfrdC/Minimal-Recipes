I didn't use mushrooms because I don't like them, I added additional garlic (3 small cloves total), and added diced red pepper in addition to the green pepper to up the veggies. I also didn't have parsley so I didn't use any. It got the seal of approval from my husband although I think he would prefer whole wheat spaghetti noodles over egg noodles. I will definitely make this again though and may add zucchini like another reviewer or even grated carrots just to get more veggies in!"

He follows recipes exactly so I know that he did nothing to alter this one except he used diced tomatoes rather than the crushed Italian style tomatoes - that's all we had on hand. It was so delicious that we decided that we can serve this to our very \"discerning\" guests as well. With hubby cooking and not totally acquainted with the kitchen, he started from scratch and we had dinner 1 1/2 hrs later!!! Great!"

While the flavor was good, the dish came out much too watery. Perhaps drained tomatoes would have been better or maybe adding some tomato paste? I did simmer the sauce longer trying to get it to thicken a bit, but it did not. I will fix this again but will have to make some modifications."

While it was simmering, I noticed it was a little thick, so I just added in a little water and that made it the perfect consistancy. I could'nt find the 'Italian-style crushed tomatoes', so I just used crushed tomatoes w/ basil. I used less Italian seasoning and no dried basil (personal preference). This smelled amazing while it was cooking and made for an easy and delicious dinner. Will def be using this recipe again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)"

Followed the directions and served it over thin spaghetti with garlic bread. Thank you so much for sharing! I will make this again and the bonus is that it is healthy and very low in fat, but it doesn't taste like it Yum! Also, I think olive oil should be used instead of vegetable, the olive oil gives it a wonderful flavor! Eating the leftovers and they are fantastic!"

"reviewBody": "This is one of those recipes I didn't have much time to dedicate myself into and it turned out so delicious! First, I browned the chicken in a pan with lots of onions, garlic and green pepper. Once ready, I transferred to the crockpot with the remaining ingredients and cooked on low for probably 4 hours. I didn't have any mushrooms, I didn't cube the chicken and at the end I forgot to add Parmesan, but even then was very flavorful. Next time I will make sure to have everything. Served over whole wheat egg noodles with steamed broccoli and cauliflower."

"reviewBody": "While I was frantically looking for the spelling of \"Cacciatore\" I came across yours. Since my darling boyfriend let me use his kitchen while he mowed . . .I had to hurry and prepare this before he re-entered \"his space\". I like the simple, up-front ingredients that give it all the \"American\" italian bold flavors. And, I had the kitchen tidy and the Merlot open when he returned exclaiming at the tangy fragrance pouring from the kitchen, his kitchen! Loved the recipe! Thanks from Wiscony . . ."

"reviewBody": "WOW! This was a wonderful dish! My husband said that he's had cacciatore before in restaurants and homemade, but it's never been something that he specifically looks for on a menu, but this recipe completely changed his view of the meal. If we could give it 10 stars we would, it's delicious!! Used left-over sauteed onions and chicken thigh meat, but other than that everything was just as printed and it was scrumptious! Thank you Scarlett!"
