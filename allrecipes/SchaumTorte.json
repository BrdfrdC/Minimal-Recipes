Excellent served with a sauce made from sweet cherries. Or any other fruit. You won't miss the ice cream. Don't forget the whipped cream."

Also it would help with the grainy texture of the sugar to use superfine or just pulse regular sugar in the blender a few times. And lastly, next time I would cut the vanilla down to half because it gave the torte an unpleasant brown color."

"reviewBody": "FYI, 6 egg whites is what you need (1/2 c is hard to guess when measuring something like eggs)I put mine all together in one pan (9x13) rather than making individual blobs and cook at 300 for 40 minutes, turn off oven, open oven door and let sit for 30 min and it's done. I also add 1/2 tsp of almond extract and 1/4 tsp salt. Yes, the blending takes A LONG TIME even with a mixer. Probably about 15 minutes, so just keep blending :)"

I was making heart-shaped ones for Valentine's Day and after these failed I went back to Betty Crocker cookbook and those turned out perfectly. I do admit that these tasted good as giant cookies. . ."
