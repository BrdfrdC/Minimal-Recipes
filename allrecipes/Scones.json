I baked for 18 minutes until golden brown. I will make these again!"

For nicely layered scones that pull apart in lovely chunks be sure to dice your softened (not melted) butter into itty bitty bits and sprinkle it into the dry ingredients. Whisk it around to get little globulous butter and flour chunks, then add the mixed milk/egg and kneed with your hands. Don't over work the dough. We like to add shredded cheddar, diced green onion, and little bits of pre-cooked bacon to our scones.\nAbsolutely delicious."

I used cake flour instead of all purpose flour and used an ice cream scoop to plop them onto the baking sheet (loved that it turned out all uneven-shaped!) The outsides were crispy and the insides were soft. And although the recipe says it's for 8, I managed to get at least 16pcs (I'm guessing because I kept each scone to a \"mouthful\" instead of having them in 'pizza slices' like in the video)."

With a hot cup of tea My goodness the trick is to add the egg/milk mixture slowly and stop when the dough is moist but not wet. Also very little kneading. All in all I think it took 30 minutes max from start to finish. Easy and quick breakfast or snack meal. Topped with melting margarine. Truly a delicious experience."

I did have to add a little more liquid--when I turned the dough out to knead and cut, it was simply too dry and wouldn't hold together. So I added a few drops of milk and everything was fine. I also used a little milk to the tops of the scones and sprinkled some brown sugar. I got 8 huge scones which I'm sure my neighbors will love!"

When I realized my mistake, I pivoted (we're all so good at that these days, aren't we?) by adding a couple handfuls of chocolate chips, and baking them as muffins instead. They turned out really tasty! So I'll definitely make these \"scones\" again!"

I didn't use all of the milk and egg mixture (just enough with orange juice to keep it's form). Once baked to a golden brown, I let it cool a little then brushed it with an orange juice and powder sugar glaze before serving. I had to try 2 of the 8 wedges just to make sure it tasted the way I want it to."

I don't know about what others are saying about needing more flour, the portions were perfect. \n\nA couple small changes I made: shredded frozen butter so it stays cold, after forming place in the fridge for 15 minutes before baking, and brush the top with heavy cream before placing on the oven. \n\nThis recipe was so simple and made some of the best scones ice ever made.
