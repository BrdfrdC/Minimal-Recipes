I also added a little more of the seasoning in the recipe. I can say that I definitely recommend this especially if you are Kokomo incorporate tempeh into your dinner rotation."

Although I used a 4 quart pan for cooking this, I didn't have room for the corn and one of the peppers. I served this with some vegan cheese and it came out great. I will definitely make this again."

I added some -- maybe a teaspoon. I also wished it were a little hotter. Next time I might add a jalapeno. It's very hearty, and, of course, gets better as it melds together. Thanks, Scooter."
