"reviewBody": "Wow!!! My husband is EXTREMELY picky when it comes to salmon - much less from a can, but - we had ourselves two cans ‚Äúgifted‚Äù to us and I needed to figure out what to make with them. Found this. Because of my ‚Äúfear,‚Äù halved except used 1/2c panko. One can/halving the recipe resulted in 7 patties for us. Fried in our cast iron. This! Was! AWESOME! Dipped in tartar but would like to make an aioli next time. Husband ate 3 patties! üò≥ They were that good and he was surprised this came from a can! Would absolutely make again! Stellar recipe Judiebug!! Thank you!"

"reviewBody": "Delicious and easy. I only had one can of salmon so had to adjust ingredients a bit. No panko so used crumbs I had saved from stale loaf of Italian bread. I made them early in the day and refrigerated for about an hour which I think made them easier to handle. Also rolled in dry bread crumbs before cooking. Like one other reviewer I added a bit of butter to oil to get crispier outside. Had over spaghetti with butter and parmeson cheese. Side dish of watermelon/blueberry salad."

I did use about 1/2 the Dijon Mustard, had to substitute red onion for Spring Onion, added a bit more Mayo and garlic powder. I also needed more oil when frying. I served with a quick tarter sauce recipe but added some Franks Red Hot to it. Everything was delicious."

Worcestershire, and plain Panko breadcrumbs. Saut√©ed chopped onion, celery and yellow bell pepper (about 1/4 to 1/2 c. of each), cooled and added to the mix. It was so delicious!

"reviewBody": "Love this. However, I don't like salmon so I appreciate how much this hides the salmon flavor. I made these with leftover salmon. So quick and easy. Big hit with all 3 teens, and my husband who doesn't usually like seafood cakes. I might use less worcestershire and salt next time. I didn't really measure the ingredients - just threw stuff in the bowl. I forgot the onion. I didn't use Old Bay, but looked online for a substitute, which included celery and a few other ingredients. I also didn't have dijon. As it was, it was extremely flavorful. Overall, a great recipe that will be made again and again. Thank you!"
