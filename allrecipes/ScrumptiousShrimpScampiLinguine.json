"reviewBody": "This was my first time making a seafood linguine, and I had mixture of seafood to add. I was looking for a nice simple sauce that wouldn't overpower the seafood. \nBesides adding different seafood (shrimp, scallops, lobster and salmon), I followed the recipe almost exactly - to get the sauce! The only two exceptions were garlic (I have an intoleranc, substituted chopped scallions) and clam juice (I made a broth by boiling up the shrimp peel). The result was pleasantly satisfying. I found it hard to mix up the linguine and the seafood, so I tonged out the linguine, then scooped out the seafood on top. Looking forward to the leftovers!"

To be sure to have enough sauce, I doubled everything (except shrimp and pasta), and it was perfect. Because of that, I didn't add the pasta water at all. It was garlicy, lemony, and delicious! Just perfect with a fresh green salad and some crusty Italian bread."

I thickened the liquid with a little cornstarch and served with fresh cut chives and Parmesan cheese. My husband said it was perfect."

I cut the pasta in half- I can't imagine using an entire pound. Way too much! I even used an entire bag of frozen peppers and onions. I would have been happy with less than 8oz of pasta. Not sure I'll make this again."

And i also added clams and scallops, and left out the red chili flakes and pasta water. It was good, however, it was a bit bland in my opinion. A good recipe nonetheless!"

Freshly ground pepper also enhanced the flavor. Next time I may chop some arugula and put it in for that little peppery flavor. A salad, a bottle of wine-perfect dinner. Thought I was still in Italy"

I will cut the hot pepper even more next time. I used a fat noodle, which sucked up the flavor wonderfully. I did add the pasta water at the end, I felt it needed it as the noodles sucked up most of the sauce. This recipe will definitely go into our regular rotation, it's great to play with and change as what you like or based on ingredients you have on hand. A must try!"

I didn't have wine the second time I made it, so I used white grape/apple juice with a little lemon and chicken broth instead. Wonderful submission!"

My son loves cream sauces, but I didn't want so much fat so I swapped out the heavy cream for 1/3 less fat cream cheese plus some skim milk. I skipped the clam juice, added about half of the pasta water amount, and whisked the sauce while it bubbled. My family has requested this again. Thanks for the original recipe!"

I do think the red pepper flakes it calls for was a little much so I halved it to 3/4 teaspoon and that was perfect. I did NOT add the pasta water. I thought the pasta water would dilute all the other favors and I'm glad I didn't add it. I was really able to taste the lemon, garlic, wine and butter with each bite. I may add a little more garlic and some lemon zest the next time I make this and see how that goes. Oh and I cut the red and yellow peppers with a tiny heart cookie cutter just for some fun."

I was also out of red pepper flakes, so I too a few whole dried red peppers, and added them to the roux when the pasta was absorbing the liquid. They added just the right amount of pazazz. I took them out when I served, of course. I dusted the dinner with a little Parmesian, which is a no-brainer. But after dinner, I thought it would be a good touch to drizzle on a little lime juice, just before serving. Sliced black olives seem to make sense to me, too."
