I also sautéed the onions, garlic and freshly chopped parsley in 4 tablespoons of butter. I cubed a whole haddock fillet and six large sea scallops along with one cup peeled and deveined shrimp cut in half. I did not use clams. I also added one tablespoon of Old Bay seasoning to the other seasonings."

I used a can of pink Alaska salmon, a 12 oz bag of frozen precooked shrimp, and three 6.25 oz cans of minced clams in clam juice. I also added 1/2 cup celery, a little more potatoes than called for, and cut the cayenne in half. It was absolutely wonderful!!! My family LOVED it and I felt like a gourmet cook. 5 stars in my book.

"reviewBody": "Lots of interesting textures and flavors! IF you do it right. My wife can't stand shrimp (she's tried) and I can't agree with calamari. We used crab, scallops and chopped ham as protein. Added a dash of Old Bay Seasoning (very welcome), but the rest was to recipe. I have made this many times, and the real trick is letting the pre-protein mix get really soft without boiling, taking much more than 25 minutes, more like an hour. That hour of constant, intermittent stirring led to creation of wonderful sides, like my signature easy \"garlic cheesy bread\", until the veggies were JUST soft enough. You have to feel it while stirring. Finally, add the protein and keep it just hot enough to stay below boiling until it all cooks through. An arduous process to rival risotto, but similarly, so worth it."

Added 10 minutes to the simmer time as the potatoes were not cooked enough and added 10 minutes after we added the seafood (shrimp, bay scallops, salmon, haddock) as it was too thick so added 1/2 cup of water in the final 10 minutes. Added bacon when serving for effect and all were very complimentary of the dish. No salt &amp; pepper required."

I wasn't about to waste good shellfish ,calamari, and cod. I made my own cream of mushroom soup,( takes only a few minutes) sauteed mushrooms in a bit of butter, 1 clove of chopped garlic,2 tablespoons of grated onion,a touch of sherry and half and half cream. I proceeded with the original ingredients, with full fat cream cheese,and half and half cream. I used frozen grilled corn from Trader Joe's,( again, I wanted the best tasting ingredients for the expense of the seafood).We had this for Christmas Eve and it was divine!"

I cut it into small pieces, added a slab of cod and some more shrimp and left out crab meat. (the shrimp in the medley are very small). I used regular cream cheese and milk. I am on special diet so I can't have potatoes or corn so left them out. The second time I made it I did add a can of cream corn and a small can of corn. It was awesome!

One pound of shrimp, crab, and clams and I also added clam juice. I also added a lot more garlic and onions because of our love of the two. It had a wonderful seafood flavor and filling. I will definitely make again adding more seafood and a larger quantity. This was my first time making a chowder and definitely want be my last. Thank you for the great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Ok. This turned out great, but I did some things differently. Some in ingredients, some in technique. First, except for the milk I went all in with the full fat.\n\nI first rendered about 6 sliced of cut up bacon. I left the fat in the pot and set the bacon aside.\n\nI then lightly sauteed/sweated the vegetables first in the bacon fat, then added the garlic (3 cloves) and then spices for about a minute (I also added a heaping teaspoon of Old Bay Seasoning) prior to adding a half cup Pinot Grigio to deglaze the pot. Only after that did I add in the milk and cream cheese. I also added a jar of clam juice. I did not use the corn water.\n\nI used a full pound of shrimp and a full pound of cod, a pound of the scallops, and 8oz. jumbo lump crabmeat and the can of clams. No calimari.\n\nI used the bacon for garnish.\n\nI would advise folks to make sure they dice the potatoes and carrots to a relatively small size to ensure it cooks in a reasonable amount of time. I also made sure the fish were bite size.\n\nNext time I will try the non-fat route.\n\nMy wife and daughter loved this."

We cut up 3 peeled red potatoes, no carrots, 2 cans of corn (drained), 5-6 cloves of garlic, used juice from a can of clams and substituted old Bay instead of parsley. \n\nHad some heat to it from the pepper but I wouldn't change it. Excellent dish for a cold winter night in the Northeast."

"reviewBody": "I was skeptical, but with the fantastic reviews, I figured this one would be worth a shot, and I'm happy to say, it was far better than I had anticipated! I bought a can of clams, fresh bay scallops, crab claw meat, and shrimp - way more seafood than the recipe called for, but I wanted seafood in every spoonful. My husband specifically said \"ew gross, clams.\" but I was already invested in the project so I put them in my food processor and ground them up with a little milk. Warning - this produces a hideous, disgusting grey/green liquid that I almost threw out... but I persevered and you should, too. It'll be ok, I promise. My honest advice: Don't let the clams scare you: they add a rich, sorta sweetness that you wont be able to achieve without them. I pretty much followed the recipe but used frozen corn instead of canned, and like some others, added most of the juice from the canned clams. I did end up adding a little chicken broth towards the end because I was out of milk and used so much seafood that I needed a little more liquid. I also stirred in about 1-2T of sherry and it was amazing. Next time (yes, there WILL be a next time. The clam hating man has already requested it again. ), I think I will cook the potatoes and mash them up a bit to make a thicker, more chowdery chowder. So good!"

I also had about 1/4 cup of cream cheese I wanted to get rid of. I found this recipe and used what I had, left out what I didn't have (potatoes, cream of mushroom soup, corn, other seafood, green onion). It was so good!

I made it AS IS the first time and it REALLY SUCKS to lose $35 worth of ingredients, so I'm going to save you all the time and money.\n\nFirst, there's no way potatoes and carrots are going to soften in a simmering (very thick!) chowder in 25 minutes. In the pot that you will put everything in, sautee all of the veggies *EXCEPT THE CORN* for about 10 minutes. Then add in the potatoes and carrots and enough chicken stock to cover. Cover and when it begins to boil, set a timer for 5 minutes.\n\nThen you can add everything else in as directed."
