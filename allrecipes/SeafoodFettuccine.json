Used double the butter and had a drizzle of olive oil in the pan(I'm not trying to eat healthy). It did take a dab of the corn starch which may not be necessary (I like mine thick). Everything about this recipe is a perfect do it yourself, follow exactly or veer off a bit and get creative but it's an awesome recipe for just about anyone, new or experienced cook-at-home folks.

I used a total of 2 lbs of seafood, using a combination of shrimp, scallops, and a couple of cod filets. Based on other reviews, I added some portobello mushrooms and bell pepper but otherwise stuck to the existing recipe (including adding 1 tbsp cornstarch with the half&amp;half)."

I sautéed fresh mushrooms in the butter and garlic until soft then added the green onions and 1 tsp. Italian seasoning. Adding the shrimp I sautéed for 2 min on ea side. Then I removed the shrimp from the pan, preventing further cooking. Then I cont w the remaining recipe. It’s really delicious and can be very versatile. Thank you for sharing."

"reviewBody": "With some changes in the cooking instruction it's a solid 5. I cut the portions back to 2, lunch tomorrow...can't wait! I can only get frozen scallops where I live so I soaked them in milk for 20 minutes to remove the \"fishy\" taste. While the pasta was cooking I pan seared the scallops and then the shrimp, scallops are too delicate IMHO to risk over cooking. I cooked the pasta for exactly 8 minutes and retained 3/4 cup of the cooking liquid before draining. Add the pasta and cooking liquid to the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes. The corn starch is unnecessary, the starchy water replaces it. I then added the scallops and shrimp and cooked it just enough to warm. I had about a cup of extra clams and mussels so included this for the last minute. This will be a repeat, thanks for the recipe."

I tweaked it a bit by adding a few extra ingredients: a splash of lemon juice, a few shakes of crushed red pepper and two chopped snow crab clusters. I had to substitute one tablespoon of finely diced onion and chopped parsley for the chopped green onion. Will make sure there are green onions in the fridge the next time I make this recipe. Yep, received positive comments from hubby (not atypical). Thanks!! Sorry there is not a picture, but it was quite colorful and looked terrific."

I added several veggies, OK a bunch of veggies (squash, zucchini, asparagus, carrots &amp; broccoli)to give it a healthier twist (plus I love them), white wine &amp; Dijon mustard. A friend recommended the last two ingredients. I cooked the scallops &amp; shrimp as directed and added about 1/4 c wine and used the left over juice in the cream sauce and addes the Dijon mustard into the sauce also . Fantastic. Just made so much that there wasn't quite enuff sauce but it was soo good. Next time, more sauce."

I added capers which were wonderful. I served broccoli and baby spinach with it. It could have been added in. All in all the meal was delicious and I would make it again."

After rinsing the scallops and shrimp ( which I added) I seasoned the seafood with the salt , pepper, red peppers flakes and parsley. The seafood was then sautéed in the butter/garlic. When I added the cream ( used light cream) I also poured in some white wine. I felt the cornstarch amount was great and added the right amount of creaminess to the sauce. I will most definitely make this dish again."

"reviewBody": "I cook the seafood separately so as not to overcook. My take: Saute a bit of garlic in a pan with a stick of butter. Pour in a pint of heavy cream. After it starts getting good and hot add in a pinch of chicken boullion powder (flavor boost) and then start adding the cheese in a handful at a time til incorporated stirring continually and careful not to boil. Throw the cooked seafood in when its done (or keep separate) and serve with the pasta. No fail, perfect alfredo and tastes just like the good restaurants make."

As others have noted, I added some sliced baby portobello mushrooms and a dash of white wine with the onion and garlic step. I also added a can of baby clams and a drop of clam juice with the fish step. For the cornstarch part, I spooned some sauce from the pan into a coffee cup. To this cup of warm sauce, I added 1 Tablespoon of cornstarch and dissolved it before adding it back to the pan. I waited to see the sauce consistency, then did the step one more time. It was perfect and no lumps of cornstarch."

I used snow crab instead of scallops, this time around, but either work well. At the end I add the zest of 1 lemon and the juice as well. If you let the warm pasta sit in the sauce (without the seafood) for about 10 minutes, the pasta will soak it up and make it creamy."

I added mushrooms, green pepper, 1/2 cup white wine and a squirt of fresh lemon juice. I reserved liquid from thawing sea scallops and added this, which I reduced before adding heavy cream. We had a lot of seafood, so the extra liquid was fine. I used the cornstarch. Perfect thickness for such a rich sauce. Served over penne pasta with Caesar salads, fresh green beans and garlic Parmesan toast rounds.\nTempting to gorge, but the richness calls for restraint...which leads to leftovers!
