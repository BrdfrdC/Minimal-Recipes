I make my stock using celery, onion, tomato, and shrimp shells, and either whole pieces of fish or the heads and tails. i don't use oysters but replace it with sliced pieces of fish (orange roughy or tilapia). i tried flounder once but it breaks up and you can't distinguish it from the crabmeat. I also add sea scallops (sliced in half) or bay scallops."
