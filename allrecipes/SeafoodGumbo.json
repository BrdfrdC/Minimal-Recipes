I left out the cayenne pepper and the hot pepper sauce. It turned out ok, but I think I should have stuck to using the file on individual bowls as it’s served. I will try again"

Used veggie stock, olive oil rather than veg oil, 15 ounce can of Cento tomato sauce, a Korean fish powder. (I don’t know hat it is called... wife’s dept!) cooked about 20 mins, no need for an hour. Added the seafood. Waited 10 mins and served over rice. An absolute winner. Friends over loved it."

I had problems finding chunk crab meat...only shredded which I added and crab legs which I was not going to shuck just to put in the pot. (I'd rather eat it straight). So I followed the recommendation of the guy in the seafood department and used some of that Imitation crab (which is supposedly a mix of real crab and found or some cheap fish). BIG MISTAKE. These are sold in roles the unrolled in the pot and became a long rubbery mess. Won't make that mistake again. Bottom line, despite the Imitation crab, I liked the gumbo as did my son. My wife and daughter were not as crazy about it, and complained more about the smell stinking up the house. I will same it for cooking outside in the future."

This is a Creole gumbo since it uses tomato. Cajun gumbo uses a rue. It is a recipe, use what you like and take out what you don't. Used whole cleaned crabs and claws in this one with the shrimp and oysters. Will make this again and again."

This is what allows the flavors to really mingle (as long as it's done on low you shouldn't have to worry about overcooked seafood). Other than those changes, I followed the recipe as given. This is a keeper!"

"reviewBody": "This is a great recipe... if you substitute some creole traditions. Take the time to make a roux instead of using the oil and tomato paste. A roux only takes an extra fifteen to twenty minutes to make and will add a depth of flavor lacking in this recipe's instructions. \n\nAnd I agree to add the file on the dish after it's been served. It should be used to taste--in the gumbo it creates an odd flavor that's not that appetizing. I couldn't find oysters, so I made mine with shrimp, scallops and crab claw meat. The spice ratio is great, and the cooking time is also more or less spot-on. Aside from the modifications, this is a very good gumbo."

I left out celery ( personal taste ) and I used 1/4 green bell pepper and a whole red bell pepper, I used seafood broth, no oysters but I used crab meat and that overpowered the shrimp a bit. I made brown rice to serve over it. It's really more of a effutae than a gumbo but it still makes a good meal."

"reviewBody": "Great Recipe. I do not do much Cajun cooking myself, nor does my family eat it very often, so I don’t have anything to compare this to, but all I can say for sure is that everyone loved it (except my son, who thought it was too spicy). I did tweak the recipe a bit to accommodate what I had on hand: first, I omitted the oil altogether and added salt to the veggies so they would sweat a bit and not burn, second, I used chicken stock instead of fish stock, third, I used scallops instead of shrimp, and fourth, I didn’t have oysters, but I did have light smoked sausage, so I added that in its place. I know this sounds like a lot of changes, and it was…but for me not knowing how to make gumbo, this served as a great starting point. So, thank you Sara for the recipe and the inspiration!"

"reviewBody": "This was wonderful! Time got away from me and I had to use organic veg. broth. I added a couple of pinches of cloves to the broth after seeing that the Seafood Gumbo Stock recipe by Sara used it. We added 1/2 tsp file powder to the bowls of soup. File powder can become stringy if boiled. I am looking forward to making this again with Sara's stock recipe."

"reviewBody": "not too bad, but two items of thought. Traditional Louisiana Gumbo does not contain tomato sauce and it does contain a roux. The dark grey chocolate-esque look of traditional gumbo and the deep flavor of a roux cannot be duplicated with tomato sauce :) Keep the file in it, but use a roux as a deep thickeningagent instead of the tomato sauce. Also add okra :) NOTE: DO not add the File powder until the gumbo is done cooking and right before serving. File becomes distasteful when cooked and also doesn't keep well. Only add it into individual servings right before going to the table."
