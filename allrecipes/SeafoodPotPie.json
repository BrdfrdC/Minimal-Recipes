,"text": "Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion, fennel, celery, and carrots; cook, stirring often, until vegetables are softened and onion is translucent, about 8 minutes. Add flour and stir to coat vegetables well, stirring for 1 minute. Add wine, and stir until wine has evaporated and mixture creates a slurry, about 15 seconds. Add fish stock and 3 tablespoons cream, stirring until mixture thickens into a creamy sauce, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then gently fold in seafood, green peas and parsley."

,"text": "Reduce heat to medium-low, and, gently stirring often, bring mixture to a low simmer until sauce is warm again but the seafood will not be completely cooked through, about 6-8 minutes. Ladle 2 cups mixture into each of 5 (18- to 20-ounce) ungreased ramekins or ovenproof bowls. Place bowls on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet."

,"text": "Whisk egg and remaining 1 tablespoon heavy cream in a small bowl. Place defrosted puff pastry sheets on a lightly floured work surface. Roll each sheet into a 13&#34; x 13&#34; square and cut each square into quarters. Discard any extra pastry. Place a square of pastry over each bowl, decoratively folding corners in to fit the bowl, and brush the top with egg wash. Use the tip of a knife to create 3 small slits in the center of the pastry to allow steam to vent during cooking. You may place chopped fennel fronds or parsley leaves on the top of the pastry, lightly pressing leaves onto the pastry in the egg wash to adhere."

"reviewBody": "This was absolutely fantastic. I did have to change a little for preference and using things I had. Pho broth for the stock, the thicker side of tilapia filets for the halibut, leftover large shrimp, potatoes and corn from a boil, all chopped. Hubbs doesn't care for peas so I blanched fresh, finely chopped green beans. Loved the fennel and crab, added a sweetness! Will make again! It sounded like a lot of work, but it really was pretty easy for a day-off meal. The pastry was so nice to dip into the yummy sauce!"

"reviewBody": "We made this twice, once we made a 1/3 recipe to test it using 2 bowls and using frozen mahi-mahi fillets as the fish. It was wonderful. The second time, for company, we made the full recipe for 6 bowls. We used fresh cod instead of mahi-mahi which allowed more of the shrimp and scallop flavor to come through. It was fabulous! Don't change this very changeable recipe before trying it first as written."
