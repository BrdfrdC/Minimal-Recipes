"reviewBody": "Great start for a recipe and so simple it’s hard to screw up. Here’s my alterations and tips: 1. Do NOT add butter when you sear on high heat. It’ll burn and smoke. Just use oil, then add a pat of butter when the tuna rests after searing, right on top, so it melts into it. 2. I crusted mine with raw sesame seeds to add a bit of a crunch. 3. Use tongs to hold, turn, and sear all sides, 20-30 seconds each, depending on how thick you want the “ring” that’s cooked. 4. I omitted the salt since it draws water from the fish - you can salt after you sear, but the fish is plenty salty on its own for my taste."

"reviewBody": "Oh, My Word! Bethany Joyful, thank you for this recipe, it has converted me!! I’m officially an Ahi Tuna lover now. \n\nMy Sweetheart made this for my birthday dinner, following the recipe exactly. While the peppercorns were softening and popping in the hot butter and oil, my tastebuds were sizing up the flavors headed their way. Once the tuna steaks were added to the pan, the cayenne pepper that had been sprinkled on the steaks made its presence known. My taste buds and tum were so ready to have this dinner and it did not disappoint! I immediately requested we have it again soon... like the following week... YES, the FOLLOWING week, I couldn’t wait to have it again. \n\nNeedless to say, we’ve had this a lot now. We’ve had it with Cilantro Lime Rice and veggies and we’ve had it with Rice Pilaf and veggies. It was just as delicious with Long Grain &amp; Wild Rice and veggies. \n\nThe peppercorns make the dish for me. The second time we had this we decreased the salt slightly but increased the peppercorns to ensure there were some left to top the rice with (after topping the tuna.) We’ve used several types of peppercorns. We’ve found that Tellicherry black peppercorns add a very enjoyable softened/popped texture and a palate-pleasing complexity to the peppery flavors. \n\nThis recipe is just plain delicious! Thank you again for sharing."

My peppercorns didn't pop open, but the flavor was still good. It would be helpful to know the thickness of the tuna steaks for the cooking. I had somewhat thin steaks (maybe 3/4 inch) and 1-1/2 minutes on each side was too long for my liking. The tuna was not overcooked, just more cooked than I wanted. Still moist and tasty. As for the salt and cayenne, I mixed them together before sprinkling on the fish to my liking. I added the extra to the Sweet and Spicy Swiss Chard (also from this site) which I served with the tuna."

Also, people have complained of the smokieness it produces in the house. That is because olive oil has a low burn temperature. Replace the olive oil with avocado oil and that won't happen."

The key for me was a cast iron pan and just babysitting the oil and peppercorns. You will smell and hear when things are about to go south if you heat a cast iron on medium low and occasionally swirl the oil and peppercorns. Smell and hearing is the best indicator for me - it starts to sound like a bacon sizzle and smell like burning - throw your tuna in then. My wife only came out to make sure I had opened the windows, I wasn't yelled at."

I seared mine for about a min and a half for the top, 1 min for the bottom, and 15 sec each on each of the sides all on med-high heat (7 on my dials for my stove). I didn’t have cayenne pepper or peppercorn like I thought so I seasoned with salt, a light dusting on each side with Creole seasoning, and Some black pepper sprinkled directly onto the tuna. I also didn’t have olive oil so I used canola. I was super happy that it still turned out good because I never cooked a tuna steak before. I know I went off the rails on this recipe, but I still feel like it helped me to make a great meal and to be confident to make it again. \n\nI served mine over a bed of coconut jasmine rice and topped it with a mango avocado salsa that I made the day before."

"reviewBody": "I love tuna so I was excited to try this. I was worried about the cayenne and salt not giving enough of a flavor (so it wasn’t just spicy) so I added less salt and added grounded pepper to both sides of the tuna along with a little salt and cayenne. I always compare tuna to the seared tuna appetizer from outback which is my favorite. I had to cook the peppercorns longer, some of them popped. I honestly don’t know if the peppercorns gave much flavor to the tuna after taking them out of the pan before serving the tuna, but I think adding ground pepper helped. It was quite spicy, I would’ve liked more ground pepper and less cayenne but it was enjoyable either way! I made mine with wasabi mashed potatoes and spinach. Wasabi mashed potatoes definitely gave everything else an extra kick!"

Additionally, I would not sear the peppercorns unless you have a fantastic exhaust fan, as another reviewer stated the house became filled with smoke which could be very dangerous for anyone with asthma or respiratory issues. Next time I will eliminate that step &amp; coat the outside to the tuna with course pepper instead.to get a blacked crust."

One variation which works for us is to sear a shorter time and then put into a low temp oven--250 degrees--until internal temp gets to perhaps 110. For those who like pure sushi, this may be a step down, but others may find attractive. The absolute key is to get good, fresh tuna."
