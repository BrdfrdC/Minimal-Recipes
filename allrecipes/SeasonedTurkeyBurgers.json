I used a package of beefy onion soup mix and I did add 3 tablespoons of plain Panko bread crumbs. it turns out I'm not sure if I even really needed them because killing them in the fridge for 10 minutes made an incredible difference. They held together beautifully on my grill pan and are wonderful. This will be a new staple in my house, thanks for the recipe."

This is a spectacular recipe, burgers turn out very flavorful and very juicy. I saute them for about 5 minutes a side. add a salad or hot vegigie and you have a terrific dinner or lunch. I eat them without the roll, just plain on the plate with a little Heinz spicy ketchup. YUM, YUM,YUM"

I used 1 lb. of ground turkey instead of 1 1/2 lb. so I cut the onion soup mix quantity in half. Also, onion soup mix tends to be salty so didn't want to over-do it. I added a slice of colby-jack cheese the last minute or so and covered the pan to melt. Love this recipe and will be making frequently!"

I did make a couple of minor changes - I made this into a meatloaf and we ended up having meatloaf sandwiches with cheese and mayonnaise, and because it was a meatloaf I added some breadcrumbs to help combine it better. I also used low sodium soy sauce (which I do with most recipes). The turkey flavour really shone through, which I loved. Will be making again."

"reviewBody": "Recently I moved into an apartment and had to donate my grill so I wasn't sure how these burgers would do in a skillet. To my surprise, they turned out fabulous and quite juicy...to keep them from burning on the outside before they cooked through I added some water to the pan after the juices had time to accumulate and then covered to keep the steam. I always worry with ground turkey that I will undercook it, so I did try and check by cutting into the burger and then cooking them five minutes past when I thought they may be done. Luck was on my side as they were cooked, yet still juicy!"

I added 1 tsp of garlic powder, used lower sodium soy sauce, and added 1 Tbsp of worcestershire sauce. I kept the amounts of everything else the same. I used a old peanut butter lid lined with plastic wrap to press the burgers, and I came out with 10. I grilled them, along with some other burgers for my husband. He really liked these burgers, and said whatever I did 'different' he really liked!"

I made them on our Foreman Grill, cooked for about 15 minutes. Got 5 good- size patties. I served them on a sesame bun with tomato slices, swiss cheese and avocado. I would probably rate them 3.5 stars if I could but my husband thought they were great. He said they were the best turkey burgers I've made, so I feel like 4 stars is fair. Thanks for recipe!"

When I made this recipe, he not only ate it, but he said \"this meat was really good\". I made it in a pan instead of the grill because we live in a condo and do not have a bbq. I used 15% fat turkey and even saved some of the mixture to make the following day. I think that one was even better that the first days batch. The second day, we had them with white basmati rice instead of hamburger style (more like a kabob style). YUMMY!"

"reviewBody": "I love these burgers! They are easy to put together, juicy and flavorful. I used 1 pound of foster farms ground turkey. To that I added 1 package of Lipton Onion Soup Mix and 1 garlic clove, egg, slightly beaten, little soy sauce and fresh ground black pepper. My patties may have been a little larger so I ended up with 5 instead of 6 burgers. They did not take long to cook up on the grill, about 20 minutes, only flipping once. I served these on hamburger buns with thick slices of local tomatoes and manoa lettuce. The burgers are well seasoned, nothing overpowering at all. They are juicy and tasty, not dry and not needing any extra condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, etc) to the burgers. The preparation, ingredients and cooking time are approximate. I served the burgers along with, \"Baked Sweet Potato Sticks,\" also from this website. These baked sweet potatoes are also VERY good by the way and complement the turkey burgers nicely."
