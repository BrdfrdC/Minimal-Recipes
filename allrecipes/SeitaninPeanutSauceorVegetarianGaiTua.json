Mix in the spinach and green onions; cook 3 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the spinach is cooked."

I did make my own seitan as I was unable to find chicken flavored..not difficult and it freezes well. Will make this again for sure"

"reviewBody": "This was simple to make and fast to put together especially using the pre-made seitan. I made the sauce per the recipe, except that I used agave syrup instead of sugar and used only half the amount called for since I think coconut milk is sweet enough as it is. It was pretty good as is but the only flavors I could really pick out were the peanut butter and coconut milk so I doubled the seasoning elements (red curry paste, chili sauce and oyster sauce) and that helped a lot. I wasn't sure about the spinach but it added a nice color to the dish and blended in well with the other flavors. I served this over whole wheat spaghetti. Will make this again with my changes."
