And like most, mixed the butter in with the crumbs and lined the pan. Didn't have any butterscotch chips, so used more chocolate chips and added some real peanut butter not chips) to the SC milk. Yum!! This also helped to cut the sweetness. Thanks for the recipe."

When the condensed milk goes on top of the coconut it forms a better top layer. The way this is under the coconut it didnâ€™t bake right and I ended up having to put it back in the oven after they cooled. They were so gooey I couldnâ€™t cut them and they were falling apart. Didnâ€™t think it would make such a difference."

I used 2c graham cracker crumbs and 1 stick of butter, which made the crust just the perfect amount of crispy. One variation I got alot of compliments on was using semisweet, milk chocolate and peanut butter chips (made half without coconut) then after removing it from the oven, sprinkled honey roasted peanuts on the half with no coconut...yum! Ive made this recipe 3 times in a week with 3 different combinations of toppings and all came out great"

The recipe calls for 1.5 cups of crushed graham cracker (comes out to 10 full graham crackers) and .5 cups of butter. I added 50% more. So I used 2.25 cups of crushed graham cracker and .75 cups of melted butter. This made the crust an appropriate thickness. I put the crackers in a large ziplock bag and used a rolling pin to crush into powder. Used a sifter to get uniform thickness of the cracker crumbs. Came out great!"

I crush the graham crackers instead of buying already crushed ones (makes a difference) I always melt the butter in a separate bowl and mix the Graham cracker crumbs thoroughly in the same bowl before pressing Into the 13x9 pan. I use dark chocolate instead of semi to help cut the sweetness. Make sure to pour the condensed milk BEFORE the coconut that way the coconut will toast in the oven. Soooo good. I always get so many compliments with these."

"reviewBody": "I made these with the following changes: I doubled the recipe, mixed melted butter with store bought crumbs then pressed onto foiled and greased (very important step) 17Ã—11Ã—1 sheet pan, I poured one can sweetened condensed milk over the crust, 1 layer of choc chips, 1 layer of butterscotch chips, 1 layer of pecans and 1 layer of coconut. Finishing with the 2nd can of sweetened condensed milk over the top. The baking time was 6 to 7 min longer so that the center of the pan could get toasted. I was able to lift the bars out of pan easily after cooling on wire rack. The pan was still warm when I lifted them out and I think that's helpful because once the bars are completely cooled the melted ingredients turn into cement almost. Very difficult to get off pan. I cut into bars and stored in an air tight container putting a piece of wax paper in between layers of bars and stored on countertop. Came out delicious as always!"

I like how it's all in one pan ... melt the butter in that one pan, don't need to grease the pan, all super easy. And they're a hit with everybody!"
