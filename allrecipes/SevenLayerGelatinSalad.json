"reviewBody": "I make this layered jello in a Bundt pan every year for Thanksgiving. Mainly for my younger nieces and nephews. It sure is time consuming, but the result is rewarding. I use vanilla yogurt instead of evaporated milk though. The timing is most crucial thing to this simple dessert. You have to check between each layer how it’s setting…if you touch the previous layer and nothing sticks to your finger, that’s too firm…so the remedy for that is to ‘slightly ‘ warm the next color of jello so it will ‘stick’ to the previous layer…hope that makes sense! Honestly, I think it’s the best to do a trial run in a small dish before you do a big 7 layer. Once you get a hang of it, it’s very simple, but just time consuming. Good luck and have fun!"

It is very time consuming but worth the appreciation from little kids."

I brought it to my in-laws for mother's day and popped it out of the mold and it immediately began to separate and slide off the plate. Not only that, the kids (and perhaps the adults, although they didn't say) didn't care for the evaporated milk layers. Over-all, it was a failure. I think it needs Knox gelatin in order to keep it's shape. I thought it tasted all right but I wouldn't make it again. Too much effort."

"reviewBody": "Extremely easy, you just have to make sure you start it with enough time to finish it. I made it in about 3 days, and probably wouldn't have taken as long if I hadn't been working during the day. The problem with it was transferring it to a plate--it slid all over the place and some of the layers broke. No one really seemed to care, though, so that worked well enough. I wanted to do a rainbow since I was taking it to a baby shower, so I used cherry, orange, lemon, lime, berry blue, grape, and blackberry fusion in that order. Despite the breakage and the fact that jello is hard to transfer, everyone who tried it seemed to like it, including the new mother. I left the rest of it for her, actually. I think it would be better in a jello mold or individual serving cups, however, as opposed to a rectangular pan. Otherwise, this is one of the easiest recipes I've ever followed and it certainly got me a lot of awe that I spent a lot of time making it (which I really didn't!). Thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I made this in a trifle dish for my sister's colorful wedding. It was beautiful and tasty but I'm only rating the recipe three stars because I had major trouble with the directions. I ended up having to throw my first attempt out because, despite following the directions exactly, the layers melted one another and formed one big black unappetizing layer. My second attempt, however, I decided to stir in 3/4 cups of ice cubes instead of the water to bring down the temperature of the gelatin before adding it to the solid layers. That worked MUCH better. I also let them solidify for a full 60 minutes instead of 45. I read on the internet that there might be problems with letting them completely solidify because the layers may end up separating when they are unmolded but I had no problems with that (of course, I didn't \"unmold\" the layers because they were in a trifle dish...but when dishing out the layers they adhered perfectly)."

"reviewBody": "Fun recipe! Spraying the bundt pan with pam is important. Even with this precaution I had to jiggle it and coax it away from the sides of the pan before turning it upside down on the plate. Given the number of layers, it made about 10lbs of jello. Too much for our little get together- had to throw a lot of the leftovers out b/c we couldn't finish it in time (generally a BIG no-no, but considering it was just Jello... no guilt there). For those who aren't big Jello fans: the evaporated milk layers are reminiscent of cheesecake... esp with placed next to strawberry or raspberry layers. Its by no means cheesecake, don't mistake me. But it IS an interesting twist. We liked it &amp; will make it again, next time in individual bowls. Two words of warning: make sure each layer sets before the next one is added. Second: don't put yellow next to blue. Somehow, despite allowing a whole day to set in-between these layers, they still melded together and made a huge \"icky\" green color that kind of marred the effect. Still turned out nice however- esp when sliced. All and all I'd say this is easy, tasty, fun for kids AND adults, and totally worth the time and refrigerator space."

I waited a bit too long for each layer, and they all began to separate on our plates. Still yummy, but next time I'll pay more attention to the clock."

I think you could get the same result by using smaller container and less layers of jello or doubling each layer. I also had read to grease the dish you are serving it on so that it lifts easily and wish I had remembered to do it. I think it was yummy with the evaporated milk and easier to do than most layer recipes."

"reviewBody": "Very easy recipe! I saw someone else's gorgeous pic and knew I would finally be able to use up those packages of gelatin that have been taking up space in my pantry, although I had mostly red/purple flavors, so my layers were not so dramatic. Still, even though I nearly ruined it (instead of just dipping the bundt pan I used in hot water to loosen, I plopped it down in the sink and forgot about it for a few seconds...don't do that!) after that heart-stopping \"splat!\", my dessert was pretty much still intact and attractive - just a little gelatin had melted. Will make this one again!"

Just made it for a shower. Yummy!!"

"reviewBody": "This was great! I did smaller layers &amp; used 1/2 small box of jello for each layer. I did 10 layers total. I also used plain yogurt instead of the condensed milk. For the clear layer I used the 1/2 box jello, dissolving 1/3c. boiling water, then adding 2 icecubes &amp; enough water to equal 1/3 cup. Then I pour this into the pan &amp; let set for 30 min. While that is setting I make the cloudy layer with 1/2 box jello, 1/3 c. boiling water, 2 ice cubes &amp; enough water to equal 1/4 c. cold water. Then I add 1/4 c. plain yogurt &amp; mix well with a whisk. Let this sit on counter while other layer is setting up in fridge &amp; when timer beeps, add the cloudy layer &amp; repeat process! It was fun &amp; delicious. I did red &amp; green jellos for christmas but you could do any color!"

Next time I will use less layers, and more red jellos (ie strawberry, raspberry, cherry) because I liked those the best in this, and they look the prettiest, IMO. Original review: This is very time consuming. I tried to hurry the process and merged the last 3 layers into one large one. Made in a trifle bowl to show the colors. Will update on taste..."

I tell you adults love it! I made it in a casserole dish and the 7 layers filled it to the top but the layers were thinner and would look better if they were thicker. But with a layer of whipped topping on the top was yummy! Next time I'm going to make them in wine glasses for individual desserts! You could do so many colour combinations for different holidays! I also put each layer in the freezer for about 25 minutes, which cut down on the time quite a bit."

I'm not really fond of the evaporated milk layers though, and the trick is to pick several flavors that will taste nice together...if I did this again, I'd probably pick 2 flavors and layer them. I also didn't have space in my 13x9 pan for a 7th layer...not without sloshing it all over, anyway."
