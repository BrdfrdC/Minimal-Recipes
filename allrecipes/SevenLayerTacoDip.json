The beans should already have a good flavor, so no need to alter that. You can also buy the can of beans with jalapeno, or like me, I will use some homemade leftover beans, but I would definitely omit the bell peppers too. Not a flavor I want to taste in a dip like this. =) Then you can give this altered recipe a much better rating. Enjoy!"

The taco sauce adds so much more flavor than just plain salsa. I also left off the green peppers and olives because of kids. I added black beans. This is one of the best recipes the way the layers are designed with seasoning with the beans and cream cheese add with sour cream. So good!"

I was concerned there wouldn't be enough beans to cover the bottom, so I added a little bit of salsa and it worked out perfectly. I did not add tomatoes or green pepper. I didn't think they were needed. I put the green onions on top of the cheese just because I like the look of them. We don't like olives so I didn't use those. This is a great recipe that you can make your own."

I couldn't find my usual recipe so I tried this one. Adding the cream cheese lessened the punch of the sour cream so I would take that out. I also made it in a pretty display bowl but would definitely adjust the layers because putting the tomatoes, peppers &amp; salsa all together takes away the visual appeal you could get. I would also add in guacamole as a definite must. We just scooped it on top after the fact. Like I said it wasn't terrible but it could be made better."

"reviewBody": "This is a very good basic recipe that can easily be tweaked to your own liking. \nOne reviewer stated that cream cheese doesn't belong in this dip. Well, I suppose not if you're trying to make authentic Mexican, but I think the creaminess is what makes this dish. It balances nicely with the robust flavor of the taco seasoning, tomatoes, onions, and olives.\nNext time I will add a layer of guacamole.\nThis would go nicely with black beans and corn also."

I used a 9x13 pan and thought at first that it would be too big because recipe called for a large serving platter.Nope, perfect size and if I used all the ingredients this called for, it wouldn’t fit. I used 1/2 head of lettuce and 1 cup of hand grated Colby Jack cheese because that’s what I had on hand. Very tasty and I like how my vegetarian friends can enjoy it, too."

I personally didn't put the olives on because I don't like them. The first time I made it, I didn't put very much lettuce on because I was worried about it wilting, but I found it too cheesy. The second time I made it, I put on the whole head of lettuce (or, most of it) and it was much better and didn't even wilt! I also discovered that it doesn't really matter what type of bell pepper you use because no one can tell the difference anyways, so just use whatever you have on hand! Definitely recommend trying it!"

I was concerned that it would make the dip watery. Just depends on how much liquid your salsa has. This is a recipe that you can adjust to your liking. There was not a bite left! Will definitely use this recipe again."

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe in lieu of buying a dip for an anniversary party. I doubled the batch and did it on a 16\" square heavy duty plastic tray... good idea on the heavy duty LOL. I bought the restaurant-style refried beans and mixed with taco seasoning. Then a layer of the cream cheese/sour cream, topped with cooked taco meat, then chunky salsa that I had drained, then olives, green onions, and cheese. I knew it would be sitting out so I opted out of lettuce and thought that if I did salsa AND tomatoes, that would be a bit overkill. I had the taco meat to use, that's why I threw it in. I know, don't rate it if you didn't make it exactly like the recipe and I completely agree. In this case though, I went searching specifically for this recipe knowing what ingredients I had and was going to use, and this dip was gone by the end of the evening."
