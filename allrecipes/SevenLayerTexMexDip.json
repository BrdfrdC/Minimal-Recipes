We brought to the Christmas party tonight and it was ALL GONE."

This was topped with more cheese and spoonfuls of salsa. Right before serving I squeezed lime juice on top. *I subbed the mayo w/cream cheese after reading multiple other reviews. Served with Tostidos Scoops and Fritos Scoops."

I make it just like the recipe, with one small change. I started adding one more can of refried beans, and i spoon it in little dabs on top of the sour cream layer. When you spread it, it mixes slightly with the sour cream mix and makes it even more tasty, and also more filling!! Then I just top it with the cheese and veggies like normal! I can't tell you how many events I've made it for and its always the first thing to run out (which is why i bring two pans now!)"

DO NOT OMIT THE MAYO...you will be disappointed!"

Like many other reviewers, I used lite sour cream, fat free refried beans and left out the mayo; therefore we avoided all that extra fat as well.

Other changes I made were to stir in a bit of salsa into the refried beans so they weren't so 'stiff' and I also sprinkled the top with a bit of chopped fresh cilantro. This was a hit!"

I personally don't care for packaged Taco Seasoning so I make my own, omit the mayo, use refried black beans as opposed to Pinto beans and I thinly slice pickled jalapenos on top. The other change I make is that I spead a thin layer of good quality salsa over the beans.\nIt's an attractive tasty dip that always is the first to go at a party!"

I thought the taco seasoning way overpowered the other flavors and the smoothness of the sour cream. If I made it again, I would do it without the taco seasoning or with maybe 1/2 packet. I made it in an 11x7 pan and that seemed to be the perfect size. It was quick and easy to make and made for an attractive presentation. Other people at the party really liked it but I would not eat it again as is."
