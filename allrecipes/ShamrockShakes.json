These shakes are usually at the top of the request list. I add more ice cream and less milk. Because as is, it’s too runny. I also add crushed up thin mints cookies or mint oreos to the top and sometimes use mint chip ice cream. Delish"

I actually put a little of the chocolate syrup in the shake mix because it wasn’t sweet enough without it. Delicious. Tasted like mint ice cream. And I hate McD’s shamrock shakes…homemade is perfection."

As others stated, I added less milk...probably 1 cup of milk per 2 cups of ice cream. I will never again buy a Shamrock shake from McDonald's! Last year when I got one, it tasted a bit odd and I think it was the dye they used. And...for about $6 I was able to make about 10 shakes for my family."
