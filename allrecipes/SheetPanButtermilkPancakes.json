"reviewBody": "I made this almost exactly as the recipe is written. (I would never write a review on some thing I haven’t tried ). My husband is one of the pickiest eater‘s and even he liked it! Followed by my children and they liked it! What I like best about this is it can all be made at one time. Rather than making and flipping four pancakes at a time in a skillet! ( I’m always the last one to eat or half the pancakes are cold). Minor adjustments I made: I did not have buttermilk so I made my own with 2 tablespoons of vinegar, and adding enough milk to make 2 cups. I used pancake mix in place of baking mix since that’s what I had.… It was a little thick but if I would get a bigger pan it would thin out. While the pancake was baking I also put a pan of bacon in the oven (my preferred way of making bacon). I don’t know if it was my oven or the fact that I had two things going at one time or a combination of both but I had to leave it in for 35 minutes at 350°"

"reviewBody": "My response is directed to the the review that was posted as the most critical about this recipe. I too have not tried this recipe. But, in answer to the review question, “what do you think about this recipe?”. I “think” it sounds like a great recipe. As to the comment on the quality of the recipe, I’d say it’s what you yourself add or take away from the recipe to make it your own. This recipe is no effort and crowd friendly if need be; things I look for in a recipe. So, based on that, my rating is 5 stars on the recipe alone. I can’t wait to try it. THANK YOU!"

"reviewBody": "I made this using Krusteau pancake mix. I don't like the taste of Bisquick personally. It was very good! Since just 2 of us, I made cut into 8 pieces and use 2 pieces each with just our Wisconsin maple syrup and butter. We loved it! So simple to make!!! The next day since I had alot leftover I frozen 2 pieces for later use but use 2 squares for our dessert and topped with strawberries and blueberries that I lightly sweetened with sugar and added a dollop of whipcream on top and we both like it too!! I haven't used the 2 leftover frozen pieces yet but when I do I'll try to remember to make another comment!"
