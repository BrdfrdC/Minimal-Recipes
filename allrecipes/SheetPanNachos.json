We did vegan beef, refried beans, vegan cheese and sour cream, and added fresh tomato and lettuce. And lots of hot sauce!!"

I salvaged enough for dinner, but to say it wasn’t pretty is an understatement…my fault, not the recipe’s. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, cut back a little on the cayenne, and added some cumin to the meat spices. All things considered, this tasted pretty good, and I’ll definitely make it again, but next time, I’ll have a firmer grip on the pan."

We topped with pico de gallo, chopped avocados and sour cream.. I prefer to bake my nachos in a 350 degree oven until the cheese is melted and the chips just start browning."

I subbed a can of black beans for the meat (and used the same seasonings, plus a healthy dash of both garlic salt and cumin and a squeeze of lime because I had one on hand) and omitted the olives per personal preference. I served with salsa, sour cream, more jalaps, and quick pickled red onion. Sheet pans: they’re not just for cookies; thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Did not use the black olives (don't like them) nor the jalapeno peppers (didn't have any). It was good. 3 minutes in my broiler was WAY too long, the edges of the chips got burnt. Also I would recommend spraying the foil with non stick cooking spray before placing the chips on it, the chips and cheese stuck to the foil. We liked the seasonings, although don't put a lot of salt on the meat as the chips are already salty. Will make this again."
