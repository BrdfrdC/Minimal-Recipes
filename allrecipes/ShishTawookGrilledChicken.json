Similar to those who have commented before, I modify it slightly using a little Paprika, Turmeric, and Cayenne Pepper. It is my wife's favorite dish. We love to share the rich flavor with friends when they visit."

(My bf does prefer it with a little less oil in the marinade.) I’ve made this SO many times that I have memorized the recipe. It is flavourful and delicious. We eat the Shish Tawook in tortillas with marinated turnips (the purple ones) and fresh tomatoes along with some homemade garlic yogurt sauce. Thank you so much for sharing your amazing recipe. \n\nFYI: I’ve also made this recipe and put it in the freezer in sealed bags for cooking at a later date. It works well and tastes great even after being frozen."

This is a very popular dish in the Middle East. Different recipes had slightly different ingredients. Will definitely make again. My husband asked if I had kept this recipe because he would like it again. I did not thread on any veggies, but I know it would only add flavor. Thanks for this recipe"

I'm a big fan of Lebanese food as well as going out to dinner. This recipe is as good as anything you would get at a Lebanese restaurant. When I make this I serve it with pita bread, hummus, and Lebanese rice (a recipe from AllRecipes). Would also pair wonderfully with Fatoosh salad."

I felt it could've used a tad bit more salt and some heat of some kind. When we make this again, I will probably: a) double all of the spices except salt, b) Add an extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and c) marinate it overnight."

The spices were just right - don't skip the cardamom! It was super moist. I served it with Tabbouleh III from allrecipes.com, as someone else suggested, Greek yogurt dill dipping sauce, hummus from the store and pitas from the store. It made a wonderful dinner, and it was so easy to make."

"reviewBody": "I made this to marinade last night. My husband Kelly and I are camping over the summer and my intent was to follow the recipe to the tee but what I like about this recipe is that it is very forgiving. I did not have allspice so I looked up what to do. Take cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. The recipe did not really say which garlic to use where so I put pre minced garlic in the marinade and the salt in the dip. At first it was a little salty then I added lemon juice. It was delicious. I also only used 1/2 a cup of mayonnaise with 2 tablespoons of Greek plain yogurt. Again all I had. I did not have peppers but did marinade the onions all night with the meat. I did not have cardamon so again I ad-libbed and looked it up in google. We used two tablespoons of ketchup because that is all we had. It was soooooo good. Both of us give it a 5. I will try next time to make it as states. Thank you so much!"

"reviewBody": "This is the recipe I was looking for. However, I tweaked it just a little. I use Fage Greek yogurt and I was tasting some of the sourness of it too much on the chicken, so I doubled the oregano, tomato paste, garlic, pepper, cinnamon, allspice, added a half teaspoon of paprika and also added a teaspoon of red chili pepper flakes for a little heat. (I know it's not authentic) Seriously, twice I've promised my roommates that Id same some kabobs for them but I just can't help myself. They're just too freakin good. Nice char on the outside and restaurant quality moistness on the inside. I grill them on the BBQ first with aluminum foil on top of the grate then after they're decently cooked I let them char up by putting them directly on the grill. Do it!"

"reviewBody": "Just finished scarfing this down and I must say, what everybody has been saying here is true. This was fabulous and tasted just like the chicken I've had at many Lebanese restaurants. I followed the recipe to a T and did not change anything. I marinated skinless boneless chicken breasts for 9 hours and didn't cut them up. I cooked the chicken in the NuWave Oven-4\" grill, 8 minutes one side, 13 minutes other side, and 5 minutes on first side again. In the NuWave at the same time, I roasted chunks of rutabega, after dunking them in the marinade, for a total of 30-35 minutes. This vegetable is tough and needs about 30 minutes at least. Ate it with pita and garlic sauce I made in the Magic Bullet: 5 garlic cloves, 1/4 cup Lemon juice, 6-8 ounces of grapeseed or canola oil, say a half tsp salt or to taste, 2 egg whites. Good thing about the Magic Bullet is that you really can just dump it all in and it emulsifies. After mixing for 30 secs to a minute total, I just poured it all out and then put back half and wizzed it until suddenly it takes on a mayonnaise like consistency. Then I did the other half. Perfect. This was an extremely tasty and easy meal. This is a real keeper."

After seeing the most helpful reviews, I skipped oregano, added heaping recipe measurements of the other spices except the black pepper. Instead of oregano, I added 1/2 tsp dried mint, pinch of turmeric and shake of cayenne pepper. Marinaded 5 hours, then grilled as directed with red/green peppers and onion. Served with seasoned saffron rice and fresh naan. This will be a regular from now on."
