I used red wine instead of white. I added a tbsp of sugar just to sweeten it up a bit but that was my personal preference. What a great salad! Perfect side for any barbecue meats or actually as a side to any main course. Thanks so much for sharing."

Wonderful recipe, I just made a macaroni salad for the 4th of July and used the dressing with green pepper, scallions, black olives and cubed cheddar cheese. Scrumptious! Thanks so much for a new favorite!"

If you use regular jalapeños instead of pickled, check for taste before dicing. Jalapeños can vary widely in the heat they have. This is a nice break from the usual. Definitely give it a try."

I then proceeded with the recipe and let it chill about 3 hours. We both really enjoyed this dish along with 'Chili-Lime Chicken Kabobs' and 'Roasted Cauliflower 'Steaks'' from AR. This salad would be great for a party or carry-in as the colors of the dish make for a very pretty presentation."
