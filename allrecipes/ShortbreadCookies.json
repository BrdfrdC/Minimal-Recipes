The dough that stayed in the fridge overnight was a little bit better results than the previous day. I‚Äôd probably try adding a touch more vanilla or use a better quality extract next time. The dough was very dry, I didn‚Äôt have sticky dough like other comments, not at all. I used an electric mixer throughout. I got almost 4 dozen total. I put the last roll in the freezer so we‚Äôll see what that turns out like."

"reviewBody": "The recipe makes about 3-4 dozen\nI wouldn‚Äôt worry about using a press- shortbread isn‚Äôt pressed normally.\nI was always taught to make shortbread it as a drop cookie like chocolate chip, peanut butter, etc- scoop a ball with a spoon and drop on the sheet, smush with fork. It‚Äôs not a flower, but people will know YOU made them. \nTips from mom and aunt with 60 years of baking each: \nThe dough is likely to get mushy while cutting and cook up hard if you try to roll them out and use a cutter. \nThis will be hard TO DO in a cookie press, unless you have a really expensive one. Usually those are for similar cookies: spritz cookies , made with eggs. (Softer dough)\nDon‚Äôt over cook them! If the dough is over worked or they are cooked till golden, they get very hard. Still rich and good though! They keep nicely outside of the refrigerator or freezer for a couple weeks . They are awesome with a half slice of chocolate orange on top, or lemon zest, or cherry or spices."

Next time I'd bring that down to 15 mins so they aren't so cold they crumble when they're cut or so that the middles aren't so cold when baking that they don't cook evenly. Half the batch I pressed into white sugar prior to baking. I see these as a nice little cookie with my morning coffee (with the sugar)."

"reviewBody": "This is a delightfully easy recipe and the result is immaculate. The cookies were perfect and buttery in each bite. My family absolutely loved them . I added a couple more tablespoons of sugar for a tad more sweetness and chilled the finished dough for about an hour before rolling it out on a lightly floured surface and using cookie cutter shapes (for my 3 year old to enjoy) with half of it and scooping the balance out . This is certainly a keeper and will a staple for quick dessert snacks at home. Thank you for sharing it with us!"

I followed the recipe , however my dough would not come together. So I grabbed a softened half stick of butter and threw it in the dough and continued to mix dough. Everything came together, used a cookie press successfully, baked great and tasted wonderful. I rarely use recipes that do state the grams as I weigh all my ingredients. A cup is not always a cup depending on who manufactured it, a gram is always a gram on an accurate scale. I have three sets of measuring cups and they all weigh a cup different."

In addition to the 2 tsp of vanilla, I added 1/4 tsp almond extract. I also added an 1/8 cup powdered sugar to enhance the flavor. \nMake sure you add the full 4 cups of flour! I reduced the flour by nearly 1/2 C at the advice of some reviews &amp; my test cookie was flat &amp; greasy.\nBe care not to overcook! I cooked mine for 12 mins &amp; they were too brown. \nOverall taste was great &amp; just like I had imagined."
