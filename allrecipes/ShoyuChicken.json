I also left out the red pepper flakes because i am pretty sure shoyu chicken should have a balanced flavor. \"1 onion\" is a super vague spec. What kind of onion? How big? I got onions almost 4\" across and onions the size of garlic cloves. I cooked the thighs at 225f in my pellet grill until they reached 165f internal temperature. Everyone loved them."

Some people only want it reviewed if you do it exactly as is and I guess if I was a professional reviewer that would be correct but taste is subjective somewhat so flexibility should be part of the charm of the recipe. I KNEW I wouldn’t want so much raw onion so I used half the amount. I could tell it was already quite spicy/peppery so I didn’t add the optional cayenne but did try the full amount paprika. I grilled boneless skinless chicken breasts because my health requires low fat. This will be on my alternating regular menu.."

After trying, I adjusted to family's tastes: Added 20 oz. can pineapple chunks, drained &amp; reserved 1/2 cup of juice. Replace water w/ this juice &amp; 1/2 c. apple cider vinegar. (Recipe needs this tang!) No oregano. Adjust cayenne pepper amount to how HOT yours it! The sauce is good on rice also. Options: peanuts &amp;/or a little peanut butter stirred into sauce after dish is cooked."

I fished the thighs out and let them cook enough to de-bone then put the coarsely chopped chunks back in the pot to warm. I served with pineapple rice. If you like spicy, dip more sauce out, if you don't like it hot, use a slotted spoon to just get chicken."

"reviewBody": "This came out really great but I will admit that I made some adjustments...so take it with a grain of salt. FWIW, I used half the soy (I can't have the sodium), substituted 1 TSP of ground ginger for the ginger root and added 1/2 C of apple cider vinegar and 1/2 C of honey. Before anyone yells at me for adjusting the recipe, keep in mind I still rated it 5 stars as I think it would have been great even without my adjustments. Also, stay very close to the grill when cooking...these burn QUICK if you're not on top of them. I gave them grill marks then move to indirect for the remainder of the cooking time. Enjoy!"

Left the sauce as is, but made a few changes:\nUsed breasts (we had them on hand)\nCooked covered in the oven in a roaster on a raised rack\nThickened with a bit of corn starch and cooked the marinade while the chicken was in the oven to make a sauce. \n\nServed with rice and mixed veg. Chicken was juice, and the sauce was amazing! This was a hit in my house and will be made again!"

But then I took the dry ingredients and made a rub out f it. So once it was done marinading, I dried the chicken, and then rubbed them down with the spices. I thought it came out pretty good! If you go this method I would definitely cut back on the brown sugar though! Something to try next time."

My only tweak was to use Coconut Aminos instead of soy, due to an allergy. Coconut Aminos taste just like soy but with less sodium. I also baked the chicken in the marinade and then finished them on the grill. By baking the marinade with the chicken, it was safe to use as a sauce. I separated the onion s and solid bits from the juice, added corn starch and honey to what was left and had a great \"teryaki\" type sauce for spooning over the finished product. Delicious!"
