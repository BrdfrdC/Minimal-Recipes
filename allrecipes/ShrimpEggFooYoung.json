Better to use Xiaoxing wine, rice vinegar or in a pinch, apple cider vinegar. They all have a sweeter, mellow finish\n\nI added oyster sauce for more umami flavor\n\nInstead of chicken broth, I used broth made from shrimp heads and skins."

You can use sauteed bell pepper, sauteed mushrooms, leftover coleslaw mix, broccoli slaw, zucchini, carrots, or any other veggies. It's even good with a bit of chopped celery, bok choy, or chopped regular cabbage. \n\nYou can also use beef broth in the gravy. I highly recommend getting a bottle of oyster sauce, or vegan oyster sauce (made of mushroom.) Put a couple of TBSP in the egg mix and a couple of TBSP. in the gravy. That is the secret to tasting like restaurant quality. I REALLY like your addition of sugar here. I have not done that before, and it made a huge difference. \n\nThis is such a great recipe. It's such a nice place to start."

"reviewBody": "Excellent! I used finely diced cooked pork roast that I marinated in soy, brown sugar and oyster sauce before frying off to caramelize. I did a quick saut√©e of all veggies before I assembly lined dinner for 8. I did a few with and without meat. Added cilantro for those who favor the taste. My go to foo yung sauce has always been 3 C stock, 3 T Oyster Sauce, 1 T Pad Thai paste, 1 tsp Thai Garlic Chili paste. Simmer for 20 minutes. Thicken with a corn starch slurry. I‚Äôve added some garlic powder when the mood struck, but the base sauce hits the flavor notes, I think compliment the egg foo yung best. A relatively light and yummy alternative to omelets. Just as messy and I honestly prefer these! Thank you for reminding me how much I prefer them!"

"reviewBody": "The Chinese restaurant across the street from my house is still better. I made the recipe exactly as written. The patties, for me, were a little bland and a little thin. I'd probably hit it with a lot more garlic, some soy sauce, and maybe even some 5 spice powder. I'm also thinking the egg mixture itself might use some corn starch. Unlike most people, I thought the sauce had real potential. It was more thin than I'd like, so I'd increase the cornstarch. I'd probably use beef stock rather than chicken. I'd also increase the soy sauce by quite a bit; probably 2 more TBS."

We did take some of the advice that was given by one reviewer to only use 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 tablespoon of vinegar rather than the amount proposed in recipe.

I'm not sure why the garlic was included as it doesn't come through. This recipe yielded 4 good size patties that I cooked for 3 minutes per side."

I cooked the recipe according to directions but the shrimp egg foo young patties still did not have any taste. I added additional seasoning to the gravy (soy sauce) hoping this would rescue the taste before serving. I even omitted the vinegar since someone else who made it said the vinegar ruined the gravy for the patties. I'm not sure what additional seasoning is needed to bring this recipe up to snuff. If anyone has anyone suggestions I would appreciate the help since we love shrimp egg foo young! Thanks."

I have also used caned Chinese vegetables and a can of beansprouts. I have also added onion and celery. I always cook the vegetables first and then add to the egg and fry. The sauce is what makes these. Don't let the vinegar scare you. I used powdered chicken broth the low sodium one to cut down on sodium. I made it tonight and my Dad said it was the best meal he has had all week."
