Cook on medium heat for 5 minutes. Blend 1/2 &amp; 1/2 with 2 tbsp corn starch before adding to skillet and it will be thick. Add cheese. Stir in pasta. Thin with 1/2 c pasta water if too thick. You can add fresh broccoli or any veggies with the mushrooms and garlic. Love love!"

And as a result I ended up with a ton of leftover fettuccini. The sauce it did make wasnâ€™t very flavourful and the pasta was dry as a result of a lack of sauce. Would not make again.\n\nAlso, the shrimp should be added in the last few minutes, not the first few, as it takes forever to thicken and the shrimp gets overcooked."

I sautÃ©ed the shells in butter, removed them, added more butter and garlic. Removed the garlic, added shrimp which I had dusted with Cajun spice removed them after cooking a minute on each side, added juice from dried mushrooms, should have added some red wine, then cooked frozen stir fry veggies and the mushrooms, removed them and put in 1 cup of heavy cream and 1.5 Cup milk, heated and added 12 Tablespoons of Parmesan cheese, grated. It was a labor of love, put it all together in the end and heated through with 9 ounces of fresh fettuccine noodles. Absolutely fantastic. SautÃ© shells is such an flavorful addition. Well worth the time. Fed 4 no leftovers."

Very good flavor, easy to make but I would never use cooked shrimp and cook it that much again. Yuk. Use fresh or frozen shrimp thatâ€™s thawed and it will be perfect! I will use a little more cream next time so that itâ€™s stays creamy after adding all the pasta. It dries up fast. Hubby and I ate the entire pan and I donâ€™t usually eat lot!"

"reviewBody": "Easy, simple, fast...and so tasty and creamy. I like the idea of adding a shrimp stock to the Alfredo (must try next time). I followed a lot of your suggestions on here and doubled the garlic content, the half-and-half, and parmesan. I also added about a T or so of corn starch as well as a bit of pasta water to aid the thickening process (saves on time!). All in all, I think the flavors (cream, cheese, garlic, butter, shrimp) all married well together and made the dish flavorful, authentic, and creamy. By the way, the pasta itself also helps the sauce thicken...just mix it all up well and use the double ingredients or so for the sauce and you'll be quite pleased with the results! On a side note, I find you'll need more than 10 min for the pasta to cook Al dente; I cooked mine for 12 min and could have even used a minute or two more."

"reviewBody": "The flavor of the sauce earns this recipe 3 stars but as written this is again an example of using the wrong shrimp and way over cooking them to the point it degrades an excellent dish. The amount of sauce is also insufficient for a pound of fettuccine. I tried a second time using 16/20 raw peeled shrimp, cooked them with the garlic and butter while my wife prepared the sauce. We doubled the sauce amount and timed it so everything was ready at the same time. Turned out much better and we will make again in the amended version."

"reviewBody": "This is a decent foundation however there were some changes I made: I doubled the ingredients for the sauce as its way too little sauce for the amount of ingredients. In fact, I think next time I would triple the sauce ingredients. I used whipping cream instead of half and half, added additional seasonings because it was pretty bland (pepper, onion powder, also make sure you add enough salt). I also added a little more cheese. We also enjoy broccoli with our alfredo which I steamed and added at the end with grilled shrimp. I did not add shrimp in the beginning as I did not want them to overcook. Also to thicken the sauce I added about a 1/2 tablespoon of flour...would've used cornstarch but I didn't have any on hand."
