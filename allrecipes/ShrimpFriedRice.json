I sauteed my onions with garlic and a little ginger root for about 3 minutes and then added the bean sprouts. I then put the cooked rice in the wok with the soy sauce and some Chinese 5spice seasoning. I then added everything to the rice once the soy sauce coated all the rice. And I played it and topped it with raw scallions. I wish I had taken a picture. Because mines looked better than the picture posted. And when I say it was delicious... IT TRULY WAS and you don't need the at ALL."

"reviewBody": "I think this rice could have had way more potential. As a warning, I did not have bean sprouts or green onions on hand. It seemed like those two flavors were definitely missed in this recipe. \n\nI used leftover, refrigerated basmati rice from a couple of days ago (to keep it as firm as possible), and raw shrimp (to not over cook them). I agree that adding the egg in the rice made the texture completely undesirable, so I would recommend cooking the egg 3/4 of the way (in a separate skillet) before adding it to the rice. \n\nI'd also recommend seasoning the shrimp beforehand (even with something as simple salt and pepper)... the shrimp could have had a nice pop, but it was plain instead. I'd also recommend putting the shrimp in and cooking it 1/2 way before putting the rice in (if it's raw)."

I also used Italian rice ( Arborio) as I find it holds its shape better then regular rice.I had no problem with the shrimp, it did not get over done.That being said it was very good , Iâ€™m giving it a five for flavour.\nThank you for the recipe."

This is my fault, however, for not tasting the dish before I added all four tablespoons and the extra salt. Just keep in mind when cooking, you can always add more seasonings but you can hardly ever take away!"

"reviewBody": "Wow. This is so good!! Here's what I did: very hot wok, a tbsp of veg oil, added grated carrot, chopped celery and onion, tossed into the wok until softened, about 3 to 4 mins, then added finely chopped fresh garlic just until the aroma hit me, maybe a minute more to soften it. Removed completely from wok, then added about a tbsp of oil and cooled rice, tossed for about 3 mins, and returned the carrot mixture to the wok with some thawed peas and corn. Tossed until incorporated. I scrambeld 2 eggs, salt, pepper and a handful of chopped green onion in a frying pan until loosely set and added it to the rice with 3 tbsp of soy sauce, a splash of sesame oil, cooked shrimp and just a little more fresh green onion. Tossed together until combined and hot and... Incredible. I even had a jar of Chinese 5 spice on hand and at quick reach just incase, because I really didn't understand how this could possibly be flavourful on its own, but completely unnecessary. Best fried rice I have ever had. No joke. I can't believe how good this was!! Super easy too!"

My husband is on a low carb diet (45 to 50 carbs per meal) and the changes makes this a dish he can enjoy guilt free. It also makes for a colorful and visually appealing meal. I also use Geisha canned bean sprouts because our very rural location makes fresh bean sprouts hard to find and keep on hand."

Even though the flavor was great the result was not what I expected. The rice way to sticky, close to mushy and this because of adding the eggs last. \n\nI recommend this recipe if you are looking for an authentic flavor."
