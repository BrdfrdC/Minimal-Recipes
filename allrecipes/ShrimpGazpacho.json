If your cooking raw shrimp, steam them and ice them down as soon as they're done. I used a tablespoon of Old Bay seasoning on them while they steamed. This makes a lot of soup, so be prepared to share with neighbors. Because its seafood, consume as soon as possible (I don't that will be a problem)."

Added the rest of the chopped veggie, two tbsp EVOO, one tbsp hot sauce, the 2 remaining cubed avocados and the shrimp. Served ice cold with a nice chardonnay and crusty bread. It was a huge hit at a gourmet dinner. Will make this over and over."

It was fantastic for lunch today and as I made the whole recipe, will be for many more lunches and dinners! I only made a few slight changes, using Low-Sodium Tomato Juice and a bottle of clam juice to sub for the tomato and clam juice cocktail. I also used 1 SlimCado (Florida Avocado) as it is lower in fat / calories and much bigger than a Hass Avocado. I seeded the cucumbers before cubing and only used 1 pound of salad shrimp. After following the recipe exactly after that...I found it needed a little more seasoning. So, I added about 1 Tbsp low-sodium worcestershire, 1-2 tsp celery salt, and several drops of tobasco. That made it 5 stars! \n\nWith my changes, this came out to 117.9 Calories, 2.5 grams Total Fat (0.2g Saturated, 0.3g Polyunsaturated, 0.1g Monounsaturated), 73.7mg Cholesterol, 208.3mg Sodium, 611.1mg Potassium, 15.5g Total Carbs (2.3g dietary fiber, 6.5g sugar) and 9.9g Protein Per Serving (12 Servings)"

This ratio seemed right to us (I cut the recipe in half and got 6 generous portions) but we really liked the extra juice. I also added 1 TBSP Worcestershire sauce, 2 TBSP Olive Oil and Hot sauce. We also found the recipe needed more salt. I used 2 Lbs. shrimp and chopped them into bit size pieces. (Husband likes the extra protein) We enjoyed this more the next day as the onion flavor mellowed. Over all this was a huge hit. My husband was impressed with how healthy this is and my Father-in-law just enjoyed the flavors. This was a refreshing change of pace. I will make this again. - Huge hit Dawn. Thank you for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "Let me start by saying that I have traditionally hated most things tomato based and have never been able to stomach a glass of V8 juice. But, desperate for a summer soup, I gave this a try. It was amazing. I made some modifications including: I added some yellow peppers, some juice from a jalepeno can (per suggestion of other reviewer), season salt, lemon AND lime. ALSO, and this was the biggest thing: Clamato or whatever the bottled tomato/clam juice is in most stores has as ingredients: Water, high fructose corn syrup, tomato, blah blah blah chemicals, clam juice, in that order. I vetoed that. Instead, I used tomato juice and got an 8 ounce bottle of clam juice and combined them. I added a bit of agave to try to imitate the sweetness I imagine the canned stuff had. But, to be honest, I don't know if I'd add the agave (or that much) in the future. Maybe only a few tablespoons rather than nearly a quarter cup! Anyway, it is excellent. YUM YUM YUM"

"reviewBody": "This was WONDERFUL! I grew up eating this and it tastes just like my dad used to make. I scaled it down and used what I had on hand. I used a 46 oz of V8 vegetable tomato juice, 1 cucumber, 1 avocado, 1lb of cooked, frozen shrimp that I defrosted under cold water, half of a red onion, half bunch of cilantro, 1/4 lemon juice, salt, pepper and about 1/2 to 1 tsp of cayenne pepper as well as a tsp of worchestire sauce. It turned out so well. Be cautious if you choose to put cayenne in it. As I was making it, it didn't taste very spicy at all so I added a bit more but as it sat in the fridge to chill, the cayenne assumed its full potential and was hot. We love spicy food and it wasn't too spicy for us at all, but wanted to tell others in case they used it and couldn't taste the flavor as they were preparing it."

"reviewBody": "This is almost identical to authentic Mexican Shrimp Cocktail. If you want to make it as such, add extra lime, a little salt to taste, and here's the trick: either add the juice of a can of jalepenos to taste (just the juice!) or a few dashes of Tapatio. I use both. All you need is a package of saltine crackers and a nice cold beer for the perfect summer treat!"

"reviewBody": "I never thought about using avocados in soups before, so when I came across this recipe I was pleasantly surprised. The only thing different I did was leave out the cucumber, use mixed seafood instead of just shrimp, and make my own tomato soup base by stewing some tomatoes just covered in water with some garlic for 15 minutes and blending it with some leftover drainings from boiling the seafood. Absolutely delicious!"

"reviewBody": "I cut the recipe down to 4, I used frozen/thawed salad shrimp (otherwise I'd have given them a rough chop), I diced everything very fine &amp; I used cilantro-in-a-tube (about 2 tbps). I also added celery salt, a couple of tbp of EVOO, a tbp of worcestershire (figure it's good in bloody mary's so what the heck), some diced yellow bell pepper &amp; a smidgeon of hubby's hot sauce (it's garlic, serrano peppers, bell peppers &amp; onions, roasted &amp; pureed). I made it up &amp; let it meld in the fridge for a couple of hours &amp; then gave it a squeeze of lime before I served it in chilled bowls. This is a very filling, satisfying gazpacho ...all the accompaniments it needs is some toast &amp; a glass of sauvignon blanc. Thansk for a great recipe Dawn...we really enjoyed it!"
