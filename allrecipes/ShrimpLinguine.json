"reviewBody": "My family loved it, but I did think it fell on the \"bland\" side a bit, even though I increased the garlic, added white wine, and offered lemon wedges and red pepper flakes on the table. As previously stated, it's a good base recipe, but needs tweaking (such as not so much parsley and uncooked shrimp). I would cook it again, though. Chicken could be really good with it instead of shrimp."

"reviewBody": "I did make some changes but think it would be excellent, if extremely rich and perhaps a tiny bit bland, as written. My main complaint is that it does not make enough sauce for that amount of pasta — the amount of shrimp is fine but it needs more liquid. My changes: 2% milk plus cornstarch, 1/3 the butter (plus a generous spoonful of light sour cream at the end). I doubled the garlic, used dried basil and subbed a small amount of green onion for the parsley (my parsley was a little sad looking), plus I added a few generous pinches of Cajun seasoning. People put their own Parmesan on. Oh yes, and I added some sliced sautéed mushrooms; I bet asparagus would also be great."

I then added the basil, parsley and thyme and finished the recipe as stated. The shrimp was tender and delicious. My husband and I really enjoyed this delicious meal.\nI will definitely make this recipe again and I will try it with the chicken also."

After finishing it, I noticed it was missing a little flavor, so I added some German spices and a little gravy binder, because it was a little to runny for my dinosaur tastebuds. Will try it again though, with the whole gang here in the next few months."

Precooked shrimp were tricky as I wanted them to be hoy but not overlooked. Make sure they are at room temperature and only go for 60-90 s condos. \nRule #512?? One can never use too much Parmesan cheese"

I didn't use any fresh ingredients, all my ingredients were dry flakes (basil, thyme, parsley etc.) However i used about 2-3 tbsp worth of dry basil and parsley flakes. I kept the measure for the thyme the same. I added about 1 tbsp of salt and half tbsp of pepper and it came out fabulous. At first i was wondering why the sauce was thin, but after you add the Parmesan it will thicken to an alfredo. Tasted like red lobster!"

There was a tablespoon of butter on the bottom of the pot, so I might lighten the butter a bit next time."
