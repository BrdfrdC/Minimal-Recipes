I will say that the shrimp I used was already marinated for fajitas so I'm sure that added to the flavor and I didn't cook it with the chips because I burned the chips the first time. I just made it kind of like a dip the second time and the many times after that. All other instructions were followed and it's always a hit. Like a stuff your face as fast as you can to get more before someone else does hit."

And instead of quartering the shrimp I chopped them my blender. But neither of these changes altered the recipe. Again my company really enjoyed them. The recipe does make extra so I am freezing the rest and see what happens."

My variation: Leave the shrimp whole and place one on each \"scoop\" style tortilla chip with cheese mixture. 2 cups + mexican cheese blend (*not* 2lbs - this must be a typo), reduce cumin to 2t, add 2 cloves minced garlic. Easy, flavorful crowd pleaser. Thanks for the great recipe!"

Corn chips hurt the roof of my mouth (yes, I am a delicate flower - hahaha). These are great with fresh pico de gaillo on the side - makes them seem lighter - I get my fresh-made pico at Publix - they do a great job and save me all.....that....chopping."

Good call, because even with just half the amount it still featured too prominently for me. I used fresh minced onion rather than dried and a 4-cheese Mexican blend rather than Monterey Jack. Hubs and I agree that this intriguing array of ingredients that led me to this recipe in the first place unfortunately got a little lost by the cumin. If I was to make these again, I'd reduce the amount even further, if not eliminate it altogether."

I assembled these at home and brought them with me and because they cook so quickly they are ready in no time. I actually got 2 cookie trays full from the recipe, so it makes a lot. I used shredded colby/cheddar cheese and monteray jack. Not greasy in the least. It says to quarter the shrimp but I must have had larger shrimp so I just cut them into smaller pieces. The combo of spices are excellent and you can taste everything working together....The adobo peppers, cilantro, cumin, parsley, minced onion with the cheese; and they look so great! Nice orange -color, green-speckled, cheesy mounded -over scoops with shrimp pieces peeking out. Winner!"

Thank you, AllRecipes!\n\nAnyway, I do a couple of things a little differently now which I thought I would share. I now use a Colby Jack mixture of cheese instead of straight Monterey Jack. They're less greasy that way (not that this is health food by any means!). They unfortunately don't make the McCormick white and green minced onion blend anymore, but plain dried minced onions work just fine. Make sure to use the minced and not the white/green onion powder blend!\n\nAnd I now like to use the scoop tortilla chips because the mixture won't run off the chip. If not, try to find the thickest tortilla chip you can. They hold up better that way. Enjoy!"
