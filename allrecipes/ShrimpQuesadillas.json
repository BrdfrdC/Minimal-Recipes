"reviewBody": "Wow. As good as any from any restaurant. I make them exactly as written except I make half of them without the jalepenos because some of my clan can’t do spicy, then I add the jalapeños to the rest of the shrimp mixture and make the rest. I Serve with sour cream and salsa. I have a 8-11 person clan. These are beloved by everyone - mild ones, medium ones with jalapeños, and very hot lovers put hot sauce on top once served. These have already been requested half a dozen times since introduced. The heat of the skillet when assembling and cooking the quesedillas is important. Too low and they get soggy and hard to flip. Too hot and the tortilla gets too done before the filling is is ready and then it doesn’t hold together when flipped. Medium is perfect."

I also added one clove fresh garlic, finely chopped. Using a stovetop griddle (since the shrimp mixture was in my only fry pan), I was successful in making one at a time. My husband raved at the flavor. 4 stars because of the time between each so it’s hard for more than 2 to eat together. The next day, I tried our panini griddle and that worked quite well."

I didn’t use jalapeño because I didn’t have any, and I used one red and one yellow pepper. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter and loved it. I put a dollop of sour cream, some salsa, and a dollop of guacamole on the side for a fun, tasty dinner! Thanks!"

They were light and I enjoyed the peppers, which I normally don’t put in my quesadillas. I’ll make this again but add more seasoning. I’m also confused by the calorie count. There’s no way these are 753 per serving—unless people are counting sour cream and guacamole that they add on?"

Served with avocado, plain Greek yogurt, chopped fresh organic kale and mango salsa. Oh, and a mango margarita! Took almost no time to make and was amazing! Will make again."

"reviewBody": "The other reviews don't lie - these are awesome good. \"D\" good as a matter of fact. I stuck to the recipe fairly closely, but didn't bother to measure anything. I also added some garlic, fresh mushrooms and wilted spinach to the mix for extra nutrition and because I had it to use. I wanted to do these \"restaurant-style,\" in one big quesadilla and then cut it into wedges, and I must confess I was nervous as heck doing so. A big spatula and a prayer turned it over in the pan effortlessly. When it came time to getting it out onto the plate I just merely slid it out from the pan. It's anybody's guess if it will work as smoothly the next time! I was really, REALLY impressed with this. A little sour cream, chopped green onion, and some salsa (I used green) and I was in shrimp quesadilla heaven. Whether you serve this as a main course, a snack, or as an appetizer this WILL be a hit."

The second time around, I cut back on the oil for the peppers/onions and, having purchased a super good non stick pan, I was able to eliminate any oil or spray for frying the queso's. I cut back on the cheese (personal preference) and the flavor is still fabulous. Not too spicy with 1/2 jalpeno and other seasonings per the recipe - and my family is picky. Thank you, Dana for a great submission!"

I wouldn't say a perfect 10 (or 5), but a solid choice! Will make this again since it's easy, everyone loves it (meaning my kids will eat it), and did I mention easy? I just throw rice in my rice cooker, and throw on a can of black beans for a complete dinner."

My family is very picky about Mexican food, but this was a big hit and leftovers promptly disappeared as well. The only things that I did differently were to add some minced garlic in with the onions when you begin to simmer them, I used butter instead of oil to fry the tortillas, and I only used a small bit of jalapeno, not nearly a whole pepper. I believe this will become a regular at my house..."

Totally not on purpose, but did not take away from the end result in flavour, which was great!"

You could really have fun with the recipe (adding other things you might like such as mushrooms or tomatoes).

I served these with 'Traditional Mexican Guacamole', salsa, sour cream and diced tomatoes."
