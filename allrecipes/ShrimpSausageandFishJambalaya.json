"reviewBody": "The tomato paste really makes this very different from your standard jambalaya. I would probably omit next time I make this, or perhaps add only half (if using from a tube instead of a can). It definitely makes it \"stand out\", so there's no harm in including it, though. Cod is the perfect fish to use for this recipe, absolutely brings everything together and shouldn't be \"optional\" in my honest opinion (or else why not just use a standard jambalaya recipe). I also added corn on the cob halves in with the fish. Definitely needs to simmer at least 15 min for the corn to cook, but the fish/shrimp did not get overcooked at all. Also added about 1.5 cups more broth in with the rice. Half seafood broth, half chicken broth would be great for this recipe. The real failing of this recipe as posted is the suggested spice mix. First, add a couple bay leaves. But the suggested name brand seasoning mix is SERIOUSLY lacking flavor and no one should use it just because this recipe lists it! Just look up a proper cajun/creole seasoning recipe, especially one that contains oregano and thyme. And if it still doesn't taste \"right\", when in doubt, add a little Accent/MSG."

I'm wondering how much that contributed to the rice being absolutely perfect."

Also backed off on the rice a bit. We made a 2 cup stock base from the shrimp shells and used 4 cups chicken stock and that made a difference in flavor depth. also added more black pepper and cayenne pepper for more spice. This is 100% better than any restaurants over cooked over salted mess."

We used a combination of long grain and medium grain rice (I used up all I had left which came to 2 cups in total). I ended up making seafood stock by simmering the discarded shrimp shells in 2 cups of water. I added the 2 cups of seafood stock to the pot. We also doubled the Cajun seasoning and added red pepper flakes. It was delicious. I awarded 4 stars simply because the recipe as written didn't allow for enough liquid to properly cook the rice. All in all, a very good dish, and one we will be making again."

"reviewBody": "Real yummy. Easy to make and ingredients are readily available in the supermarkets. Depending on your desire for heat, you can alter the amount of Cajun seasoning. I'm a light weight so I reduced it a little. The one step regarding no disturbing the rice, I think it needs some occasional stirring to keep the rice from sticking to the bottom and possible burn. Mine burned a little and it may be that the heat too high. Of course you don't want to stir too much or you end up breaking up the rice and creating a real mush."

Watched it and added 2 cups more of chicken broth around the time I put shrimp in. Rice stuck to pot shortly after putting in. I don't own one of those La Creuset type pots but think that maybe ideal. This is 2nd or third time I've made it. The ingredients are many but not far out from what I can easily obtain and already have on hand usually."

I followed the recipe exactly as written in spite of being skeptical about adding an entire can of tomato paste. In the end, it was just OK. The flavor was excellent and the andouille sausage really does make a difference but the consistency was off. The dish ended up being really sticky, saucy, and wet. The rice was completely cooked through but it was like a thick stew rather than the traditional jambalaya that I'm used to having. It might have been better to just use diced tomatoes because I think the tomato paste was what made it so thick. I'm going back to my original tried and true recipe!"

"reviewBody": "My family had a favorite recipe for jambalaya that we used for years but it was very labor intensive, requiring marinading the shrimp overnight. I recently hosted a special birthday party for ten guests so I doubled the recipe, and it was more than enough when served with artisan bread and a simple salad. I substituted pepperoni for the sausage because I prefer the flavor, and it is what my original recipe called for. I used the whole pepperoni stick (as opposed to the thin pre-sliced kind) and sliced it thickly. It added a nice kick to the recipe. I also used bay scallops in lieu of the cod because the guest of honor did not care for fish. The scallops were small and took only about five minutes to cook through. I also precooked the shrimp as I purchased two different kinds and I was uncertain that they would cook evenly. This turned out to be a good thing because I brought the shrimp to room temperature and added it to the finished product, only allowing it to heat through before serving. This resulted in the most tender shrimp... too often shrimp are overcooked and that makes them tough. Precooking the shrimp to perfection also permitted me better control over my serving time. Four of my guests had never had jambalaya before and raved about it. Everyone had seconds and there were still leftovers so it serves a very generous amount. I will never cook my original recipe again. This is my new go to with the modifications I outlined."

I also added some cayenne pepper into the shrimp, because again I like the spice kick. The recipe was very good. My wife and I loved it, the kids, not so much, but they would prefer hamburger helper...so enough said. I added the rice on very low heat, in fact as low as it can go. The broth evaporated within 5 minutes and the rice was not even kind of cooked. I had to add two cups of water to give the rice a chance to cook and again the water was gone and the rice was still not quite cooked. I kept it covered and undisturbed. Not sure what went wrong."

We are older and cannot tolerate very hot spicy food anymore. Other than that, it was great. Thanks for posting this recipe."

So I advise a little more stock or possible it was that I used basmati long grain rice instead of medium grain.

"reviewBody": "Just a few suggestions to improve the dish a little: You shouldn't need to add a fat to saute the sausage as it already has enough. I prefer a pure pork smoked sausage for this dish, but recognize that if you are not in south Louisiana, it may be difficult to obtain. Try an independent meat market and you may get lucky. I highly recommend stirring the raw rice in before adding your liquid--stir until every grain is coated with the oil from cooking the meats and seasonings; this will make the rice less sticky in the finished product. It is at this stage I would add in any seafood so that those flavors can mingle before the rice gets completely cooked. (After cooking rice for 25-30 minutes, there's no way you will get anything to \"boil\" again as stated in step 8.) Next, even \"red\" or Creole jambalaya is not usually this red; I have never heard of using tomato paste in place of tomatoes in jambalaya."

Does the recipe call for cooked rice or dry? I cooked the rice first before adding to the pot. I also used only 3 cups of broth for a thicker stew. Next time I will dice the andouille sausage into smaller pieces so that each spoonful has the delicious bits. I choose to add the codfish and it very mild and had a nice texture.
