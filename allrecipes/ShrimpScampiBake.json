I served over pasta lightly sprinkled with olive oil, and sprinkled with grated cheese (Romano and Parmesan, but any Italian cheeses will do). I poured the sauce from the pan over the pasta, and served the Langostinos on top. It cooks quickly so make sure you prepare the pasta and grated cheese first. My family gobbled it up like it was their last meal!"

I also sprinkled with fresh parmigiana cheese and used dry parsley as I didn’t have fresh. I am not sure how much garlic I added, because you measure garlic with your heart!!! Good recipe!"

I too used defrosted cooked shrimp so I didn't broil it for the full 15 minutes, it was more like 8 minutes. I did take the advice of a reviewer and sprinkled some panko on top and then used about 5 \n minutes under the broiler to crisp it up a bit. The shrimp came out just fine and I'm sure I'll be using this version of the scampi recipe again. Oh yeah, I only gave it 4 stars because I really don't like butter ...this was more for my husband."

Also, the suggested amount of butter in my opinion is perfect; any less would not have provided me as much sauce as I would have liked. \n\nI feel bad for not trying the base recipe as is, but the alterations I made did work out really well. I halved the recipe because I was using only 1 lb shrimp, and made the following alterations:\n\n+3/8 cup dry white wine (sauvignon blanc), \n1/2 ish tsp each black pepper/ajinomoto (msg salt)/regular salt, 1 sprig dried rosemary, couple pieces of bay leaves.\n\nI will 100% make again, thank you for introducing me to this tasty and easy meal."

After the mixture cools I lay down the shrimp and pop it in a 450° oven for 12 minutes. 15 minutes if you do 2 pounds but I did 1 pound and used one stick of butter. I still however used a whole lemon quarter cup of wine and a tablespoon"

Luckily my boyfriend was my sous chef because I didn’t know to add the boiled pasta to the shrimp before putting it in the oven, the recipe assumed that one should know :) We added some pesto, diced tomatoes and mozzarella....super yumm!"

This has become my “I don’t want to cook tonite I’ll throw together something easy” and I look like a rockstar! So easy, it’s the first thing my 16y old son learned to cook- he would make it for his girlfriends family and blow them away. He’s in the military now and still makes it when he and his buddies get together."

This was incredible in both taste and ease. \nFor those having an issue with \"too much sauce\", that is a true oxymoron. Use any leftover sauce over chicken, rice, potatoes, pasta, whatever. Dip your bread or biscuits in it to flavor them! My entire family loves garlic, so I am never shy about adding it to anything. This was awesome!"

"reviewBody": "My pet peeve is tail-on shrimp in sauce, especially butter sauce. I was fortunate enough to purchase two pounds of raw 21-30 shrimp that had been thoroughly cleaned, shelled and de-tailed. I made the recipe as written, adding red pepper flakes (traditional) and extra garlic to suit our taste buds. LOVE the addition of Dijon in this recipe, as it binds with the fat to make an actual sauce. Cook time for the jumbo shrimp was 15 minutes. Served on a platter of linguine and garnished with parm curls and more fresh parsley, this was a fabulous meal. My family requested (and received) homemade “Red Lobster biscuits” which I thought were overkill...but a fresh, crusty baguette and roasted asparagus would have been the perfect accompaniments. This recipe has forever changed the way I make scampi!"

I did make the modifications suggested by Sydney on Dec 20, 2005 except that I used 4 lbs of shrimp and doubled the recipe. I have since shared the recipe with a friend, as modified, and her son can't stop raving about it. From Sydney: \"I too made some modifications to this great recipe. I used 24 oz. of frozen shrimp, with the tail on. Used only 1 tablespoon of mustard, and I added apprx. 1 tablespoon old bay seasoning, 3 cloves of chopped garlic and 2 tablespoons of fresh parsley to the butter mix. After placing in a non stick cookie pan (with sides), I sprinkled it with a mixture (about two handfulls)of panko bread crumbs and fresh grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese. The last two to three minutes of cooking, I placed the oven on broil (just long enough to brown the tops of the shrimp). OUTSTANDING!\""

After baking, I removed it, added Panko crumbs to the top with just another very light sprinkling of fresh grated Parmesan, put it under the broiler for 2 minutes make a nicely browned top. Such a delicious recipe. I used 3/4 cup butter since the shrimp were jumbo and it was perfect."

Sometimes leaving out the lemon juice makes it bland so I added a little red pepper flakes because I like some spice. I then put shrimp in a small casserole and some cod in another small casserole. Put 1/2 of the sauce over each and baked. it was so yummy! I’ve been looking for some fish recipes. I wasn’t sure if this would work but it was really good. Can’t bake them together because the cod takes so much longer. Then served over zoodles with a piece of cod and a few shrimp. Everyone loved it."

There was plenty of sauce and the Dijon mustard gave the dish a nice, subtle 'zing'. Hubby loved it and we've eaten it for two meals and still have a few shrimp left over. It warmed up nicely in the oven. I put it in when oven was starting to warm up and left it in for a few minutes after it reached 400 degrees. It was plenty warm and still not overcooked. First time we had it I served it on a bed of wild rice and that was good...but the second time, I served it mixed with angel hair pasta and it was excellent! It is a nice, easy way to make shrimp scampi!! Thanks!!"
