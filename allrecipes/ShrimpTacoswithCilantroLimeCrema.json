Next I cut up all the veg and let it sit on the cutting board. Then i warmed the tortillas in my skillet, spraying them with Pam and let them crisp up. I put them all n a plate in my warmer drawer while I cooked the shrimp in the same pan that I warmed tortillas in. Then I assembled! I added some Mexican cheese on top of the creme and topped with shrimp and veg. My husband said they were great!"
