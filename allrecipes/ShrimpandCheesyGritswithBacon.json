I did use smoked Gouda instead of cheddar, I seasoned the shrimp with some Cajun seasoning prior to cooking them, and next time I’ll add extra chicken broth to the grits so they won’t be quite as thick, otherwise this recipe is perfect!!

I substituted the evaporated milk for Land O Lakes Greenhouse Half &amp; Half with 30% more cream, and I seasoned the shrimp with Badia Biscayne Bay Seafood Seasoning (less sodium). I added butter to the grits while simmering, and added scrambled eggs and buttered toast to round out the meal. The grits were so creamy and delicious as a stand alone dish, but with the shrimp and bacon toppings my family couldn't stop complimenting the food. I will definitely make this for breakfast again."

"reviewBody": "Good recipe - I didn't add any additional seasoning to the shrimp and for us it was a little bland. I couldn't bring myself to add a whole cup of cheese to the grits either - so overall, if you really want a flavor punch I think the other reviewers that ramped up the shrimp seasoning had it right. I'll do that next time, and will season the grits a little more to make up for the flavor lost by not adding a whole cup of cheese. Otherwise, it was pretty good. I am still trying to come close to the flavor of the shrimp and grits and I had at Pisces Rising in Mt Dora Florida. This doesn't quite capture the lushness of that dish."

I also added minced garlic to the onion, green pepper mixture. When the shrimp where done, I added a 1/4 cup of chicken broth (to loosen the bits from the pan). At the very end I added a handful of grated cheddar and a sprinkle of Old Bay to the shrimp. I wish I could say that my whole family loved it but alas...they dont like seafood.

I cooked the bacon whole and saved to sprinkle on top; added minced garlic to the pepper and onion, cooked that down and added about 2 TBSP of flour before adding the shrimp (which I increased to 2 lbs, jumbo-precooked); lastly I used water instead of chicken broth for my grits (personal preference). This recipe is a keeper for sure-Thanks!"
