I used stone ground corn flour, chopped turkey bacon and sliced hot dogs because that's all I had on hand and I really wanted to make this dish. Still came out delicious. I only had a few tblsps of half and half on hand, so I used chicken stock for all the liquids and added a small amount of cream to the grits and the gravy. I actually think it was better this way. I also threw in an extra tblsp of red bell pepper and the tiniest bit of chopped jalapeno to the gravy, and I used ros√® instead of white wine because it was open. Can't believe how tasty it was. Believe it or not, I hate grits and grainy foods! But I ever since I tasted this dish during a trip to Charleston, I have been craving it. I just had to try making it at home. I've been making it every weekend since. I'm eating some of the leftovers right now!"

And the truth is, I actually changed the recipe because I ruined the wine sauce...so I made a basic cream sauce with the heavy cream, butter and flour separately. I tossed the ingredients together and put everything into the crock pot. By the time the dish was served at the shower - you can imagine all of those flavors! The mother of the bride asked me to make it again a week later. What a happy mistake! Great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "So my review is really going to be about the \"gravy\" as that was what I was most interested in when reading this recipe. For the Shrimp and Grits part: I always make my grits with a little garlic powder, salt, either half and half or heavy cream as it make a more creamy, smooth grit taste versus just water. And I just throw everything in the rice cooker, hit the button and walk away. I prefer not to have to stand over it. \nI cooked the shrimp separately for this recent Easter brunch due to some guest being allergic to seafood. \nFor the gravy. I followed the recipe, yellow and red peppers, garlic, onions etc, but used Andouille sausage instead of the Tasso Ham as my local grocery didn't carry Tasso. Turned out delicious. Guest were raving about it. Used it over the shrimp and grits as well as over the biscuits. Yumm! We will definitely be adding this into our gravy rotation.\n\nFor those that said the sauce didn't thicken, try adding a handful of regular or Panko breadcrumbs right before adding the cream and it will thicken right up . Thanks for the recipe!"

I substituted sliced and diced turkey for the ham, and found out halfway through that out of the 8 bottles of wine we had on hand, absolutely ZERO were white - so, red cooking wine it was! It came out great! I used dehydrated chives and onion powder and even zinged it up a little with some cayenne on the shrimp. we still used the cream sauce, and mixed it into the grits, but it wasn't like a gravy. it still tasted awesome. for the grits, I used 4 packets of instant grits and boiled 2 cups of chicken broth. instant grits have never tasted so good! Thanks for the recipe! will be making again!"

I also added chopped garlic to the pan with the other veggies. Finally, I only gave 4 stars because I needed to thicken the sauce with a little flour and it tasted a little bland to me so I added garlic salt, pepper and Cajun seasoning. It was delicious and I'll definitely make it again."
