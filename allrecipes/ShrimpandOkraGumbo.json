"reviewBody": "I will be honest I have not tried this recipe yet. But I do have a question for all the reviewer‘s here. I did not see anybody mention anything about the amount of oil used. If this is a healthier recipes and you’re not actually making a roux, I can’t see the point of using a half a cup of oil. That just sounds like an exorbitant amount of oil. Plus anybody that’s ever cooked okra, you would never put the okra in first, I can see maybe adding it with all the vegetables and sautéing them all for about 15 minutes. Otherwise the okra will become mush. As a matter of fact, I probably wouldn’t even sauté the okra. I would just add it to the pot when I added all the other liquids and seasonings. Does anyone have any comments about the oil? I am trying to cook healthier and would like to try this recipe, just trying to figure out if reducing the oil would really make that much difference."

I also used a good bit of ground black peppercorns and cayenne pepper to add that New Orleans \"kick\". Have added this recipe to the regular \"lineup\" of meals at our house! My girlfriend thought it was real good too (just a little too hot for her though)."

"reviewBody": "Ok...for those who want to know what I did different...which I mostly did do the whole thing different...here it goes. And it was delicious. \n\nIngredients:\n\n2 lb shrimp peeled and deveined (well mostly)\n2 lb okra...or what looks like a \"mess of okra\"\n2 cans chopped fire roasted tomatoes\n1 big sweet yellow onion chopped\n4-5 garlic cloves chopped\n1 bell pepper chopped\n6 stalks of celery chopped\n1 lb bacon chopped\nshrimp stock\nchicken broth\n1/2 c green onion...or thereabouts\n\nFirst do the shrimp. The recipe says prep time for the whole thing is about 15 minutes. They lie. After I peeled the shrimp I seasoned them with some Tony Chachere's and the juice of one lemon and set aside. I took the shimp shells and legs and whatever was left and put on with some water to boil. I cooked this while I chopped up everything else. It boiled over twice, so watch it. Boil the shells until the water smells shrimpy and is kinda murky and then let it sit. \n\nMeanwhile, you've been chopping and changing positions constantly because your back hurts. You have been thinking that maybe one of those ugly mats with the padding has some merit, after all. \n\nOnce all the chopping is done, unless you are somebody who likes to drag that sort of thing out, cook your bacon. After all the bacon is done, save the grease in the bottom of the pan and add some olive oil...a good bit to make sure you have enough to saute the okra. \n\nPour the okra in and stir it up good. Don't let the heat get too high,"

I doubled the recipe and used an entire LARGE can of tomatoe paste for 7 cups of water. Traditional gumbo has more tomatoe than that. It's best to use a cajun seasoning, like Tony Chaceres, rather than just cayanne. Other than that, everything marries greatly together."

"reviewBody": "I don't know why this recipe has such a high rating. It is WATERED DOWN and BLAND. If you decide to make this anyway, please do not put no where near 12 cups of water in it. I put 10 cups in only because my pot could not handle 12. In the back of my mind I kept thinking that this is waaay too much water, but I tried my best to follow the directions (although it just did not seem right). Furthermore, there was no salt or any kind of spice that contained salt to boost the flavor (I'm not a big fan of salt, but I do know that it does help in adding flavor). To try to save this big pot of mess, I tried to cook it a little longer to cook down the water-but that made it worse. I cooked some rice to add in it to add more texture, because by then my okra and everything else was a big mushy mess. I also added some \"slap ya momma\" to add flavor. After adding \"Slap ya Momma\" it was edible. The next day it was better, but this recipe is not worth making again; therefore, I am continuing my quest to find the easy and delicious seafood gumbo."

"reviewBody": "Very hearty Gumbo! Followed many of the advices offered by others esp. SPEYERER's (tripled the recommended ratios). Used 7 cups of water, frozen okra, and Bay seasoning as recommended; made a big difference in flavor for the better. Also used seafood mix, red potatoes, and a can of dark red beans. Seasoned and sauteed the shrimp. Topped off the gumbo with a scope of brown rice and parsley with green onions. Delish according to everyone who tried it :D"

Family enjoyed it, but I was sitll dissatisfied. Further, I had added creole seasoning and Old Bay, and some scallops. Hint: frozen cut okra is much more economical at this time of year (January) than fresh!! Tastes the same, after cooking down. Pretty good, but I'll keep looking and experimenting."

"reviewBody": "Sorry to review this as modified, but it was pretty yummy this way. Time consuming, but good. ILO water, I made \"Seafood Gumbo Stock\" from Sara on this website. I think that added to the depth of flavor, but I can't attest to whether or not it's worth it. Does make good use of the shrimp shells, though. I also made a roux with 1/4c flour and 1/4c butter, cooked to a chocolate brown (I hear this is how gumbo is done traditionally). I added the roux after the stock to thicken things up (didn't measure how much stock I actully used). I used frozen okra, boiled for a few minutes to take the edge off, and cooked it the regular amount of time per the recipe. Also, didn't have tomato paste; substituted 1 can of regular Rotel for the tomato paste and tomato. For the seasoning, I made 1/4 batch of \"Creole Seasoning Blend\" from Joslyn on this site - sprinkled a few tablespoons over the shrimp several hours before, added the rest to the pot after the roux. Perfect spiciness for us (not OMG HOT, but had a kick and a very nice flavor). Added 1 bunch of parboiled and chopped swiss chard (part of the lucky New Year's theme I was going for), and accidentally omitted the green onions. Served over brown rice. A lot of work, but yummy. Would definitely make again.\n~~~~Just made this again. 12 cups stock is way too much 6-8 cups is better. If you realize this too late, scoop out the solids to avoid overcooking them and boil down the liquid. It makes a huge difference."

The extra 20 minutes of simmering after adding the shrimp back in is unnecessary with the reduced water. Oh and I added a ton of garlic salt since I didn't have the bay leaf, oregano etc that everyone else was suggesting. Still, it's a good basic recipe for someone who's never attempted gumbo before (me!)"

So...I added much more tomato paste, more celery and the following list of spices: Tony's Creole seasoning, Old Bay, garlic salt, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and a bay leaf. I think the bay leaf is crucial for any Louisiana type dish! Once this simmered for a while, the flavors were so amazing! I served this over rice and also added sausage to bulk up the protein a bit. I love that this recipe uses fresh okra, one of my favorite vegetables! I will certainly make this again, but I will reduce the water (or use chicken broth) and will add a can of tomatoes rather than just the paste and one fresh tomato since I really prefer a tomato based sauce in spicy meals such as this. Serve over rice and maybe even add a slice of cornbread. Yum!!"

First, I scaled back on Okra (I'm kind of unfamiliar with it, being I'm from the north and all... plus I can only find it frozen, and it's relatively expensive). To make up for it, I used a mixture of green beans, wax beans, and baby carrots. I added in lots more garlic, because that's how I like it. I omitted the celery and tomato paste, which I didn't have on hand. I also used about half vegetable broth, half water--and not nearly 12 cups' worth. Added paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, salt, and basil with the water and broth. Served it over rice, and it was très délicieux!"

I guess it's better to error on the side of caution with spices/seasons though... you can always add more but can't take away. It was, however, pretty soupy. I expected it to be a lot thicker than it turned out to be. I'd give 3.5 stars, but since that's not an option I rounded up. I'll make this again but maybe try something a little different."
