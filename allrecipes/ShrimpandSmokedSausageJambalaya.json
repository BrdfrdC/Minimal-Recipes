Did not used minced garlic which was fine because the dish is spicy regardless also used 1 cup yellow and white rice. But did take Jody's note on the lemon juice at the end and WOW what a tasty dish. I did learn how to stop having gooey rice by draining the can of tomatoes. Delicious!! Ty"

I did not have any jalapeño peppers so I had to omit them. Probably why the kids loved it and my husband and I found it to be bland. Definitely a great base for jambalaya and can be changed according to your heat level."

The flavors were those of a typical Jambalaya, but I found this recipe lacked in \"spicy\". The Hillshire sausage gave a great taste, I left out the shrimp because my son is allergic to shellfish. It's a quick one for sure, but it's hard to teach an old dog new tricks - no roux = no geaux."

I had to add additional liquid and cook for an additional 10 minutes. The flavors were great though and I would make this again! I loved the sausage on this. If I didn't have a 7 year old, I would make it even spicier! Served it with some hot sauce and French bread."

Tomato purée for the canned tomatoes because my son doesn’t like tomato chunks in his food. I also used only 1/2 a jalapeño as I didn’t want it too spicy. It turned out great, just the right amount of liquid, and everyone enjoyed it. I’m very picky about the recipes I keep, and this one is a keeper!"

I also thought it needed some more green color because we try to get dark green veggies in our meals, so I added a couple large handfuls of fresh spinach leaves right before adding the shrimp. Lastly, I didn’t have jasmine rice, so I used long grain brown rice instead and cooked it a little longer (maybe 5 extra minutes). The lemon juice at the end (I used juice from a whole lemon) gave it this nice tangy flavor (don’t skip that)... the whole family RAVED! ‘Definitely making this again! THANKS for sharing it!"
