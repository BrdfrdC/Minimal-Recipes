I boiled for 30 minutes and simmered for 30 minutes then left them in the pot for 45 more minutes to marinate. After that I put them in a 300 degree oven for one hour. Turned the oven off and left them in there for another half hour. I had sauced them per the recipe but finished them in my air fryer at 375 degrees for 6 minutes. They were good and very tender probably the best oven made ribs I’ve ever made or eaten. I would make again even though it is a long process. The air fryer was a good addition for the final result."

"reviewBody": "Sooo, the first time I make a recipe I try to follow exactly. But being the first time I've cooked ribs, I read through a ton of reviews and made several of the changes I saw. The flavor was really good, but they were just a tad drier than I like. I used half beef broth and half water, 3/4 cup liquid aminos (soy sauce), 1tbsp worcestershire, 5 smashed garlic cloves, 1 onion cut in chucks, 3 bay leaves, a few shakes of pepper and some old bay seasoning. I did not add any additional salt. All I has on hand was 2.75lbs of boneless country style ribs. I simmered for 45 mins and let them sit for a few hours in the brine for a few hours (as suggested by a few other reviewers). Then I ladled a few scoops of the liquid into a dutch oven, layed the ribs in and basted with Sweet Baby Rays. Cooked at 225 for 3 hours, basting a few times along the way. Took the top off and broiled for 10 mins t o caramelize. Next time I will simmer for 30 mins and play around with the oven cook time/temp. The family loved them, so it is a keeper! I also took others suggestions and strained the broth, cubed some potatoes and made some killer mashed potatoes!"

"reviewBody": "I've been looking at this recipe seems like forever, and never tried it; I always did my country style ribs in the slow cooker because I thought boiling them would make them tough. Well, today I decided to try it. Oh my gosh! I'll never go back to my old ways again. I had four pounds of country style ribs, some with bone and some not, about 7 ribs. Before I boiled them I put the normal rub I use and let them sit to room temperature. Then I dumped in the same spices I used with the rub - salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic, smoked paprika (yes I eyeball it). Let them simmer 45 minutes. At that point they were pretty tender. Doused them in Sweet Baby Rays on both sides and put in the oven for about 30 minutes. They were awesome! Hubby said needed more salt but he always says that lol. I might leave in oven a few more minutes next time to get even more sticky-ish. Lloyd, sir, you have made a believer out of me!"

I brought the water to a boil then added the ribs along with enough water to cover them. I added three quarters of a cup of soy sauce, one tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, one tablespoon of minced garlic, one tablespoon of pepper, and onion wedges from one large sweet onion. I let them softly boil for about 50 minutes and then let them sit on the stove covered for an hour and 45 minutes. I then put them in the oven, covered with foil, after coating them with Sweet baby Ray's honey barbecue sauce for 1 hour at 350, basting them halfway through. I took the foil off for the last 15 minutes. Everyone loved them!"

I bring them to a boil with kosher salt, fresh cracked pepper and fresh garlic (we like a lot of garlic), then cover the pan, lower the heat to a simmer, and leave it about an hour. Then I pull the ribs out, place them in an aluminum foil covered cookie sheet or roasting pan (saves on cleanup and conveniently stores leftovers), sprinkle more black pepper, a little onion powder &amp; baste them with plenty of BBQ sauce. Bake as directed, turning after a half hour or so and basting again. They come out sticky and oh-so-yummy EVERY time!"

After preparing it several times, this is what I do: 1- cut into pieces of 2-3 ribs each. 2- dry rub with bbq seasoning of choice. 3- boil for 45 minutes. (If I’m not ready to bake yet, I let them sit in the water until I’m ready. I feel like the times I’ve had to let them sit for an hour or more made them come out super good). 4- transfer to baking sheet in foil pocket(s) covered in favorite BBQ sauce. 5- bake fo 45 minutes. Done. And perfect!!!!"

I placed them in the boiling water with garlic powder, pepper.and salt for about 45-50 min. Then I used a big deep foil roasting pan and put the 4 half slabs in there and coated with lots of BBQ sauce. Tightly covered with foil and cooked on 350 degrees for about 1.5-2 hours. I had much more meat than this recipe so increased temperature and time a little. Then took off foil and put more sauce on and broiled it for about 5-6 min to get a little crisp on top. They were just so so tender. Fell off the bone and so easy...."

Cover them with water and I boil them for about 45 minutes, remove from water, place in pan, add bbq sauce (I drown them in it , plus add a little of the boiled water as well), and I bake them for 1-1/2 hours and they come out perfectly tender and falling apart."
