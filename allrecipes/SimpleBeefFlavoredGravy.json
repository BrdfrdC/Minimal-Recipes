"reviewBody": "Used recipe for a rough guide as I only needed a small batch. I added a little rosemary, thyme, substituted onion powder for the onion, a little garlic powder, and fresh ground pepper for extra flavor. I used beef flavored “Better than Bullion” to make beef gravy. Served it over some freshly mashed baby golden potatoes with skins on. Very smooth creamy beefy gravy really paired well with the freshly mashed potatoes. I would definitely use and recommend this gravy recipe again."

Make the roux with melted butter and flour. Cook for a few minutes then add the broth. I sub 1/2t. onion powder for the cooked onion then when it's the right thickness I add a splash of Worcestershire Sauce. I really brightens the flavor. I make this all the time and always use Better than Bouillon beef base."

But... at this point I had no more onions left... I used 2 cubes of bouillon instead of 3 - I used corn starch instead of flour and I added about 1/2 a can of beer... So, in order... boil 1 cup of water, add 2 cubes of bouillon, bring to boil... add 1/4 cup butter.... take 1/2 cup cold water add 1/4 cup of corn starch, stir till creamy, add this to the boiling bouillon, stir frequently as it thickens, and then add beer while stirring... let the alcohol cook out and Voila... ready to serve"

"reviewBody": "Very quick and easy, but also VERY salty (because in part of the additional bullion I used AND I had no unsalted butter). \nNo surprise, I wanted the gravy a bit darker so I used 4 bullion cubes, instead of 3. \nI prepared it this way simply because I did not have any gravy, no stock, and no large cuts of meat in the house to make my own pan gravy. \n\nWhile whipping up Salisbury steak as a quick, last minute supper, I went to the old standard quickie gravy (here), and it served it's purpose. It did make a thick, flavorful beef gravy.\n\nTypically if I go this route, I use unsalted or low-salt beef stock instead of bullion. \nI also pre-cook the finely diced onion until carmelized, for added flavor. \nThen, just before the onion is finished, I add a small amount (1/2 tsp.) of freshly minced garlic to the onion and cook for 2 minutes. I then whisk it all together, with a few grinds of black pepper, until thickened."

Bring to a boil and cook until thickened. I'll add less onion next time - it was a little too onion-y for me. We served it on meat loaf to 40 people today and the plates came back clean"

I used beef broth rather than bullion, but kept the wet/dry proportional. The only thing I did a bit differently was to use a couple (or three) tablespoons of consommé (Campbell’s) in the gravy for flavor. It already has seasonings in it, and is my secret ingredient when you don’t have all the other stuff you need to dump in beefy-flavored things. I used it on hot brown sandwiches."

I combined all ingredients (I used 3 teaspoons of onion granules in place of the onion) except the flour....i brought them to almost a simmer on low heat and then whisked the flour in slowly, instant thicken. It was very tasty and thick. Loved it"

I added black pepper and did as others by sauteing the onions first, added flour then the beef broth. I did add a tsp of beef bouillon trying to darken the light gravy but it did not help. It tastes like roasted gravy but sort of looks like chicken gravy. For a first time try it was simple, delicious and all natural ingredients. I am so glad I tried this."

Sauteed the onions in the butter, added beef broth to the flour and mixed very well. Put broth in with the sauteed onions, added the flour mix and as I was taught by my polish grandmother-in-law..... you MUST boil the gravy for at LEAST a minute to get rid of the flour taste. Then I added some gravy master for added color. VERY very good on the fly gravy. This will be my mainstay recipe for when I dont have drippings to make real gravy. I prefer the broth over the bullion so I can control the salt."
