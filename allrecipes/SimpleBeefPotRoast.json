Check the tenderness at about 2.5 hours, when it's fork tender it's done. You can always add more liquid to your gravy while the roast rests. The only variants I make are to add garlic to the chopped veggies and carrot wedges around the roast for the last 30 minutes. Served over mashers. Yum."

Second, and this has been a BIG hit, double or triple the amount of vegetables then after the roast is done use 1/2 or 1/3 of the vegetables to make a puree for topping the roast and/or vegetables. Remove 1/2 to 1/3 of the vegetables plus 1 Tbsp of the juice from the pan and place it in a blender. Puree on high and add small amounts of beef broth to get the consistency you desire (thick, but pourable). Place it in a gravy boat next to the roast and veggies when serving, it's fantastic!"

Came out tender and I was surprised to find that the juices of the veggies made plenty of liquid to pour over dinner and the remaining meat. Followed the directions and it was perfect. Took 2:45 in oven to cook 3.85 lb chuck roast."

Pot roast is cooked to well-done this makes the meat very tender which is what you are striving for. The tenderness and seasoning is where you get the flavor IE. garlic, onion, bay, rosemary and the vegetables. Anything less than fully cooked is roast beef. I love both, but for different reasons. Pot roast is awesome wish I had some now. Great recipe."

The meat was okay but was overcooked and tough and definitely nothing like melt in your mouth despite swimming in an inch thick of grease that came out during cooking. I intended to use the leftovers for roast beef sandwiches tonight but I can't see how it will be good since it is dry/tough. The veggies did mush together and surprisingly my teenager really loved them. Probably because they flavored up while swimming in the 1 inch thick grease at the bottom that came off the meat during cooking. Definitely no liquid was needed! We still ate it but I was really disappointed based on good reviews, expecting it to be wonderful and melting in my mouth like pot roast should be. It just seemed like I overcooked the roast (4 lb that I cooked exactly 3 hours 10 mins). I'd like to try again based on the good veggies but I don't know what I did wrong to correct next time."

I also cut WAY back on the butter since my roast had some fat on it. Was a bit skeptical but the vegetables were as delicious as the meat!"

I discovered Chef John a couple of years ago and have gradually been expanding my knowledge and skills ever since. I had a roast on hand and wanted to use it up so I searched specifically for a Chef John recipe. He did not disappoint. My husband raved all night. Tender, juicy, and simple but satisfying flavor. I’ll never make roast any other way again."

Next time will divide a packet of onion soup mix under &amp; over the roast before cooking, for added flavor. \nI discarded the overcooked vegetables, straining the liquid to a skillet for making gravy. \nThose reviewers who complain that the meat is over-cooked should learn the difference between roast beef and beef pot roast."

Very very disappointed in this recipe. I added garlic and potatoes as many people suggested but it didn’t save the dish- once it cooled down I added a cup of water, Dried Italian dressing In the packet , onion soup mix and A buttermilk Ranch packet- Anything for flavor. I cooked it another hour and then strained the veggies And roast out- took the gravy and put it on the stove- Added flour and made a gravy. I made mashed potatoes. Together everything went well but it took so much work."

I eyeballed the veggies, adding a little extra of each. Crushed two cloves of garlic and sweated it off with the veggies. A dash of thyme and rosemary and threw a 3lbs roast in the oven for 3 hours. It came our moist, with a crispy crust (think the best part of ordering carnitas). Served on top of some creamy mash potatoes with the veggies and we dug in. If you're looking for the ultimate quarantine meal... this is it. Throw it together, take a bike ride with the kids, play a little baseball in the backyard and in 3 hours... dinner is served!"

The wife wanted to know what seasoning was used...she couldn’t believe it was just salt, pepper and rosemary ( and butter ??). I like rosemary, but even if you don’t it’s subtle in this pot roast. The vegetables do cook down significantly and are very soft. However they are delicious. Next time I may increase the veggies and chop instead of dice. I did add peeled red potatoes for the last 90 minutes of cooking and they turned out perfect. This is your grandma’s Sunday pot roast, delicious and easy to make!"
