I am not a beer drinker and I don't know how it would have tasted with the stout but it was good with coors light. Simple to make. I had 2 pieces that were a little thick so I sliced them to allow for faster cooking.. Was tender after 1 hr 35min."

(We don't drink wine but you can get those cute little 4-packs at one cup each at the store ~ they are so great to have on hand when cooking.) Other than those slight modifications, I followed the rest as written. I was shocked and surprised to have a dish loaded with a complexity of flavor. This is going in our regular rotation. We loved it!"

Since I use a coffee-like spice on a lot of beef dishes, I thought using a coffee flavored stout beer would make this work for our family. it did !!\nThe idea was terrific. I had 2 hours to make side dishes while our ribs simmered, so all could be served together. At the end, the meat of course fell off the bone and remaining sauce was usable to keep everything moist. No leftovers here."

I served this over mashed potatoes and with green beans. It would, also, be good served with noodles. It came out so tender and delicious. Next time I will try adding some sour cream and perhaps mushrooms extending the sauce more. We have leftovers for lunch now - there were 2 large short ribs and 2 small ones in the packages that I bought so the small ribs will be lunch."

But I wanted to try these boneless short ribs and this recipe was simple and did the trick. I had no garlic but I followed along and used shallot instead of onion/garlic and added parsley, rosemary, thyme and tarragon to flavor it up. I used a small Staub dutch oven - two firsts - my first short ribs and my first use of the Staub pot. For liquid, I used white wine and water with a vegetable bullion cube. Came out great, two small portions, one for tonight another for some other time plus lots of gravy left over. I was so excited they were tender I forgot to take a photo (sorry) haha). If I did it again I would make a larger amount and save some for a friend. Thank you Allrecipes!"

I started later in the day, so I turn it on high for 3-4 hours and the aroma almost had me gnawing my elbow (not easy!). Leftovers the next day were even better. Took the suggestion of another reviewer and used the leftover broth for onion soup - they were already in there! Just added cheese and croutons."

"reviewBody": "I have made this recipe many times. There are better but more complex recipes out there for short ribs. However, you can't beat this one for simplicity. For added flavor I sometimes reduced the broth to make a demi glace. I even made this in a dutch oven over a campfire. We have also used beef shin instead of short ribs because it was more economical and it was just as good. Stout does add some more flavor but I usually use the darkest beer I have around, typically Yuengling Lager. This is one of those recipes that you can easily be altered to your taste to make it your own."

Sauce is more of a jus and was excellent as well. This will be a great recipe to play with! Seasonings and flavors will be easy to change up, as well as gravy thickness. Just as it was was magic with a little horseradish! :) Thank you!"

I did add celery and would have added carrots but forgot to pick them up from the store. I decided to bake them at 350 for 2 hours after searing and they were fall-off-the-bone delicious...

Usually don't change a recipe, but it's been my experience that meats cooked in wines have a bitter after taste and since I'm not a beer drinker was afraid I might mess up these great looking ribs. One review mention not having the beer and just used onion soup mix and water so that what I did. There were so MANY POSITIVE REVIEWS that next time I will venture out &amp; try the recipe with the beer. Truly falling off the bone and delicious"

I had read in an Americas Test Kitchen (ATK) article that using chicken stock when cooking beef gave better flavor. Not having the chicken stock I used turkey stock. To the pot I added 4 large carrots, cut in 2 inch long chunks halved lengthwise if it was easy to cut them. For the beer, I added Hard root beer, the \"root beer\" taste disappeared. I did not add the salt and pepper while cooking. The final product didn't seem to miss it. It could have cooked longer but the meat was fork cuttable as it was."

Other than that one change, I followed the recipe to the T... and my hubby loved it, said it was one of the best beef dinners I've made in a while! Now, from him, that is a TRUE compliment! Thanks SO much for sharing this one, my short ribs are usually so tough and flavorless without some kind of heavy syrupy coating... I will be making this one again. And OFTEN!"

"reviewBody": "I made one change to the recipe: only in that I doubled it. I don't know if my butcher's cuts on short ribs was wrong, or whether or not that would have made a difference.\n\nThat said, I had 2.3 lbs of short ribs in the form of 4 big ribs. I doubled all ingredients and cooked according to directions. In an attempt to avoid crowding the pan, I braised the seasoned/floured ribs in two separate batches. After the first batch (2 big ribs), I contemplated washing out the pan and replacing with new butter/oil. I didn't... cooked next 2 big floured ribs in remaining darkened butter/oil. Prepared everything exactly according to recipe, including buying stout, then doubling ingredients for my extra ribs.\n\nThe result: somewhat bitter and burnt-tasting gravy and ribs, with amazing flavors of what might have been. My thoughts are 1) if you're multiplying this recipe, change out your oil/butter before each little batch; 2) the Stout is quite bitter -- I love beer-based marinades and undertones -- but don't multiply the Stout equally by the recipe's ratio. (I used two bottles of Guinness for 2+ pounds of ribs and the bitterness was palpable.)"

"reviewBody": "Was very surprised despite all the good reviews. I did adjust for our family. I used almond flour seasoned with rosemary, garlic powder, pepper and paprika. I used a crockpot on low for 6 hours adding potatoes and carrots the last 45 min. My crockpot runs hot, thus the cut in time. I used Sierra Nevada Stout. I used 2 cups of beef bone broth and 2 cups of chicken broth. It was melt in your mouth and so flavorful. I followed others advice and was heavy handed on the salt when seasoning the meat. I also used the broth afterwards to make a delicious gravy. I think next time I will serve with mashed potatoes and green beans. This will definitely be a repeat for us and dinner guests. It's that good."

I didnt have stout on hand so i used half of a can of ipa (since i didnt want a strong bitter taste) and omitted the onion as I am allergic. Simply cooked with lots of garlic, salt and pepper. The Meat literally fell off the bone. Like other reviewers, I made a gravy from the sauce and my picky eater son asked for seconds. Will definitely make again"
