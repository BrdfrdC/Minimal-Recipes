Folks, you cannot give this recipe five stars if you changed it. All the five star reviewers changed the recipe. It's a lie that you made this if you tweaked it. I couldn't understand the five star reviews after I made this until I read them. I was totally misled into thinking this was going to be good based on the overall four star rating. Never again."

I used something less than a tablespoon, had twice as much noodles, 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef and two cans of cream of mushroom soup and the garlic flavor was still over-powering. It was just barely palatable enough to eat for dinner but the leftovers will go in the garbage.\n\nChange it to 1 teaspoon of garlic powder unless you're the type of person who likes to eat cloves of roasted garlic as an appetizer.\n\nI'll probably make it again because it is so easy but I'll cut down the garlic to a manageable amount."
