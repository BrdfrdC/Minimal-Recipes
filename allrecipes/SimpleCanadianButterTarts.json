The addition of lemon extract was interesting, but I did find it took away from the sweetness a bit. If that's what you're looking for in a tart, its great. Personally, I've had better."

My Fianc√©e playfully proposed again after his first one...and as he gobbled up the last one announced \"Make these again...tomorrow!\". I used a whipped shortbread for the tart shell. (Pastry isn't my strong point.) It worked out really well. I forgot to put in the lemon juice and they were still amazing! Great recipe, thank you so much for sharing! : )"

Don't waste your money, it's really not that nice of a taste. Will be leaving that out the next time I make them. Also, i used pre-made mini tart shells and only cooked them for about 12 minutes instead of 20-25 min. Oh- I almost forgot, a little to heavy on the raisins for me. Otherwise a nice butter tart!"
