So there's loads of seasoning in my drippings. I liked this gravy. It is the right way to make a sauce. It is quite easy to adjust to your taste, just mix flour and water out of the pot then add it."

Here is a photo of how incredibly THICK the \"gravy\". It was ridiculous. I salvaged it by taking half a cup of this (almost playdough thickness) mixture out and then adding about a half quart of chicken stock to my pan in order to thin it out."

I will be honest and say I did NOT use the whole half cup of water/flour mixture. I just eye balled it to see how much I needed. For the people saying it tastes like flour, the gravy is made from YOUR drippings which came from YOUR chicken! &amp; you can always season the gravy to taste as the recipe stated ?? This one is definitely a keeper, thank you for sharing!"

This was so simple and it turned out delicious! I saved the drippings from the roasted chicken I made, put in fridge until the next evening. I wasn't sure how this would work but I just microwaved it to melt down the fat then but it on the stove and followed the recipe. I cut the flour to 1/4 C as others suggested but then cut the water down to 1/2 C as well. Ended up adding 1 tsp cornstarch (mixed in a little water first) to thicken it up. You definitely have to keep whisking this as it does separate bc of all the fat from the drippings. I did add a little poultry seasoning. Outstanding."

"reviewBody": "I tried this thinking it would be a quick and easy way to make gravy; however, was somewhat disappointed. The trick to a really good gravy is to make a roux of equal parts butter and flour, cooking it while stirring constantly until it develops a carmel colour and has a nutty smell. When ready to make the gravy, whisk the four/butter mixture into broth/drippings. This will enhance the flavour (without the raw flour taste) and will thicken the gravy. Very rich!"

Mine did not become thick at all, so I added more and more flour until it finally became thick but when i tasted it, it was awful. I started over and when it still wouldn't get thick at all with the 1/2 cup of flower, I went ahead and dumped it into the very hot chicken broth from the chicken, it thickened up perfectly and tasted great. I don't know if the instructions are unclear, but if you try this don't be surprised if the water and flour do not get thick at all until you mix it with the hot chicken broth."

It is an easy way to make a gravy, but I would recommend using corn starch instead of flour, to avoid that taste. All in all, I think I will keep searching for a different gravy recipe."

I used about 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and it was still a little thicker than I like my gravy. Great flavor though and if you feel the gravy was too bland then it's because you didn't season your roast well. The gravy comes directly from your drippings!"

It seemed like too much flour, too much water, not enough seasoning, and I didn't understand the directions. I put the chicken drippings in a pot, mixed the water and flour in a separate container and then slowly added the flour mixture to the drippings over medium heat. I added garlic and onion powders, paprika, salt, pepper, hot sauce and a dash of soy sauce and it was still bland... so I added half a cube of beef bouillion and that made it better. I'll just have to play around with it some more until I get it right!"

It doesn't matter what seasonings you use on your chicken, as long as it's flavors that you love &amp; it is seasoned well. If you're just roasting a bland chicken, expect a bland gravy. Otherwise, you'll always get a perfect gravy by this method. I will usually boil the giblets separately while the chicken is roasting to make a stock to use for this gravy in place of the water. Use your instincts and add stock/water/flour as you need to get that perfect consistency for your gravy. I add a little sea salt &amp; ground white pepper and it's done. So easy! Thanks for the staple recipe! :)"

"reviewBody": "This recipe worked perfect for me. I made gravy on thanksgiving with a random recipe I found online, but it was way too thick after it refrigerated, which means you added too much flour. I eyeballed a half cup of flour and just turned the kitchen faucet on low, continued to drizzle water in small increments, stirring in between, until it got to the not-supposed-to-be pasty texture, and then added just a smidgen more water at a time until it was still thick but no longer pasty. It was the perfect mixture. Also, for the water-to-chicken drippings ratio... I find it works best if you start out with about 2/3 cup to 1 cup of drippings for the amount of flour/water you're adding. AND, make sure you get LOADS of the seasoned bits from the chicken in with your gravy...I used sage, nutmeg and almonds to season my chicken, and stuffed it with this thick creamy mushroom mix I made (package mushrooms, can cream of mushroom, carrots, chili powder, 3 garlic cloves, salt and pepper) so I got remnants of the stuffing in with the gravy mix and it was sooooooooooooooooooo gooood!!!!!"

From the drippings of two small roast chickens I added 1 cup of water. Note to reviewers - the roast chickens often go on sale at BJ'S for around 2 bucks a pop. I hadn't measured the drippings. I added about 1/4 cup of flour while whisking but it seemed really too thick. Had to add about 1/2 cup more of water to make it work. Had some red while, so added a coupla ounces of that too, lots of salt and pepper to taste. It made a nice rich gravy. Thanks for the basic instruction which is what many of us need! I am done with jarred gravy now that I can do this."
