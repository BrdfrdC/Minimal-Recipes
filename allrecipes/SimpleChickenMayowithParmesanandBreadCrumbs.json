The chicken wasn't bad, but did feel somewhat subpar to other breaded chicken recipes I have found in the past. I think it's rather bland but may be better for picky eaters or children."

Also, because my chicken was big I put them in about 5 mins longer but after about 20 mins I took them out and basically basted them with the oil from the pan- Lastly, right after taking them out, I topped them with a little bit of shredded parm (someone brought me it after the fact haha)."

In the past when I would brown the chicken first before baking, it made the chicken tough. This way without browning first makes it much more enjoyable to enjoy! Thank you for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe is full of flavor, but needs a few things to reach full potential. First, salt and pepper the chicken breasts, then sprinkle the breasts with herbs de provence (or whatever herbs you use) before brushing on the mayo. (If you sprinkle on the herbs after coating in panko, they get lost.) Add 1 tsp of dijon mustard and 1/4 tsp or so of garlic powder to the mayo/parm mixture. Finally, if making this for a few people, it's much better to cook it on the stove. Add a tbsp of olive oil to a nonstick skillet. Heat for a couple of min on medium. Add the breasts, cook for about 4 min depending on thickness, then turn and cook 4 min more until panko is nice and golden. Serve with lemon wedges. You will like it!"
