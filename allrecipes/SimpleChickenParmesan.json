I use store-bought sauce, but really like the way the chicken is pan-fried then broiled with cheeses - it keeps it the exact right combo of juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I use garlic herb bread crumbs, otherwise the bread crumb coating is a little bland. Thanks for a regular addition to our rotation!"

Using the rack twice contributed to a lot of clean up. I added the crushed garlic to both the sauce and the olive oil sauté of the chicken. Can’t have enough garlic! I used Marinara for the sauce and added the recommended spices. I believe baking the chicken instead of sautéing in a pan and broiling would produce a better result. That said, I tried it and learned a lot! Thank you."

About the only changes I made were that I added a pinch of red pepper flakes to the marinara sauce to give it a little heat, and I left out the sugar because I don't like extra sweetness in savory dishes, and the crushed tomatoes I used were sweet enough on their own. Since I'm a beginning/intermediate cook, I particularly liked the little hints such as putting the breaded chicken cutlets on a rack to help the bread crumbs stay put. \nIn any case my strictest critic (wife) said it was delicious, and that's all that matters :). I'll definitely make it again.\nI've posted a picture, which also includes a \"zoodle\" (zucchini noodle) warm salad that I got from another source."

"reviewBody": "Excellent recipe. Best I have tried for this dish. So often on AR the posted recipe is bare-bones and you have to read the reviews to get the technique. So I really appreciate the OP giving directions and timing. It's not complex. It's through. SO I followed the directions exactly- only change was seasoning the bread crumbs. It's really important to pound the chicken flat and let the breaded breasts rest on the rack for a few minutes. The breading actually stayed on during frying (for once) and cooked evenly. Don't mess w the chicken. Only turn it once. Line your baking sheet w foil. I placed the chicken directly from the frying pan into the clean rack- drained fine- then broiled as directed. Chicken came out juicy and nice and crispy- not at all soggy, which is my biggest complaint w chic parm. My whole family, including grandma and a picky 4 yr old, loved this. (Kids say it was \"delicious\"). My husband's only complaint was \"babe, you didn't make enough chicken!\" (LOL There IS a small amount of leftovers, but next time I will increase it so we get 2 full meals out of it. It was that good.) I served this w EZ Drop Biscuits from AR. Thanks for a \"keeper\"!!"

It's true, though, that kids never complain when chicken parm is served - which is a huge plus in our home."

I think I needed to use thinner chicken breasts because it took a while to cook it thru and the coating was starting to get too dark. Will try this again with pre-butchered thin breasts. I actually use the tomato sauce recipe just as-is over pasta. I think it's delicious and it's super easy to make!"

Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was fabulous. My kids devoured it and were wondering where the leftovers were the next day....I told them there weren't any because they ate it all. :). Great recipe and so simple!!!"

It was a little scary cooking the chicken with the oil spitting, however it all came out wonderfully. The sauce tasted amazing, as did the chicken. It has now been deemed a household favorite in my home :)"

I pounded the chicken and breaded it in egg and bread crumbs, then pan fried and transferred to a wire rack over a cookie sheet, topped each with cheese and baked at 350 for about 15 minutes (only because the broil setting on my oven sets off my smoke detector!) I used jarred sauce because it's what was on hand.\nI served it with spaghetti squash topped with the same store-bought sauce and more cheese.\nMy boyfriend raved, which is rare!"

I followed the instructions otherwise except for: (1) marinated the chicken first in buttermilk (2) After sauteeing step, I skipped the wire rack step and just put it in a greased baking dish in a 450 oven for 5 minutes and (3) my way to get the chicken thin enough was to slice it when it was still partly frozen - it was very easy to slice 1/2\" thick or less when still half frozen. I found that to be much easier than pounding it or than butterflying it when thawed."

The note says that it makes twice as much sauce as is needed, but I let it simmer while I did the chicken and it reduced and got thicker and was just enough. I doubled the oregano and basil and added a bit more sugar, as per our family's taste. Word to the wise: the breading on the chicken burns fairly easily at med-hi heat, so a medium heat would be better. I am already excited to make this again!"

This is going right onto the list! I cheated and used Creamy Vodka sauce (Its amazing, you gotta try it!). Everyone ate until they were stuffed. Next time i'll be using a new brand of bread crumbs... I didn't like them so much. Thanks for the AMAZING recipe :)!"
