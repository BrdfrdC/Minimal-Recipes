"reviewBody": "I've done this , essentially , several times , and it's always been very good ..\n(HINT: when you buy your bird, be sure to buy an extra package of turkey thighs/legs!... to make the gravey !!! .. You'll not have any 'pan drippings' with this deep-fry technique, so you'll need to 'pan fry in stove's oven' those thawed legs/thighs to prepare your grandmom's favorite gravey recipe !\nNow : Back to the bird :\n\nI want to strongly STRESS that there must be NO ICE , NO FROZEN area/region in the bird whatSO EVER ... Forgetting that can actually result in an EXPLOSION when bird is lowered inth the very hot oil ! EVEN IF THE FLAME IS OUT! So, do follow the advice here, made more emphatic by this lil note of mine!! \"There's nothing like knowing the consequences of a dangerous act quite like KNOWing what the consequences might be! 1) NO ice/frozen part of bird , 2) DO IT OUTDOORS , and especially 3) NEVER ON YOUR PORCH OR DECK!. 4) MAKE SURE the level of oil needed is known, and that there's aat LEAST 5 inches between the top of the oil level and the top of the pot ! .. the oil WILL RISE as bird is lowered into it ... 5) SHUT OFF THE FLAME of a flame-fed system whenever inserting the bird OR removing it! ... lest oil dripping over the edge of the pot IGNITE ... ( Did we say 'Fire Extinguisher rated for Oil fires ??? oh yeah, we did!! )\n\nThis is serious business, so pay attention!\n\nAlternative: use one of the newer ' Electric Turkey Deep Fryers' !! 'ButterBall make"
