Perhaps there was too much water from the shrimp that made its way into the sauce, but it didn’t have a lot of flavor and the sauce never thickened as it said. It’s also way too much time to cook shrimp so I took the shrimp out when it was getting overdone, about midway through. The ingredients sounded promising, but it didn’t make any sense at the end."

"reviewBody": "I think this was fine but originally had less sauce and flavor than my family likes. I started out by using 1T olive oil and 1T quality lemon flavored olive oil and extra butter. I definitely used the caper juice -- great idea. I used unconcentrated organic lemon juice (2T to start). I didn't have fresh parsley but had fresh dried so I crumbled and threw that in.\n\n My shrimp started to cook too quickly so I removed the shrimp from the pan and took advantage of making more sauce since I had some leftover angel hair.\n\nI eyeballed, and added to taste, more of all the ingredients...lemon olive oil, a good size pat of butter, more minced garlic, pepper flakes and parsley...then once the garlic was soft, a little more lemon juice, caper juice...some Himalayan sea salt. I had some leftover Chardonnay (wonderful La Crema from Monterey, CA), added probably a 1/4-1/3 c. (hard to tell how much was left), and cooked on low heat until the alcohol evaporated. Dish changing. I added the shrimp and tossed so as to not overcook it even more.\n\nIt was a hit with my picky husband. My adult son, too. Wish I had more angel hair leftover as they really liked the extra sauce. \n\nAn aside...I would've liked to have added a few capers but I was afraid the picky husband wouldn't eat it.\n\nThe photo shows all that was left. It made a good amount of large shrimp."

I used a little oil/juice from my jarred stuffed jalapeños in lieu of caper juice. I laid the shrimp upon a flavorful (but not overpowering) toasted sourdough bread. My wife and I were in indoor dining heaven!"

That's too long, so following the recipe to a tee would turn your precious shrimp into spongy hockey pucks. Add the shrimp later in the cooking process, three minutes is enough."

One suggestion as others have mentioned...maybe remove the shrimp after first minute and add back in after sauce is mixed...very easy to overcook the shrimp. My 16 count/# were borderline overcooked.

To make it a little more substantial, remove shrimp, deglaze the pan with a little white wine, add 1/2 cup of cream and 1/2 cup of parmesean cheese and return shrimp and mix in some capers to pan. Either way, you can't go wrong with this one."

I have never peeled and deveined them before, but quickly learned to do them, and in about half an hour I had a pot of peeled shrimp ready to cook. Like many others, I had no caper juice, but used green olive brine and all the rest of the ingredients. \n\nWe love garlic, but my hubby gets heartburn from too much, so I added about 1/4 cup of cream to the resultant sauce, and this was just soooo good. He couldn't quit eating it. I served it over pasta, and while I may never find a bargain like this again, I will make this again, without a doubt. I think it would be equally good with either fish or chicken. Thanks, Chef John. You are always reliable."
