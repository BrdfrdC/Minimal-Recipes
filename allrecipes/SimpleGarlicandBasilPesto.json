,"description": "This recipe is something that you can make quickly and easily using a blender. Everything you need is easy to find in your local supermarket. This paste is great for putting on or in meat and pastas, or with cottage cheese in stuffed pasta shells. Once I start making this, the orders from friends and family keep coming in. For best taste, pesto should be heated up in the meal it&#39;s being prepared with."

I use macadamia nuts instead of brazil, because I can never find them. (Accidentally bought salted nuts once- and just rinsed them good. It was fine.) I toast the nuts to bring on the flavor. And, I use a little less garlic (1T-1.5T), and I increase the cheese to a full cup...just because, who doesn't love more cheese? My boys wait to lick the bowl like it was chocolate cake batter."

The only nuts that I had was toasted sliced almonds, and the nutty flavor was still good. I forgot the heat, but I will probably add it next time for an unexpected flavor. Also, I don't' have a food processor, so I used my blender. Clearly it isn't the preferred tool, but it worked with a bit of persistence. I only added oil a bit at a time. I do not think that I used nearly as much as the recipe suggested. My family asked me to make it again, and I plan to do so soon and freeze a portion of it."

Secondly, instead of 12 servings,I would have preferred amount in cups. I started with 5 medium cloves of garlic and threw into the processor with the blade running. Stopped processor and put in 3 cups of basil leaves, good handful of walnuts, the cheese, a good shake of red pepper flakes instead of chili powder, salt &amp; pepper to taste. Started processor and poured in 1/2 cup of evoo, which seemed to be enough. Since I was using this as a side dish, I cooked a 1/2 lb. of rotelli pasta, tossed with the pesto and only had enough leftover pesto to fill 3 ice cubes in an ice cube tray. That all said it was delicious and will be making again."

I tried Tia Basil the first time and it is not as strong so the other flavors were prominent. I also reduced the virgin olive oil by 2 Tbsp and used Walnut oil and substituted the nuts for Walnuts. I used what I had. Next time I will try sticking to the recipe. It still turned out good. I am going to let it sit for several days and if still too strong will add more basil possible some spinach leaves to cut the garlic."

"reviewBody": "This was phenomenal! I left out the Brazil nuts and just used about 3/4 c pine nuts, which I toasted on the stove. I also added just a pinch of salt, about 1/8 tsp. I tried to follow some users' suggestions to leave out the chili powder, but it was much too bland without. It adds just the right amount of zing without being too spicy (even my 4-year-old liked it). A dash of lemon juice might be a good idea for color preservation because the bright green did darken quite a lot very quickly, but that's just for aesthetic value. It took all my willpower to keep myself from eating it straight out of the blender with a spoon. I am going to make several more batches for canning and give them as Christmas presents to my family. It is so delicious!"

I also used minced garlic from a jar (was in a hurry), and the result seemed a bit bland. Next time, I plan to use fresh garlic, salt, pepper, a little less oil, and a little less Parm cheese. I might also experiment with a few drops of lemon juice. I will definitely make this again. It worked well in the Pesto Chicken Penne Casserole recipe from this site."

"reviewBody": "Very easy and basic. The hint of heat os something I always enjoy and put in many foods that yould not expect it. Not HOT just a \"What is that?\" feeling. \n\nWalnuts work fine although we prefer the toasted pine nuts alone. The restaurant I work at makes and freezes a year's worth at a time with the cheese with no problems at all. If you use the oil right the color is preserved perfectly, if you want the added security put lemon juice in it. A food processor is much better than a blender and hand mincing is best if you have the knife skills. Finally, there is a Pampered Chef recipe that uses chicken stock instead of oil which is amazing in small batches and still really good if used 1/2 &amp; 1/2 in the smaller batches. \n\nGreat Foundation recipe!!!"

It was as good as any pesto I've had at restaurants. Next time I'll toast the nuts before I add them.\n\nFour stars is only because I couldn't get the basil to \"paste\" in my blender. I ended up adding everything just to get it to blend. It could just be my blender. I'll try adding the basil in slowly next time."

As it stands, the recipe is maybe a three-star, but with a tiny bit of modification, it becomes much better. I add LOTS more garlic, some seasoned salt, and more parmesan. It's a good starting point, then play around with it until you're satisfied. I have found this freezes well in ice cube trays for future use. I have also poured a thin layer of olive oil over the top and frozen in a plastic container with good results, but I don't typically need a large amount all at once."

I did not use the chili powder as my kids can smell and taste that from a mile away, I find that using 2 TBSP of the fresh garlic gives it enough zing. Toast the pine nuts and have omitted the other nuts. I have frozen it in the ice-tray and then moved to a freezer zip-lock bag. I served it with grilled chicken strips on top of fresh pasta and my guests and family could not stop slurping it! \r\nWhen you sautee the chicken strips or just after you removed the pasta from the boiling water, add 3 cubes of the pesto and it will melt within minutes."

Grrrrr.\nOk...now it's a day later and I made this. It made 11 oz for me. So the serving size is 1 oz per person. Recipes ALWAYS need to have the yield; the number of servings alone is meaningless.\nThe taste is ok; next time I'll cut back a bit on the oil, which I find a little overpowering. Or, cut to the chase and buy jarred, which I'm guessing can be even better. Maybe this needs more cheese?"

"reviewBody": "Great! I added salt and pepper and more garlic. I only needed 3/4 cup of the olive oil, as I usually add chopped sundried tomatoes (packed in oil) to my pesto dishes.\n\nEditting to add that the second time I made this, I subbed 1 Cup of lemon balm (got it in my CSA box) for 1 cup of the basil. Nice variation. I also only used 1/2 cup oil and it was plenty. Love this recipe!\n\nEditting again.... used 1 cup of fresh chives the last time I made it. I also used walnuts in place of the pine nuts because Costco was out of them Worked nicely! Also added the juice of one lemon and was able to cut back on the oil a bit more while still keeping the right consistency. This recipe is so versatile!"

Added them in at the very end (do not blend these in the machine ... found out the hard way that if you do it taste like grass). Left out brazil nuts (didn't have any) and will add cheese when I serve this since I'll be freezing the batch I made.

The pesto leftovers I placed in an ice cube tray to freeze and will put in a ziplock bag later to store for later use. I think next time I will also toast the pine nuts first (roll around in a very hot pan until lightly brown) and then put in with the pesto to blend. I am so glad I found this recipe!"

My mother is on a low carb diet and she can eat this and enjoys the flavor. As others said, I make extra and freeze it for later. I didn't have much luck with the freezing in the ice cube trays, so instead I put in the smaller portion sized tupperware and it worked out just great. It's great with the chicken, great on just plain noodles, anything your imagination can think of. Really great recipe."

I used red pepper flake for the heat instead, and toasted the pine nuts over medium-low heat until they started to brown and they gave off a nutty aroma. Be sure to use a high quality olive oil (I use Axienda Olearia del Chianti) and real Parmigiano Reggiano (I used Montanari &amp; Gruzza). If I could get raw Brazilian nuts, I'd be willing to try it, but they just aren't in high demand in Italy."

I tossed some elbow macaroni noodles in the pesto, added some quartered cherry tomatoes and feta (my favorite pasta dish) and froze the rest for later. Thanks for sharing!\nUPDATE: will definitely cut back on the oil, as the pesto did not freeze all the way when i put it in the ice cube trays as one reviewer recommended"
