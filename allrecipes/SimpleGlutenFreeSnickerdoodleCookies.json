"reviewBody": "As other reviewers mentioned, this recipe doesn't call for cream of tartar which is the signature ingredient of true snickerdoodles. That aside, my family found the cookies to be bland in flavor. \n\nI also found the recipe and instructions very lacking, i.e. what size egg is missing, whether or not to use xanthan gum (I did or the cookies would've spread if it's not in your particular gluten-free flour blend), and it's also missing the technique of first chilling the dough balls before baking which also prevents severe spread during baking. The amount of leavening is also more than necessary for a cookie recipe with such a small amount of flour. \n\nBe aware this would only make 24 cookies if you shape tiny dough balls. As stated with 1.5\" balls of dough you get about a dozen. I'd also recommend baking for much less time, especially with smaller cookies. 12-15 minutes is way too long for smaller cookies and will result in rocks once they cool."
