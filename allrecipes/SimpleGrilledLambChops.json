I left it in a baggy in the fridge for like 3 or 4 hrs and followed the instructions and perfect. I kept the juices and whatever didn’t stay on the chops when grilled and cooked it in a pan then later poured it on the chops. No other changes. Thank you so much!!!!"

I let my large lamb chop marinate for 2 hours in the refrigerator. Then I grilled it on my tabletop grill for 8 minutes on each side. ( I like well done meat). Following other reviews, I sautéed onions and mushrooms in a small pan and then added them to the lamb while it was grilling. Absolutely delicious!!! Such an easy and tasty recipe."

I found that lining a large casserole dish with foil and letting the lamb chops sit a few minutes let the juices REALLY soak in. They were almost better later. Served with baby carrots and white potatoes, sprayed with olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt, pepper, onion powder, and paprika, wrapped in foil and grilled for 30 minutes. Also..grilled romaine sprayed with olive oil, sprinkled sea salt, black pepper, rosemary, oregano, and garlic powder."

I was surprised at first that there was no rosemary, no lemon, or other ingredients one is used to associating with lamb, but there was nothing lacking in the flavor of the meat grilled this way.\n\nAs noted in some of the comments, a shorter marinating time (90 minutes in my case) was fine, and there's a good case for erring on the generous side with the onions. (I lost too many through the grill grates. Next time I'll use a griddle to keep them from falling through.)\n\nGrilled over lump charcoal on the BGE, on the medium rare side, they were just delicious! Thanks again."

"reviewBody": "Oops! Got cut off in the middle of my review! I made these with mini potatoes, and cooked everything in the oven at 400 degrees. Removed the chops after 20 minutes and potatoes and onions after 30. I took the marinade and strained it into a small pot, and added about 2 tablespoons of honey. While everything was cooking I reduced it down to a light sauce for the chops. Definitely a winning recipe that is easy to change for personal tastes. I will definitely be making these again!"

Came across this recipe and was not expecting it to taste that good because of the white vinegar in the recipe. Boy, was I wrong! Took a short time grilling and even a shorter time on my hubbies plate. He loves it so much that he wants to go to Costco this weekend to get more lamb chops!"

The lamb chops were thick, so they took longer than 5 minutes per side. I reduced the marinade on the stove top and sautéed mushrooms along with the onions from the marinade. Served the mushrooms over the lamb along with brown rice and broiled vegetables. A great meal. Will definitely use this recipe for lamb chops again. Highly recommend!"
