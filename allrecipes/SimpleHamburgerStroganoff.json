Halved the cream cheese and used a generous dollop of sour cream. Sautéed 1/2 an onion and 1 tsp minced garlic once the meat was mostly cooked. The tiny onion bits still had a little crunch. Added super delicious texture and taste. Didn’t have any mushrooms on hand and only 12 oz bag of noodles. Turned out great. Picky teenager even loved it."

I sautéed onion and garlic with the hamburger, cut the amount of cream cheese to 4 oz, used 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 soup can of milk and then a rather large dollop of sour cream and just added more to taste. Sprinkled liberally with s&amp;p. The flavor was much richer without the extra cream cheese and soup. The flavor of the gravy mix comes through and it’s not as thick. Excellent quick recipe!"

Only change I made and it was by necessity not by choice was that I used one can cream of mushroom and one can golden mushroom. Because I didnt read far enough ahead, I cooked the noodles and sauce separately, plated noodles and spooned as much or little sauce on top. My husband and Mother in law could not stop raving about this meal. Both my children (P.I.my.A eaters) loved it.tgis will forever be our \"go to.\" Thank you!!"

Like other reviewers, one can back off the cream cheese by half, use one container cream of mushie soup and add sour cream to your taste by dropping into mixture in dollops. I could even go as far as saying the cream cheese isn’t necessary but it may add a thickness that flour, or, better yet, arrowroot powder would accomplish without all that heaviness. It’s a great baseline if you just back it off a little."

I used farfalle noodles instead of egg noodles and added garlic salt to taste. The only thing I I’ll do differently next time is cook the mushrooms separately in the hamburger pan. They were a little under done because I didn’t want to overcook the hamburger. Quick and easy last minute dinner...tastes delicious too!!"

I had just under a lb of ground beef and I found in my freezer about a 1/2 lb of mild Italian sausage so I defrosted that and added to the ground beef. Drained that. Added a small yellow onion, chopped and 2 cloves of minced garlic. Added some Worcestershire, maybe 2 tbsps. Salt &amp; ground pepper. Let that simmer for about 10 min. Then added one can of beef broth and one can of cream of mushroom soup. Then a small can of drained mushroom pieces. (should've added anther can). Let that cook for about 15-20 min. Just before serving, I added about 1/2 sour cream and blended it into the meat mixture. Poured over wide egg noodles."

I had to estimate the brown gravy mix, as we have a huge jar of that powder, so I just made two cups of that gravy pretty rich (since I doubled the recipe). \n\nJust needs a bit of salt, but left that people to add to their own portions. We served it with mixed veggies on the side, cinnamon apple sauce and some dinner rolls. Will make this again, surely!"
