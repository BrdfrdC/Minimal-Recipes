I also added a little more cheese than the recipe called for, and I used half-and-half instead of milk. I topped it with panko breadcrumbs before putting it into the oven. Next time, I may mix in some crumbled crispy bacon. Much much better than boxed mac and cheese. My husband fell in love with me all over again."

I do add much more salt and seasoning. It’s really a great base to add whatever you like to it."

I ended up adding some pasta water I to try and thicken it more but even after adding my noodles, it is almost soup. Definitely add in some seasonings and veg or ham or whatever. This is a very basic cheese sauce, with not a whole lot of flavor. Good for getting the idea of how to make a cheese sauce."

Other than salt and pepper, I add a pinch of garlic powder, nutmeg, cayenne, and paprika to mine (along with some red pepper flakes because I like spice). I also like to add microwaved broccoli to this to pretend I’m healthy. My personal choice of cheeses are hand shredded cheddar and Gruyère (2:1 ratio), but you can serious do this with anything including just whatever bagged Mexican blend cheese you have sitting around in the fridge. Preshredded cheese doesn’t melt quite as well but taste wise there’s not a massive difference."

I liked the ease of the recipe and will try it again but will look at some of the other recipes to see what spices are added, plus I will either go all Cheddar or another stronger flavored cheese."

It's an excellent basic mac and cheese recipe that is almost a hundred years old, as it is featured in an old cook book I have from the 1920s. This is probably why it may seem bit bland to some modern day taste buds. Heavily spiced and flavoured foods weren't quite so common a hundred years ago. It's pretty kid friendly as is, though. We usually bake it, but I've done stove top as well."

Absolutely delicious and creamy, it will now be my new go to white cheddar mac and cheese dish. The picture is my mac and cheese on top of the stove as a side dish to go with other side dishes. If I was going to use it as more of a main dish I would put it in the oven with some other toppings. Toppings being bread crumbs or Ritz cracker crumbs with butter."

"reviewBody": "This is my favorite base recipe for mac and cheese. I find it too much cheese sauce for the amount of noodles and use about 60% of the recommended sauce per noodles. I make it based on how much milk I am trying to get rid of, and use any cheeses I have. A touch of blue cheese is really good. Garlic salt as well. I usually make this after my son heads back to his mothers, I don't drink milk, and he has always hated mac and cheese. So great solo meal for me. The left overs I heat in the oven with bread crumbs on top."

Next time I think I'll try more cheese (because I want more of a cheesy flavor) and less butter (because this calls for a ridiculous amount)."

For milk I used mostly plain almond milk and a bit of half and half to make it richer. SO EASY and so good. The cheese sauce seemed really stretchy and gooey at first but it all came together and mixed perfectly with some leftover plain bow tie noodles I had. This is a game changer. I have 4 kids and work full time and this took as long to pull together as a box of mac n cheese."
