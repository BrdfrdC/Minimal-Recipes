I used the Olive Garden dressing and it was just enough for the salad. I thought 160z that was mentioned to use, was little too much. I used a red onion chopped rather than green onions. It gave it a good flavor to add to the salad. Next time I will add black olives or maybe green bell pepper would also be a good addition to the salad. This was an easy, simple and delicious pasta salad to make for any celebration!! Will definitely be making this again!!"

Oddly enough we where out of Italian seasoning so we made do with oregano, and as you can tell in the picture we add broccoli. I read in one the the reviews about a displeasing with this recipe because of the choice of dressing they chose; I'm not sure how their choice reflects of overall performance of this recipe, buuuuuut we used Tuscan Garden Zesty Italian (from Aldi) and I am satisfied with that option. Which I may add also has NO high fructose corn syrup."

I used Wish Bone Italian Robusto salad dressing because it has so much flavor. I bought extra Italian dressing to add later. The pasta always absorbs some of the dressing and I didn’t want the salad to dry out too much, Again to your liking as to how moist you prefer the salad."

It definitely makes a lot of pasta salad, more than enough for everyone at the barbecue!"

My salad dressing was flavorful on its own, so I omitted the Italian seasonings too. Also, this recipe does not need so much salad dressing! Unless you want pasta salad soup, cut back on the dressing. \nThe bottom line is: Feel free to change this recipe a lot. It still turned out super yummy for me! \nBE WARNED: this recipe makes a LOT of salad!! Be prepared with a huge bowl."

"reviewBody": "Definitely the keys to this pasta salad are a good dressing and high quality shredded parm cheese. The italian seaoning added to the cheese adds GREAT flavor. I used Good Seasons Italian dressing made with apple cidar vinegar and olive oil. I added spinach (green),4 plum tomatoes (red) and orange and yellow mini sweet peppers, with some red onion. What a beautiful presentation. Any veggies you want or have with the shredded parm, italian seaoning and a good dressing! Easy! Can't be beat!"

My changes are that we typically use farfalle (or bow tie pasta) instead of rotini, and instead of parmesan and italian seasoning, we use Salad Supreme seasoning. On occasion, to make it heartier, we add pepperoni to it."

"reviewBody": "Pretty good! While I prefer my Pampered Chef Italian pasta salad recipe, this wasn't half bad considering it was made from bottled Italian dressing. My recipe calls for a homemade vinaigrette and a generous bounty of fresh veggies (i.e. broccoli, zucchini, cherry tomatoes, etc.) and that sets it above any pasta salad made from convenience items, IMHO. Having said this, I think I would have enjoyed this a bit more if it were made with different veggies. I think a mix of bell peppers and red onion would have been more to my liking. The tomatoes kinda broke down after sitting in the fridge overnight and the cucumber, although tasty, overwhelmed everything else. All in all this was decent, but I'll need to make a few changes in order to better suit my tastes. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Katzen! :)"

I didn't have any green onions but since I don't care for raw onions I wouldn't have added any anyway. I only had 2 roma tomatoes and that wasn't enough. The recipe calls for 6 and and that would have been a lot better. I used a greek vinagrette instead of Italian and liked that a lot since it had feta cheese in it. I don't like it when recipes say to use cheese by the ounce. I used at least a cup. When it came time to serve I added more dressing and parmesan. I would recommend this recipe. It was delicious and easy."

"reviewBody": "A simple, yummy pasta salad. I have made this for a bunch of different events and always have people asking for the recipe. I like to use halved cherry tomatoes, for their sweetness, as well as a really good shaved parmesan (and lots of it!). You can experiment with different Italian dressings to find a flavor that suits you; I usually just go with whatever is on sale (!), but I'm not picky, and I don't think you could go wrong. Presuming you make this ahead of time, I would suggest reserving some dressing to mix in just before serving -- or even adding extra, as I have -- as the pasta will soak up a lot of it. I also add more parmesan when I give it a final toss, for added texture. This recipe is kind o a no-brainer, as it's just so easy and good. It's a staple in my repertoire!"
