Used homemade pesto from this site and stuck with the rest of the recipe and it came out perfectly. If I had to change anything, will definitely save the pasta water to help it be less dry (but I like it like that personally) this can pair with grilled Parmesan chicken and salad really well!!"

"reviewBody": "This \"simple pesto pasta\" can be made even more simple. First, since there is already garlic in the pesto I saw no need to add more, let alone 3 T. for a half pound of pasta! Second, I saved myself a pan to wash by just tossing the pasta with the pesto (I used homemade) and butter. Simple. This mix of pasta and pesto is a delicious, traditional classic - by all means add the pesto \"to taste\" and remember that less is more. (P.S. Be sure to reserve some of your pasta cooking water to add to your finished pasta if it becomes dry as it stands. If it stands long enough to do that :)"
