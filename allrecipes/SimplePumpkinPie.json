I added some vanilla and cinnamon to the pumpkin spice. You don't even have to have whip cream with this pie. The ready bake pie crust that you buy is the best way to why bother making it yourself. The reason I decided to make the pie I bought a few cans of pumpkin puree for my pup and ended up not using it. So easy to make why bother with store bought pie..you won't be disappointed."

Because I'm low on time and energy, I used a refrigerated pie crust. We mixed the pie filling in my Kitchen Aid mixer, it was less than five minutes to make it. We followed the recipe exact. This pie was done baking at five minutes before the fourty minutes was up. Gorgeous pie, VERY VERY good. This recipe's a keeper. NOTE: For those of you who want a pie that tastes like pumpkin that's lightly sweetened, this one is for you."
