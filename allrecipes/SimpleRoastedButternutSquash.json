Overall I would make this again, but I do need to invest in a larger peeler and an good attitude. :-)"

"reviewBody": "I hate any and all squash - have not eaten any for at least 40 years... Due to Covid boredom I decided to go out on a limb and try this roasted butternut squash recipe, which I followed to a \"t\". It was actually good, not great but good enough that I am discarding my squash prejudice. Try it, you'll like it."

We like both savory and sweet preparations of butternut, and this time we did sweet -- melted 2 TBS bacon fat, tossed the squash in it, crushed 2 tsp coriander seeds and tossed again with pink salt to taste, placed on baking sheet, sprinkled 1/4 c brown sugar on top, and waited. Melt in your mouth with a kind of toffee quality from the sugar, and the coriander really made it stand out for us."

Definitely will make again and again!"

Even though cutting it takes time, it is still easy to do. \n\nBecause I was making turkey tenderloins in the oven, too, these cooked instead for an hour at 325. Toward the end of that hour, I raised the temp to 400 both times finish the turkey and the squash, but the squash got an extra 5 to 10 minutes at that temp.\n\nMy whole family liked the squash, except for my youngest. (In the future I will need to hold some squash back to prepare like sweet potatoes for her.)"
