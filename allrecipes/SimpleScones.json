I've done blueberry and my favorite is fresh raspberry. I use raspberries from the store--they are more firm than home grown--and pull them apart into smaller pieces. Of course with fresh fruit, the scones must be refrigerated if not eaten relatively soon. Very good, very simple recipe with excellent results."

I divide the dough into 2 discs and cut each into 8 scones, so i end up with 16 not so large scones, which is perfect! I do i like to sprinkle white sugar liberally over the top before baking to get a nice sweet crunch on the top. I sometimes do a raisin, orange zest and walnut mix for variation. I've even used hot cross bun spices with raisins/currants and candied orange peel and they are sublime! thanks a million for this amazing recipe. i will forever cherish it!! ***update june/2022 I made a dried cranberry and white chocolate chip version . I cut out tiny rounds with my biscuit cutter( I got 23), brushed with some buttermilk mixture, sprinkled with sugar and baked for 12 minutes at 350. they were incredible. This is the recipe that keeps on giving!"

Also, to prep the wet separately &amp; then add to the dry mix with a fork. The add-ins are nearly endless. I can see how these can be either sweet or savory. This is a keeper recipe.👌"

Every morning grab a ball and fold in the customized ingredients to each individual liking and bake at 350 for 18 minutes. My favorite customization is white choclate and blueberries, my son likes blueberries and milk chocolate."

You can use almost any dried fruits, add in nuts or seeds, swap in non-dairy fats and liquids. My favorite variation is dried pineapple with pecans and coconut, and if you want to amp up the coconut flavor you can use very cold coconut oil in place of butter."

"reviewBody": "These were delicious! Soft and flaky and not at all dry. I had to make a couple changes due to what was on hand. I only had refrigerated butter so instead of blending with my fingers I used a pastry blender. It worked well and still grated easily and achieved a good crumbly texture. I had no sour cream so instead I used vanilla Greek yogurt and reduced the sugar in the recipe to 1/4c to adjust for the sweetness. I then added a tsp of vanilla extract to the eggs and yogurt to go “all in” on the flavour. I didn’t add raisins, though they would have worked well. It would also work with dried cranberries, cherries or apricots. Plain was great though and I’ll definitely make these again."

BUT I can tell it’s a really good recipe because I have made some really bad recipes. I put chocolate chips in mine. Next time it will be blueberries or cinnamon chips. They were still good. I have eaten scones all over the world and these aren’t bad. Btw it’s not scone with a long o; it’s actually pronounced scon. Just weird info."

I will definitely be making these again and again as my go-to scone recipe. 10 stars!"

I still got 8 good size scones as they rose beautifully. I made the faux clotted cream and used blueberry fruit spread and had Chai Vanilla Latte Tea. It was delicious and I didn't MESS it up! I will be making these again this weekend trying one of the many variations. I also think I may use salted butter as well as use egg yolk to brush on prior to baking vs. using heavy cream to see if I get a better shine."

If you want a scone that's good on its own but also goes well with just about any topping try adding alot of cinnamon, about half that amount of ground cloves, and then add a splash of maple syrup to the wet ingredients. Your kitchen will smell devine."

My favorite so far is a dried cranberry, white chocolate chip, pecan version but you could make anything in this recipe and it would be wonderful. I used buttermilk instead of sour cream or yogurt because that’s what I’ve had generously on hand. Buttermilk does wonderful things to the baking soda but I imagine it’s similar to sour cream or yogurt. And the grated butter is a must. I’ve made 4 versions and only the last was completed in the food processor. That spoiled me as they were in the oven within 15 minutes! Imagine that! 30 minutes from nothing to melt in your mouth hot scone with melting white chocolate chips oozing around plump tart dried cranberry! Nirvana!"
