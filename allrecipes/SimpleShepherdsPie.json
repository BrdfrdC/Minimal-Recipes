I added fresh thyme, kosher salt, garlic, worchestshire sauce and mixed the pork 50/50 med ground beef. Much better. Or even better than that, ditch the mushroom soup and use lamb and make a proper shepherds pie. Just saying."

After draining fat added some Lea and Perón, mustard, salt and pepper. This added a little zip. Also used left over warned mashed potatoes and sprinkled some kraft Parmesan cheese on top. Quick and simple"

In addition to the peas and carrots, I also added some Lima beans to the mix and instead of ketchup I used 2 tablespoons of sofrito and just a splash of beef broth. I also used ready- made mashed potatoes to save a few minutes of prep time. Amazing flavor!"

It's possible I messed up the potatoes because they were a major problem simply because they didn't spread very well over the top of the meat mixture.

Add 4 T. basil pesto. Brown @ 1 min. Add 1/3 c. flour and brown for @5 min. Add 1 c milk, &amp; stir continuously until it is incorporated. Repeat with 2 more cups of milk, one cup at a time. THEN add the veggies and meat (I used chicken in this case), cook a bit, and top with the mashed potatoes. Transfer the skillet of yumminess to the preheated 400 degree oven and bake 20 minutes.

I substituted peas and carrots with a bag of frozen green beans mixed in after everything else was mixed. After putting it in 2 qt casserole dish I sprinkled a cup of cheddar cheese on top and then spread the garlic mashed potatoes on top of that."
