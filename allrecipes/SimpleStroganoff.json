"reviewBody": "This is a budget freindly recipe for sure, but not very tasty. I did it a tad differently with my cooking method, so I didnt have to use more pans (Im lazy) I sauteed the mushrooms in 2TBS of butter, removed from pan then sauteed the meat with some dice onions and garlic, just for more flavor. I had to look up greek seasonings, as it isnt something I've ever had on hand. While the meat was browning I started the egg noodles, since they cook quickly. The rest was the same. Pretty good, but I like mine better, lol. Sorry. Still cheap but a different method with less clean up."

At the end, it was a bit too runny, so I added some instant potato flakes to thicken it. So, I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but pretty darned close. Very tasty soup that I will make again!"

We also had some left over mushrooms sauteed in butter, which I combined with a couple of additional small cans of mushrooms. I used spaghetti, which was my last pasta choice, but is all I had in our pantry. I used everything else as called for, and sprinkled some Parmesan cheese on at the end, and this was a killer supper. Thanks for the incredible idea, Richard. It's a winner."

Also, I used italian seasoning instead of greek, it turned out to be very good, and had to add more salt, pepper, onion and garlic after the sour cream for the same reason mentioned above. Overall a good dish."

I added 1/2 a teaspoon more seasoning than the recipe called for as my family likes a lot of spice. I didn't have any brand name Greek seasoning blend so I used one I made from here: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/231228/greek-seasoning-blend/ \nIt turned out great too!!"

"reviewBody": "I've seen many recipes for \"ground beef\" stroganoff over the years, but this is the first time I've made one. The one thing that I didn't like was that the sour cream totally liquified once combined with the meat. The dish had zero eye appeal because of the watery texture. The Greek seasoning was a nice addition, but overall, this stroganoff was a disappointment. In all fairness, it could be that I wouldn't like any ground beef stroganoff, so moving forward, I'll stick with the real deal version. Sorry olderguy for the less than favorable review."
