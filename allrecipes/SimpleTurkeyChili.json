No cayenne pepper (guest can add additional spice to their taste). I used 1 can of stewed tomatoes. It was more watery than i like so I added a 1/3 cup of masa flour to thicken it.

There was enough juice from the tomatoes (boxed not canned) and the turkey added some.\n3) I don't know how you can add two tablespoons of chili powder and still have an edible dish. I used a half teaspoon together with the other spices as specified and it still comes out on the hot side. Either I have extra hot chili or I have a very low tolerance for heat."

The only thing that I would change is to maybe cut back a bit on the spices in it; it worked well for my Fiancee and I, especially with the addition of sour cream and cheddar cheese--but it did not sit too well with her seven year old, so I felt a bit bad. \nI would give this 5 stars for flavor and ease of cooking; but I am going with 4 because of how MUCH of a kick it had. Other people may need a heads up for this kind of thing."

I sautéed them all before adding the turkey to ensure they were truly softened. I added whole tomatoes which I then crushed myself (I prefer the method) and I added a can of tomato sauce along with the water for more flavor. I doubled the kidney beans to make it more hearty and I decreased the amount of chili powder. The amount of spice was perfect! This recipe is so great because it is so easily customizable.

"reviewBody": "Great base! Use these additions if you like a lot of flavor, spice (kick), and thicker chili. Don't bother scrolling through other reviews, cuz I stole everything worth mentioning. ; ) If I don't mention it, use what's in the original recipe. I don't lose anything, except the water, but I add a lot. 1 tbsp olive oil. 1 cup low sodium chicken broth. 1 can (10.5 - 16 oz) diced tomatoes (any) I like Rotel original and hot. 2 cans beans (any bean) For my double batch I use 1 chili bean (not drained &amp; rinsed ), 1 black bean (D &amp; R), and 2 red kidney beans (1 mashed &amp; 1 whole - both D &amp; R). 2 1/2 tbsp chili powder. 1 tsp dried oregano. 1 tsp cayenne. 1 tsp cummin. 3/4 tsp black pepper. 1 can of corn (D &amp; R). 1 4 oz can of green chillies. 2 jalapeños (diced). 1 green &amp; 1 red pepper (chopped). 1/4 tsp cinnamon. 1 tbsp brown sugar. 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Montreal seasoning to taste when browning turkey. Start by sautéing onion in half the oil. Cook til softened, then add peppers &amp; jalapeños. Cook til softened, and then remove. Add rest of oil and brown turkey. Once evenly browned, add back the onions &amp; peppers. Add garlic and cook for 2 min. Add all seasoning and cook for another 2 min, while constantly stirring. Dump in all remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil, then reduce to low and cover. Cook for 75 min, and stir once halfway through. Once done, stir again, and let sit. Gets better with age. Serve with sour cream and sharp cheddar. Hope this helps someone. Sorry for the layout..."

I also used smoked paprika instead of regular, and think it's an improvement. I used a chopped turkey breast instead of ground turkey and fried the onions in the fat from roasted breast, which seems nice. I also added frozen corn, as I love that in chilis, as well as some chopped red pepper I had in the freezer. Tastes very good right now, but probably even better tomorrow! I'll serve w/ grated cheese, sour cream and some corn bread. Yum!!!"
