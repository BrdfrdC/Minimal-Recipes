He is a very picky eater,(just like a kid, lol) It's good and I would probably make it again if he liked it. I would probably make less though since it is just the two of us. Unless you like leftovers, I would make less if only for two people. And I also agree that I would make more of the sauce for this as I really enjoyed it and would want more."

Also use Lipton beefy onion soup mix instead of plain onion. I do remove a couple steaks when they’re almost done to a separate baking dish and add sliced fresh mushrooms to the remaining steaks, as the rest of us love them."

"reviewBody": "This turned out great! I made a few small changes, however. I didn't have beef broth on hand so I instead dissolved a beef bouillon cube in 2 cups of hot water--this was pretty salty so I didn't add any salt to the recipe. I didn't have Italian flavored bread crumbs &amp; the bread crumbs I did have on hand was pretty flavorless so I added about 1/2 tsp garlic seasoning to it. I skipped the mustard entirely. Everything else I did the same but I made the patties extra thick &amp; fried them in a frying pan. Then I put the patties on a cookie sheet lined with foil &amp; mixed the soup &amp; 1/2 cup of the bouillon broth together &amp; poured it on top. In retrospect, it might have been better to put the patties in a casserole dish instead of a foil-lined cookie sheet as the soup mixture sort of baked itself into a caramelized state. In some ways, this made everything more flavorful but the soup mixture didn't stay liquid enough to act as gravy. All in all, however, it was a hit with my family."

I add a 1/2 a cup of oatmeal, 1/2 cup of bread crumbs with the ground beef. Sauteed a 1/2 and onion with a bit of broth till tender. I used one can or bottle of brown gravy whatever I had in the pantry added a bit of water and season accordingly (keep tasting while cooking) I can cooked everything on low heat on the stove for 15 minutes. I also used a touch of cornstarch slurry to thicken the gravy slightly at the end and it is a perfect dinner."

For some reason, mine turned out greasy tasting.... and I wiped the pan clean after browning the meat (85% lean) so it wasn’t from that. I wouldn’t normally use a cream soup for this dish but I will definitely use the meat recipe in the future and combine that with a gravy in the future."
