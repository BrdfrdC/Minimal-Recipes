My wife (Chinese) showed me how to find where the tender parts of the spear were and which was tougher. Simply bend the lower half of each spear. Above where the spear snaps cleanly is tender; below is the tougher part. No guesswork involved and no waste."

"reviewBody": "This was my first time steaming anything, and my first time cooking asparagus. This recipe was a great base, though I agree with other reviewers that adding the salt and butter to the steaming water is just a waste.\n\nI made this as a snack so I could try steaming asparagus. (:\nI knew I wanted more of a kick of flavor rather than just plain steamed asparagus, so I sautéed about a teaspoon or two of minced garlic (I love garlic so I pretty much just put a dollop of it in) and a pinch of salt in about 3-4 tablespoons of butter in a separate pan. ((Be careful to not brown the garlic however, as it gets bitter.))\nI drizzled this onto my steamed asparagus, but still wasn't satisfied with the amount of flavor, so I followed Josie's advice and put the juice of half of a lime on there. It was absolutely delicious! I will definitely make this again, though I might try sautéing the asparagus in the butter mixture after steaming, and maybe adding some more spices. (:"

So I used the bay leaf from that recipe in this recipe's water. I added a little olive oil. Steamed for 10 mintues. I had melted butter in a shallow baking dish ready with poultry season, salt, pepper, and Italian Herb Season Grinder mix flavoring the butter. When the asparagus was ready, I added it to the melted butter. Delis!"
