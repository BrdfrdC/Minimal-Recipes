I also added poppyseeds, it would be cool to know when to add add-ins if we want. Also whe to turn it out of the pan. I can never remember if I should cool it or not. Also ideas for icing recipes. Looks and smells delicious! Thanks!"

I am so glad I found this one!\nAfter reading some reviews, I made the following revisions:\n1 3/4 c white sugar, 1/2 cup brown for a less purely sweet taste.\nIn place of milk I used a light (not too thick) yogurt, which helped keep the cake nice and dense.\nI used a rectangular baking dish so I wouldnât flood my tiny oven. I had spare batter for 10 cup-poundcakes. \nChocolate chips on top for cuteness!"

It did leave a behive shape of cake on the baking sheet though...good for tester :)"

The only thing I changed 3 of the times was using lemon extract instead of vanilla. One of my older recipes used the lemon which everyone loved but was not as good as this recipe ! Never too old to make changes. The pan purchased was a tube pan described special for pound cakes."

"reviewBody": "This pound cake is golden brown mild glaze buttery goodness. I only added 2 teaspoons of baking powder and I used a 10 inch bundt cake pan. Also when I pour the batter in you have to take a flat small spatula and flatten the batter lightly in a circle so it bakes and rise evenly. I also left a 1/2 inch of space in the bundt pan when I poured the batter so the cake have room to rise and will not overflow. I topped mine with whip cream preferably lite whip cream because it's not sweet and strawberries."

I followed the recipe as is (with the exception of adding some lemon zest to the batter), and it baked up perfectly - no spill over whatsoever :) It took around 65 mins (give or take), which gave the top a nice crispy crust. At first, I thought it would be too sweet with the 2 1/2 cups of sugar, but it was just right. This is first pound cake recipe I've found that didn't include complicated directions or ingredients that I don't usually have on hand (ie. sour cream, buttermilk, yogurt), and I'll make it again and again. Thanks for posting the recipe :)"

As other people have mentioned, this makes a lot of batter. I ended up using the largest cake pan I have, which is big enough for a large birthday cake and the cake took one and a quarter hours to cook. I used lemon essence instead of vanilla and glazed it with runny lemon icing after piercing the cake a few times first. I've had many compliments. I will absolutely be making this again."

NOT what I intended. It tasted amazing, but it wasn't very pretty. Oh well. Next time I will just follow this recipe but still add the cinnamon."

"reviewBody": "Chose this recipe after discovering I have a bunch of eggs to use up. Ended up modifying it for my preference and based on other reviews. I cut the recipe in half and omitted the baking powder which gave me a single, dense loaf that turned out perfectly. I used 3/4 cup white granulated sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar which gave the crust a light crisp and great brown sugar flavor. I also used half a teaspoon vanilla extract and half teaspoon almond extract with a splash of maraschino cherry syrup for an amaretto flavor. I lowered the baking temperature to 325 as I was using a glass loaf pan and wanted to lower the chance of anything burning. It came out perfectly golden and delicious after 90 minutes. This is a great recipe to use as a base and was very easy for someone who had never made pound cake before."

Found this recipe and followed the recipe except for a couple changes. I divided the batter and added the pudding mix to half. Then I just poured regular batter in first followed by the strawberry pudding batter next. I swirled it in the bundt pan and baked it at 325Â° for 80 minutes(checking my batter at 60 minutes and continuing to bake in 10 minute intervals until done) The cake came out perfectly moist and dense. I might cut sugar down to 1 1/2 cups next time if using pudding mixes. But overall, very easy and tasty!"

I split the recipe in 1/2 and baked in a 9x6 loaf pan for 45min. My cake didnt overflow and rose to a perfect size, despite my beating air into it with my electric mixer(i think the air fluffed it up more). Instead of a sauce or frosting, i just sprinkled approx. 1 tbsp of sugar on top, which made a delicious crunchy topping. I also coated the pan with sprinkles of sugar after greasing it, which gives the cake a beautiful glaze. This is now my base recipe for a delicious &amp; easy pound cake. Thank you Diane!"

"reviewBody": "I give this recipe four stars, but only because I modified it. Taking the advice of another reviewer, I completely eliminated the baking powder, making it a much more \"true\" pound cake AND entirely eliminating the overflow problem. I also converted it to a lemon pound cake by substituting (1:1) fresh lemon juice for the vanilla, adding about three tablespoons of lemon zest, and reducing the sugar by 1/2 cup. Taking the suggestion of another reviewer, I sprinkled brown sugar and choppped pecans in the pan before filling it with batter. Baked (without pre-heating the oven) for seventy-five minutes (splitting the difference between the suggested bake times). The resulting cake is really good; it came out of my (silicone) bundt pan cleanly and easily, although I did notice a very slight underdone swirl through the lower register of the cake -- maybe I should have kept it in the oven a bit longer. Thanks, Diane, for a great foundation for a really very good cake!!"

It was definitely a lot lighter than most pound cakes and it actually took a couple of bites for me to register that signature 'pound cake' texture.

It turned out very well, with a nice (however mild) orange flavour. We had some friends over for tea and they loved the cake, having seconds and thirds. Everyone's favourite part was the golden crunchy crust. This cake is not going to become a kind of recipe I would make over and over, but I will make it again for Easter."

I halved the recipe though cause after reading the reviews it seems that you get 2 cakes from the full amount of batter. I got 1 perfect sized cake. The batter does rise quite a bit and the top seems to brown fast so I had to turn down the heat 3/4 way through cooking. It smelled wonderful in the oven, yum! The taste of the cake itself is not too sweet at all, in fact it's perfect and I was delighted by this because it leaves opportunity for many different types of toppings! I served up some slices with a dusting of confectioners' sugar and a generous drizzle of Sue's Hot Fudge Sauce (found on this site) and it was great! I think I'll add some whipped cream to the combination next time around. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!"
