I also plan on subbing beef and pork for the chicken. This is an extremely versatile recipe."

Because I had cut the chicken so thin, the chicken was done before the sauce could carmelize or thicken. So I added a little cornstarch mixed with cold water to thicken it. Will make again"

I actually used tri tip for the meat, only did 1 Tbsp minced garlic and 1/4 tsp cayenne (due to sensitivities in the household, playing it safe for the first go round - may up it slightly next time but still great with the measurements I used), and I added some shredded carrots and broccoli. Served over fried noodles, I used the recipe another reviewer provided. \n\nAmazing!! I will be making this again and again, in much larger batches."

I may have cut the strips too wide. It took about 12 minutes for the sauce to concentrate. Perhaps I did cook too long but it was unbelievably salty. Not sure if I will attempt it again with low sodium soy sauce or just bag it. The chicken ended up somewhat dry on top of the saltiness so, all in all, I was under-impressed with the recipe. I was somewhat flummoxed that so many had rated it with five stars."

I used kitchen shears to make sure the chicken was sliced thin as well."

The brown sugar is totally drowned out by the soy sauce and sesame oil as well. Maybe some added honey might work to better complement it all. I'd also add some minced ginger and chopped green onions for the finishing touch."

"reviewBody": "I stayed pretty true to the recipe except I used 2 1/2 lbs of chicken so I tripled the sauce (I like a lot of sauce). I also added extra onion, some sliced mushrooms, and broccoli slaw for some veggies. My skillet was so full I cooked it in a little chicken broth first with the lid on to get everything close to done then added the sauce toward the end. I had it so full I was afraid if I added the sauce at the beginning it would burn or cook away. Even with the few changes it was amazing and I think it would be good exactly as written if you didnâ€™t want to add the extras. This will be a regular for us."

I also think it's missing a little something, I'm going to try adding 2-3 tsp of minced ginger to add a little kick next time.\n\nI also used more onions than were listed. 1/2 of an onion, sliced, but think that 1/4 of an onion would probably work better for most people."

I use a variety of veggies including riced cauliflower, diced zucchini, onions and red peppers for instance added to 1/2 c of rice to fill out the dish. I use chicken tenders rather than an entire breast and that extends the meal as well. This is a definite favorite of all our family including picky eaters."

I doubled the sauce and let the chicken and veggies marinated for 10 minutes before cooking. Next time I will try to let it marinade for at least an hour and I think that would kick it up a notch. The dish is good but I feel like it was missing something I canâ€™t quite put my finger on. Oh and I did thicken the sauce with a cornstarch slurry because the zucchini watered it down some."
