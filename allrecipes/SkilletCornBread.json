I modified as follows: used buttermilk, 1 t of baking soda, 1 t of baking powder, 1 T of maple syrup, I jalapeño very thinly sliced, I cup of finely shredded cheese (I used a mix of Colby, sharp cheddar, and Monterey Jack from Organic Valley), and I browned the butter in the cast iron skillet, eliminating the oil. This resulted in a cornbread cake that was high, light, and moist. I might increase the maple syrup by 1 T next time, but otherwise, this was perfect. I tested at 18 minutes, by 21 minutes it was done."

There were no modifications made to the recipe however I did spread a stick of butter across the top with five minutes remaining to cook to give the cornbread a golden brown top. I also cut the cornbread into four large triangles and immediately removed it from the skillet. Someone else had recommended removing it right away to keep the corn bread from crumbling and drying out. I made this corn bread to eat with red beans and rice, so the recipe was perfect for that however if I were to make again For another dish I probably will add sugar to sweeten it a bit."

The top browned more than I was expecting, possibly due to sugar content, the positioning in my oven, or the additional butter. I'm not bothered by that, however. I just found it bland. \n\nEven if you prefer your cornbread to be savory rather than sweet, I would add about twice as much kosher salt, possibly more."

Only reason I gave this four stars is because it is not sweet like the recipe says. I’ll definitely make this again and be sure to add a bit more honey because I like my cornbread on the sweeter side. Otherwise, great recipe!"

I agree with many reviewers who state that A) southern cornbread should not be sweet but also B) cornbread with zero sugar in it can be bland. So I followed the advice on another review and added 2 Tablespoons of sugar. I also cooked it in bacon grease because I had some from another recipe I had just made. This went together like a dream and baked up beautifully. Thanks for a great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Perfect basic cornbread recipe that you can as a base recipe that is good as is, but if you like to \"doctor up\" recipes, this is the perfect base. \n\nIf you want sweet corn bread just add sugar -- up to 1/4 cup. If you want buttermilk cornbread use buttermilk and substitute 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda for the baking powder. Add creamed corn if you want creamy corn cornbread. \n\nThis is a GREAT base recipe to keep -- no need for 3 cornbread recipes. Just add want you want to this one.\n\nTips: You can melt the butter in the skillet, then pour it into the batter. No need for another pan. There'll be a little butter left in the pan, so you won't need the oil. Do NOT overmix. Mix all the dry ingredients together separately then use a large spoon or spatula to fold the wet and dry together."

It worked for the night to compliment my Chili but will look for a more flavorful recipe next time. \n\nWhat is nice about it, and why I made this version is that it has a very simple and common list of ingredients so I didn't need to run to the store. So from that perspective it's nice if you need it last minute. \n\nNext time though I will plan ahead and get a richer version made. \n\nThanks."

"reviewBody": "I chose this after searching for a low-sugar recipe, because my usual recipe is super-sweet and I wanted to add green onion and shredded cheddar. It was surprisingly moist! My kids found this to be bland and dry but they are used to what I find to be an overly sweet recipe. I did add two tablespoons of sugar and my daughter thought the batter tasted \"too floury,\" so I added two more tablespoons. I only added cheese and onion to half, and my son preferred the plain half. I also added a bit of cider vinegar to the milk out of habit (I never have buttermilk on hand). Don't be afraid to add the full 4 teaspoons of baking powder. I couldn't taste it (or maybe the vinegar neutralized any baking soda taste)."

"reviewBody": "Didn't have a cast iron skillet (sigh), but I preheated a heavy stainless skillet in the oven and got a pretty good crust anyway. I used white cornmeal since it was on hand. I'd never seen the soaking technique for the cornmeal (and I'm a Southerner from a huge family of great cooks). I think this made the result exceedingly moist and tender. This is one of the richest-tasting cornbreads to ever cross my palate. Looking forward to tinkering with additional ingredients using this as a base. Might increase oven temp to 450 next time for a little darker side crust and top browning. This is my new go-to for cornbread."

Good texture and it cooked so evenly in the cast iron skillet. I was really impressed with that and remembered that that is one of the features of cooking in a cast iron pan is the even heat. It made me think of trying other quick breads that way too. It also had a nice crusty bottom. I cooked for about 25 min. I would make it again with the changes I made to it as the basic batter is very good in terms of lightness and consistency."
