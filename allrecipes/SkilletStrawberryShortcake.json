"reviewBody": "I really liked this recipe. I prefer the shortcake to be a bit sweeter, but adding more sugar and getting more juice on the strawberries might just do it for me. I thought the dough was great. I made half of the recipe in an 8 inch cast iron skillet, added the suggested extra (2 tablespoons, I used Kefir instead of buttermilk) and also sprinkled the top with coarse sugar before putting it in the oven. I think the dough texture was perfect…but I would not describe it as shaggy…but more like a biscuit dough. It is my new go-to Strawberry Shortcake. Thank you!"

It has more flavor and thickness that makes for a perfect breakfast meal over pancakes. I did add strawberry extract to the whip cream that brought more strawberry flavor."

"reviewBody": "Made as directions stated, turned out delicious! Whole family loved it. The actual dough isn’t sweet, more so buttery. The strawberries and whipped cream are what make it sweet so I kept toppings on the side for everyone to help themselves to adjust how sweet they wanted it. Definitely suggest keeping the lemon zest for the macerated strawberries, it cuts the sweetness of the macerated strawberries a bit and added a bit of tartness that was great, doesn’t make it taste like “lemon.”"

"reviewBody": "This gets a 5 for concept and final look and crumb but only a 3 for the actual recipe. Let me say at the beginning I had to make 2 adjustments. More on this later. Prepping the dry and wet bowls was very easy. I left my parchment paper a little oversized so it came up the sides. No risk of sticking. I liked that I didn’t have to pre heat pan. I did everything as described but my dough was anything but loose and scrubby. It was so thick I couldn’t get all the flour mixed in. 1st change: I had to add about a quarter cup more milk which worked. Put it in pan and topped with berries as written. 2nd change: I put the large crystallized sanding sugar on most of my sweet baked goods if the top will show. Makes everything look special and gives a pleasant sweet crunch. Just something my crew likes."
