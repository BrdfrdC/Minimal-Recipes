"reviewBody": "I’ve been making this one for years to rave reviews. Even with a small household of one adult and one kid, I make the full recipe and either freeze one of the foil-wrapped bundles in the roll tray or just bake it up a few days later. I tried it with the butter-flavored Hawaiian rolls and was surprised to find that the sweetness of the original-flavored ones is much preferred. There’s a little discrepancy in the onion soup mix amount. The recipe calls for 1.25 oz but currently the Lipton envelopes contain just under an ounce. The only reason I know that is bc I buy the mix in bulk and weigh it out for recipes. If I were using envelopes, I’d either open another and use some or all of it or supplement with some finely chopped or even dried onions as well as some onion powder."

After I put them together I melted a quarter cup of butter and brushed it over the tops of the rolls and then sprinkled sesame seeds over the tops of the rolls. Everything else I did according to the recipe. I will definitely make again."

Don't be afraid of the mayo; it really isn't overpowering and lends a richness to the meat mixture. I did use cookin4therapy's bun sauce, though I used less and wish I would have have slathered it on (especially on the insides of the bun). Fantastic recipe and so happy to have found it! It will be perfect to bring to a party! Bun sauce: 2 tbsp minced onion flakes, 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce, 1 tbsp Dijon or Spicy Mustard (not the regular yellow), 1/2 cup melted butter. You melt these together and brush on top of the buns just before you put in the oven to bake."

I use HerbOx sodium free beef bouillon to make the onion soup mix and my family really enjoys these sliders."

I also did not have onion soup mix, so I substituted with a little garlic powder, dash of liquid smoke, a couple tsp of Worcester sauce, and diced onions cooked with the burgers which were broken up. I have to say they turned out terrifically and were a hit. I also use the butter/poppy seed/mustard et al topping mentioned in some other reviews. I would highly recommend using the Beyond Burger product as an alternative and healthier meat source for this recipe."

No one said that. :o Girlchild said she liked the rolls, too. Huh. :O :D ... 4.10.19 ... I froze half of the meat mixture. 'Came across a markeddown package of Hawaiian Rolls &amp; \"went with it.\" Haha. It looks like too much filling &amp; would be if only meat, but it isn't so it isn't. :D The buns have a close-to-grilled crispness. 'More toppings &amp; condiments required for this girl, but that's easy enough to fix. :) Note: Bikerfamily likes Hawaiian Sweet mini sub rolls (precut). I use a gigantic piece of Big Foil (as it's called at my house, that's the extra wide foil), lay out the bottom section of the rolls, carefully get the meat stacked and distributed on the rolls, top with the top rolls, wrap the Big Foil around the sandwiches as best you can. I often do the prep days ahead of the actual baking and serving... \nhttps://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/freddys-burgers/ ... 3/7/20: Sixteen regularsized buns filled &amp; half filling left. :o More buns next time - or less filling. :D"

The onion soup mix really adds flavor to these sliders, and saves time since you don't have to chop up raw onion.

"reviewBody": "HELPFUL TIP FOR ONION HATERS and those who don't want HARD buns: Really was kind of concerned my four kids would hate this because of the onion flavor. All of them despise onions, and you know what... I guess in this packet, it's not a standout because all of mine didn't say a thing. I noticed...but loved it! The only complaint they had was it needed more flavor in terms of ketchup and more pickles ...and the grownups wanted shredded lettuce and a tomato option. ……….BUT for a quick teenager snack that you can even make ahead and leave in a dish ready to just heat for 30 min, this definitely fits the bill. Also, was afraid of the 2lbs of ground beef.... I mean, that's a lot! ...but it really did well with 2 packs of king rolls. Sure there were leftovers, but it is worth eating again. I used enough buns that I thought the kids would eat. Foiled a 13X9 dish, and also covered with foil. W/O it, the buns would have been rocks. Also must cool ground beef as mentioned before adding the shredded cheese and mayo. Drain the beef too. All these made just the perfect burgers."

"reviewBody": "These are really good, but they were not exactly what I was looking for. I made some changes: I used the Hawaiian Sweet rolls, rather than plain dinner rolls. I didn't have onion soup mix, (frankly I don't care for it, and its very high in sodium, just fyi) So instead I added one fine chopped white onion, 1Tbsp. season salt, 2 tsp. black pepper, 2 tsp. garlic powder all added to meat mixture. I liked the alternate of cooking all in the frying pan to. But, if your looking for super thin burgers like the fast food (castle) you can also spread the meat mix thinly over a large cookie sheet, bake at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes, then using a couple pancake flippers, place onto your already prepared rolls. I wouldn't include pickles either. Put them\non the side. Anyone that dislikes pickles will hate the juice being all over your bread!"
