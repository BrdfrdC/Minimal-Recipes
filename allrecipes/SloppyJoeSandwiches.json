I used about a 3/4 cup of ketchup and a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper. These sloppy Joe’s were too sweet, so I added a little more vinegar. I added more water as needed as the mixture kept getting too dry. This recipe is ok, but I’ll continue to use the canned Red Gold Sloppy Joe Sauce (way better than Manwich)."

In the future I will use half of the brown sugar and twice the vinegar. My husband really liked it, but also thought it was too sweet. The seasoning was perfect. (I also left out the salt because I have to be careful and didn’t miss it at all. I’m sure the ketchup has more than enough!)"

Second time cooking this recipe and my mom’s boyfriend asked if I was making the same one, so they REALLY enjoy this recipe. :) We did end up doubling the recipe both times, so there would be enough for everyone and so there would be enough for leftovers. We’re having tatter tots with it as well (as a side)."

If I had to do it over again, I would have substituted a good BBQ sauce for the ketchup, added half a chopped green bell pepper, and eliminated the chili powder altogether. As it was, it was okay, but the chili powder kept nagging until I was glad to be done with the meal. Bleh."
