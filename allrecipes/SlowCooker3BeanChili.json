Measured the main ingredients in the recipe but, just added the extras with a pinch here and there..just tasting as I go. Instead of a full can of green chilis, I did a can of the diced tomatoes with chilis. This chili is more of a hot dish with it being so think so, I added a small can of spicy V8 and about a 1/2c of water. I cooked all mine on the stovetop, no need to use a Crock-Pot for this one."

We also add more seasoning to the crock pot (probably double chili powder, 2 tablespoons cumin, generous onion and garlic powder). It’s a family favorite!"

This time I replaced the kidney beans with an additional can of pinto/chili beans. I personally do not care for the kidney bean texture in chili. So I guess it's a two bean chili. I increased the chili powder and cumin for my taste. I also added a partial green pepper this time that needed to get used. I prefer the stovetop method, using my cast iron dutch oven, low simmer for a few hours."

I made this recipe with Lightlife sausage because of my vegetarian girlfriend and it was pretty good. We ended up getting 9 cups out of it, which everything added together ended up being 237.22 calories per cup which is awesome. for leftovers, I got a beef hotdog and poured some of this on top and sprinkled with cheese to make an awesome chili cheese dog. Perhaps some different seasonings would turn this into Doritos level good, keep trying and let me know."

"reviewBody": "This is wonderful!!! Easy and great for freezing. I could not find canned Chili Peppers so I used fresh and chopped them up. Fire roasted tomatoes were not available either but using canned tomatoes were fine! I also used about 1/4 pound ground beef (93% lean) in addition to the ground turkey to give the browning of the turkey a little boost. Will definitely make again, especially this winter!!!! BRRRRR"

"reviewBody": "I am SO glad I made this!!! I got a brand new 6-qt. digital Crock Pot for Christmas this year, so I've been on a mad hunt for slow cooker recipes! This was the first one I decided to make since we had about a week's-worth of Winter come through about a week ago.\nIt was so extremely amazing! The only thing I changed was that I used 80/20 ground beef in place of the turkey (I have a thing about ground turkey). It was the best chili I have ever made in my life! It wasn't so spicy that it left my lips blistered, but had a little kick with the tomatoes. \nI saved exactly half of it to freeze and my husband and I ate off off it for three days. The part that I froze is enough to invite my youngest daughter and her family (5 extra people)!!! I WILL be making this again. Extremely easy recipe, and extremely good!!! \nI made some rice, had assorted grated cheeses, and good old-fashioned corn bread to go with it (the rice helps with young children who can't tolerate any spice--even though it's not a really spicy-hot chili). It's good all by itself, however!\nThank you so much for the recipe!!!"

"reviewBody": "This was great, but a bit bland... Admittedly I didn't have the green chiles...or the 'fire roasted' tomatoes - just used 2 cans of plain tomatoes. However, I added some coriander. That was awesome! I would recommend cilantro if you have it on hand, coriander if you don't. I only had whole coriander so I crunched it up in a tea bag and floated it in the crockpot. The cilantro/coriander adds this lovely after taste, and covers up some of the bean aftertaste. Also 1 cup or more of frozen corn - added in the last hour or so of cooking. I made it with beef and was a bit generous with the beef. Served with options of shredded cheese, sour cream, and hot sauce. It got rave reviews at a recent potluck."

Great for those who are converting meals into healthy options. \nWith that said I decided to step it up in flavor with 1tbs Sea salt and a extra 1/2-1tsp of chile powder. \nGreat recipe, Cheap and easy too! I bought enough ingredients to make the dish twice for family and it was only 28 bucks :)"

"reviewBody": "I really enjoyed this dish and I pumped it up by using pinto, black and kidney beans and extra tomatoes. Instead of purchasing separate herbs, I have a great Watkins Garlic Herb Blend but I also used fresh garlic - lots of it! I used unsalted ingredients for the most part and added very little. I ate it for dinners/lunches over the span of almost two weeks but none of it went to waste! It's versatile - great by itself, with corn chips, with sour cream/cheese, over a baked potato. I would definitely make it again."

I have definitely made better tasting chili, but this does have healthy ingredients."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was my first attempt at making chili. And let me tell you, it was DELICIOUS! It says it makes 10 servings but I couldn't get enough. Actually, it yielded about 8 servings. I feed my family of four and it was about 2 servings a piece. I didn't have fire roasted tomatoes so, I used regular diced tomatoes and was very pleased with the results. I can not wait to make this again. It is similar in texture to Wendy's chili. However, I think this is better! Loved it!"
