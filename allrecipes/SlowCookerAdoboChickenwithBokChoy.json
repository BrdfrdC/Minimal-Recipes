I also used 1/2 cup of soy sauce instead of 1/3 and added an extra tablespoon of the brown sugar. I used LOTS of black pepper. I also used boneless thighs. My crockpot cooks super fast, so I only had to cook it 5 hours, until the chicken started to break apart. It has a nice tang, not too overpowering. It’s amazing the flavor with so few ingredients. Will make again."

"reviewBody": "I ran across this recipe and locked in on the bok choy ingredient which I had and really needed to cook or use in a salad. Score! All the other ingredients were on hand so it was destined to become dinner. Then discovered I only had 2 big fat thighs in the freezer. No problem, I could still pull this off, right? Then I realized my crock pot was on a shelf in the garage but the Instant Pot was handy. So I guessed at 1/4 of the seasonings except for using an entire large yellow onion. (I'm not a committed hard fast measurer). Also, went easy on the vinegar per other reviews. I filled the pot with onion and seasonings and set the thawed thighs on top with a full teaspoon of paprika sprinkled over them. I set the IP on Slow Cook and put a lid on it. After about 4 hours I opened the IP, added a full cup of long grain rice with about a half cup of water. Then changed the setting to Rice cooker. I had to run an errand and got back to the IP about 45 mins later. I was starved so spooned a healthy serving and let me tell you, this is delicious! Now, if I had only remembered to add the darn bok choy... Oh well, I can add the bok choy to the leftovers. :) Obviously, this recipe cannot be messed up, although I could have added less rice with only two thighs. I will make it many more times and especially for company!! Great sauce and great flavor."

This recipe also needed more garlic and bay leaves; and I recommend a 1/2 a tablespoon of whole black peppercorns. I'd also drop the onions. Any way...look up a traditional Filipino Adobo recipe where the meat is cooked in a rolling boil for about 45 minutes-1 hour and compare."

The chicken didn't have much flavor, but the juice tasted fairly good over rice. Won't be making this again."

"reviewBody": "What a delicious and comforting recipe! I put it in the crock pot before I left on Saturday morning to visit my mom and sister, returned home and put my feet up after adding the Bok Choy and starting some rice. When the food was ready, I removed the chicken to a platter, added some thickener to the broth and bok choy and then put everything out like a buffet. We all put rice in our bowls, ladled broth and bok choy over it and lay the chicken on top. I also put out soy sauce and red pepper flakes in case we wanted to add them to our individual dishes. It was so good we got stuffed!"

I'm thinking I should have removed the chicken then added the bok choy and then put the chicken on top. Any thoughts on what I *should have* done?"

The sauce was a bit thin and greasy but boyfriend enjoyed the punchy hit of vinegar. I added boiled eggs for about half hour to steep in the marinade, made a nice additional component to this simple dish :)"

Not enough liquid, meat was sitting on a rack of onions above the seasoning liquid, was nearly tasteless. Plus side, smelled good while cooking, wasn't vinegary, I used Apple cider vinegar and the Bok Choy was a great addition. Adobo is like chili, there's as many variations as there are cooks, think I'll stick to stovetop versions but thanks for the recipe."

You can't give it 5 stars just because the meat is tender."

"reviewBody": "Made this with a couple of changes. Instead of waiting 8 hours, I seasoned the thighs with adobo seasoning, let those sit while I did the prep work on the onions and garlic. Then I sauteed the thighs for 3 minutes per side in 2 batches. I had my pressure/slow cooker on \"Keep Warm\" so I tossed those in as they finished. \n\nThen I sauteed the onion and garlic in the skillet used for the chicken. After 5 minutes, I threw in 1/2 cup red wine to deglaze the pan and poured all that into the cooker. Set the pressure cooker to low pressure for 20 minutes.\n\nWhen time was up, I vented and set it to slow cook for 30 minutes, added the bok choy and returned the cover with the vent open. After 30 minutes the thickest parts of the bok choy were not cooked so I turned it to saute until they looked cooked through."

I my slow cooker (made of ceramic) I sprayed olive oil on the sides/bottom, then placed 1 tbsp of unsalted butter. place slow cooker at buffet till butter melted. then added the sweet onions, then garlic. Changed temp. to simmer. After 40mins., added a little bit of white wine. while that is simmering, I prepared the chicken smothered with paprika and pepper. Then prepared the veggies (added 2 Leeks) and then the sauce. Changed the temp. to low for 5-6. I did every 2 hours checked and/or mix it. I made steamed 3-rices (Brown/Jasmine/Balsamic)."
