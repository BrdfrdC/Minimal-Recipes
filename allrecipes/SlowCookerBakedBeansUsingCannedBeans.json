And they are so easy to make. I didn't have any ham on hand, so I used about 1/3 lb of bacon and sauteed it together with the onion before adding it to the beans. I also didn't have any hickory flavored BBQ sauce so I just used regular and added about a tsp of liquid smoke. Delicious! I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could! I will never buy canned baked or pork and beans again!"

I used bacon instead of ham, and cooked it w/the onion first before adding to the bean mixture. I didn't use any green peppers, and used white kidney beans and northern beans. I tripled the recipe, cooked on low for 8 hrs in my slow cooker and they were sooo yummy!! Will use this again and again :):)"

I could eat this by itself as my main dish! So yummy!! Thanks for the recipe!"

If I made it again, though, I would take the time to saute the onion before adding it to the recipe. Even though my beans cooked for 8 hours, the onion was still quite crunchy. I used pancetta instead of ham, left out the bell pepper, and added more barbecue sauce, ketchup, and an extra dash of mustard and brown sugar since I like a saucier bean."

I scooped it all out and put it in a casserole dish, leaving behind some liquid. I put mixed in the bacon, and 2 teaspoons worchestire and baked at 350 uncovered for 30 minutes. Took out, covered in foil until ready to serve.....now they looked like a nice thick backed bean dish. The taste was great, though. I did use a mixture of northern, black and red beans for visual interest."

Make sure it is a barbecue sauce that you really love. How much brown sugar you use really depends on how sweet the BBQ sauce is that you use. I used 1 tablespoon mustard instead of the dry mustard. I did not use the green peppers because I did not have any. I used chopped cooked bacon instead of ham because that is what I had. I took it to a birthday party and it went very fast I didn't even get any myself . I take that as a very good sign! I will definitely use this recipe again!"

I didn't add any meat, used the full amount of brown sugar, used regular bulls eye BBQ sauce, used a half of a large green and yellow bell pepper and one huge onion for the double batch. I really can't imagine adding more veggies. Because of time, I cooked these for close to 3 hrs on high then transferred to a casserole dish and baked for 35 minutes at 350. We will have again."

"reviewBody": "These are great and I'm not even a baked bean fan! The only tweak I made was to use \"Dave's BBQ Sauce\" from here (super easy to make from pantry staples) and I do think that probably imparted a bit more flavor than a bottled sauce, so keep that in mind. I may have used a bit more ham, too, simply because it's what I had left to use. These received rave reviews from guests and multiple recipe requests. This will become a rib dinner side staple at the LTH house. THANKS for the recipe, wannabe chefette!"
