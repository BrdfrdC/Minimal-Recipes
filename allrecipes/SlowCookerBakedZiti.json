I probably should have added another small can of tomatoes to make up the liquid because this cooked very quickly. Ended up being only about 1 hour on high and 2 hours on low. I froze the other half of the ingredients to make again soon"

The noodles were perfect that way- not soggy like I’m reading a lot in the other reviews. Next time I plan to make sure I have the sausage but still use some kind of wild burger (that’s all I cook with), either 3/4 or half the noodles, and add another can of spaghetti sauce. This made a HUGE meal and we don’t need quite so much with just 4 of us and no microwave for hubby to heat it at work. I will definitely be making this again!"

It fit just fine in my large oval-shaped slow cooker. The original version would not have fit in it! I halved the pasta, meat, sauce, but not the cheese. It turned out really nice. To ensure enough moisture, I put a bit of water in the sauce cans, about 1/4c of water, to get the last bit of sauce out. \n\nTo cut down on dishes to clean. I cooked the meat in a large saucepan. Removed it. Then cooked the onion and garlic in the same pan. Then I added the meat and sauce to it and warmed it up a bit. \n\nI added additional garlic. basil, and oregano. I also added fresh sage and parsley."

It still came out fabulous! I made it in a 7 qt hamilton beach slow cooker, and the recipe filled it up nicely, it took about 1 hour less to make than indicated cooking on low heat.\n\nWe will definitely be making this recipe again!"

I will say that the first night it was palatable and I'm not saying that the flavor was bad, the flavor is definitely there. It is just that the pasta ends up mushy-(sp ?). I will try agagain except, I will add the pasta much later ! Again the sauce is nice"

Repeated the layer.Cooked on low for 6 hours. Easy dinner, yum and easy clean up. Left overs as well."

I cooked it on low heat in my slow cooker for about 6 hours. If someone has any ideas on how to bake it so the noodles don't over cook and absorb all the sauce, please let me know and I will definitely make this again. Also, I paired it with the cheesy Italian bread from this site and it was awesome"
