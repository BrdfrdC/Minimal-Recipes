Had to remove chicken and brush with BBQ sauce and put under broiler after it cooked in the crock pot. Also, if you are cooking it in BBQ sauce, there is absolutely no need for the other ingredients. Either make your own or use bottled. Using both is ridiculous."

What I done was, is I took some foil and rolled it up to keep the chicken off the bottom...that way I can drain it when done and it also adds to the moisture by leaving it in, and I also used leg quarters. Throw some onion and garlic in the bottom where all the juices collect, and you have that flavor as well as a good base for gravy. I've done the same thing with brisket."

My only reservation with it was that I am a huge sissy about spicyness and I hadn't realized what amount of heat 1/2 a tsp of red pepper flake actually creates. It was right at my top of the tolerance for spice but still very good, it was a little much for my 7 year old but he still really enjoyed it-next time I may use less red pepper though. Otherwise soooo tasty!"

Chicken contains a lot of moisture, so I would recommend cooking the chicken \"plain\" for about 1/2 of the cooking time to get most of the moisture out.

The chicken was too done to our liking and made cutting it into bite size pieces tough. Like I said my mistake! Will remove chicken sooner to let cool. One thing I did do was to strain the sauce into a separate pan and add the cornstarch mixture to that. Made thickening a little faster. After thickening somewhat I returned the sauce to the crockpot and added the cut up chicken. \nThe wife and I will have the rest over rice tonight."

This looked really good for that. THE PROS: it was very easy. I used 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, totaling about 1 lb and cut the ingredients for the sauce in half. I did not add the red pepper flakes as we do not do spicey things very well. Anyway, for the barbeque sauce, it worked well as I actually used a couple of different kinds of barbeque sauce that I had on hand and wanted to clear out of the frig! The chicken was very moist and tender, yet the pieces held together well - not always the case when cooking boneless, skinless chicken breast pieces! The sauce tasted very good to us. THE CONS: I gave this recipe only 4 stars because there was WAY TOO MUCH SAUCE AND IT WAS VERY THIN. Even though I only used about a cup of the bottled barbeque sauce, with the addition of the vinegar (and I used cider vinegar because I did not have any white on hand - I donâ€™t think that really matters) and the steaming that adds moisture while it cooks in the slow cooker, I ended up with almost 2 cups of LEFTOVER sauce! Thatâ€™s AFTER we used sauce on the chicken we ate! I am going to freeze the leftover sauce and make this again and will just re-use the sauce I am freezing to cook the chicken in. At the end, I plan to mix a little cornstarch with water and add to the sauce in the slo"

"reviewBody": "It seemed weird to me that it could cook for 4 - 6 hours. That's a big range! I made only two large chicken breasts so I cut the ingredients for the sauce in half but followed the recipe and cooked it for 5 hours. I used Sonny's Sweet BBQ Sauce and wondered if adding the brown sugar would make it too sweet, but it didn't. It was very yummy. As others have commented, it makes a LOT of sauce and it is very runny. When (not if) I make it again, I will make 1/4 of the sauce for two breasts unless I am serving it with rice or something to sop it up. Hubby liked it and said I should make it again. Not exactly diet food, but what the heck. It was easy and very tasty! We had enough left overs to have pulled chicken on a bun later on."

I mixed the ingredients in a bowl (except the chicken) and placed them in the refrigerator overnight. In the morning I added everything to the slow cooker and went to work. It was ready in the afternoon. Now to more complicated things."

When making only two chicken breasts use only half the bottle of sauce but if using savory sauce try leaving the amount of brown sugar the same, otherwise cut everything else in half also. I drained the chicken before pouring the sauce over, I basted the chicken a couple of times with the sauce during the last hour of the cooking process."

Next star chop some sweet onion and fresh garlic scattered on top and then some dry seasonings. After about four hours I plan to drain off the juice and fat from the skin flip the babies over and add barbecue sauce. Turn the heat down to low and let it rock along to their summer in about three hours then go to hold for dinner. I'll take a picture before they come out of the park later and how they turned out?"

It came out very dry because of that so I turned it into pulled chicken sandwhiches and it tasted just fine with the extra bbq sauce.\n\nI made it again but only had it in for a little over 4 hours and it was so juicy and delicious! \n\nIt's definitely a hard recipe to completely mess up as it was delicious both times, I highly reccommend paying attention to the time though! \n\nGreat introductory recipe for using a crock pot!"

"reviewBody": "Took other reviewers' recommendations re: cooking breasts first, draining liquid and then adding BBQ mixture (per recipe). Found chicken was overcooked--tough, but the BBQ sauce was a WINNER!! Going to try making the BBQ sauce on the oven (for approx. 1 hour) and then just stirring in some rotisserie chicken slices to warm it up. Again, the BBQ sauce is so worth making it again!! Thanks for posting! \nUPDATE: Made this again with following changes: Made BBQ sauce following recipe. Purchased a rotisserie chicken and sliced the meat into strips. Preheated the oven to 300 degrees. Sprayed a 8x8-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Spread enough of the prepared BBQ sauce to coat the bottom. Added the chicken pieces on top. Used the remainder of the BBQ sauce to pour over the chicken. Covered the pan with foil and cooked for 30 minutes. YUM!!! Highly recommend!!!"
