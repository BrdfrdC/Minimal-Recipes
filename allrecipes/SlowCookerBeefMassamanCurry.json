"reviewBody": "Made it as written. It was wonderful. I looked at other recipes, but this was the most straight forward. The canned paste, when you find the right one...makes it easy. I will make this again using pretty much any protien. The curry is fresh tasting, not cloying, with just a nod to heat. I cooked the meat with lemongrass and cinnamon, no reason. I used a 4lb well marbled roast, it was perfect."
