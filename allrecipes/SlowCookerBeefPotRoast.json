If I made it again I would definitely add some chopped potatoes to it. Also, every reheated bowl that I've made, I add some *black pepper and cayenne* and I think it brings the dish to 5 stars. Next time I make this, I'll add both to the chicken broth mixture on the front side."

I also added a few quartered potatoes and I didn't have any tomato paste on hand, so I used 3 tbsp of pureed tomato. The thyme and rosemary were subtle and awesome and the roast was fork tender. Another good thing about this recipe is that I had almost all the ingredients at home and everything was reasonably priced. I have plenty of leftovers for tomorrow and I'm looking forward to them."

Braising the meat as described is the key to a tender, tasty roast. Put yellow potatoes, halved in the bottom of the crock pot. Really enjoying this meal."

"reviewBody": "Honestly, this was disappointing. I chose this Pot Roast recipe because it was Chef Johns - his recipes are typically spot on. The major problem was that it was pretty blah, it needed a lot more seasoning and I made it EXACTLY as written. I will make it again, but will add more seasonings - maybe red wine or Worcester sauce. Also, next time I won't put the carrots and celery under the beef - my meat was thicker than in Chef Johns video and I think it needed to have more contact with the chicken broth, onions etc. I don't think the mushrooms added anything. On the plus side, I learned that the carrots were perfectly cooked after 4 hours."

I've tried it with &amp; without beef broth &amp; honestly the chicken broth is better. I've added herbs at the beginning &amp; at the end, the same with little potatoes, and now I just throw it all in in the beginning. I taste the herbs just fine &amp; the little potatoes are cooked wonderfully, absorbing ask the yummy flavors! I've used a 7-bone roast &amp; a regular chuck roast since it's getting harder to find the center cut (7-bone) kind. They're both delicious, but I really do prefer the bone-in. I like to think of the added goodness the bone offers the broth. I love spices so I always add in so much more bc that's just how I am. Sometimes, if I have it, I'll add a little red wine right after sautéing the tomatoe paste in the middle &amp; it helps it mix all together. You can not go wrong with this recipe guys! Add what you will, take out what you don't like. This is hands down the BEST slow cooker pot recipe out there! I bought an instant pot &amp; I have a Dutch oven, I've made pot roast in both &amp; still prefer the old slow cooker. In the past I've made a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce but my husband prefers me not to because he loves soaking it all up with soft rolls. Way to go Chef John, for always showing us the ART of cooking well! ♡♡"

I added a can of beef consume' along with the chicken stock and I omitted the fresh herbs, simply because I forgot to get them at the market. As my luck would have it, my crock pot stopped working an hour into my cook. I placed everything into my Dutch oven and baked it low and slow. 250 degrees for about five hours. The extra consume' that I added turned into a delicious gravy that was served over some mashed red potatoes. I am having dinner guests tonight and guess what is on the menu? Yep and I can not wait! Enjoy everyone!"

"reviewBody": "This is hands down the best pot roast I’ve ever made, however I did make a few minor alterations. First, I used a Dutch oven to make this a one pot recipe instead of a slow cooker. I cooked in the oven at about 200 for about 5 hours. I added LOTS of salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. I also added bay leaves and red wine. When the roast was done, I pulled the meat out of the Dutch oven and simmered the vegetables and gravy until it was the thickness I wanted and then added the meat back in. You can add a flour slurry to quicken this process. I also misread the directions and added the full can of tomato paste but it didn’t seem to effect the result. TASTE AS YOU GO and season accordingly, and if you do it in the oven, add a little extra chicken/beef broth. This is NOT a throw it together and leave it kind of recipe, as prep work and the cooking process before I put it in the oven took around an hour, HOWEVER it’s totally worth it to make the extra time to do it."

I'd say change nothing. Watch your cooking time, really depends on roast size. Mine was about 3 pounds, cooked little over 5 hrs."

And if you take the extra 15 - 20 minutes, it’s worth it and scrumptious. Watch the video. I always watch Chef John’s videos because they are very educational, even for us experienced cooks. You literally do not have to change a thing with this recipe. The only modifications I made was I added a little red wine to deglaze the pan, and used a Montreal Steak seasoning. This is by far the BEST slow cooker pot roast recipe out there so don’t cut corners, do the prep as recommended and you won’t be disappointed! Thanks Chef John!"

I didn’t add mushrooms (though I’m sure the would have been a delicious addition) and I added potatoes and once cup of red wine. Just fantastic!"

The mushrooms, carrots, celery, and onion made for a delicious variety of flavors and textures, and I served mine with mash potatoes adding to its heartiness. I was surprised to see the use of chicken broth instead of beef broth. Personally, I’m more a fan of beef broth or Lipton onion packet, but this variation was certainly a unique change from routine, and wasn’t too bad."

"reviewBody": "Turned out great! Very tender, with that classic \"pot roast\" flavor. Mine definitely had to be on for 6 hours on high. Checked at 5 and it wasn't ready. Better to have dinner later than not as tasty! I've messed up slow cooker pot roasts before by not giving it enough time. \n\nI only had a 3-pound boneless bottom round of beef available, but it still worked out great with the same measurements otherwise. Got four nice servings out of that. \n\nMy slow cooker is rather large, and the liquid didn't cover the meat completely. I just flipped it twice during cooking. I pulled it apart into chunks (not shreds!) after I turned off the slow cooker and let it cool for a bit before serving. \n\nIf you like to have more of a gravy, you should either add more flour to the onion/mushroom mix before mixing in the chicken stock, or add a cornstarch slurry in the last half hour. \n\nI did have to skim quite a bit of fat off the top, but that was my mistake in using both oil and butter for the mushroom and onions. I usually do that to avoid the butter burning, but the mushrooms released enough liquid that it probably would have been fine."

Everyone loved it and would like to have it again so a copy of this will be going in my recipe keeper! Wonderful meal for those cold winter nights. TY Chef John!!

I Also used dried thyme and rosemary. This recipe is a keeper for me."

We'll see how it is after 5-6 hours. So far it smells wonderful so I think it will be great! I will serve the meat and vegetables over herbed brown rice."

This is really a fantastic full-meal, crock pot recipe and I can't wait to use it mid-summer when I seem to NEVER want to turn the oven on! \n\nI made some tweaks based on preferences and what I had on hand. My roast was boneless because that is what I could easily get, and I seasoned the roast with both onion &amp; garlic powder prior to searing. I added about 3/4 cup red wine and 2 tbsp of worcestershire sauce for added flavor (went easy on salting the roast itself since both of these ingredients were adding salt). I also used low-sodium beef broth since that's what I had. Used dried herbs in place of fresh (1 tsp rosemary, 2 tsp thyme). I let it cook a full 6 hours on high and the roast was fall-apart tender. To finish it up, I thickened the jus with a flour slurry on the stove and served it with Chef John's perfect mashed potatoes and some roasted string beans. Delish!"

Only thing I do different is cut celery/carrots up and put them in slow cooker while you’re browning the roast. That way, instead of setting aside the roast when it’s done browning (in my cluttered bachelor kitchen where counter space is limited), I set it straight in the crockpot on the veggies. Regardless if this effects the resting process, it’s not bad enough to make me want to organize my kitchen."

I also used beef broth, added a lot more of all seasonings (garlic, rosemary, and thyme!) I like these types of meals to be hearty and flavorful and these changes accomplished that! It was a delicious dish!"
