I then made mashed red potatoes, boiled with the skin on and peeled before mashing, adding butter and sour cream while mashing. The stew mixture more resembled a goulash than a stew. Made a bed of mashed potatoes and poured the goulash over it. We loved it!!!"

I believe the people having difficulty with dry meat, etc are using an instapot, based on pics. Instapot and crockpot (or slow cooker) do not work the same. You may need to adjust the recipe time and temp to your appliance. This would also work great simmered on the stove."

Mushrooms, parsnips or cauliflower might be good too. Cooked on high for 4 hours and it was good especially considering you don’t need to brown the meat before."

For my family, it wasn’t very rich in flavor, rather it was kinda blah. To get more favor though, requires more effort. It would have been nice if this easier recipe worked out, but I’m going back to my tried and true classic French version with red wine, more spices, and browning/searing the meat first. To me, it’s worth the extra effort. Glad I tried it though and thank you for your recipe!"

It's worth the extra money on the condition that I'll use every bit of it. So I added the prime rib bones to the stew, and added all the remaining au jus to the beef broth. It was absolutely exquisite; after 12 hours, the stubborn prime rib meat just fell off the bone, and the au jus permeates the entire presentation. Amish noodles are a nice addition as well."

I added mushrooms, one large potato… I didn’t have beef broth, so while I ran out to the store, I put in three bullion cubes and a cup and a half of hot water. I was worried about flavor and saltiness, so i got some Swanson’s beef broth and put a good splash over the whole stew. I cooked everything together for four hours on high. It was amazing!"

For the comments it taste like a regular Beef Stew what did you expect it to taste like! This stew was exactly what I wanted and simple to put together. The only thing I did different was due to my inability to follow simple directions. I seasoned the meat with seasoning that I chose (onion and celery and garlic powder) instead of mixing salt and pepper with flour. I ended up adding additional seasoning to the stock and vegetables and I did all prep work night before except broth and Worcestershire sauce. Next morning in between trying to get out of house on time I added liquid, plugged crockpot in. The smell in my house was heavenly."

Pretty much followed the recipe exactly except I used a shallot in place of an onion. I cooked it on high 5 hours and it had no flavor. I ran out to get the Lawry’s beef stew seasoning as some suggested and it helped a tiny bit bit overall it was nasty. The beef wasn’t tender nor were the carrots. Total disappointment and a waste of time preparing."

While the spices were the same, I did add a single serve bottle of Cab Sauv, a regular size can of diced tomatoes and extra carrots and celery to stretch for 8 servings, because my husband invited some friends over for dinner. I did brown the flour coated beef and onions then threw everything together, brought to a boil then put it in a 275 degree oven for 3 hours as I didn’t have all day. I do believe the stew would have been awesome without my additions."
