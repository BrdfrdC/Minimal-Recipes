NOTE: butcher says the shoulder &amp; butt pork roast come from the same area of the pig's shoulder. Because it wasn't the 5 lb. used in the recipe I made some minimal alterations in amounts and time. This was wonderful and pull-apart tender. We both highly recommend it!!"

But then I added 1 part Famous Dave's Devil's Spit and 2 parts Famous Dave's Sweet and Zesty Barbecue Sauce and it came alive! It even had a smoky flavor to it. I swear by these two sauces. I will definitely make this again."

The drippings are measured out, some of the fat skimmed off, and brought to a boil on the stove. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Since rice is a 1:2 ration with water, I reduce the rice by one cup, bring to a boil, and simmer for 20 minutes. Best rice to have with pulled pork!"

"reviewBody": "Oh my goodness! I have a new favorite way to make pulled pork sandwiches. We loved the beer flavor! I rubbed the spices into the pork shoulder, browned it on all sides, then put it in the crockpot with the beer and more garlic and onion powder. I didn’t have any shiner bock so used a can of 805. Crocked on low for 8 hours, removed, shredded, put 1/2 the meat in the freezer and returned 1/2 to the crockpot with 1/2 a jar of Buddy Stubbs sweet heat and crocked on low for 1 hour. In the mean time, I made a batch of Chef John’s Hamburger Buns. When serving, I added a few tbsp of bbq sauce to each sandwich. It got rave reviews at our Super Bowl party (for 2...there’s a pandemic). Can’t wait for leftovers tomorrow!"

"reviewBody": "Very good, I'll be making pork butt this way forever. Also, it's very forgiving. I had to use a 7+ pound roast, because that was the smallest one they had. I didn't know it had a bone in it, and it filled the cooker so much I couldn't use the whole bottle of beer. It was still wonderful. South Carolina has 4 kinds of BBQ sauce depending on your region (Catsup based, mustard, vinegar, and tomato). I used the vinegar based one--still wonderful. I bet if I added some liquid smoke, it would probably fool some people as the traditional outdoor deal. Be sure you use a dark beer."

I used Yuengling Lager beer. I may have used less than 12 oz of BBQ sauce. I don't like too much. I had three different kinds of bbq sauces leftover so I just mixed them together. I did put a little of the juices back in too. Cooked for 1 hr on high and 8 on low, then 1/2 hr on warm. Served on ciabatta rolls with home made coleslaw, and green beans. Whole family loved it! Very easy and delicious!!"

Bay leaf, paprika, dried mustard....whatever you want. I also throw in a touch more spices than what's called for. I save the juices and add a little flour for gravy in a side pan. Can use it for au jus dipping as is. I used Yuengling larger beer if your east of the Mississippi! If you're on the West side, no luck. Maybe special order?"

The pork turned out great and my family loved the flavor so much that I couldn't keep their hands out of the shredded meat in order to prep for the next step."

I had two bone-in 7 lb pork roasts so I added a half more of everything except the beer. I put them in 2 different crock pots and used a Sam Adams Summer Wheat beer to pour on top, I also added some liquid smoke to give it a bit of a \"smoker\" taste, nothing too crazy. I started the roasts around 9pm on low and in the morning at 9pm I shredded the meat, drained the liquid and put it to the side to add later if needed (but I didn't end up needing it). I put the crock pot on high for an hour and then on warm with the lid off for a bit. It sat on warm until the party at 6pm. I never did add the bbq sauce so people could add it themselves. Everyone seriously loved it!"

This let the fat come to the top. I spooned off the fat, then shredded the pork and returned it to the slow cooker. I added a little more BBQ sauce and heated for one hour on low. Turned out great."

I’m glad that I did, because I had a lot of fat to pick off the meat before putting it back in the crock pot. I spread it out on a cookie sheet and take a small knife to take off fat and membranes left. My family loved it!"

"reviewBody": "This was so easy! I'm all about fast prep and little to no thinking when it comes to cooking. I had a pumpkin ale on hand and the flavors of that went soooo well with the seasoning. I was surprised other reviewers said they needed more seasoning, I thought there was plenty (though I think I was a pound short on the meat, so maybe that's why, or perhaps the beer with those added spicy flavors enhanced it), and I even loved it without the bbq sauce, but I was craving bbq, so I just added 1/2 the bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's. That's our fam's favorite! People can add more sauce to taste or enjoy more of the meat and seasonings flavor. This is going in our fave crockpot meals to cook frequently. Very yummy."

The bbq sauce is where a ton of the flavor comes from, the consistency of the pork has more to do with the ingredients and the cooking. \n\nReally great recipe thank you!"

I followed the base recipe but made a couple of minor additions: I added some thinly sliced Vidalia onions, 1 tsp of smoked paprika, 1/2 tsp of cayenne and 1/2 tsp liquid smoke. I used A bottle of miller lite and cooked my 3 lb pork loin on low for about 10 hours. All of the liquid was absorbed into the meat making it nice and juicy and the meat was literally falling apart it was so tender. I served it plain with white slider buns with a bottle of sweet baby rays sauce on the side for anyone who wanted to add it to their sandwiches. The additional spices made the plain meat very tasty for those who preferred to withhold the sauce. Thanks for sharing!"

I would not recommend discarding the broth-the pork was quite dry, and adding the barbecue sauce did not moisten the pork enough . I ended up adding a bottle of Not Your Father's root beer to add some flavor and moistness, but t was still just an OK recipe. No one else in my family cared for it and we threw out what was left over. A note to Southerners--this is not close to being as good as anything you get in the South--you will be disappointed if you are used to true siouthern barbecue,."

In the morning it was cooked and oh so tender. I didn't add the bbq to the meat after I shredded it as I knew some in our party don't care for it. I served this on mini Hawaiian buns and had different flavors of bbq sauce available and Cole slaw for those of us who like to top pork with the slaw. I am not a beer drinker - at all - but it sure did flavor this meat very nicely. I wouldn't hesitate to make this recipe again. Served the sandwiches with chips, 'Green Pea Salad with Cheddar Cheese' from AR, chips, veggies and dip and everyone enjoyed their meal."
