"reviewBody": "This turned out really good. I had weekend guests and prepared everything earlier in the day, before their arrival. When i could see the night was winding down (after much socializing üòâ), I quickly mixed everything together and started the crockpot. This was somewhere around 11pm. We turned in sometime after midnight so I did the ‚Äústir once‚Äù as directed in the recipe before going to bed myself. The first person up was around 8am ish. Thankfully they turned the crockpot off. Some of the edges were getting overcooked. Flavor was good but basic - and I even added 1 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp garlic and onion powders to the eggs! But any bland is spruced up by your toppings and mine included avocado, salsa, sour cream, Pepper Jack cheese, etc. Again, everyone enjoyed. The ease of this is worth making again! Note to others: Either identify your early riser or direct the first person up needs to shut off the crockpot. Or! If you are fortunate to have a timer crockpot, set it! It will stay warm for the extra hour or two of sleep you need without cooking the heck out of the edges. I had a crockpot liner so easy clean-up. Would absolutely make again. I plan to play around with the seasonings but will make again. Thanks Nicolemcmom! Good crockpot/guest recipe!"
