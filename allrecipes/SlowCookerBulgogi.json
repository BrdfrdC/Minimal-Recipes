"reviewBody": "I didn't like this recipe. It was too much salt, even from the low sodium soy sauce, and too much sugar without much taste at the end. It actually gave me a headache. One of the most important ingredients is missing as well, you need to add a fruit like pear or kiwi. when cooked they create an enzyme that brings out the sweetness and flavors. Six hours was also too long, it would completely dry out your meat. i ended up making it completely different, so it may not even be in the realm of bulgogi anymore, I'm not sure. I put a thin layer of dark brown sugar on the bottom of my crock pot, enough to cover it but not enough that your finger sinks into it. I then added the beef, a pinch of ginger, a dash of cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg, a dash of chili pepper, 3oz of sesame oil, 3 oz of low sodium soy sauce, 1/2 a cup of water, sesame seeds and a golden kiwi - skinned and sliced then quartered. I cooked it on low for a half hour, then mixed everything around. I then cooked it for another half hour. Important to note - the beef had already been cooking for about a half hour previous to me changing up the recipe, so you may need to adjust the time. For a marinade, I'd probly use 1.5oz of the dark brown sugar and a 1/4 cup of water, upping the powdered ingredients to a tbsp each. same amount of sesame and soy. Play around with it, I have all my faith in you! Then mix it all up. it may not be super wet so just make sure everything is coated. Big hit. My ultra picky 5yr old loved it. I served it with basmati rice and raw sliced multicolor sweet peppers."

Based on other reviewer's suggestions, I doubled the marinade, increased the garlic to 6 cloves and about an hour before it was done, I added sliced mushrooms, sliced water chestnuts and the green onion. I had also increased the toasted sesame seeds to about 1 TBL. I was very glad for the increased sauce, but overall, thought the flavor was lacking. It was basically meat cooked in soy sauce. It's not one we will be making again. Thanks for the recipe - you never know until you try something!"

"reviewBody": "Like another reviewer said, four stars due to the poor cooking instruction. I doubled the marinade recipe (as I used 2lb of beef very thinly sliced) and forewent the marination altogether. I poured the marinade right into the slow cooker. I cooked this on LOW for TWO hours, stirring every 20 minutes. It came out absolutely perfect. I plucked out the beef and poured the excess marinade/sauce into a saucepan. I proceeded to bring this to a boil and added some cornstarch slurry to thicken. Served with stir-fried noodles and veg. Very good."

Flavor was quite rich.\" Six hrs. on low and our thinly-sliced beef was dry and tough from being in there w/ not enough liquid for that long of a time. I was in the process of making rice, so I quickly stir-fried a mixed frozen bag of veggies, which ended up absorbing the bulgogi \"sauce\" from the slowcooker - that was quite tasty. I just don't think the cooking method worked so great here."
