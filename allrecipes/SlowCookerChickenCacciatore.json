"reviewBody": "This recipe was a HUGE hit for this family of five. I combined the original recipe as well as a few suggestions from some of the reviews. I put 4 fresh boneless, skinless chicken breasts in the crockpot. Added 1/2-2/3 jar of Rao's Marinara spaghetti sauce, 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 can tomato paste, 6 oz of red wine (small bottle of a Cabernet Sauvignon), diced onion (1/2-3/4), diced pepper (1-1.5 green), 2-3 teaspoons of minced garlic, sprinkled in oregano, onion powder, and basil. Mixed well and covered the chicken with the sauce. Cooked on low for 4-5 hrs. Around the 4 hour mark, I took the chicken out and cut into sections before placing back into the sauce in the crockpot for the remainder of the time. Placed on top of linguini that'd already been plated and it was delicious!!! Kids were asking me to make it again before they'd even finished their dinner."

Also, I checked it and with my slow cooker set on low, it was almost too done at 5-1/2 hours (175Â°) which is \"done\" but it continues to cook because the sauce is so hot. If I make this again I will make my own marinara sauce and use a little bit more of it than the recipe called for. I will also check it after 4-1/2 hours and until it is at 165Â°, then turn it off."

I bought the giant boneless/skinless chicken breasts and 3 of them weighed 2.5#. It covered the bottom of my crock pot and I put all the ingredients over the top.\nUnbelievably tender.

"reviewBody": "I liked the amount of meat and veggies in this recipe but the seasonings from \"Chicken Cacciatore in a Slow Cooker\" so I combined them. I like a lot of seasoning. Here's what I added - 6 oz. tomato paste, another tablespoon of minced garlic plus 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 1/2 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes and 1 tsp Italian seasoning. Some of that was added to taste later because it needed more seasoning. Oh, I used a jar of mushrooms instead of fresh which I added for the last hour. I used 6 large chicken tenders. It was delicious. Next time I will use 8 chicken tenders and consider doubling the recipe - I like to freeze meal size portions. Also, my slow cooker is a little slow so after 3 1/2 hours on low, I turned it to high for another 1 1/2 hours so the veggies wouldn't be crunchy. It could have used another 1/2 hour on high. Next time I'm thinking about adding the uncooked spaghetti to the crock pot for the last 30 minutes for a 1 pot meal."

"reviewBody": "This cacciatore is tasty if not spectacular. I was looking for an easy, chicken, slow-cooker recipe and this certainly fits that bill. I've made it twice with good results both times. Mine ended up a little watery, thinning down the spaghetti sauce more than I care for. My husband won't eat mushrooms so I left those out. That may make a difference in the amount of liquid, I don't know. But I'm no chef and it tasted good so I'm grateful for the recipe!"

Sauce was made using diced tomatoes, wine, etc. It is supposed to be on the thinner side, not thick like jarred sauce. Also, my dad used a more flavorful cut of chicken such as boneless skinless thighs. :-)"

My guests raved over it! The pasta soaks up the extra juice and makes it really flavorful."

I didn't have much time so I cut the chicken breasts into large strips and browned first, seasoning the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic, oregano and sriracha spices (for a bit of kick). Threw it into the slow cooker with the rest of the ingredients. Also added a small can of garlic and olive oil diced tomatoes and some additional oregano. Cooked for 4 hours. It was amazing."

As others have stated the sauce was a bit runny. Part of that could have been due to using frozen chicken breasts. Mine was cooked in 6 hours with fairly large breasts. Nine hours does seem excessive and I can only imagine how overdone the meat would have been."

"reviewBody": "It is quick and easy to prepare, but I think dark meat chicken would be better than breasts. The breasts were very tender, but still a bit dry. Also, despite using a premium spaghetti sauce, the flavor was lacking a little. I'd kick up the seasoning a little to give it more spicy kick. The chicken tended to rend out a lot of liquid, making the sauce runnier than it should have been. So perhaps a thicker marinara would be a better starter."
