I am a busy mom, so this was the ultimate in lazy man's version of this recipe and I doctored it ALOT. I just dont have the energy to spend time cutting the ham or rolling the chicken, so here goes. I used 1 cup of chicken broth with the can of chicken soup, than added a lot of fresh ground garlic, a bunch af dried parsley, italian seasoning &amp; fresh ground pepper, and stone ground mustard - the jar kind, not the herb. All of it was to taste till I liked the flavor. I cut the chicked breast in half to thin them, I used lunchmeat ham and sliced swiss. Then I just layered it into the crockpot like it was lasagna: sauce, chicken, ham, cheese, sauce, chicken, ham, cheese, sauce. i didnt have stove top so I used a bunch of croutons on top which was nice because it didnt get mushy like other people mentioned. Then I added more chicken broth on top of the croutons instead of butter and viola! Hubby loves it, kids loved it, their friends loved it. Thanks for the recipe!"

You need the gooey stuffing to act as a sauce because the chicken is otherwise bland and the cheese disappears. So if I need to doctor it up by pounding the chicken to then roll the ham and cheese inside, it has ceased to be a quick easy slow cooker meal and you're basically making regular chicken cordon blue."

I layered cream of chicken mixed with milk first on the bottom. 3 breasts, ham, mozzarella cheese, dry stuffing mix, and a little more cream of chicken. Then I repeated the layers making a total of 6 breasts. Of course doing it this way I needed a second can of cream of chicken mix. This was so quick and easy for a busy day. Goes better with mashed potatoes than rice. WILL make again"

I did make a couple changes though-instead of the stuffing mix, I used italian bread crumbs (toasted on the stove and added towards the end) and I also added some shredded parm/romano cheese along with the swiss. Next time I will add even more cheese because it seemed to be non-existant by the end of the cooking process."

I seasoned it with onion powder, black pepper, and garlic salt. I then placed the ham and two slices of swiss on one side of the chicken before folding together and placing into the crock pot. I bought Chicken Stuffing and waited an hour before putting it in the crockpot. I did not put the full amount of stuffing in. The stuffing did not create a crust but blended really nicely with the meal as a whole."

Added some tarragon to the soup/milk mixture. Sprinkled the inside of the chicken breast with poultry seasoning before rolling. Placed the breast rolls in slow cooker with about half the soup mixture. Cooked on high for an hour. Added the stuffing, melted butter and rest of the soup mixture after the first hour. Cooked for about another 90 minutes on high setting.\nFamily's overall reaction was \"meh\". It was OK but just didn't impress. I might try it one more time but bake it in the oven instead. As a slow cooker meal this was a miss."

Butterflied chicken and put one slice cheese and one ham in each. Then two of each layered on top. Used cr. of mushroom soup and added garlic powder, poultry seasoning, thyme, pepper, oregano, dried parsley and white wine, used 1/2&amp;1/2 instead of milk. Added stuffing last hour of cooking and skipped butter, used chicken broth instead."

I was concerned that the chicken would get overcooked and fall apart, but I used two very large chicken breasts and cooked on low for 6 hours and it turned out perfectly. I thought it was strange to add the Swiss cheese at the very beginning, rather than at the end of the cooking time, but the cheese melts and combines with the soup giving the sauce a cheesy Swiss flavor that I thought was pretty distinctive. I would recommend this. It was so easy, and very good tasting. I will be making it again."

I found the toothpicks to be cumbersome and wish I could find something edible as absolution to hold breasts together. Overall a keeper! Thanks."

"reviewBody": "This is the first thing I've cooked that in 22 years my husband has ever gotten enthusiatic enough to want to bump up a few things. The first time I had it too soupy so I halved the milk with heavy cream and it was perfect. We hammered the chicken, layered it, cheese (which we used provolone and I finished out the bit of swiss I had, layer of shaved ham, another good layer of soup sauce as the chicken breasts actually thinned enough to make two. So we had that second layer of meat and cheese topped by the breading. I cooked on hi for 5 hrs. It was moist, savory, and everyone loved it. It goes WAY further, I would suggest this amount for at least six. I sliced and served it onto a platter and all of the layers held together so it was quite attractive as well. This was done in my large oval crock (not sure size). I would not suggest doing it in anything smaller. The width and shape of the oval crock made it easy to slice and remove. It has to be cooled before slicing if you want a good hold of the layers for looks and then warn, This is the best recipe we've used and it as our guidance we just did tweaks for his taste. While there may be lots of way to tweak to your taste, without this recipe would be absolutely nothing to start from. We cannot thank you enough for providing it."

"reviewBody": "I cooked this just as the recipe instructed. First of all, spray your dish with cooking spray or use a liner on this one. The stuffing really sticks to the sides. I cubed my chicken and my ham. I cooked it on high for 2-1/2 hours due to time. It was fully cooked and hot. I should have read the reviews about adding the cheese and stuffing about an hour before serving (30 minutes on high). The stuffing was mushy. It would have been better if it was crunchy. I also think that it was too much stuffing for me. My box was only 6 oz. I suggest using less. I think I will try breadcrumbs next time, but you can use crackers, crutons, etc. I will also use more cheese (we love lots of melted cheese). Overall it was very good and I will definetely cook it again!"

This was delicious but the entire dish did not stay together well. Splitting open the chicken and stuffing the ham and cheese inside would have been much better. I also used real off the bone ham, not deli meat which gave it a better taste. I will perhaps try this recipe again but I will follow the recipe exactly and see if it makes a difference."

I would not recommend adding any salt as with these ingredients it didn't seem to need it. The stuffing was not mushy so waiting to add it seemed to work out. A green veggie went nicely on the side.

I added low-sodium chicken stuffing on top with 2 hours to go, but next time I will wait the last 30 minutes since they got mushy.
