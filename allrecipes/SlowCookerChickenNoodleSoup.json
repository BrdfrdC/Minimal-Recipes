"reviewBody": "This is the best chicken noodle soup I ever had. I didn’t have most of the listed herbs so I used minced onion powder and low sodium mrs dash and double the pepper. I used 2.3 pounds of chicken and 12 oz of noodles. Chicken was good at 5.5 hrs so then I stirred in the noodles and let it cook for another thirty min. I used four cups water and four cups low sod stock. The noodles were soaking up the stock so I added two more cups. I did add one teaspoon of salt for better flavor as I had omitted it initially. I served it up and added some sriracha sauce and was warm and happy. I am recovering/have the flu! Thank you for this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This was okay. I’ve had better. I followed recipe exact. Flavor was there but dull when I sipped the broth only. Maybe a good soup when you’re sick? In hindsight, should have used just broth (no water) and maybe increased other seasonings? I also blame being overcooked. Since I do not work from home, this cooked on low for almost 8.5 hours before we shredded the chicken. It then cooked another 40 min for the egg noddles to cook through. Chicken was stringy and dry. That part I blame on me as submission says 5 hours. Maybe chicken thighs if you need to let cook all day? Glad we tried. Makes a TON! Just not our favorite version. Thank you!"

Instead of noodles, made matzo ball from the mix . It was a hit. Do not need to cube chicken breast. Meat can be shredded towards the end. New way and easier to make soup."

Subbed green onions for a regular onion, used 7 to 8 chicken thighs instead of chicken breast, used 1 1/2 tsp. salt and omitted season salt, 5 1/2 cups of chicken broth instead of 8 cups water, added an extra carrot, and used thyme instead of basil. It cooked for 4 hours, the small thighs cooked quicker than larger breasts. I added noodles for 30 minutes. Total cook time 4 1/2 hours on low."

I fried the chicken on low so it was still juicy and shredded it and added it to the pot. \nI cooked the noodles separately so that I could save the leftovers for another time and not have mushy noodles. \nEasy to do, was told I “outdid myself “ from my fiancé. Super hearty and great on a chilly night. We even had a frozen baked crusty bread that put the star on top. Definitely give it a try!!"
