It was delicious but I didn't care for finishing it on the stove. the next time I made the quesadillas I filled them, rolled them, covered them with cheese and sauce and put in the oven for 20 minutes or so. Delicious and easy!!"

The liquid didn’t really thicken even after cooking on high for a while after shredding, so I used a slotted spoon to scoop it out and let the liquid drain a little before I put it on the quesadilla. I followed my normal quesadilla process and baked them in the oven. I added a thin layer of refried beans because I like them."
