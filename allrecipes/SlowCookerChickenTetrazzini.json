This was a major exception. Also, my mother was not free with compliments. That's why this recipe is going in our family favorites recipe book. Not only did she like it, she LOVED it and complimented me on it. The first time I made this, I made it exactly as written and it was great. Tonight I am going to make it with leftover Thanksgiving turkey. I will put the cooked turkey in a baking dish and cover with the sauce. It should come out perfectly after about 30 minutes at 350 degrees. After serving it over the pasta, you can sprinkle some grated cheddar on top! Yum!!"

Then I made a 1 lb box of penne pasta, drained it and threw that in the big skillet too. All in all it took me less than 30 minutes and it was so freaking delicious! Thank you!"

Cooked the mushrooms with the garlic and onions, added all the wet ingredients and added to the crockpot with one hour remaining. Added the frozen peas on top. I also cooked the chicken in chicken broth in the crockpot and not just melted butter. After it was done, I cooked spaghetti, mixed it all together and put it in a baking dish, covered with bread crumbs and melted butter and put in the oven for about 15 mins. Absolutely delicious!!"

"reviewBody": "Very good over rice as well. First, I added the chicken broth to boneless chicken thighs sprinkled with pepper. After 3 hrs. on low, I added the remaining ingredients (I was two ounces short of cream cheese) in addition to carrots, peas, and just a dash of cayenne pepper, for another 1 1/2 hrs. on low heat. Sirracha was served at the table to be added individually to taste (a few drops made this even better!). \nI typically don't rave about crock pot meals, but this was really very good! Thank you for the recipe! Everyone loved it!"

"reviewBody": "A very simple dish to put together with tender and creamy results. I didn't have the dry Italian dressing so I added oregano, basil, parsley, paprika, celery salt, herbs de provence, salt and pepper (probably a 1/3 teaspoon of each). I also added frozen peas for the last hour of cooking, then served over linguine. This one is a keeper. Update: This recipe is always in the rotation. I find I can put everything in at once, including raw onions, and even the cream cheese (or save until later if you prefer). I have added extra chicken broth when using this technique and cook on low for 5 - 6 hours. Sooo tender!"

Only four breasts because that's all I had. As such, I reduced the amount of dried Italian dressing stuff by about a third. I also topped with some fresh parsley and served over fettuccini noodles. The end result was perfect! My three friends and I all agreed that I needed to add this to my list of regulars."

I thought the Italian seasoning packet would add all the flavor necessary, but it isn't enough to stand up to the soup and cream cheese. This is an easy recipe that I intend on making again, but I will most definitely be tweaking the seasonings, in addition to adding a touch more salt. I did not find this recipe at all."

I didn't have a powered dressing packet, so I poured about a cup of italian dressing over the chicken, and threw in an entire stick of butter :-) Instead of putting it over pasta, I cut a spaghetti squash in half (length wise) and put the tetrazzini in the baked squash, sprinkled some cheese on top and baked it just long enough for the cheese to melt. DELICIOUS and very low carbs!! Actually the tetrazinni could be eaten as a soup by itself. It's a keeper!"

Set the crock to high, and after an hour, I added a chopped small sweet onion, the garlic, and here's where I sorta messed up: I added a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup, um, they are right next to each other in the cabinet...since I had a lot of chicken, I added a can of cream of chicken as well, figuring, well, I wonder how this will turn out...\n\nLet that cook on high for about four hours, then turned on low and added the cream cheese and started cooking the wide egg noodles.\n\nThe chicken was falling apart tender, the sauce was thick and tasty, I didn't soften the cream cheese enough as there were small chunks in the sauce and that was good thing - a really refreshing taste when you got a chunk in the sauce...\n\nA total keeper and one we will repeat!"

I used the ingredients as listed except that I used a whole, cut up chicken instead of all breasts because I needed to use it up from the freezer. The night before I mixed all ingredients except onion together in a mixing bowl. I cut up the onion and put it on top and then covered with saran wrap and left in the fridge until morning. In the morning, I skinned the chicken and put it in the crockpot first and covered with the ingredients from my bowl. Oh, I added fresh mushroom too. Turned it on low for 7 hours and went to work (mine has a timer and resets to warm when finished). I removed the chicken from the sauce and shredded with two forks (too hot to handle). With the chicken out, I mixed two tablespoons of corn starch with 2 tablespoons of water and added it to the sauce to let it thicken while I shredded the chicken and cooked the noodles. I served over home made Amish egg noodles (because I saw them in the store and know that I love them). DE-LISH."
