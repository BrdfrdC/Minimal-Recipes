Instead of freezing the dumplings, take a fresh roll of biscuits and put them on top of the soup and remake them. They come out mushy if you freeze them and put them back in."

I was off to a good start throwing in some healthy chicken breasts, but then once I felt like I was just adding a bunch of sodium with the Chicken soup and then the biscuits are pure indulgence. My husband stopped eating since it seemed so unhealthy. Mind you, I rarely cook, so to have him not finish his dinner was weird. I finished mine and ate more for lunch the next day, so it was tasty, but just don't expect to get in your skinny jeans or tell your doctor what you just had. Other than that, it was nice to have the house smelling yummy."

I fileted them to make 4 breasts. I added 3 chicken thighs,skinned removed. I think the thigh meat n bones add more flavor. Remove bones after it cooks a few hours. Add 22 oz cream chicken soup n about 3 cups chicken broth n one packet Lipton dry chicken soup n noodle mix. Season s,p, Italian seasoning, garlic, tarragon. Cook about 4 hours n shred chicken. Stir in 4T butter. Add baby carrots n corn. Make biscuits using Bisquick biscuit recipe on box. Add small teaspoons to crock pot. Cook abt another 2.5 hours on low. Gently cover dumplings with gravy a few times. I serve with egg noodles (can‚Äôt have enough carbs). Huge hit. Everyone loved it. Will only go crockpot version for now on."

"reviewBody": "This is a great base recipe so I'll give it four stars. You definitely need to add and adjust to fit your tastes. I made the following changes 1. Broth instead of water. Water is pointless. 2. Added vegetables: celery, carrots, chopped green beans 3. Used green onions instead of regular onions and only a small amount 4. Used chicken tenders and seasoned them with garlic salt, parsley, pepper, and oregano 5. Added three tablespoons of white wine Cooking: I can't leave chicken in my slow cooker for as long as recipes say to because it ends up overcooked and dry... I left the tenders in for about two and a half hours (still ended up being a little too long), then removed them and put them in the fridge. I let the vegetables cook for about half an hour longer then added the biscuits. Following the advice of another reviewer, I cut the biscuits in fourths. They ended up being way too soggy. I'll leave them whole next time. Once they cooked, I cut up the tenders and added them back in to warm up. Aside from the weird texture of the soggy biscuits, it turned out well. It could probably use something to thicken the liquid though."

I used a family size cream of chicken soup and 1 regular can of chicken broth. I add baby carrots at the beginning and I don't add onions (not everyone here likes them). 2 cans of biscuits is definitely too much but 1 can may not be enough, probably 1 1/2. I've tried this with the bisquick dumplings too, but I prefer the biscuits. I add the biscuits about 2 to 2 1/2 hours before it's done."

With the biscuit dough, I try to remember to put it in earlier than this calls for but one thing I sometimes do to help it along is to pull the \"crock\" out of the slow cooker base and pop it in the oven under the broiler for several minutes, in case that is helpful for anyone. It can actually brown the dough a little depending on how long you leave it so be aware if that would bother you. It doesn't bother us."

(I estimate 1.5 lbs of thighs = 4 breasts) No onion, broth instead of water, 1 can of biscuits. Added frozen corn and green beans just to do it. Liked that. \n\nI wondered about cutting the chicken up: before cooking? After? Well, it breaks into pieces all on it's own!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe clearly doesn't need more reviews but I thought it was worth chiming in anyway. \n\nI have seen many similar recipes and the criticism of the dumplings is valid. The texture and consistency doesn't work. However, the base of the recipe is just that, a base to be built upon. \n\nEdits, adds:\n\nSeason the chicken with salt and pepper. \n\nI added fresh celery and carrots. Used a giant sweet yellow onion over red. Red seems an odd choice to me. I also added dried thyme, oregano, even a dash of paprika. I added a lot of black pepper. Taste the sauce. It will tell you what to lean into. God help me, I added some salt. \n\nI stole the idea of baking in a pie crust. Knowing that the chicken would end up in a pie, I diced it before throwing it in the slow cooker. The pie crusts were two frozen Pillsbury deep dish crusts. Just before baking, I tossed in a bag of frozen peas. They don't need time in the cooker. Best part? On high, diced, this recipe in the slow cooker only took about 3 hours. Chicken was done, veggies tender."

This step was missed because I set out all my ingredients per the ingredients list and that is not on it. I add chicken stock instead of water usually and add some veggies such as carrots and corn. Definitely need to add more time for the biscuits to cook. Either split them or pull them apart into little dumplings. I also cut up the chicken. A little black pepper added but definitely do not add salt."

When it was time to shred the chicken, I removed it and thickened the sauce with a little slurry of flour and water, shredded the chicken and then returned it to the pot. Last, I rolled out the biscuits to about 1/8‚Äù thickness and cut them into strips with a pizza cutter. It took about 45 minutes for the dumplings to be completely cooked."
