One lb. of meat isn't enough, so I also used one lb. of ground sausage which made it more hearty &amp; added taste. I did not add celery, I added cumin, used fresh parsley &amp; basil instead of dried, and I drained all three cans of beans. Generally a nice taste but not a recipe I'll use again."

Also, I used two cans of low sodium diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce. I didn’t have cannalini beans, so added black beans. Thanks for sharing.

I made a few changes, I used ground turkey instead of hamburger, I used one can of tomato paste and one can of diced tomatoes instead of the 2 cans of puree and then instead of the cannalli beans I used light kidney beans.... I just made this and my family is already asking me when I am going to make it again"

If you make this exactly as called for, its way too bland. Don't be afraid to kick up the seasoning!"

I used one Vidalia onion and two small red onions, because I like the bite of a red onion. I sautéed the onions, celery and garlic for a few minutes, adding a splash of balsamic vinegar to caramelize a bit. Substituted red pepper for green, only because it’s what I had. Used two 28oz cans of San Marzano peeled tomatoes, pureed, with 1/2 tube paste. Added cumin and cayenne to taste (guessed). Even better than anticipated."

My family STILL suggested I throw in a cyan pepper next time."
