You can sub Apple or Grape or Blackberry). And then yellow mustard. 8 oz jar of jelly, 2 oz mustard. Dijon/Brown mustard doesn't work--use the yellow. Melt in a saucepan before pouring over the sausages. It's alot better tasting."

With the grape jelly and chili sauce or the grape jelly and bbq sauce. Concerning the bbq sauce though which kind Smokey or sweet? Or would cranberry jelly be better? Out of a can like for thanksgiving? I‚Äôm not sure but I do know I don‚Äôt want sweet I want savory but still good. Without a red sauce like ragu. Thx so much for your help."

I use the 8 oz. jar of grape jelly, and one bottle of Chili Sauce. Add about 1 cup of Sweet Baby Rays Sweet and Spicy BBQ sauce, and 2 Tbsp. of Jalapeno Salsa. It will cook up. Adjust the BBQ sauce if it needs a little more.\nIt all will make a difference, and everyone loves the way I make them."

I used Kraft Original barbeque sauce and Smucker's grape jam. Perfect!"
