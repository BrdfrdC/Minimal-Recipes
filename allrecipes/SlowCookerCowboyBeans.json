I made it for our potluck dinner for the first time and all that was left was a couple of cups. Everyone came to me to say they loved it. I did reduce the brown sugar, to 1/2 cup, and 1/4 would be just as good especially if your using canned beans such as Bush's or any that already contains brown sugar. Very good dish, highly recommended."

"reviewBody": "I have made it several times. The original recipe is good, but it's better with half a cup of brown sugar, only one onion, add 2 cloves of minced garlic, and swap out the lima beans for butter beans, which are fully ripened lima beans, and they are are more tender and better-tasting. Other worthwhile changes I have tried: using BBQ sauce instead of ketchup (cut the sugar to 1/4 cup if it's a sweet sauce), great northern beans instead of butter/lima beans (made it for a Vietnam Vet who refused to eat ANY form of lima bean XD ), adding Frank's Red Hot, and using baked beans instead of pork &amp; beans (again, reduce the sugar). I've also tried a variation which I baked it in a dutch oven, uncovered, in a 350F/177C oven for 30 minutes. This works well, although I recommend cooking the onion and garlic in with the hamburger and bacon until translucent. Can you tell I like Cowboy Beans?"

I cooked the onions in the pan with the hamburger until they were translucent and aromatic, I also used 3/8 lb of bacon(low salt)= 6 slices, because 1/2 lb was 8 slices and I ate 2 of them. I definitely will make this again."

The only changes I made were adding a jalapeno and half a red bell pepper and using slightly less sugar. It made a lot, which would be good for a crowd and really went well with my homemade cornbread. I wanted to use this recipe because it had lima beans, which my boyfriend really likes, but honestly, all the beans pretty much tasted the same with the sauce."

"reviewBody": "Followed the recipe as written ish. Great recipe, real comfort food. However after reading reviews I decided to cut sugar in half. It sounded like a lot of brown sugar for that amount of ingredients and collectively we all thought it was still a bit too sweet. Will certainly make again but next time I will start with a 1/4 cup and add if I need to. Truth be known I had it for breakfast the next morning. What was I suppose to do? It was just sitting in the crockpot calling my name!"

"reviewBody": "This was SO good! My 6 &amp; 8 year old gobbled it up! It's pretty forgiving as well...changed slightly for what I had on hand &amp; it still tasted great. I wasn't really sure if this was a side dish or a main dish but I served it with big fruit &amp; veggie smoothies &amp; called it dinner!\nMy modifications (so I remember later)...used a whole pound of bacon...chopped, cooked half way &amp; drained before adding hamburger, used a can of refried beans (no baked beans on hand) and a can of white kidney beans, reduced brown sugar to 1/3 cup packed, added 1 cup of water with a beef bouillon cube since I did this on the stove top not the crockpot, added a couple good splashes of apple cider vinegar and put a half onion in to simmer with it as opposed to chopped onion (kids don't care for chopped onions but enjoy the flavor). I let this simmer on the stove top for a couple of hours before serving &amp; it was perfect!\nWill definitely be making this again, thanks!!"

"reviewBody": "Made as is: This Hobo Beans model is sheer genius; the key is finding the right quality ingredient brands ( not necessarily the top dollar ones, either !! ) to make per directions---and it's not hard to do. First time, I was amazed at the balance to Tex-Mex and BBQ smokehouse flavor essences, something I really didn't expect. Kids love this dish served them in taco shell bowls, topped with shredded cheese ( cheddar or pepperjack ) and I've wowed guests, stuffing Hobo Beans in emptied green pepper shells and oven roasting them. This Hobo Beans model WILL inspire you to add personal artisan touches / tweaks--but you got to first make this by the book."

And again, their review is based on their changes. If, after making a recipe, I feel a need to make changes the next time, I will be respectful and keep my changes to myself and save only, with my changes. Just saying."

"reviewBody": "I have made this recipe for reunion, birthdays, holidays and graduations. When I ask what they want me to bring, they always ask for these beans. I usually make 8-10 times the recipe. I use 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white for once the recipe. I also add 1 Tbsp cider vinegar, and I use dried mustard. Some times I add the Tabasco. I never have any left overs. The vinegar, levels out the sweetness. Also if I can find them I like Bush's small butter beans, better than the large ones."

Cooked: 1/2 lbTurkey hamburger, 1 pkg-turkey Sausage sweet or turkey kelbsa. 1 small onion chopped. 5-10 slices ofTurkey bacon not cooked chopped add with 4 tblspn butter squares on top. No mustard, but added dashes of honey, ketchup and barbecue sauce to taste. Keep other ingredients not changed as listed above. Follow cooking of raw meat above, except bacon. Then combine everthing into large baking dish or casserole dish and Baked in oven 350 for 40-45 mins covered. Uncover last 10 mins to brown bacon on top.\n* you can omit honey if too sweet. Brown sugar is enough*"

"reviewBody": "Excellent beans but it makes a lot! I did change a couple of things but I think the original recipe would be delicious! I used a 28oz can of Bushes baked beans, 1 can of chili beans, and 1 can of navy beans. I did use the full cup of sugar and catsup. I sprinkled a good amount of dried onions instead of using diced. I also only used 1/2 lb ground beef and no bacon (trying to lower the calories). Let cook for about 4 hours on low, then 1 hour on high without the lid.. thickened right up."

"reviewBody": "This is a really good combination of beans, ground beef, and bacon, and the taste is similar to a traditional Calico Beans. I knew 1 cup of brown sugar would be way too sweet for our tastes, so I cut that in half, and we were happy with the level of sweetness. Enjoyed this with some mini jalapeño corn muffins. Thanks for sharing, this one's easy and gets a thumbs up in this house!"
