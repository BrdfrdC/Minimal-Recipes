"reviewBody": "Very tasty and gets better in fridge. Couldn't be easier to prepare. One major caveat: the recipe neglects seasoning. You gotta add some salt! (Or your family/guests/you will!) Another ththi to note: there will be a huge amount of chicken fat floating on top. Now rendered seasoned and flavored chicken fat is a mighty tasty thing, but most of us would probably prefer to dispense with most of it, so you will need to skim the fat on top, or, for preference, cool the cooked dish in the fridge, and then easily skim the fat on top when it is cool and congealed. Just sayin'...."

So, I cut the soy sauce and vinegar in half and found the sweet spot. Oh, it doesn't take FIVE hours to cook it either. I didn't try this recipe, because I knew how it would taste."

"reviewBody": "Great dish. Super simple and very flavorful. We do keto so we skipped the rice and added veggies. To the reviewer who said they made “NO” changes but then proceeded to use boneless skinless chicken thighs (which is, in fact, a CHANGE)..common sense would tell you that food with bone-in take longer to cook than boneless. Perhaps learn basic cooking skills before leaving senseless reviews."

"reviewBody": "Love how a reviewer emphatically says she made NO changes to the recipe then in the next sentence so she used boneless chicken. Right there is one change that could affect the cooking time that she complained about. People have to remember not all crockpots are created equal. Older ones take longer to cook. I think this recipe is just fine as written and in my crock pot 1 hour on High and 4 hours on low was sufficient."

Instead, I added sweet onion and served it over rice. Side dishes of broccoli and yellow squash with some of the adobo sauce. I can imagine lots of otherway to use this recipe as a foundation, much like a good basic chicken curry recipe lends itself to almost endless improvisation."
