"reviewBody": "We loved it but I did tweak it a little to our liking and based on other’s suggestions. Added half a left over smoked sausage used in another dish to the bacon. Added 1/2 tsp Old Bay seasoning and subbed half and half for the evaporated milk. Agreed with one reviewer still more like a soup but we felt it was plenty rich with the half and half, bacon and smoked sausage. Great way to use up seafood that has been in the freezer a while! It was not too expensive for us as my husband had either caught the fish himself or we bought it cheap while in Florida and brought it back home in the cooler. It does make a lot and could feed a crowd. Ate it with a crusty French bread perfect for dipping into soup."

DON'T cut out the bacon even if you're not a bacon lover... it's adds a smokey-smoothness that really makes the flavor tremendous.\n\nOne word of advice.. unless our cooker isn't as warm as it should be or the seal isn't great (probable)... the potatoes aren't ready after 4 hours... we use 5 as a guideline."

I did add some Old Bay seasoning as well. The flavor was great although as some of the reviews said it was a little on the runny side and not as thick as I wanted it. I added a little cornstarch mixture as well to thicken it up. My suggestion would just be to make a rue with the onions and garlic before the stock was added and that would help to thicken it. Overall the taste was great and we ate it with some french bread. Just what I was looking for!"

Like other reviewers, I added some Old Bay Seasoning and some cornstarch to thicken the broth. If I had the time, I would have mashed or pureed some of the potatoes to thicken the broth. I plan to add an extra potato next time I make this. Thank you for the recipe."

I was generous with the red pepper flakes and the black pepper and it was only a little spicy, but certainly had more flavor. If you like spice then add twice or three times the red pepper. Perhaps a diced jalapeno or two. I like the idea of old bay and may use that next time.\nIf you want more of a thick stew or chowder then either add pureed potatoes back into the stock after cooking or perhaps less stock to begin with."

Taking some of the suggestions into account by adding Old Bay, and by changing the type of fish to cod we enjoyed the recipe. With changes - we give this 4 of 5 stars. This recipe can be changed to match your taste and budget preferences."

I made a rue with butter/flour before adding the white wine/chicken broth etc. I did add some sliced Andouille Sausage from Costco and some small steamer clams (after cleaned with corn meal) Instead of canned milk used a little cream instead. Served it with multi-grain Artisan bread and white wine out on the our deck. Was like being at a 5 star restaurant for everyone. Thanks, I will do again this summer for others."

Even with seasoning, all my family could taste was the overwhelming pungency of fish. The excessive amount of stock called for makes this a thin soup. I like my chowders thick. This wasn't worth it."

In an attempt to balance between healthy and creamy, we added some half &amp; half/heavy cream, but kept it mostly evaporated milk. It's definitely more liquid than chowder, but worth it for the reduced calories, in my opinion.\n\nWe also went heavy on the Old Bay. It definitely helps the flavor along... and there's a lot of it. It's the kind of soup you use up your french bread on and STILL tip the rest of the broth into your mouth at the end of it. Highly recommend."

I used only a pinch of black pepper and red pepper. I wanted something smooth and mild. This was a good choice for dinner after a long day. I put the vegetables in the crock pot the night before. The kids added the broth and corn when they got home from school. I added the milk, ham and seafood when I got home. It took all of two seconds, so I had an hour to rest after work instead of cooking. I look forward to making this again."
