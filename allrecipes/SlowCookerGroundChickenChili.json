"reviewBody": "Good recipe that I tweaked..sauteed onions and garlic, added corn &amp; its liquid, added some canned Adobe chipotles in sauce, just chopped them up and finally just added some spoonfuls of herbed cream cheese, not mixed in but left on top. Cooked for 8 hours in slow cooker, then gave it a good stir before serving..even my fussy husband who isn’t a fan of ground chicken liked this. I’ll make it again."

However, my husband added the red pepper and the chopped jalapeño to his bowls. I put two large chicken breasts in the bottom of the slow cooker and shredded them as was suggested. This was a delicious chicken chili that I will definitely make again."
