I was super worried that it wouldn't turn out very good as this was the first ham I'd ever made myself. \nMy coworkers LOVED it!\nThe flavor was wonderful and they especially loved how it just fell apart like pulled pork. It is perfect for sandwiches and my boss ended up using a couple of rolls to make one. \nI just used a 7.5 pound smoked, bone-in ham and cooked it for the full 8 hours. It was very tender and juicy.\nDefinitely recommend this recipe as it is written!!"

Just cover tightly with heavy duty aluminum foil and it works great. Do not remove foil just pop a thermometer through the foil for temperature. Put the large flat carving part of the ham face down in the crock-pot. It also frees up your oven for other cooking. Simple slam dunk recipe for a beautiful juicy ham dinner."

I'll be making this more often since it's so easy. We had an 8lb Farmer John bone in ham ($10 sale) on low for 6 hours. We did baste it with it's own juices every hour, but that's optional, we were paranoid and decided to go a little extra to make sure it was yummy."

"reviewBody": "This is the 4th time I have made a ham this way so I can say, with confidence, that the results are superbly tender and tasty....perhaps the best ham I have ever had. one small caution: Don't cook TOO long. 8 hours on low is quite long enough for a 9 or 10 lb smoked, uncut butt portion, or maybe even 6 or 7 hours. Longer hours result in a darker, drier meat that shreds too easily and is still tasty but less succulent. My best results for the same sized ham were achieved with 2 hours on High + 2 hours on Low OR 6 hours on low. This makes such a great and easy meal. Sliced leftovers freeze well, too!"

I have also mixed a few squirts of Dijon mustard and a can of whole jellied cranberries with the brown sugar that is added on top to jazz it up. It was good both times. This is a good, easy Sunday ham to prepare. This last time I cooked it on high 2 hours and low 1 hour. I switched it to low just when I put my cheesy potatoes in the oven and the timing was perfect. This was delicious with steamed carrots and green beans, and the cheesy potatoes. This is my go-to method for preparing an inexpensive ($8) bone-in shank cut ham that Aldi carries during the colder season."

I had already bought my smoked, spiral sliced ham before I read all of the recommendations to NOT use this type of ham!! It actually turned out fine. I had a 9 lb ham -- next time I will get an 8 lb ham -- because it just barely fit in the crockpot. I did use the advice of others who said that the lid didn't fit on theirs as well so they wrapped aluminum foil around the top and sides. I did this and it seemed to work fine. I also cut the total time -- I cooked it on low for 4 hours. I didn't baste it b/c I was too lazy to undo the foil!! But the ham turned out juicy and hot and everybody loved it!! I will definitely use this recipe again but my changes will be: slightly smaller ham and cook on low for 3 hours instead of 4."
