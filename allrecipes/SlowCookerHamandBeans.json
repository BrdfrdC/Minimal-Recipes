My wife and it fiddled with adding a little bit of apple cider vinegar in a bowlful. It helped a little. Then we tried adding a little bacon grease at a time in the bowl we sampled, but to little avail. For us, the recipe is a bust."

My boys are coming over for dinner tonight and have no idea how this is going to turn out."

I heeded all the advice to cut the brown sugar, then kept adding more till I suspect I put in about the amount in the recipe . I guess I like sweeter beans than most here! I also used broth rather than water and upped the amount of cayenne a little, but that’s just a personal preference thing. Thanks for a really tasty recipe!"

I omit the brown sugar because my hubbie is diabetic but I also didn't think we needed the sweetness when I like main dishes more savory. I like to use ham shanks for the extra meat but if unavailable then I use ham hocks for flavor and cutup ham pieces for the meat. The little bit of nip from the cayenne pepper is just perfect and not overdone. When my Mom, who is a country bumpkin, says that they were the best ham and beans she has had, then that is something to say."

I also used the ham bone from my leftover Thanksgiving ham and the cubed meat that was left on the bone.. all in all about a pound of ham or more. I also substituted pinto beans for great northern beans. I am very happy with the way this turned out and will definitely make this again when I have leftover ham!"

We don't like spicy food so I left out the cayenne, which definitely left a more sweet flavor - not overwhelming but I will cut down on the sugar a little next time.. I simply put everything together with about 2 cups of water and let it simmer for about an hour, then used an immersion blender to make it creamier. Will definitely make it again, and with a little less sugar I'm sure it will be 5 stars."

I wanted to have it slightly thickened, so when it was done cooking I grabbed a couple ladles of the beans and broth portion and pureed them in the blender. I stirred it back in with the beans and it was perfect! Both teenage kids loved it. My husband, who really can't stand beans or bean soups told me this needs to go into our cold-months dinner rotation. I was hesitant to make it at first because of some reviews calling it too sweet. It had a hint of sweetness, but wasn't overly so at all. I made it a week and a half ago, and am soaking beans right now to prepare it for dinner tomorrow night. Thanks for an amazing recipe!"

I used an Onion Soup mix packet for the Onion powder, it worked. Subbed minced garlic for the garlic salt. Figured it had enough salt from the onion soup mix. Finally after hearing here about it being too sweet, I cut the sugar in half. The ham bone + Ham was from a frozen spiral cut where I saved the bone at Thanksgiving. All these minor tweaks came together very nicely."

I didn't think my family would enjoy the sugar, as we have always eaten savory ham and beans, so I soaked my beans overnight, drained and rinsed, and added to the slow cooker the next day with a diced onion, one smoked ham hock, 3 minced garlic cloves, salt, white pepper, two chicken bullion cubes and added water two inches above the beans as instructed. The only issue I had was after 9 hours of cook time, I had an incredible amount of liquid! Our personal preference is for a thicker, stew-like consistency, so I will cut back on the water next time. Other than that, FABULOUS recipe! By doing in the slow cooker, I can serve this on a weeknight. Thank you for sharing!"

Add beans.(honestly give or take on those spices...I'm not good at measuring. I used a TB and dumped spices in using it). Ham hock. Cooked from 6:00am-4:30pm. Mashed just a bit before serving, not all of them just a couple mashes to thicken the broth. Cooked up about 8 strips of bacon and added just before serving. Family said it was the best I'd ever made! Hope these changes help others."

I make it once a week or every other week in the winter."

I cut back on the brown sugar since I already had the honey glaze going on. I will probably cut it in half the next time I make it. Started with about 2 cups of chicken stock for the liquid and then added water on top of that. Also added a cup of freshly diced onions. Great recipe!"

They trim the spiral sliced meat off the bones for sandwiches and to sell in smaller quantities than a whole ham. There is still a large amount of ham on the bone that didn't get used for those purposes: perfect for a batch of beans or pea soup.\n\nI live alone and this recipe is perfect for portioning into zip freezer bags for a quick warm-me-up in the winter. Awesome with PBJ sandwiches."

I used a leftover ham bone that still had lots of ham and was particularly tasty in this dish and I cooked it in the slow cooker for 8 hours which was probably at least an hour too long (but still great.) I did not add the sugar because I already know we don't like sweet Northern beans and I added a bay leaf which I think really added to the taste. I probably added more garlic than the recipe called for. You can definitely taste that small amount of cayenne pepper. We loved this dish but I think the quality of the hame bone/meat may be key to making this a great one...ours was great! Thank you!"

After slow cooking all day, any remaining meat simply melts right off the bone. Secondly, yes... It was a little sweet, but not crazy sweet, and sweetness was nicely balanced by the cayenne pepper.\nI made this with a few modifications: I used sautéed onions instead of onion powder, and garlic powder + salt instead of garlic salt, added one generous tsp of dried rosemary instead of parsley, and fortified liquid by including some vegetable stock. I thought the results were outstanding!\nThe next time I make this I would reduce sugar to 1/3 C, sauté celery with onions and add a few chopped carrots halfway through the cooking time.\nThis one is a keeper!"

My wife had bought some ground ham in the deli, so I used a 1/2 Lbs. of that. I had a bag of 15 beans and soaked them overnight (did NOT use the flavor packet with it). I started with a 28oz can of diced tomatoes, 1 chopped medium onion, about a half cup each of chopped green and red pepper (frozen from bags in the freezer), 2 tsp. crushed jar garlic, brown sugar &amp; spices as indicated. Added the beans &amp; homemade chicken stock instead of water I had on hand.\n\nAbout 6 hours in, chopped 1 Lbs. of turkey kielbasa in half moons (less five inches that I grilled and put on a hotdog bun for lunch)&amp; added it to crockpot.\n\n11 hours in it was still to soupy for my taste. I skimmed out about 1 cup of liquid, cool it in fridge, then whisked in about 4 TBL of flour to the cool liquid. Added mixture back to crockpot to thicken to light gravy type texture. Everyone loved it - a keeper!"

Probably only got a little over a pound once I cut out the \"grissly\" parts, but just 1/2 pound definitely would not have been enough ham for a full pound of beans! I liked this well enough and wouldn't say I was disappointed with the outcome, but probably will try a different recipe next time!"

I prefer bacon for the flavoring, I cooked (5) bacon pieces and used the remaining grease to saute 1 small onion, in lieu of onion powder. I added the bacon and sauteed onion (grease included). Additionally, white pepper is a nice compliment to the northern bean. While maybe not heart healthy--Southern at heart, it was absolutely delicious!"

First of all, I kinda doubt the person actually made this recipe who thought the b.sugar and cayenne pepper was a terrible idea. Secondly, if you think about this recipe truly it is an awesome base. I have made many of bean soups. My husband said this one was one of my better soups, and he loves my cooking. I used an onion instead of onion powder. This was all I did to the \"base\"recipe yet I know what I love in a bean recipe. I added celery. with about an hour to cook I added on can kernel corn and 1 can stewed tomatoes. Served with buttermilk biscuits. Remember the sugar does change the flavor and it for the better... it give it a rich deep flavor. Not too sweet at all. Then of course I added other veggies. Thank you for this great \"base\" recipe and if I wanted a thick bean and ham... I would leave it alone and add a lot less water."

Followed recipe as directed except I cut the cayenne pepper in half, and I used 15 Bean Soup, since that is all I had on hand. At first I followed other reviews by cutting the brown sugar in half, but when I tasted the beans at the end, I ended up adding more brown sugar - which totalled to the recommended amount. I also used 2 cans Chicken Broth and then filled the rest of the way with water to cover the beans, and I think that helped with flavoring. I also used a tip that I read on another ham and bean recipe....\" Add a pinch (maybe 1/2 tsp) of baking soda - makes the beans creamy and much less gassy\". \nI loved that I could throw it in the crockpot and it was ready when I got home.

He doesn't care for beans anyways, so my plan was to eat this for the next few day's lunches. I'm sad to say that I'm not going to.... This is SUPER bland! Now, I'll admit, I snubbed my nose at ham and beans as a child (my mom LOOOVED them and fixed them often for her and my father), but I am happy to report, I have made it past my childhood aversion. Unfortunately, this recipe failed to convince me how good ham and beans can be. :( Tonight's meal ended up consisting primarily \r\nof cornbread and a half bowl of beans I was able to choke down.
