It's not the recipe's fault. Certain ingredients stop the beans from cooking and they will always be hard. Some beans are old and take 3 hours to get tender, fresh beans maybe take and hour. Test a bean or two first. Always pour off the first batch of cooking water,(supposed to get rid of some of the gas) Not my fav recipe but it is good."

I wasn't gong to give up what I had started (after I heard that the beans were old via a website). I added about 2 cups of water and what a change the beans had. Nice and soft just what you want. It seems the answer is more water. \n\"How can you tell if dried beans are old\" I have no idea.\nps: a bought a smoked jowl instead of bacon. Same taste 1/4 of the price of bacon."

Cooked exactly as the recipe states, you end up with too firm a bean and, although the recipe pictures look very saucy, it has so little sauce compared to bean that it was somewhat dry for those eating it. Perhaps soaking them overnight instead of boiling the beans would have made a difference in texture but, short of doubling the sauce, this remains a thin and scarce sauce."

In the morning, check to make sure the beans are done (squash a bean between your fingers). Then I drain &amp; reserve the liquid. Smash some of the beans with a masher and add all the other ingredients. Go easy on the salt and sugar. I fry some bacon, drain it and saute the onion in the grease, then add to the beans. I like prepared mustard instead of powdered. Use the reserved liquid instead of plain water, but don't overdo it. Check for thickness. Also, I prefer tomato paste and just a dash of ketchup. Cook on low several hours, check for water and leave the lid ajar a little to thicken. Yummy !"

I wouldn't recommend this recipe. It's like a bad joke to cook something for hours that smells good only to find out that the texture is terrible."

There is enough in the bacon and it can make the skins tough and not cook thoroughly. I also cook for an hour on high before turning it to low. It never fails. It can take 9 hours, but is SO worth it! Also, I use a whole pound of bacon. It's a preference for my family, but does make a difference. Love, love, love!!!"

Cooked in the slow cooker on low for 10 hours and the beans just melted in the mouth. This is a great base recipe that you can endlessly tinker with and add all sorts of flavours."

When the skins burst in the air, I placed them in the slow cooker with the sauce recipe. When done after 8 hours of cooking, they were still a little crunchy, but the sauce recipe is terrific! It is similar to my Dad's beans, baked in a brown pot, but can serve a crowd. I am going to cook the soaked beans half at a time so they are softer next time."

No one in my family liked it. The beans were mostly done but there were still a few crunchy ones. This was plenty sweet but the flavor just wasn't for us. It was a waste of food and time. Just a side note, I have read a lot of other baked bean recipes and some of them say to make sure you don't use black strap molasses because of it being too bitter. I didn't have that kind so I didn't use it in this recipe but wanted to pass along the tip in case others like me are trying to find a perfect recipe for them."

Made it too soupy, but it tastes wonderful. I slightly thickened the sauce. Since I was making them for Easter dinner, I added ham chunks."

I should have know to boil them before putting them in the slow cooker but it's been awhile since I cooked beans and I don't do it often enough. \nIn addition, I thought it was a little unusual to add so much ketchup to a baked bean recipe but I did and I WILL NEVER ADD KETCHUP to baked beans again. Maybe if you want a barbecue type taste but NOT for a Boston Baked Bean type of dish. I cooked it per the recipe, put the beans in refrigeration overnight before even using them and then heated them up the next morning. I disliked it so much that I through out the whole pot of beans."

WAY too much ketchup! I added more brown sugar to try to counteract the tomato taste but it didn’t really help. Now I’m stuck with a huge container of ketchup baked beans.\nI’ll be asking my mother in law for her delicious recipe to use from now on."

The only changes I made to the recipe were reducing the brown sugar by half, and adding a small can of stewed tomatoes which I had puréed. They were really tasty and good for a group - I made the recipe for a group of 10 and had some left overs. Caution with cooking time: I started on \"High\" and had to stop the cooking time to keep beans from getting mushy. Will cook longer on \"Low\" next time. I think this recipe has more nutrition in it than the recipes that call for tinned beans. Thanks for the recipe."

My beans stayed hard after many many hours on the crock pot. Now I've learned that salt and acid in tomato based sauces (like ketchup) cause the beans to stay hard. Then I read some of the reviews and found that others had the same problem even though they gave this recipe 5 stars. It doesn't matter how good the flavor is if the texture is terrible. This was the top recipe that came up on my Google search, but the instructions need fixing so that more people don't end up with crunchy beans."

So as previous reviewers commented, I soaked the beans over night (12 hours) and then boiled them for an hour in water without salt. This definitely helped soften them. I don't like beans too sweet so used half the brown sugar, and also halved the ketchup with tomatoe puree. If you do this, you may want to add about a quarter cup of more liquid (going to try burbon next time for kicks). These were going with smoked ribs, so I was lucky and had some homemade smoked bacon in the fridge to use to give it more the BBQ taste. Next time if I just have regular bacon, I might add a tablespoon of liquid smoke for the outdoors taste. But that is just a preference. I also fried the bacon with the onions so that I could remove some of the grease before adding it to the pot for the full cooking time. These are just some personal preferences. This recipe is bang on and can easily be added to depending on your tastes and eaters. Excellent base recipe. Thanks for sharing."
