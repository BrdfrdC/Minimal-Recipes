I also used brown rice, so it had to cook longer. The spice was nice. I will cook the rice separately in the future. I only gave four stars because I did have to adjust and without the spicy sausage and fire-roasted tomatoes it would have been a bit bland."

I cooked the rice separately, rather than in the crock pot. Had home made seitan on hand which held up fine after four hours in the crock pot. Easy recipe and easy to customize to your own preferences."

I added the dry rice with two cups broth because it looked like the rice would use up all the juices if not. Otherwise everything was the same. It was fabulous. My husband and I ate the whole recipe as our dinner! Thanks for the recipe!"
