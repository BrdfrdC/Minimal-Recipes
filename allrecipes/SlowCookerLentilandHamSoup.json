The spices overwhelmed this dish, the fact that salt wasn't listed should have been another red flag. Good base but next time will omit the 3 strong italian spices and try just used what my gut was telling me cajun spice instead. 11 hrs on low didn't cut it for french green lentils, 5 hrs on high did though."

"reviewBody": "This soup is very good. I made it mostly as is but just half of the recipe. I also cooked this on the stove for about 45-50 minutes at a low simmer after boiling all for about 5 minutes. The reason for my 4 stars is because I truly believe the soup needs a bit more tomato whether it is in sauce form or with actual crushed or diced tomatoes. Tomato gives it color and more flavor. It was looking too pale and unappealing with the amount of tomato sauce the recipe calls for. Also, if you wish I highly recommend using actual crushed tomatoes for a bit creamier than brothy result. Will make it again with my tomato suggestions."

I added a teaspoon of salt and an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce for the 8 teaspoons called for (odd amount, in my opinion). \nAfter reading many comments, I decided to cook on high for four hours, and will probably give it a stir midway. Looking forward to eating this! I like to add some shredded cheese and possibly some hot sauce for my serving."

I also thought 11 hours was a bit long since lentils don't need a lot of cooking time. I cooked for about 9 hours and the thickness was just fine. Maybe a little soy sauce or balsamic would kick the flavor up a notch."

That still didn't add enough flavor for me so I added a bit of Lipton Garlic Herb soup mix that I had on hand and that added enough flavor to satisfy me."

Light meal. ***10 HOURS on low***no liquid left, flavorful but closer to a mashed potatoe ordeal. Heavy meal. ***VERDICT*** would do it for 4 hours on high next time. As it makes for a lighter meal and yields more."

I added in a can of crushed tomatoes with garlic, basil, and oregano already added in instead of tomato sauce because I wanted to bulk it up. I also used all chicken broth and no water. I think the next time I make this I will use the water and remember the carrots. Overall I'm pretty satisfied with this recipe. I ended up cooking it for the whole 11 hours because we had a situation come up and weren't able to eat until late. \n\nUpdate: As I'm typing this, my husband tells me it's really good and he really likes it! I have NEVER heard him say that about any soup!! So I guess I'll make it again the same exact way with all chicken broth but I am on the fence about the carrots now.... And so with that update, I bump the rating from like it, to love it. Because for a soup to get a compliment from.my husband is a BIG deal!!"

The Ro-tel tomatoes might be too spicy when cooked for a long time!"

Rather than chicken broth, I used powdered bouillon . I also used the diced tomatoes recommended. The morning of, it took about 2 minutes to layer the ham, veggies, lentils, spices, and cover pour about 4 cups of water over it. I also omitted the smoke flavoring and used Bragg's amino acid flavoring in place of the Worcestershire sauce. My daughter who is not a 'soup person' enjoyed it. There are left overs for two to three more meals, so it is cost effective. Definitely a hit served with cornbread:)"

"reviewBody": "This recipe was super easy to make and I think will reheat well. I'm so used to cooking vegetarian soups that often need extra flavor, so I used 5 cups broth instead of 4 cups broth and one cup water which was a mistake, it was too salty. Might do 3.5 cups broth and 1.5 cups water next time. Otherwise no changes for next time. \n\nOh, I didn't have tomato sauce but I had paste, so I did 6 tsp paste instead of 8 tsp sauce and that worked out fine.\n\nUPDATE: Made a second time with 4 cups broth, only had 1 c of ham so added extra veggies. Was done cooking after 4 hr on low, at 11 hr this soup would be mush. Highly recommend!"

"reviewBody": "Surprisingly, really good! I'm generally not much of a bean soup-type girl. Lentils gave the soup thickness but not so much of the soft grit-like thickness that I don't really like from most if not all bean soups (Lentil first timer here). I'll start by saying that I only had half the amount of broth available, so I halved everything else. GREAT flavor, I did include chopped up tomato (on top of tomato sauce - needed to get rid of it), and probably at least 3x ham the recipe called for (post-thanksgiving leftovers, reason for recipe search..and I STILL have ham leftovers to use!! lol), and about 1Tbsp of of pepper flakes to give it a good kick. I only let it cook for maybe 6 hours because I fell asleep and got paranoid leaving it to cook on the stove all night without monitoring. Started around 8pm, woke up around 1am, stirred and shut off...10am nice a thickened up soup..YUMMY! So, I just let residual heat continue heating as much as it could before it started cooling down. By am it was pretty much room temp, so I just zapped a bowl in the microwave - I wasn't cooking for anyone so it was perfect for me. Maybe plan accordingly (start in the am) if you're able to monitor throughout until it's ready for supper after 11 hours, but I thought it was pretty good how I did it, and saved on energy bill, lol."

I added olive oil to the bottom the the pot and simmered the veggies garlic and spices together. Then I added the ham, stock, water, and tomato sauce. I put a whole 8oz can in the soup. I simmered everything together for about 45min until the lentils were cooked through. It came out delish!! So happy with this and I will definitely be making this again."
