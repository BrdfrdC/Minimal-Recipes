I carefully weighed out 4 lb of potatoes and cubed them. Yes, they fit in the slow cooker, but there wasn't enough space to stir any of the remaining ingredients into the potatoes. I ended up using two slow cookers.\n\nSecond, next time I will DOUBLE or maybe even TRIPLE the amount of chicken stock. My soup ended up so thick I can eat it with a fork.\n\nI made the recipe exactly as written."

Next time I think I will add some of the bacon grease to the butter when mixing in the flour, and maybe adding paprika for more taste. Delicious with chives, sour cream (or yogurt), additional cheese and oyster crackers on top!"

The ingredients called for garlic powder, but nothing more mentioned of it in instructions. I opted to add during the second stage, when adding adding the bacon and cheese to the mashed potatoes. Will definitely be making again."
