Used a full can of evaporated milk and half of the suggested milk (used skim milk). Grated medium cheddar but only used half the amount called for. Added onion powder and paprika. I also cooked n high for an hour then lowered to low but if I had precooked the pasta could have used the low setting which would have been a lot better. Grandkids ate it anyway but will turn out a lot better with these adjustments."

It was just about the only thing at those potlucks that had absolutely no leftovers at all at the end (the sides of the slow cooker had been scraped thoroughly!) and I've always been asked for the recipe by at least one or two people afterwards.\n\nI've also made it at home and tried a few variations such as adding pieces of bacon/ham, varying the cheese mixture with some aged cheddar and parmesan, and putting a crust of breadcrumbs on top (to crisp them I put the slow cooker pot under the broiler for a couple of minutes), all of which were good I admit, but the basic recipe is a winner in my books."

I doubled the recipe for a sports event, left out the canned soup, used a 12 oz can of evaporated milk and four 8oz packages of shredded 'mac and cheese' blend cheese that our supermarket carries (shredded cheddar, swiss, and american together). I added garlic paste for some zing, and added half of the cheese towards the end. It was super, and the little bit left over was even better the next day."

"reviewBody": "Made this(1.5x portion‚Äîso 24oz of pasta) for a Thanksgiving work potluck and I‚Äôm surprised at how well this turned out considering how easy it was!! Followed the advice from other comments and did not cook the pasta beforehand(added 10oz of water to the Crockpot), rubbed the pot with the butter but did not melt it, and put in a half of the cheese at the start and the rest in the last hour. Used a mix of about 25% pepper jack and 75% medium cheddar, though next time I might use more pepper jack. Because some of my coworkers don‚Äôt eat eggs, I did not include them. Seemed almost a little too liquidy, but ended up being perfect. Make sure to watch this closely as the timing will depend on your slow cooker‚ÄîI was strapped for time so I raised it to high for 45 minutes. This was a huge hit! Making again for my family‚Äôs Thanksgiving celebration."

I buttered the dish and then added a few pats of butter on top. The only reason I give it 4stars instead of 5 is because the 2 times I've made it, it has this weird sweetness to it... it's still a delicious recipe, just wish I could figure out how to cut out that sweet taste."

The noodles got gummy and clumped together, I tried to add milk but it took away from the cheese flavor. Needless to say the girls finished the double batch.

Being a big fan of the carmelized onion and bacon mac' n cheese recipe. I added the mustard and spices to the egg mixture and then again to the milk and soup mixture. Instead of straight cheddar, half was shredded muenster (buttery goodness). Carmelized onions and garlic during the butter and noodle step and at the end adding the milk soup mixture and cheese ... added more dry mustard, paprika, salt n pepper and red pepper flakes with about 3 tablespoons of bacon drippings (from bacon baked in oven for toppings during serving) ; stirred until combined. After cooking 1-1/2 hours ... added more muenster and cheddar for last 30-45 minutes or until done.\nFor my first attempt to ever cook the \"sanctified man 'n cheese\" in a crock pot ... not too bad of a turn out. It still needed more seasoning (Paprika, salt and black pepper) and perhaps a sharper cheddar and/or Asiago . All in all though not bad for a crock pot version of the oven baked classic. The oven melts the cheeses better and makes it creamier than this turned out (maybe a cup of Velveeta to help with the creaminess it was missing). It was good, needs some more tweeks for our family, but we will make again."
