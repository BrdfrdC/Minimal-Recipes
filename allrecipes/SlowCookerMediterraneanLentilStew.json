I did add a little bit of ham flavoring to it, because I love that flavor combo. Served it to guests on a spontaneous ‚Äúsoup night‚Äù (after the famous three days of no power in Texas!), it hit the spot. I‚Äôm not a fan of strong flavors, I used the spices exactly as written, and the amount of spice was just right -a good combination. I‚Äôm excited to have another use for lentils and will definitely make this again!"

"reviewBody": "Not a huge lentil fan but I thought this recipe was great! I was shocked that I had every single ingredient on hand (not normally the case). I read all the reviews since there weren't that many. I agree that it needs more liquid so I started w/6 C. water. Ended up adding 2 more cups over the cooking time so I would say this stew/soup needs 8 C. water. I used Better Than Bouillon Veggie Base and I probably went a little overboard on that but it was still good. I'm not a vegetarian so I might try chicken or beef broth next time. Might back off a little on the cumin and experiment with other spices. To the reviewers who say their lentils were still crunchy...did you cook it on high? Mine came out perfect &amp; by the way mine looked exactly like the picture ?? Very hearty soup and will def make it again!"

Threw it all in the pressure cooker with a package of frozen carrots. Pressure cooked on high for 45 minutes. Thickened up more than expected, but the water added after cooking brought it back to a good consistency. It was delicious."

"reviewBody": "OK - have to admit that I never cooked with lentils before. That said - since this recipe did not mention it I ignored the advice on the bag to pre-soak the beans. Bad move. I followed the recipe exactly (as I always do the first time, unlike a lot of fellow readers) and it was pretty raw even after cooking for over 4 hours. Added a full cup more of broth as well as some more seasoning and quite a bit more salt and pepper. Again - quite a bit more salt and pepper. The recipe is pretty liberal with the cumin and coriander but doesn't think much salt or pepper is needed. I am not a big salt lover and rarely over use it but in this case I needed some more than was called for.\n\nAnyway - the next day with the added ingredients and a couple more hours on low the dish started to take shape. I liked it and will make it again with the added liquid and more attention to the beans."

It was still too pasty for me and I ended up adding a 2nd cup of water/vegetable broth mixture. I now had the consistency I was wanting. However it still lacked in something for me. I will be upfront and say not a vegetarian, but I do enjoy vegetarian dishes at times. This however did not cut it for me. I am going to add some grilled chicken to it to finish off the rest."

Added quite a bit of freshly-ground black pepper and a little more tomato paste, otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter. Very nice stew."
