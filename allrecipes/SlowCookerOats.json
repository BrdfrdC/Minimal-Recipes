I add 3 or 4 apples or pears. Use a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon. Tastes great with lots of fresh berries added while the oatmeal is hot. I make a whole batch of this oatmeal and then refrigerate it. Every morning I take out a bowlful, microwave to heat it up and then top it with plain Greek yogurt and pecans. Delicious."

Such as: water only, or half milk/half water, all milk... added nuts, sometimes no raisins, sometimes on low and others on the warm setting. I’d say my fave is half/half milk/water, no raisins or nuts, and low setting. The nuts and raisins get too mushy, would rather add at the end. The butter is a MUST in my opinion, makes it super creamy! I love adding a little heavy cream to my personal bowl when serving—yum!"

Also if you don’t want to use butter I use 2 cups regular coconut milk (more watery type) and 1-1/2 cups water gonna try just 1 cup coconut milk next time but the 2 is really good. I normally cook it for 6 hours with timer over night and get minimal side wall stick. I do 2 apples Fungi (sweetest) and skip the raisins grade apples first before adding anything."

I'm making it again and will try that, I'm sure it'll work great! I also think I will try increasing the water to 4 cups.\nI used dates, walnuts and apples in this - dates are amazing in this recipe!"

I pretty much fed my kids flourless and eggless cookies for breakfast and was ok with it. Chocolate chips would probably taste good but then it would definitely be a dessert.\n\nWhen reheating, add milk for a creamier and healthier option. You need to break it up a bit or it has a bread-like texture."

After looking at other similar recipes, I believe the liquid amount is way off - should have added at least another 1.5 cups. I also cut back on the cinnamon as it just seemed like way too much. I did not add the apples but added twice the raisins. It was edible but just. This recipe really needs doctoring in my opinion."

Also, the recipe does not call for the addition of salt, and we all know oats are a bit flat without it, so I highly recommend adding it! My husband doesn’t like raisins, so I left them out. The sweetness they would have provided could be compensated with a little additional brown sugar."

My 7 yo and 9 yo grandsons helped themselves (with supervision) to three large bowls Christmas morning BEFORE opening gifts. \n\nI lined my crockpot with a bag to save on the mess. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and half unflavored almond milk and half water. I made a recipe and a half because I wanted to have enough for the four adults, too. I will definitely make this my go-to oatmeal recipe."

I set my crockpot to WARM (not low) for about 6.5 hours. The result was perfect. I added brown sugar, walnuts, milk, and some blueberries to the finished product. YUM!"

"reviewBody": "Good recipe but instead of steel cut, I recommend using stone ground oats (sometimes called Scottish style) and cut the cooking time in half since ground whole oats are in smaller pieces than steel cut. I did reduce the raisins which I thought would predominate too much. I saw someone post that they normally cook oats in 5 minutes which means they don't usually use steel cut oats. You cannot use 'rolled oats' (which are actually pre-cooked) in this recipe. They will not"

I was afraid it would be waaay too cinnamon-y judging by how dark brown it became, but I think it was just right. This was also my first experience with steel-cut oats so I wasn't sure what to expect, but again, very yummy after 5 hours in the slow cooker. Next time I think I will double the apple, but that's just because I love apples. Also grateful for my apple machine that makes peeling, slicing, and coring my apples so easy, so this was a nice fast recipe."

"reviewBody": "This is the 2nd recipe I've tried making steel cut oats in a crock pot. (the first was blueberry banana but we won't go there).This is also the 2nd time I've done this recipe with a few very minor changes.\n1)I used a crock pot liner (Reynolds). Worked great, no mess. \n2) I used one granny smith apple. I used one of those corer/slicers that you push down on the apple and slices it into 8 slices. Cut each slice into 4-5 pieces and added them in the pot with the skin on. I figure that they cook for 8 hours, who's going to care that the peel was left on?\n3)I used 1 1/2 cups of water and 2 cups of almond milk. I'm not sure why I use almond milk. The recipes I first looked at called for almond milk. I guess it's supposed to be good for you like steel cut oats.\n4)I used craisins instead of raisins because raisins will kill my dog.\n5)I used 1 Tbsp of apple pie spice instead of cinnamon. The spice also has nutmeg and allspice in it as well as cinnamon. I figured it wouldn't hurt.\nI turned this on before bed and had a bowl when I got up in the morning. I left a note telling my wife it was really good and enjoy it but she overslept and only had time to turn the crock pot off before going to work. I tossed the liner and untouched oatmeal in the trash when I came home. That is one reason why I'm making it again. Another reason is it's so gosh darn good!"

It calls for 1 cup chopped apples, so I chopped up one gala and one granny smith, probably more than a cup I did not measure. I have a really plain crockpot, just 2 settings, low and high. I cooked it appx 7 hours on low and it was perfect. Used a crockpot liner, so got every bit. Reheats nicely. My hubby and I are both type 2 diabetics and this did not raise our blood sugar, so bonus for that! Will be making this often! Thanks for the great recipe!"

Because the last time I had oats I was 5 (44 years ago lol) and I swore to my mom that I’d go hungry before I ever choked them down again. \nFast forward and a new diet with meal prepping has taken place and I’m amazed how delicious this is! I used 2.5 cups unsweetened almond milk and 1.5 cups of water, did not add raisins, used light brown sugar, and everything else the recipe calls for. I sprayed the crock pot with Pam and cooked on low for a little over 5 hours (cooked during the day so I could keep track of it). My serving size turned out to be about 3/4 cup and there were 6 servings. I sprinkled 1tsp of chia seeds over each serving before refrigerating. I’m sure I’ll add a bit of almond milk when I reheat the oats but the sweetness, cinnamon and apple flavors were all perfect! Adding up what I used, each serving including chia seeds is 147 calories. Nutritious, tasty breakfast"

(I also have 5 burned fingers from this fiasco) I now feel like a candidate for worst cooks in America. Anne Burrell is going to be knocking on my door.\n\nSo my advice, if you make this.. Make sure you have a crock with a warm setting.\n\nThe end result that wasn't stuck to my crock was good, but on top of it all runny. I would say it might need more oats than directed, because a 6-7 hour cook time should have produced firm oats and mine was full of cinnamon soup.\n\nThe taste was very good though, but I think I'll be hesitant to do oatmeal in a slow cooker again"

Hooray!\nThe amount of cinnamon was fantastic as well. \nBecause I'd made slow cooker oatmeal before and found it to burn on the edges, this time, I tried 2 hours on Low, then turned it to Warm while we slept. It was a little crusty on the edges when we woke up, but not burnt. \n\nAnd hey, I found a trick on the internet for help with the burnt-on, caked-on remainder, and it works like a charm!\n\n\"The Crock-Pot Ladies recommend sprinkling baking soda onto stuck-on food before scrubbing. If that doesn't work, their second course of action is to pour 1/4 cup of baking soda into the ceramic pot, fill it with water, and add a dash of dish soap. Then cover it and set on high for 2-4 hours.\""
