"reviewBody": "Living in Dutch country PA heard about this from local friends and had to try it. I'm not normally a fan of sauerkraut, but this was a hit, especially with carrots and potatoes. I should have added salt to begin with, but a little on your plate does just fine. Best is the slow cooker method. I was even running late this morning but still found a few minutes to throw this in the crockpot and run. (Don't forget the water!) Came home to a warm, hearty dinner and a house that smelled amazing. Definitely make again."

The pork and sauerkraut have lots of liquid...by hour number 8 my sauerkraut was already done and everything was swimming in liquid. Flavor is fantastic and I'll cut back on the butter next time...and maybe add more pepper. Thank you for sharing!"

I think she makes hers with a pork shoulder, but I liked using the tenderloin because it was more lean. I think the shoulder would work well also!"

We LOVED it! \nI followed this recipe exactly except that I used 2 jars of some kind of artisan craft beer sauerkraut that had caraway seeds in it. \nThis was GREAT. I cannot stress this enough. It was melt in your mouth, flavorful and amazing! Husband raved about it and I loved it too. This will now be on a bi-weekly rotation at our house (and that's saying a lot because they are picky and we can never agree on what is good food!) \nThe ONLY thing I will do differently next time is that I will exclude the potatoes and make mashed potatoes instead. The potatoes weren't bad, but mashed would be better with this meal. Although it would take a little more effort as this was the easiest thing I have ever made."

My German Grandmother told Me that sauerkraut without caraway seed was almost a sin, so I included about a half teaspoon of them. Otherwise, this was a very satisfying recipe as written and I'll be making it again."

"reviewBody": "Fantastic! I used a very mellow sauerkraut because of family preferences, so because of that I had to make some minor changes. I cooked this in my InstaPot and seared the roast first, then I deglazed with chicken broth. I used this instead of water that the recipe called for. I cooked on the slow cook function on high for 4 hours. At that time, I thought that the sauerkraut had lost too much of its flavor, so I added in two chicken bullion. Everything was so flavor. The roast was juicy and flavorful and the potatoes were fantastic. There was just the slightest of sauerkraut flavor in both, but just enough. I will make again."

The potatoes had a bit of a tang which really balanced all the flavors. Only changes I made were to add a cup of chicken stock to replace the water and I used a 2 1/2 lb pork loin roast which I seasoned with s&amp;p and seared before placing in the crock pot. Cooked on high for 3 hours and then on low for another 3. My husband told me that I had to add this dish to the rotation!. My pleasure - easiest complete meal I've ever made!!"

"reviewBody": "I was nervous using the slow cooker for pork loin and sauerkraut because I didn't want to overcook the pork and end up with pulled pork. I added thick slices of red onion and granny smith apples to the bottom of crockpot, put 5 lbs. of pork loin on top of that, then 2 32-oz jars of sauerkraut on top and sides. Started on high to get hot then turned down to low for a few hours. After a few hours, tested meat with meat thermometer and turned down to warm until we ready to eat. After taking the meat out to carve, I mixed the apples and onions into the sauerkraut. The apples gave the sauerkraut a nice flavor and toned down the sour a bit. Mashed potatoes go really good with this meal. Loved it. Enough for seconds for the big eaters in my family. Serves 8-10 people"

It was done on high after 5 hours but I left it to soak in it's juices for another hour or so. Only change I made was to brown the tenderloins first and I doubled the recipe making lots of leftovers. Great Oktoberfest recipe! Thanks Amian"
