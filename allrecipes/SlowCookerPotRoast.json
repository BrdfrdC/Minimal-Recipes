I just used some extra herbs: 2 tsp thyme, a few dashes of celery seed &amp; a few cloves of garlic, plus an extra onion on top. Also instead of water, used 1/4 cup red wine and 1/4 cup chicken stock. Used 2 tbsp of cassava flour and a tbsp of arrowroot powder instead of flour. Seriously. Let's stop cooking with processed chemicals. It's actually quite easy."

Using gravy mix makes sense but I was curious about the Italian dressing mix and the ranch dressing mix. I use ranch dressing mix all the time in potato casseroles but I wasn’t sure about using it in pot roast. The 3 mixes worked perfectly together. I used 1 cup of water and I added red potatoes, celery, baby carrots and pearl onions. Magnificent!"

Here's the kicker: I'm out of town and the only pot roast my local butcher had was dry-aged.First, the gravy was velvet smooth, the peppers added a great kick...but the meat! They say your meal is only as good as the ingredients, and of course that's true. But if you ever get a chance to make this meal with a dry-aged pot roast, jump at that chance.This meal is now in the rotation. My husband is licking the plate like he's never seen food. Off to stop him..."

A few changes: added some potatoes and celery and reduced the carrots. also did not have beef gravy mix but had some (long in the tooth) slow cooker sloppy joe mix which I used in place of. I did not add salt (forgot) and my saltaholic wife loved it without adding any at the table. I will be making it again next month and hopefully will remember to buy some beef gravy mix."

I poured the mixture over the entire chuck roast instead of how they did it in the video where they poured it around it. My chuck which was close to 3 pounds took up the whole bottom of my crockpot. I would like the gravy to be thicker so I may adjust the mixture next time. Still good all the same"

Then floured and browned it in a little oil. I placed a few carrots and new potatoes in the crockpot then added the roast and placed a bay leaf on top. Chopped the onion (added a little minced garlic too) and lightly caramelized them in the same pan I browned the roast. Added to the crockpot with roast. Mixed the seasoning packets to together adding 2 Tbls of flour then whisked in 1/2 c red wine and 1/4 c water. Poured over the roast. Cooked on Low for 6 hrs, then added baby carrots and new potatoes. Cooked another 2 1/2 hours on Low till carrots were tender. The roast was falling apart. No knife needed. And OMG the gravy is out of this world!"

Took longer than 15 minutes to prep as I added potatoes, extra chunked onions (in addition to the sliced onions on the bottom of the crockpot), peeled baby carrots, and bella mushrooms. It took me 30 minutes to prep. I used two packets of gravy. The brand I used was Pioneer. It says that each packet makes 2 cups of gravy. I thought. \"No way, that's going to be enough gravy for me!\" Plus, with the extra vegetables, I knew that there would be more liquid than the recipe called for. Made for a very tasty dinner."

I added 1/4 cup of beef stock and it was too salty for our taste, so I added 1/4 cup of water and it was just right. I added 2 cubed potatoes and 7 carrots, and all were cooked to perfection. My only concern was that the gravy might be too thin, but the flour pressed into the beef did the trick. Great recipe and so very easy."

I used a 4 lb. eye round roast as I don’t care for chuck and I had one in the freezer. Also, after flouring the roast, I browned it on top of the stove before putting it in the slow cooker. Everyone raved about the flavor. Gravy was the perfect consistency!!!"

When I reheated the leftovers I added peas and fresh mushrooms. Awesome. So my take away is add anything you like and it will be amazing. Definitely will make again. Once everything is in the pot there is absolutely nothing else to do. If you want to make rolls to sop up the gravy my husband wouldn’t argue. Try it, you’ll love it."

"reviewBody": "A good recipe that makes more gravy than you’d expect! Tastes even better the next day, so makes great left-overs too. After making a couple of times, I changed the water to beef broth and added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to deepen the flavor. Also, once when I did t have Italian dressing mix, I used a packet of garlic-herb dip mix and it still came out great, so i think you can improvise with what you have on hand and not spend $$ on special ingredients."

And substituted half a cup of red wine (Cabernet Sauvignon) in the gravy mix, til desired consistency was reached. I had my doubts about the amount of liquid when the cooking started. But about halfway (4 hours) into cooking the gravy had completely covered the roast, and was eventually more than enough. I waited the 8 hours and when it was done, the meat was so tender it stirred right into the mix like magic!! My four year old daughter gives it 2 thumbs way up!! And that is impressive for a pot roast. Til next review, stay grubbin my friends!!!!"

I also added sliced baby portabellas and omitted the potatoes because I didn't have any on hand, instead, I served it on egg noodles. Also, I followed others' suggestions on here and halved the ranch and gravy packets (and maybe used 3/4 of the Italian dressing mix) so it wouldn't be unbearably salty. It's definitely a dish I'll make again and again."

I was skeptical about the sodium content based on other reviews.. but I added the recommended carrots and onion and waited until an hour and a half until time was up to add mushrooms.. made mashed potatoes.. everything was on track. The only problem is that this pot roast has been in the slow cooker since 8am. It's now 4:40pm (so 8 hours and 40 minutes) and it still isn't done. We used a 2.5 lb roast, I followed the instructions exactly. Super frustrating. Flavor is on point, but cooking time is not."
