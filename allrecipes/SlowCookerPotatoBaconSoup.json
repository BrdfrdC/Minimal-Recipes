"reviewBody": "3.10.20 The timing is W-A-A-Y off on this recipe. I used the slow cooker feature on my Instant Pot®, checked at 2 hours, and the potatoes were not only cooked, but actually overcooked. No whisking the potatoes was required because the potatoes already were turning to mush. Granted, maybe I cubed my potatoes smaller than others, but I’d recommend that you start checking for doneness at about 1-1/2 hours. Cooking that many strips of bacon leaves you with a LOT of bacon fat (too much IMO), so I removed all but about 2 tablespoons to brown the onions. Also, it really needed a pretty good dose of salt and pepper, was fairly bland. I didn’t have Cheddar-Monterey Jack blend, but I did have each type of cheese, so I just shredded the two of them (worked fine), melted beautifully after a couple stirs. And I used fat free half-and-half which was what I had on hand. So a few tweaks along the way, but this turned out to be a creamy, tasty potato soup that I would make again with the changes above."
