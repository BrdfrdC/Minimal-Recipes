For a quick, cheap, easy recipe it may be okay for you, but I would rather take the time to add molasses, onions, etc, for a really good, deep flavor. I also think a cheaper cut with fat adds even tho you have to cool and remove the membrane and congealed fats later. JMO"

I topped with some crushed red pepper flakes and let it stand for about 10 minutes. I sliced up a sweet onion and put it underneath. Then I poured in two cans of A&amp;W Rootbeer. I cooked the pork on low for 7-8 hours. Then I shred it with two forks, drained it, then put it back in. Turned the slow cooker to warm, and mixed in some BBQ sauce. If you are ever near Cashmere, WA, pick up some Country Boys BBQ sauce!"

I used about a liter of root beer for a 6 lb shoulder seasoned with dry rub , let it go for about 9 hours and then poured off the liquid. I then added a 18 oz bottle of Stick Fingers Carolina BBQ sauce and served on toasted hamburger buns. Tasted great for less than a $20 total investment."

Following some of the other suggestions I pierced the pork with a serving fork thoroughly before simmering to let the juices penetrate, and rubbed with garlic salt and pepper. Seven hours on low and it shredded very easily. Added plenty of Sweet Baby Ray’s with Vidalia, put back in the cooker and kept warm until ready to serve. Served on lightly toasted Hawaiian rolls with coleslaw. My wife and kids wolfed it down as fast as they could and asked me to make it again soon."

This meal stretched for 3 days and I used it on nachos, stuffed zucchini boats I mixed with cream cheese and mozzarella. All this and that roast and bbq sauce with a can of root beer cost under 10.00."

I've made it a bajillion times in different ways and it has never been bad. I've made it using the ascribed pork loin and it wasn't bad, I did notice it was a little chewier but it was less fatty if thats a health concern. Generally, I follow others' rec to use a cheaper/fattier piece of pork and I usually season with some spices-always eyeball/different. But again, it has NEVER failed me. I don't even look the recipe up anymore most of the time but props to the author because you've saved my butt countless times as I've come into adulthood!"

It ruined dinner that was started at 11:30am. Dont make the mistake that I did and think it is an easy recipe to make a great family dinner. If you do not have the skills to make pulled pork, this should absolutely not be your first option."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is a staple in my house. I also use the Sweet Baby Rays (we like the hickory and brown sugar flavored sauce). I put the roast in my crock pot, lined with a liner of course and stick it in the fridge. The next morning I add my root beer and turn it on. I'm not a fan of the smell of it while its cooking so I stick the crock-pot on top of my dryer in the garage to cook all day. Get home, bring it in, drain it, pull it. Reline my crock-pot and add the bbq. Get it hot then eat it up! I also freeze leftovers in zippy bags."

"reviewBody": "This is a terrific recipe. I used a large pork shoulder butt and browned it off in bacon fat first. I added it to slow cooker and poured one bottle of IBC root beer (it is made with cane sugar) and let it cook on low for 8 hours. I turned it once midway. I did not add barbeque sauce at the end as my man is on a special diet and we have a sensitive sauce for him. So I shredded it and let everyone add their own sauces to their bun as well as cheddar cheese and cole slaw. That way everyone could customize their sandwhich. Wonderful recipe and thanks Livie's mom for sharing it."

I made it the night before so we could have it for the following dinner the next day. When I went to put it away for the night I had a few bites and didn't want to stop eating!! It was everything all the ratings said it would be! It was easy to make - and I too added the spices initially of the salt pepper and garlic salt - crock pot on low for 6 hours and then drained, added BBQ sauce and let it cook for one more hour on low. And WA-LAH!"

It is exceptionally lean, and after 7 or 8 hours on Low it shreds very easily.\n This is about as easy as it gets for a tasty comfort food meal the whole family loves.\n\n We use Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory Brown Sugar sauce with it, but I know sauces are a very personal thing.\n\n We usually make nachos with chips, cheese and some sour cream on them, but it also makes a great sandwich or taco too !"

I entirely covered the meat with a and w root beer and left to cook for 10 hours then drained. I shredded and added very little bbq sauce, and put it back on for another hour . I am not a big fan of having pulled pork where the only flavour is bbq sauce. This was a fantastic simple resipe. I sprayed the slow cooker with coconut spray twice and clean up was a breeze.Two very big thumbs up."
