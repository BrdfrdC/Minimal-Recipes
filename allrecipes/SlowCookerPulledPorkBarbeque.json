Slow Cookers retain moisture and too much added liquid results in meat stewing and taking longer to cook. You can always add more BBQ sauce about 30 min before serving if desired."

It was so good the family asked for it again next week. \n**I didn't intend to make any changes but accidentally doubled my spices (I had two roasts and in my mind it was doubled) so when I tasted it after 7 hours I added the rest of the bbq sauce jar and 1 TBSP of dark brown sugar to balance it out. So the moral of the story is the recipe is very forgiving."

After about 15 minutes I poured some of the sauce over it and let it sit again for another 10 minutes which helped the sauce thicken. Best pulled pork recipe I’ve made to date!"

"reviewBody": "Delicious &amp; so easy! Used a 1.5lb center cut pork loin roast in a 6qt crock. 4 hours on low, shredded the meat and cooked in the sauce on low for another 45 minutes. Was worried while shredding that the meat would be tough but it turned out perfectly tender and very flavorful... don't skip the simmer time after shredding! Since the roast was smaller we used one medium onion and 3 stalks of celery (about 1c) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I used a teaspoon of salt and 1/2t of pepper \"to taste\" and it was perfectly seasoned. A little more effort than just dumping a bottle of bbq sauce over the pork but the 5-10 minutes of prep was worth the great depth of flavor. We prepped the night before and took the crock out of the fridge about an hour before cooking so it was really effortless. Saved this recipe for future use and looking forward to enjoying it again!"

I followed the directions with the only exception of adding 2 heaping tablespoons of concentrated tomato paste, my family likes that flavor on pork.\nThe cook time for my crock pot was 6 hours on high. The bones slid right out! While I cooled the meat to shred, I put the sauce on the stove to reduce, then skimmed some of the fat off. I returned the shredded meat and sauce back to the crock pot on warm. It held nicely until supper time. We add hot sauce at the table to accommodate individual taste preferences.\nThank you for a great simple recipe!"

Used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce. I would not add the water to start. It was a little runny after shredding the pork. There is plenty of liquid and doubt it will be dry. You can always add some water or bbq sauce if needed after shredding if it is to thick. Winner."

"reviewBody": "Was a little uncertain about the ingredients but, followed this recipe as written. Turned out great and the flavor was just what I was looking for. The liquid as it cooks is thin but, once I drained it I just added a little more barbeque sauce to the pork on a toasted bun from the bottle. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Barbeque Sauce for slow cooking (Hickory &amp; Brown Sugar flavor) This pork is pull apart tender. When the recommended 7 hr cooking is up test it by using a fork to pull the pork apart. If it does not pull apart easy just leave it in for additional time. I added another hour. For sure I will make this again. By the way, left overs are amazing Enjoy!"

I also added root beer in place of the water, as that's what I use for liquid in my other pulled pork recipes and I like the additional flavor the root beer gives. The recipe without the celery is great! The pulled pork was very flavorful. It will be a go to recipe for me. Maybe someday I will even be brave enough to add the celery! Thank you for the recipe."

All you really need to do is put your roast in the crock pot, I like to use a pork tenderloin 4 pounds or more, and dump a jar of hot banana peppers on top. Cook until it's done. Put it in a very very large bowl and take your hand mixer to it, it'll shred up in a matter of seconds, banana peppers included. Then mix up a blend of your favorite barbecue sauces start with Sweet Baby Ray's and what other sauces you like along with some vinegar and go on from there and don't forget to add the Liquid Smoke that's the key to the whole thing."

"reviewBody": "The only addition I made to this recipe was to substitute Root Beer for the water. After cooking, I removed the roast from the sauce mixture and shredded it with 2 forks......then used my immersion blender to \"liquefy\" the celery, onions, etc. I removed approx. 1/2 of the liquid to serve as an additional dipping sauce along with the pulled pork. Returned the shredded pork to the crock pot and heated for add'l 30 min. Served on toasted Kaiser Buns.......DELICIOUS!!!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe was so easy and quick to put together before work (no browning of meat!) and it was a very tasty dinner to come home to. We loved it! Lots of leftovers in our two person household, so I discovered the even better taste the next day! As I used a sweet barbecue sauce, it made a very delicious base for wraps the next day. I just heated the pork and wrap for a few minutes and added a salad greens mix, pea shoots, julienned apple, julienned cucumber, and avocado, no need to add dressing, as there was plenty of flavour in the pork, and wrapped it up. I added a large salad on the side for more greens, Super delicious! My son loves the pulled pork! We have eaten and enjoyed lots, and I still have enough for one more night! I will make this again!"

"reviewBody": "Excellent, excellent! It was fairly simple to put together, although I made double the amount in the recipe. The taste was not overpowering, so my son who doesn't like barbeque sauce flavor could still eat it (and it tasted great)! If you want it saucier, simply add some onto your pork on your sandwich. Top with coleslaw and you are all set to go! Fair warning- this gets very soupy during the cooking process so, in order to place it on a roll and not have the bread turn to mush, you need to be sure the meat is drier. If you are eating it out of a bowl, no sauce problems at all. One of the best parts of this recipe was the incredible smell it made all through the house, for almost the entire day- superb!"
