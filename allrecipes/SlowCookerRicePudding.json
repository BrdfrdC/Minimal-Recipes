I think time variations should be expected when using slow cookers. I am making another batch now and am using a can of coconut milk as part of the 4 cups of milk. This recipe and technique leaves lots of options for experimentation."

Cooked on High. Stirred once each hour. ready in 3. Turn off at 3 hr hour mark. (Rice is a little wet). Leave for 15 mins in pot to absorb remainder of liquid. Then serve. It was reasonably sweet but nice. (You could use less sugar if you wanted.) I didn't use almond essence. Might be nice with a little orange rind. Rice was very soft and plump and delicious. I Would make again, but probably try on the stove top."

I basically made this as instructed except I used half brown sugar and half white sugar, as well as half the almond extract because that flavor is really strong for me. Also just a note - on my slow cooker, it was starting to get some burning around the edges before it was done cooking to thickness, so that worried me for a minute, but I just left the burned sides intact, kept stirring with some regularlity and the end result was delicious. Wonderful recipe I will for sure make again!"

I read a lot of different recipes and a lot of reviews on all the diff. recipes and I think I just let too much go to my head. I think it came out a bit too chunky because I felt like it sounded like just way too little rice vs amount of liquid. so I added 1/4cup more rice. I also used 2 fewer cups of milk and added a 14oz can of sweetened condensed milk. So it ended up being more...caramely. Not what I was in the mood for! It's not the worst..but I wish I would have just followed the directions and I bet it would have been awesome! Next time I won't doubt the recipe! Shame on me. lol."

My husband loves rice pudding and he devoured it, but you can cut the sugar and extract flavorings in half and it's perfect. I ended up transferring to stovetop because even after 3.5 hours on high in my slow cooker, the rice wasn't cooked. (But that was my issue , no fault of recipe)"

I didnt have almond stuff or even good vanilla extract (was making it at work and I can't use the good vanilla with alcohol.). But it worked beautifully with imitation vanilla. Thanks for the recipe."

"reviewBody": "Growing up, my grandmother's rice pudding was always a treat--thick, sweet, cinnamon-y... It was something my father and I looked forward to. So, when I stumbled on this recipe, I figured \"hey, this looks like an easy way to start making rice pudding.\" I'd never made a batch of my own, and grandma left a, well, let's call it \"cryptic\" breakdown of her process. Consequently, I made this recipe to try to rekindle some of my childhood and bring a bit of joy to my father's face.\n\nThe flavor on my final product was good, though I'd skip the almond extract next time out. That said, I have a couple issues with this particular recipe. A half cup of rice to four cups of milk? I did use whole milk, but the pudding turned out like rice-filled sweet soup. Again, good flavor, but incorrect consistency. I posit that more rice/starch is necessary to thicken the mixture.\n\nAlso, my rice didn't quite cook all the way. It wasn't awful, but it was far from perfect. A longer cook time (coupled with more rice) would probably make this work better--but I AM an outlier with this rating. It seems that most people have had great success with this recipe, so I may have just had a bit of bad luck.\n\nThe conclusion? I'm not turned off of this recipe. It has potential, and maybe I just missed a beat. I may make it again to see if I get the same result, but I'm definitely looking for a quality stove top recipe that more closely resembles my grandma's."

Only added a pinch of salt and 1 1/2 the recipe using Fairlife 2% milk. More protein ?? cooked about 30 mins longer. Was runny until it set in fridge. I would cook it a little less as it was a tad too firm after setting.. It is awesome and easy! Also stir midway through so it doesnâ€™t stick to bottom."

Thank you.\nI read most of the reviews before hand in order to avoid making mistakes but to be honest there is nothing to it, it's dead easy. I followed the instructions as it is but the only thing I did was doubling the amount because I thought the original quantities not enough for a big family! So 1 cup of rice and 8 cups of milk and kept the same measurements to the rest of the ingredients!!! Haven't said that it took 5 hours to cook and I must say that after 2 1/2 hours I opened the lid to check because nothing was happening and milk still the same so I gave it a stir and added another additional hour!!! After the hour has finished I checked again and still too watery, gave it another stir and added another hour! Then I started see results!!! when the hour was over I followed step 4 and added another 1/2 an hour and when I scooped it out it came out to a tee!!. Will definitely definitely recommend and make it again"

I cooked on low; it was done in about 90 minutes or so. It was very creamy when I removed it from the slow cooker, but I knew it would thicken as it cooled. It sure did! Next time I shall add a bit more milk after the cooking is done, to hopefully, promote a creamier rice pudding. It was delicious! I liked it best served warm. Unfortunately my husband did not like it, so next time I shall do it without the egg. And, maybe add raisins, he will not like that, but I will! We finished it off in about three days, it did not make as much as I expected. Will definitely make again."
