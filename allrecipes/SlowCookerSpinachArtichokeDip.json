Oh, I also used half-and-half rather than milk, we don't drink milk around here. Overall it is a good recipe and if you add your own extras you can make it a five-star recipe."

"reviewBody": "Made this exactly as written except I cooked it on low 2 hours instead of high to avoid scorching of the cream cheese and other cheese. It worked perfectly on low. I added 30 minutes to cook time just to be on the safe side but I don't think it was necessary. This was good but I think it could have used something. Crushed red pepper maybe? Regardless, this was simple and one I will make again. Stir often!"
