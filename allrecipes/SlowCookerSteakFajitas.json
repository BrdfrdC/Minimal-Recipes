These were amazing. My husband has asked me to make them again. A friend of mine (he‚Äôs Mexican) who is really critical about Mexican food came over, and he even commented how good they were. BUT...the leftovers were even more truly amazing! We made burritos with and without beans and rice, and they were so good. I had a bit still left, so I scrambled eggs and added cheese and made a breakfast burrito. Just excellent. I‚Äôve got a cooker going right now set to feed a bunch of teenage boy athletes. Highly recommend this recipe!!! Btw, I‚Äôll just hook up my pancake griddle to heat the flour tortillas when the boys are ready. I can do 8 at a time. Fast. Easy."

However the method of crockpot fajitas just didn't do it for us. I might try another reviewer suggestions and crisp the fajita meat in the broiler,or my cast iron skillet than place the meat in the slow cooker. I'm on the fence on this one!"

Easy to make &amp; I love the crockpot as my kids have different schedules with sports."

I also chose to slightly saut√© my bell peppers and onions and then add them to the meat. I also am not a huge fan of flour tortillas, so I put the mixture over rice and my family absolutely loved it. I already had this idea in mind. But, the slow cooker option makes the meat more tender. Thanks for the slow cooker idea"
