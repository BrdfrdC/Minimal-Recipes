As posted in other reviews, you don't need to pre-cook the beef, just add all the ingredients to it. Next time I won't use the diced tomatoes as they made them runny. I used more ketchup than called for (1/2 cup), and I also added some shredded cheese that I needed to use up. Use spaghetti sauce to top off the peppers and you only need 3 Tablespoons of water in the bottom of the crockpot."

(Made on 6/24/20. I fit 5 halved peppers in pot. Rest of meat mixture was turned into meatballs by adding bread crumbs &amp; cooked on high for 3.5 hrs)"

But, my biggest gripe is with how many pots and pans it took to make this. To me, a slow cooker meal should be one that you just throw everything in and set it to go. The fact that you have to cook everything ahead of time defeats the purpose of the slow cooker."

"reviewBody": "Hubby and I both loved this. I used ground chicken and brown rice. I followed some of the other reviewers and added brown sugar (1 tablespoon) and allspice (1/2 teaspoon) to the liquid to pour around the peppers. I also changed the water to chicken stock (actually used bouillon 'cause I didn't have any stock) and adding half a can of tomato paste. This increased the liquid to about a cup altogether, but it was very tasty to serve alongside. Had to make 2 layers of peppers in the crock pot and they just barely fit, but it worked. If you're wondering whether or not to drain the canned tomatoes - don't. The meat mixture does need some salt - I put in a teaspoon but felt it could have used a little more. I cooked it six and a half hours on Low and the peppers were done just as I like them - they held together nicely and were not too mushy. Will make this again for sure. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This is my go-to \"basic\" recipe. I agree with many others who said not to brown the meat first. I used to make stuffed peppers in the oven, but I find this to be FAR easier -- no need to blanch the peppers first and it takes me only a few minutes now to prep the peppers. I did follow one reviewer's recommendation to add brown sugar and allspice, which is now \"my\" basic recipe. I use whatever diced tomatoes I have on hand (plain, Italian -- not fire-roasted per the recipe). I also agree with other reviewers that the peppers need to be topped with a tomato sauce (I combine paste, sauce, ketchup, diced tomatoes -- whatever I have remaining -- minced onion, and a bit of Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar and allspice)."

But my family enjoyed it as is. I'll add a bit more sauce next time..thank you for submitting recipe"

I also used Uncle Ben's white rice in a bag which took 90 seconds to cook in microwave and was the exact amount I needed. I used red peppers instead of green as they are sweeter. I also added shredded sharp cheddar to the \"mix\" which made a real yummy difference! I also added some salt to the mix. This is a definite repeat for us!"

Ground beef doesn't do well in slow cookers unless you cook it first. SUBSTITUTIONS: We had to use brown rice and a 10 oz can of Rotel tomatoes and chilies, and it turned out great. We used a little extra water since I was nervous about it drying up. NOTES FOR NEXT TIME: Next time we make this, we'll keep the brown rice and the Rotel, but I think we'll use a little extra ketchup and Worcestershire--or better yet, some tomato paste and soy sauce/Bragg's Liquid Aminos to deepen the flavor. \n... \nSince we were short on time, I threw the rice into the slow cooker during my lunch break the day before, browned the beef that evening, and mixed it all together at lunch the following day. Cooked it about 4 hours on low, then 2 hours on high so we could eat an early dinner.\n ... \nThank you for this recipe!"

I add ALLSPICE to the meat mixture and put some BROWN SUGAR and some ALLSPICE in the Tomato sauce you use...such a great flavor! You will always use the sugar and allspice from now on. YUMM!"
