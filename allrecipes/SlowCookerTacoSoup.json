I've subbed turkey and hot chili beans, and I use green hatch chiles and red onion. You can play with the amount of liquid to make it more soupy or less, and you can make it vegetarian by leaving the meat out. It's always better the next day and I always demolish the leftovers."

"reviewBody": "This turned out super well. I did make a couple tweaks that perfected it. First I used two seasoning packets. One while I cooked the meat and one in the crock pot. Also while I cooked the meat I added Chili powder, Pepper &amp; a little ranch seasoning. I put the same seasoning in the pot. Then I used black instead of chili beans. And for my diced tomatoes I got chili style tomatoes from the store plus pre seasoned diced tomatoes. Last instead of water I did beef broth. Make sure you use the liquid from all the ingredients. This helps it be more like soup than chili. If too thick just add more water or broth. Definitely serve with chips and sour cream. (P.S need it sooner? I did high for 4 hours and it was perfect but I could've also eaten it sooner. )"

"reviewBody": "I thought this recipe was a great inspiration, but too many ingredients would have made a vat of soup and they're only two of us to eat it. I substituted 2 and 1/2 cups of my own homemade tomato sauce, one cup of my home brined peppers and rinsed them before mincing. I used only one can of black beans and one can of whole kernel corn, but the taco mix was still inadequate for this amount of food. I had to add more cayenne, chili powder, cumin, and oregano to balance the flavors. I added three cloves of garlic that I pre-softened in the microwave for 15 seconds before pressing through the garlic press. We still ended up with a huge pot of soup that will be eating for a couple of days. It came out wonderfully, so I think this was a great recipe, for small families, with which to experiment."

Instead of the canned tomatoes and chili peppers, I added 2 pint jars of my homemade salsa and only 1 cup of water. I added all the other ingredients and cooked it on low in the crockpot for 3 yo 4 hours. I'm sure this recipe would be great as it is, but after going to 3 stores that had no rotel of any kind. I decided I would try my homemade salsa in it, which I was glad I did, it was fantastic!"
