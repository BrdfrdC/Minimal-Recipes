I agree that the pasta soaks up too much broth and gets mushy, adding to each bowl (especially for leftovers) is a good idea. I made it in the instant pot putting everything in except pasta, spinach, and parm cheese on soup setting, NPR 10 min. Release pressure and add spinach (&amp; pasta if not adding to each bowl) on top of soup manual high for 10 min, NPR 10 min"

I added 1 can of Italian green beans. When chopping up the celery I saved a bunch of the leaves and added them also. This soup is so good you won’t notice that it doesn’t have any meat in it! Works great in a crockpot on low for 6 hours, none of the veggies were mushy. Will be making it again next week, and will try adding some V8 vegetable juice!"

"reviewBody": "Alright, anyone giving this recipe negative reviews is a newb in the kitchen. There are things they don't tell you to do, that a fairly seasoned cook would just know. ie- like others said, simmer the onion and garlic in oil first, then add the rest of the ingredients. Here's a few changes i made, but you can really add whatever veggies you like to this and it will come out good. I just went the Campbell's vegetable soup route.\n\nI took out the zucchini and celery and added fresh mushrooms (halved), canned green beans, (cut, not french) and canned corn. I also added more potatoes - about a handful of petite red (halfed) and I cut up 2 baking potatoes into pieces about the same size as the red potatoes. \nSo, most people who have cooked a soup a few times would know this, but always add the veggies that are going to take longer, first. In my case, the potatoes and carrots. Also, I did NOT use a slow cooker, because all of this would have turned to mush. I also did not add pasta out of personal preference. Instead of 6 cups of broth, I used 8 - or two quarts of organic vegetable broth (boxed). Doubled the salt because my broth was low sodium. Add 1 bay leaf. I also cut the kidney beans in half since I had plenty of potatoes in there and didn't want it to have an extra starchy texture. When the carrots, potatoes, and kidney beans got to be about half-cooked (yes, you need to keep checking it about every 10-15 min) then it was time to add the canned vegetables (since they're technic"

My changes: seasoned tomatoes, mushroom broth instead of veggie broth, the ENTIRE bunch of fresh parsley, cannellini beans, already chopped onion and celery, bagged sliced carrots, two parsnips sliced as thin as the carrots, fennel bulb sliced thin, and chopped up leaves. Double the thyme. I never put the pasta in, I keep it on the side because so many people can't have gluten, plus it sucks all the liquid up. I also use Saffron Pasta, and it makes this even better. I almost always forget to add the spinach. When I'm out, I use kale or Swiss chard."

Yet it turned out so good that I was asked if I bought it from a restaurant. ????????. Oh, and I cooked it for way more than the suggested time. I hope y’all’s soup turned out as good as mine. Best part, no heartburn afterwards. That’s a major YAY!!!!"

I used frozen spinach as that was what was available. I also couldn’t find cannelini beans so I used 2 cans of navy beans. Also used small shells couldn’t find ditali pasta so next time I find ditali I’ll stock pile just for this soup. It made a large slowcooker full before the pasta and I will definitely make it again."

I used basically the same ingredients but just eyeballed everything to my taste. I did sautee the garlic and onions in olive oil first. First day I made it, I was just okay. But I stuck it in fridge and found the flavor greatly increased over a couple days and I really liked it by day 2. I will, in the future make it a couple days before I plan to serve it. It was a big hit with the family. We ate every bit of it and usually end up tossing the last of most soups I make cause everybody gets tired of it. Not this one. Ate it all."
