I cooked it for 6 hours and the roast was tough, so I will be doing 5 hours next time. The flavor is absolutely delicious though! This recipe called for way to much onion in my opinion. It gave my husband and I extremely upset stomachs the next day. It was also very salty, but we didn’t mind it. Now that I’ve made this I know how to change it up next time to make it better. Like I previously mentioned though, the flavor is delicious!"

The only thing I do that is not listed in the recipe is add vegetables. I quarter an onion, cut carrots to a length of about 3\" and add any potato I have laying around cut into quarters. I add all of this to the slow cooker so my sides are already done with the meat is cooked. The juices from the meat give the vegetables a fantastic flavor. When adding the vegetables I add enough to feed however many people will be sitting at my table that night. I usually put the vegetables under the roast so when the juice drip off the roast it fully coats the veggies."

Packaged it up in four separate containers for freezer for future meals. (someone left the freezer door open so had to cook a lot of meat)\n\nThis review is for me to refer to to see what works and doesn't for next time I want to make it. Those that get mad for not following the recipe need not read this one."

"reviewBody": "I wasn't sure how to rate this recipe because I think it needs some tweaking as written, but it deserves five stars with those tweaks. First, I cut back on the amount of fresh onion since the recipe also calls for onion soup mix. One large onion is equivalent to 1-1/2 c. chopped, but I used about 1/2 c. Second, as mentioned by several other reviewers, 1 T soy sauce + 1 T. garlic salt + 1 package of onion soup mix = way too much salt. I substituted a couple teaspoons of minced garlic for the garlic salt. Third, I added vegetables (baby potatoes, carrots, and celery) and liquid (1 c. broth + 1/2 c. red wine). Then, near the end of the cooking time, I added a slurry of potato starch and milk and turned the heat to high to thicken the stew before serving. We enjoyed it over rice."
