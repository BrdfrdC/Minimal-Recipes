My husband said that my pork butt was the best he’s ever had! *I did modify a tad to suit our needs....cut the season salt and cayenne in half because we’re on low sodium diets and I’m a wimp when it comes to spice."

It cut up nicely but I was not able to get it to shred so I will cook it a little longer next time and at a lower temp. This would work great on a whole chicken or cornish game hens too. Thanks for sharing!"
