"reviewBody": "i followed the recipe exactly. I used 1 bottle of Yuengling Porter. Black pepper is perfect for me. Some thought it was too much. Hoewever, I think there is too much soy sauce. The next time I make this, I'll cut the soy sauce at first. Taste it, and if necessary, I'll add it back. Flavor was good, but I felt it needed a little \"pop\". \n\nI added about a table spoon of hot sauce, a table spook of red pepper flakes, and a table spoon of minced onions. We did not find the flavor to be too hot. \n\nMy son who thinks Lays BBQ chips are too spicy, wouldn't put the meat down. I had to hide it from him! Good luck!"

"reviewBody": "Love the flavor and best beef jerky I've had...on another note just a little common sense, to all these bad reviews about too much pepper, it's always a good idea to taste test sauces that call for hot spices and tell you to marinate it all night. Personally I tested it before marinating it and realized it was just a tad too spicy for my taste buds so I adjusted it just slightly and it's perfect"

"reviewBody": "Just finished my third batch loosely following this particular recipe and all I can say is WOW. I made two marinades this time, one with less pepper for the wimpy friends, and the other with all the pepper it calls for plus a good habanero hot sauce. I used a Masterbuilt electric smoker. Recipe doesn't give any guidance regarding temperature. I learned from the other two batches, gotta keep the temperatures low and slow. This time I started by taking it to 170-175 degrees the first two and a half hours for the smoking, then backed it down to 150 degrees for 10 hours for the drying process using the electric smoker for drying so it would take in additional smoke flavoring without over-smoking. When I pulled it out it was still a little \"moist\" but definitely cooked through and through. If you follow my variance, keep it refrigerated and it should keep for a couple weeks in the fridge because of the brining with the soy sauce in addition to the apple cider vinegar, which puts the PH levels in a good comfort zone so you don't worry about it going bad. The question of what kind of cut to use. Flank is the go-to for jerky, and this recipe totally rocks with 3/16\" thick slices for a gourmet jerky you'll not soon forget. My next batch I'm gonna try 1/2\" cuts of sirloin and shoot for jerky steaks."
