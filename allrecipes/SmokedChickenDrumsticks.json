I then brushed a thin layer of bbq sauce and threw them on the grill to get a bit of char. Cheap to make for a crowd too. next time i will try the rub suggested in the recipe."

"reviewBody": "Followed the recipe exactly, using an electric smoker and a temp monitor (so my process was fairly precise). These were done in about 35 minutes, so I have no idea why the recipe says it should take 2 hours. I had hoped this technique would give me the crispy skin, but unfortunately it was still tough. However, the meat was smoky, moist and delicious."

"reviewBody": "I am the recipe creator and just a note on cook time. Yes, the legs will very well be done before the 2 hour mark, however, the point of leaving them in longer is to get a good amount of smoke flavor on them. In addition, the use of chicken drumsticks ensures the meat won't dry out and can therefore accept a longer smoke time. If you prefer yours with a light smoke flavor, feel free to take them out when they reach 165F. Enjoy!"
