I used it to make this dip and had more than 2 cups of fish, so I adjusted the sour cream, heat and mayonnaise to the right consistency. I also added a little pinch of salt. This is just fantastic! I plan to serve with lemon wedges, capers and saltines on a bed of mixed greens with finely diced tomatoes. This Florida girl thanks you for an awesome recipe that brings back a taste from my childhood!"

Mix everything with a third of an finally chopped onion and about half dozen small capers.AWESOME!!! Friends always ask me to make them some"

Picked up the seasoning in St Maarten - not sure if it's available in the US, but there are many good fish seasonings out there - just use your favorite."

I don't like Old Bay Seasoning so substituted Prudhomme's Blackened Red Fish seasoning. Also added a bunch more hot sauce, garlic powder, a bit more mayo and sour cream. I used smoked Mahi for my fish. Easy to do without a smoker....throw some wood chips in a disposable foil pan, put on the grill and cut up your fish in chunks. Spray with cooking oil and use a fish grill over the pan. Turn every 5 minutes or so...will be ready to go in 30 minutes."

"reviewBody": "I recently moved to Florida and was introduced to whitefish dip served as an appetizer at the local fish houses. When I saw smoked (with oak) whitefish at the seafood counter, I bought the fish to make my own. I didn't change anything in the recipe and it was better than restaurants. I flaked the fish by hand pulling little pinches at at time so that the pin bones were easily seen to pick out. I had no bones in my dip.\n\nI might add a little parsley next time to add a little color and I could see finely sliced green onions, chopped pimento or jalapenos might make a nice change but the base recipe is perfect for any customization you might want to add. \n\nI would also serve on endive or baby butter lettuce leaves for a carb free option or use celery sticks for dipping."

"reviewBody": "i thought this was a really great recipe, and pretty easy for most people. Although i went the extra step. Instead of buying smoked whitefish, i smoked it myself and the dip was excellent. Like most american families i don't have a smoker. So, i bought this little wood chip box and placed it near the holes where the propane leaks out and placed aluminum foil on the grill plates, this turned out very nicely. WITH THE WOOD CHIPS YOU MUST PLACE THEM IN WATER TO GET THE SMOKE TO RISE. I soaked the wood chips in Blue moon Beer to get more Flavor. Great recipe, Great Food, Great Times!"

"reviewBody": "I used baked tilapia and it turned out nicely. I did season the fish with old bay and lime prior to cooking and I upped the sour cream, old bay and hot sauce (I like my food a little spicier) and omitted the liquid smoke. Also really no need for a food processer, it blended well with just a spoon. It seemed a little runny at first, but after a half hour in the freezer it was perfect consistency. Brought it to a party with some large sesame wafers, when those ran out my friends continued eating it with tortilla chips. Went over great!"

Topped the crackers off with some jalapenos and crystal hot sauce! Very happy with the way it turned out and it tastes much better after a few hours in the fridge. Very Good!"

I have used other fish and have modified slightly to suit. I've used trout and salmon although the best is the whitefish. I do not recommend mackerel. Couldn't be easier to make! I serve with Club crackers and Pepperoncini peppers as my favorite restaurant in West Palm Beach would serve. Thank you! Thank you!"

We use mullet and the flavor also depends on the person smoking the millet. I am from the gulf coast and we smoke the millet with oak and then make the dip. You can come close with other fish but it just isn't the same."

"reviewBody": "I live on Florida's West Coast and here, we call it fish \"spread\". This recipe can be modified if fish isn't \"smoked\" and be good as the restaurants. I just made mine and it's terrific. Here's what I did to modify the recipe... I used tilapia, just a plain white fish (because that's what I had in the refrigerator). I marinated with lime juice. I cooked the fish in a pan with just a tiny bit of butter on high heat so it got crusty on the outside... just a few minutes on each side if the fish is thin. No need for a messy food processor! I sliced into tiny pieces, but in a bowl with all the ingredients in the recipe EXCEPT, I was liberal with the Old Bay and the cracked pepper. A little bit of garlic powder thrown in, too. Also, if you're serving this as an hor d'oeuvre for a crowd, you'll want to double the recipe. Use an ice cream scoop to make a rounded serving or two on leafy lettuce. In Florida, fish spread is served with Captains wafer and sometimes Tortilla Chips. Hope that helps!"

I added an extra tablespoon of mayo and sour cream and omitted the liquid smoke. Next time I might try adding a little red onion. Served with crackers, lemon wedges and hot sauce. YUMMY!"

I wasn't going to let $9 worth of smoked whitefish go to waste, so I added a couple more dashes of wor. sauce, 10 dashes of tabasco, an extra pinch of Old Bay, and 1T each of mayo and sour cream. My family seemed to like it (no requests for the recipe), but I was disappointed. Too much work for so little reward."

I was apprehensive that the taste would be bland, because the recipe lacks some of the \"usual gang of suspects\" in a dip, such as cream cheese, garlic, onions, etc. No worries, this allowed the flavor of the fish to come out. And it's low-fat! This dip will now be my standard dish to take to dinners and events."

I came to this site (and several others) specifically looking for it. I don't know what chef you guys mugged for this recipe, but it's as good as any that I had when I lived there!! I made my first batch using the wrong fish, (fresh catfish), and it was still delicious! Warning, if you use anything other than whiting or white fish, the seasonings have to be increased considerably! I serve this with sliced jalapenos, crackers, lemon wedges,and celery. Yummy with a capital Yum! Thanks Chuck &amp; Chris!! Someone in Texas is really delighted to have this recipe!!!"
