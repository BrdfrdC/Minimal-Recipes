"reviewBody": "I made this for Christmas Eve dinner, and everyone really liked it. To save time that day, I made it the day before, and reheating it was easy. The meat was fork tender and not dry. Because there were young children who would be eating it, and I was afraid they wouldn't like a strong smoked paprika taste, I mixed some sour cream into the gravy just before serving. It softened the smoky taste, although it was still present. I served it over wide noodles, and there was lots of gravy for the noodles. One other small change I made was to deglaze the pan with red wine after browning the meat, for more depth of flavor. I've been told I can made this again next Christmas Eve, and I'd be glad to."

We ate it the next day as people suggested that it's nicer the next day after you make it. We ate it over potatoes. We ate it the day after over rice as well as it makes quite a lot and I only made two thirds the quantity! It's also yummy over noodles!\nI will definitely make this again!\nI wonder if it freezes well, has anyone tried freezing it?"

"reviewBody": "As another reviewer mentioned this isn't technically goulash, it's more of a pörkölt, but whatever you call it it's delicious. I've actually made this a half dozen times and it is amazing how much the character changes depending on the type of paprika used. As with any other spice, make sure your paprika is fresh, as old paprika loses its flavor rapidly. \n\nAnother trick is in the reheating. By letting the meat cool and then reheating it the next day the meat firms up, becoming fork tender without falling apart. To reheat, simply put your desired portion in a saute pan over medium low heat while your noodles cook. By the time the noodles are ready your pörkölt is heated through and ready to go."

I used 32 ounces of low sodium beef broth instead of water and added a tablespoon of caraway seeds to the mixture with one can of tomato paste. Also added the rest of the left over coating mixture from the meat to the slow cooker to help thicken it a bit. Cooked it in the crock pot on low for 6 hours and it was perfect.

"reviewBody": "My husband made this today and it was quite good. The only real complaint I have is that it's VERY greasy. Since none of the other reviews mention it, I have to wonder if maybe he used too much oil when browning the stew meat. The broth was very thin as well, so it was almost more of a soup than something I would serve over pasta. However, the flavor is exceptional and the house smelled divine all day. I think next time I would use less salt and add some canned tomatoes, more onions, some green and red bell pepper and celery. I'd probably also add some flour to it to thicken up the sauce. On the whole, it's a great recipe and we will definitely have it again!"

Those who found the smoked paprika not to their liking might try cutting the amount of smoked paprika in half, especially if they used less beef. Those who found it bland might want to add a half teaspoon of marjoram or caraway seed. The best rule of thumb is to make it as written the first time, and then adjust it to your taste the next time."

"reviewBody": "This was a great fall dinner for my husband (I don't eat meat). I used all of the ingredients but used a different method because I was pressed for time. Instead of sautéing the onions, I sliced them thinly and just put them in the crockpot. With the meat, I put all the dry seasonings plus 1/4 cup of flour in a resealable bag, put the meat cubes in, shook it up, and then added that to the crockpot as well as the remaining ingredients, except for the oil, for the goulash. It turned out very well. I'm sure that the original method is also great, and I will do it that way next time, if I have time, but it's good to know you can make this savory dish faster, and I guess lower calorie too by omitting the oil. Thanks!"

My husband said he'd eat it again, so I made it a second time and I really liked it. The sour cream does cut down on the smoky flavor and cools it down if it's too hot. I make this at least once a month in the winter. It's a nice hearty comfort food."

"reviewBody": "Other than braising this on the stove-top in a Dutch oven (four hours – three was not long enough) because I started it too late for the slow cooker, I made this as is – and I can’t imagine anything could be done differently that would have improved this. I was a little gun shy using all smoked paprika and had briefly considered playing it on the “safe” side by using it half and half with sweet paprika. I thought about substituting wine or broth for the water. I entertained the idea of adding mushrooms. In the end, however, I decided against all those changes I thought might make this “better” and in so doing we had a 5-star dinner resulting in clean plates and no leftovers. The meat is fork tender and the beautiful gravy thick, rich and boldly flavored. Different paprika, broth or wine rather than water, additions such as mushrooms – all unnecessary. There was enough depth and character to the dish with the onions, tomato paste and, of course, the smoky paprika. An absolutely delicious and satisfying cold weather dish with good old-fashioned charm."

"reviewBody": "This was one of the best crockpot dishes I've ever had the pleasure of making, as well as eating! After reading several reviews I did alter the recipe quite a bit. First off, my supermarket had a special on pork stew meat, so I ended up using three pounds of that. I couldn't find smoked paprika anywhere, so I ended up using regular. I also used a rub from \"Grill Masters\" which was called \"Sweet and Smoky Rub\" which tasted phenominal! It did have smoked paprika as well as a hint of cinnamon, and also chitpolte powder. I also cut down the onion to one large one, and added two red peppers because I've heard paprikash should always contain red peppers! I also used one package of fresh baby Portabella mushrooms. I also added one can of chopped tomatoes as well as the tomato paste. I did cook it for about 5 hours on low yesterday, and when it was cool I refrigerated overnight. Tonight I threw it back in the crockpot for about three hours on low, and I did serve it over egg noodles. I had some dinner guests this evening, and they could not stop talking about how wonderful it was! I would definately make it to serve the next day, as the taste and the texture of the meat was meltingly tender. All in all....an awesome recipe!"

In place of the water I used low sodium beef broth which was even more of reason to keep the salt to a minimum. One large vidalia onion was plenty of onion for this dish. My last modification was that I used sweet Hungarian paprika in place of the smoked as my store was fresh out of smoked paprika. I always use sweet Hungarian paprika in all my goulashes and paprikash type dishes anyway, although I would love to try this with the smoked next time. I served this over egg noodles with a spoon full of sour cream on each dish. I used a large saute pan and was able to brown all my paprika covered meat at the same time, however I only used 2 lbs so that is probably why. Do try this, it is great!!"

I was fine with just a sprinkle of salt- the tomato paste has a lot of salt in it already. I'd salt to taste about an hour or so before you serve it. I used a mix of Spanish smoked paprika, and sweet Hungarian paprika (didn't want to use up all of my smoked paprika in one shot!). There was a nice hint of smoke. I only used one pound of meat- 3 lbs would have been way too much for us. This was a very flavorful and hearty dish."

This is actually closer to Paprikas, which is very good also. The key is to use SMOKED paprika. Sometimes it is very hard to find. Regular paprika does not have the same flavor. You want to try and find Pimenton dulce as that is the sweet smoke paprika. Excellent recipe!"
