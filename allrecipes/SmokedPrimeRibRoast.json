I did this a month ago and took it out of the smoker at 140, glad I didn't go anymore. I just let it sit for 30 minutes before cutting it because I was worried it was in too long. The juices settled nicely and it was a good medium throughout. Doing it again this weekend but will take earlier, sear on grill then let it sit for 30 minutes before serving."

"reviewBody": "I have done smoke cooking for years, but hadn't ever done a prime rib until now. I also really, really like prime rib, although for my taste it must be rare (135 F or less by the time it has rested and is ready to be carved).\n\nSo I thought this might be a way to make prime rib roast even better than usual, but that's not how it turned out. I more-or-less followed the recipe EXCEPT I pulled it out of the smoker at 125 F and then seared it for only about 5 minutes so as to not overcook it. It was very good, but overall disappointing because the smoke overpowered, rather than enhanced, the \"beefy\" flavour. Not worth all of the effort IMHO."

I think I'd cut back to maybe 1.5Tbsp next time. I love pepper and spicy foods, I just think it dominated the crust a little too much. Again, that's a personal preference."

"reviewBody": "I did basically the same but pulled at 120F based on multiple recipes. 145F would be so grossly overcooked it would be ruined. That would end up at 160F. Could be a typo as the roast WILL NOT be at 145F after three hours. My 8.5lb roast took 4 hours to get to 120F in my 225F smoker. Was fantastic, med-rare. It rose to about 130F while I got the oven heated up. If anything I would go a few degrees less, definitely not higher. Good recipe with incorrect temp so 2 stars as people will ruin their meat if followed completely."

We have an electric smoker so I followed these directions leaving it uncovered in the fridge during the prep stage. It worked perfectly! The meat was so tender and moist no one needed a knife. The taste was fantastic. Even my very picky 6-year-old grandson loved it and I thought my son-in-law was going to lick the platter. New holiday dish is on the list!"

"reviewBody": "I made two 7 pound roasts. Trimmed the bones off and saved the ribs for smoking later. I tied the roasts so that they were more round and even for cooking. I also poked holes into the roast and inserted whole cloves of garlic throughout. I used an electric smoker at 200 degrees and smoked with a mix of cherry and a little hickory wood for approx. 3 hours. Always use a good thermometer though. I pulled off the smoker at 115 degrees, wrapped in foil and placed into a thermal cooler till the temp got to 123 degrees. Then I reversed seared directly on a super hot gas grill for about 45 seconds on all sides to create that crispy exterior crust. This brought the temp up to about 130 degrees and after I let them rest for another 10 minutes, it sliced to perfection. Even pink from end to end with no overcooked parts. The leftovers froze well and I reheated the \"prime rib steaks\" on a hot gas grill for about 1 minute per side till they were just warmed up. They were almost better than the original prime rib. The grilling added more smoky goodness and the grill marks added texture."

I don't cook it to 145, that's in the medium + range, I only cook mine to about 122-125. Also 5-10 minutes in the screaming hot oven is usually enough, you just want a crust on it, you don't want to overcook it. Or if you have your grill going, sear it on all sides on the grill."
