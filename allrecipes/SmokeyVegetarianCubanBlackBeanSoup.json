"reviewBody": "Made as written except that I used fresh oregano and chose to use only 1 bell pepper due to personal preference. Black beans always seem hard to flavor to me but this recipe seasoned them nicely. It never really thickened for me so next time I will eliminate the water that gets added in step 4. I'm also not a vegetarian so I'll use real bacon next time but this was a great alternative for people that don't eat pork. Thanks for sharing!"
