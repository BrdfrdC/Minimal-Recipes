We have also put peanut butter on the un-microwaved graham cracker half and omitted the chocolate, although you could probably use both peanut butter and the chocolate. Good with chocolate graham crackers, too."

Last summer 2012 the state I live in was in an \"no open flame\" ban so I busted out my Crème brûlée torch and voila! I microwaved the marshmallow for 15 sec until it started to puff, then once removed from the mircowave I torched until golden, added my grahams and my hershey chocolate bar and it was S'mores heaven."

"reviewBody": "Can you believe I'm 29 years old and just having my first S'more today? I'm not a huge graham cracker fan, so I've always just skipped them and enjoyed my burned marshmallows with a side of chocolate bar. However, I wanted to make special treats to send home with my son's class for Halloween. I read a tutorial online about cutting shapes into graham crackers, and immediately, I knew I had to make a special s'more. How you do that is to lightly wet each side of the graham cracker with water and microwave for 15 seconds. The cookie cutter of your choice will cut right through the cracker. Eventually, it will firm back up. To make the s'more, I lightly brushed the outside of the marshmallow with water and rolled it in black and orange sprinkles. I placed a square of chocolate upside down (so the design wouldn't show through) on top of the cut-out square, and I placed the marshmallow on the full half. I microwaved the chocolate graham for 10 seconds alone before adding the marshmallow graham to microwave for an additional 10 seconds. Carefully and quickly, I made the sandwich as soon as the timer went off. These are sure to delight the kids, and they are tasty, despite the graham crackers. :)"

To change it up I use chocolate grahams and dark chocolate or dark chocolate flavored with something like orange or raspberry or sea salt and of course the toasted marshmallow; variations are endless. Easy and really hits the spot when you get a craving for something sweet. When indoors I simply turn on my gas stovetop (not recommended for children to do) and carefully toast my marshmallow that way."

"reviewBody": "It usually works better to heat the marshmallow over glowing embers rather than an open fire for several reasons: less smoke, less danger of catching yourself on fire, embers have a more even temperature, and the marshmallow is less likely to catch on fire. In my family, we can't have a campfire without s'mores. I have made Broiler S'mores (there is a recipe on this site) when the weather does not cooperate for a fire."

A couple things that I have found in my experience, however is to make sure you use campfire type marshmallows, they don't expand and fall off the fork as much. \n\nThe other thing is that if you like your chocolate melted instead of hard you can also, while you are roasting the marshmallow, put the chocolate on one half of your graham cracker for about a minute or so before your marshmallow is done and it will get it to just right. Make sure you be careful after that though as the graham cracker gets very hot. Tastes wonderful though!"

"reviewBody": "The s'mores were so good that my family and I couldn't get enough. However due to the weather I decided to just put them in the oven and they still came out great. I put the chocolate bars and marshmallows on top of the graham crackers on a cookie sheet in a 400 degree oven for about 2 mins. We took them out and then put another graham cracker on top and it was excellent."
