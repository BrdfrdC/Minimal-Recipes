"reviewBody": "My normal filet marinade takes 24 hours, so when we decided at the last minute to make some filets we had in the freezer, I was on the hunt for something that didn't need that long and turned to this recipe, given all the great reviews. For starters, the marinade smelled and tasted fantastic!! I was extremely excited about how my steak would taste, simply based on the marinade. It was also super quick to whip up with ingredients I had on hand. 5-stars for that. The only reason I'm rating it lower than 5 stars is because I definitely disagree with the 30 minute marinade time. We gave it about 45 mins (again, this was a last minute dinner idea so we were pressed for time), which was no where near long enough. =( The steaks barely picked up the flavoring of the marinade and because of that, tasted pretty bland. We'll definitely be trying it again - but only when we have several hours (or overnight) to marinate."

Absolutely delicious. We tried it with and without the blue cheese - great both ways. Thank you to JDVMD for sharing the recipe. Yum!!"

My husband did a great job with the grilling of the steaks. The instruction/heat time was perfect for a medium-rare steak. The flavor was outstanding, and the bleu cheese was a perfect topping. Served these with 'Grilled Rock Lobster Tails', 'Grilled Sweet Onion' both from AR and grilled Parmesan green beans. Definitely a 5-star meal tonight."

I couldn't find filet mignon at our commissary anywhere so I went with 4 strip steaks and they worked fine. Everyone really loved this. Except me. I mean the toppings were tasty and all but the steak still tasted just like... well, steak. I didn't think the marinade did much for it. On the upside, I left two of the steaks in the marinade overnight and cooked them today, sliced thin and had steak salad for lunch. That was superb. I might make again."

I substituted Feta for the blue cheese, just a taste preference, but it turned out really good as well."

"reviewBody": "I made this a few nights ago for our Valentine’s Day dinner along with potatoes and roasted asparagus. I was surprised by the short marinating time, but followed the recipe. I caramelized the onions earlier in the day and zapped them in the microwave just before topping the grilled filets. Rather than try to top the steaks while standing over a searing grill, we brought them inside, topped them with the onions and blue cheese and popped them under the broiler just until the cheese began to melt. Hubs and I both like our filets and we really enjoyed the caramelized onions on this. But we both agreed the blue cheese overwhelmed all the other flavors, even though I skimped on it a bit. For us the blue cheese was about all we could taste. So our conclusion is that we’ll definitely make this again, but skip the blue cheese entirely. I guess it’s just not for us. I do think, however, a balsamic glaze drizzled over the onions/steaks would be fabulous!"

You would think that filet mignon would not absorb a lot of marinade because it is so moist but it does. The only changes I made were to cut the sugar in half and use brown sugar instead of white and I used gorgonzola because that was what I had. Fantastic!"

This has potential to be 5 stars if I correct my technique. Would prob cook on outdoor grill next time. . . smoked out my house and steak is just so good on grill! Would cook a little longer at med-high instead. The marinade and caramelized onions made this. . . great dish! Thanks!"

I offered blue cheese and goat cheese. Thanks so much, I will definitely make this many times this summer!UPDATE: Less than a week later, I used the marinade on some steak/onion kabobs on the grill, then sprinkled with blue cheese crumbles when done. Not exactly the same but at was wonderful as well!"

"reviewBody": "I am reviewing the marinade only, as we used a cream sauce with onion and blue cheese for the topping instead (from the tasty kitchen site...very good, by the way). The marinade did impart some sweetness to the filets (my boyfriend commented on the sweetness immediately with the first bite), but other than that, I didn't think it did anything for the steaks in terms of flavor. Also, for those who are planning on searing the steaks indoors, take note: the balsamic vinegar caused problems when I went to pan-sear the steaks. I patted the steaks dry, removing as much moisture as possible from the marinade, and used Mark Bittman's technique for searing that requires less heat than normal (a method I have used over and over again with great success and zero smoke). The balsamic vinegar burned almost immediately, even on moderate heat, filling the kitchen with particularly acrid smoke. While the steaks were cooked to a lovely medium rare, the burnt balsamic black crust was a detraction. That being said, I think the onion-blue cheese combo is a nice touch, and our cream sauce used similar flavors - all I did differently was add cream to the onions after they were caramelized, reduced that by about half, and then melted some blue cheese into the sauce - a nice option if you want a milder blue cheese flavor."
