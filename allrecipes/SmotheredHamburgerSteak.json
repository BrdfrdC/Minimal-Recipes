Kids did say that it seemed a little dry, but I may have cooked the burgers too long before putting into sauce. I made a couple changes to it. Instead of beef cube, I used beef broth. I put 2 tablespoons into beef mixture. Instead of 1 can of water I used 1 can of beef broth. I really enjoyed it and would make it again. Might use bread crumbs though as I didn't prefer the larger chunks of bread that remained in the finished product."

"reviewBody": "It may be due to my substitutions, but to me this recipe was bland. I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so I used onion powder instead of minced onion and concentrated beef broth (made from a bouillon cube) instead of beef base. I don't typically have minced onion or beef base on hand, so I may continue experimenting to adjust this recipe to my existing pantry items and taste. I was also confused about whether to mix the bread chunks in with the beef when making the patties, but I mixed in the bread anyway because the recipe didn't say to remove the bread. This resulted in some pretty large, soggy bread pieces in the steaks even after cooking. Next time I will rip the bread into smaller pieces. With a few tweaks to fit my preferences and what I usually have on hand, I think this recipe has potential to be a staple dinner in our house because of \nits ease!"

I tried going without but the patties were falling apart in my hands so the crumbs definitely helped thicken it up. I tasted the \"gravy\" and it was a little bland so I added salt, pepper and garlic powder. After cooking for 20min. it was still pretty thin so I added 2 teaspoons of flour to thicken up the gravy. Next time I will probably just try half a can of water and see if that helps but Hubby approved and this is going in our keep box! :)"

I only had 20 oz of hamburger--though I did not scale it. I added a few tbsp of the soup mix to the mushroom gravy as well (served over buttered noodles). Everyone loved it, kids and adults!"

Instead of beef base, I just used a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Used fresh red onion instead of minced, and a few hawaiian rolls instead of white bread. These turned out perfect, and were a huge hit. I will definetely make these again."

I salvaged my gravy by adding Kitchen Bouquet browning &amp; seasoning sauce. I'll make these patties again, but not with canned soup."

He ate until he couldn't eat anymore. Said it was the best hamburger steak he had since his mom, who is now in her 80's and doesn't cook anymore, had made them for him years and years ago. :)"

The only different thing I did was to add half of a beef bouillon cube to the sauce mixture. The gravy is great over mashed potatoes with green beans on the side. I'm sure we'll be having this quickie dinner again, thanks!"

THANKS!"

The steaks held together well, and beef base and worchestershire sauce flavored the steaks just right. I would suggest spraying the pan before browning the meat. I cooked in an electric skillet which was large enough to cook all of the patties at once. Thanks for a good and easy recipe."
