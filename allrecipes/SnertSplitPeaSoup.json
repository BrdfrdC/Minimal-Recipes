Figured I could get away with that because I used smoked bacon and the ham hocks were smoked, so there would be plenty of smoked flavor--and there was! Will definitely be making this recipe again."

I'm sure the hocks would have added a deeper ham flavor, but we loved this recipe anyways! We crumbled cooked chopped bacon over the top to give it some additional texture. Hearty and so good. Even better the next day!"

Nice and thick, you'll need to add water for leftovers. I sped things up a bit at my wife's suggestion by boiling the peas first. You don't need to do it all in the crock pot. Just give all the ingredients enough time in the crock pot for the flavors to blend....say a couple of hours."

Spice mix in this recipe was tasty.\n We were introduced to this soup in Amsterdam: comfort food at its best.\n\nHave also made this with chicken sausage, and leftover ham bone.\nSecret to this soup is slow cooking, but my slow cooker had things too mushy when cooked that long on 'high', you may want to try this for the first time when you are able to babysit it a little, as all these cookers vary."

I also added 1/2 tsp cumin at the suggestion of other reviewers, and 1/8 tsp clove. I ommitted the salt and used the ham bone and tons of chopped ham from a spiral ham. Rather than chopped strips of bacon, I used about half of a 2-1/2 oz pack of real bacon pieces. (I get them from Aldi for $1.29, and they are great to have on hand!) The soup came out phenomenally perfect, served with corn bread"

At the time, I thought the addition of thyme, nutmeg and clove seemed odd but I added it anyway. It was awful and ended up throwing out the entire pot of soup. I am remaking it tonight with a ham hock without the above spices and no sausage. It will be just the way I like it."

"reviewBody": "Super delicious! I just returned from a trip to Amsterdam and wanted to reproduce the delicious pea soup I had there. This is just the thing! The grocery store didn't have any ham hocks, so I had to use a piece of salt pork instead. It wasn't as thick as I wanted it to be even though I left the lid off the crock pot for a couple of hours so I will add less water next time. Once I work out the liquid issue, this recipe is a keeper.\nEdit 11/4/2018 I made it again with one less cup of water and the consistency was perfect. I used smoked pork neck bones this time so I got the richness from the bones in the soup. It turned out to be too salty this time so next time I'll do it the same way and omit the salt altogether."

I can't cook so most of my meals turn out as eat able so it was a home run on this one. I went back and forth on whether to fry the bacon first and opted not to.

I've already had a \"sample\" bowl and it's not even supper time yet. ;) Making some of those cheese/garlic biscuits to go with it. Yummmmm (BTW, it is 98 degrees here in NC today. Why wait for Winter when you have a/c inside the house!) So glad I didn't wait to make this!"

It is a much stronger spice than I anticipated, and though my soup still turned out great with it, I would prefer the soup better without the ground cloves."

"reviewBody": "Love the Dutch name and the soup tastes very good but the recipe has serious problems. The dried split peas are well cooked, breaking up and coloring the soup in an hour or less, nowhere near the 3 to 4 hours in the recipe. Altitude makes a difference and I'm at 200 ft. but one would have to be in Flagstaff, AZ, 7,000 ft., for it to take 3-4 hours. Diced potatoes will cook in less than half an hour and be absolute mush in an hour so the two additional hours in the recipe is way way too long. Also, the bacon does add a good flavor to the soup but the recipe should call for it to be fried to near crisp. The salt needed is more like 3/4 tsp than 1/2 and, although I'm not a spicy food fan, I did use 1 tsp fresh ground black pepper rather than the 1/2 tsp called for. I also used a large pot, one gallon, which was just the right size."

"reviewBody": "UPDATE 4/2/ 2015: Had almost all the ingredients this time (minus the leek)...and it was awesome!! I did not soak the peas overnight. I fried the bacon until crisp and tore into pieces, and I sauteed the onion. Put a very meaty ham bone, bacon, peas, sauteed onion, chicken stock and water into the crock on high for the first hour; then turned to low. After 5 hours, I took out the ham bone, removed the meat and added meat back in...also put in the potatoes, carrots, garlic and celery at this time. After another two hours, I added all of the spices, sausage slices and 1 cup water. It was perfectly done in a total of 10 hours cooking. Lots of left overs for the freezer with only two of us...but the husband wants it for dinner again tomorrow night! ORIGINAL: This soup had a very pleasant flavor...even though I didn't have all the right ingredients. I had a VERY meaty ham bone in place of the ham hock, no bacon, no leek and no sausage. But I followed the recipe with everything else. The peas were soaked overnight prior to putting them into the slow cooker. The ham bone was cooked for the first 6 hours after which time I took it out and let it cool to remove the meat...adding the meat back into the cooker. At the very end, I used my immersible blender and gave it a few swirls to thicken the soup up a bit. I never had to add any additional liquid. Served with home made corn bread, and it made a delicious winter meal. I hope to have sausage on hand next time! Thanks for sharing!"
