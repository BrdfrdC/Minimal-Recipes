Simple math.) I packaged it in a Ziploc, and added a smaller Ziploc of topping mix, and a plastic tub containing the eggs and butter, and left it in the workplace fridge (in a cute gift bag) for my Secret Santa. I agree with the reviewer who said the other ingredients should be included if it's a gift (if possible). Hope it tastes good!"

I made it with butter flavored shortening since I was low on butter and they came out perfect - a bit crisp on the outside - but chewy in the middle. I also added 1 tsp. vanilla - just something I do with every cookie recipe. One thing I do with my sugar cookies is add 1 tsp vanilla/1/2 tsp orange flavor and I bet that would work with this cookie also - just a a bit of a change. These are now being made as 'cookie in a bag' to give out during the holidays. Right now they're adorable with Fall/Halloween decorations on the bag with the recipe on the back of the bag. Thanks for a great cookie! Makes about 4 doz or so, plenty for our family...so on day three I can tell you that they were still nice, fresh and chewy. The last two will be gone after I make my coffee this a.m.!"

Everyone else seemed to love the cookies though, so maybe it was just me! I still gave it 5 stars because the recipients of the gifts loved them."

I didn't feel right giving almost all of the ingredients. I put the 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon in colored cling wrap and tied it with a bow. I had room to put it inside my jar as I had extra room, but if you didn't you could tie it to the jar. Overall it turned out to be a nice gift"

The bottoms of the cookies stuck to the cookie sheet and were very messy and crumbly. 2. The presentation in the jar is not very attractive to give as a gift. People would at first wonder why you are giving them a jar of flour, which is what it looks like with the all-white mixture. I will stick to the pretty mixtures where the colors vary."

Its very easy to mix together as it does not get so hard like most cookie doughs and it doesnt require refridgeration. Its delicious with that authentic Snickerdoodle taste (much better than starbucks!). Theres virtually no baking time limit (8-16 minutes) as it does not burn easily. Very kid friendly. I would have loved rolling the dough into balls like playdough and rolling it in the cinnamonsugar. This would make an awesome cookie in a jar gift as it requires VERY little extra items. The cinnamon sugar can be packaged into smaller jelly jars that can be bought in supermarkets. I loved the cookies and everyone loved them. Not to sweet with the perfect snickerdoodle tang."

"reviewBody": "I love this cookie in a jar recipe. It made the best snickerdoodle cookies and they were very easy to do. I quit baking a long time ago because of the hassle of measuring and not have the ingredients, like cream of tartar, I needed to make the cookie I wanted. Now I make several jars up and everything is handy to make a quick treat without the hassle. This one is my favorite so far."
