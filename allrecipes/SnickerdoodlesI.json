I did end up keeping these in the oven for an extra few minutes since my baking pan size caused the cookies to somewhat melt together (it like squish? I don’t understand how to describe it). Overall, though, this was a great recipe, and when I make it again I’ll probably make a half recipe"

However, in the oven it puffed up super big so it looked just like a scone and not a flat cookies. I think it is because I added too much baking soda. Make sure you add a little less baking soda to get the flat thin cookie feel. Great, easy, simple recipe that is perfect to serve at gatherings."

"reviewBody": "This was my first time baking snickerdoodle cookies and these turned out excellent! I made alternations based on other reviews. Butter-flavored shortening is a must. I added 1 1/2 tsp of Dominican vanilla extract. I planned to bake it for 6 mins so it didn’t overcook, but it wasn’t enough. The center looked uncooked. I realized this AFTER taking them out, and placing them on a cooling rack ( cooling rack is also a must) and eating one. So I put it back in the oven, same temp preheated and baked it for 2 more mins. It turned out perfect in texture. Slightly crispy on the edges, chewy on the inside. So the next batch will bake for 6 mins, cool, then bake for another 2 mins — I’m too scared to try it any other way, they were that good!"

This little gem is delicious :) I never ate let alone made this cookie before and followed the recipe exactly. They puffed up in the oven and when they came out they flattened just a little which made them crackle a bit. I did not roll them in cinnamon and sugar because cinnamon makes my blood sugar drop but I just sprinkled a little on top before cooking. I also added vanilla in the shortening mixture. Will definitely make these again but I will not wait for the holidays that's for sure. Thanks for this great recipe."
