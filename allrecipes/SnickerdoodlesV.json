I loved the texture - I had left them in about an extra 90 seconds which caused them to crack on top. they had soft middles and chewy, crispy outsides. The cream of tartar adds a lot. I've tried recipes without it but these are better. Because at their core they are butter/sugar cookies, I used butter instead of shortening. I used salted and used only a 1/8th teaspoon of salt."

My only suggestion would be to maybe bake them for a tiny bit less time than the recommendation, but thats definitely up to your preference. My oven tends to be a little on the hotter side so I almost burned them but they were still awesome."

I didn’t have eggs, only a carton of egg whites. I used about 5 oz (weight) of egg whites and I added 2 Tbs of butter milk to replace the fat of the yolk. It worked like a champ! So crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, but not too sweet."

It will not replace my Mrs Sigg’s recipe from this site but it was a very good recipe when I needed to use mostly shortening. I’m typically only a butter baked. I used the middle sized Pampered Chef scoop and the full 10 minutes was perfect. I used parchment, because I always do. Thanks for the recipe!"

I also forgot the cream of tartar, and I thought all hope was lost. They didn’t have the nice crack, but they were puffed up without being too thick. I also cut down the flour by 1/4 cup and I’m glad I did. Dough was perfect— more flour would’ve made it too thick in my opinion. 9 min was ideal baking time. Overall, butter isn’t that big of a deal."

They turned out fantastic by following the recipe exactly as written. No changes needed even at high altitude (8500 ft). That is often a challenge, but not with this recipe. Thank you!"

Added about a T real maple syrup. 3. I have a teeny tiny oven and dark cookie sheets, so I turned the temp down to 350, baked the cookies for 8 minutes, then opened the door (turned the oven off) and let them sit for a few minutes more (I was only making one pan... The rest of the dough went in the fridge for a later time). They were wonderful!!!! A little crunchy around the edges, chewy on the inside - hum-yum!!"

I bake 1000's of cookies for family, and these always defeated me! NOT ANY MORE! Thank you Amy for posting this recipe. These cookies turned out perfect. The only thing I did different was added vanilla and cut out the salt. The texture is very pleasing, and the ease of the recipe is wonderful. I doubled the recipe in a leap of faith and I am happy to add these to my cookie bar on Christmas Eve!"

I then refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours (covered) then bake.They turn out to be the softest, with just a hint of chewy"
