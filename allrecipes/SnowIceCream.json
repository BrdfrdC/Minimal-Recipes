This can easily be scaled down and adjusted to your tastes (using chocolate, different sauces and add ins). I've always mixed the sugar, vanilla, and milk together and then the snow, which helps get rid of some of the grainy-ness that comes along with adding sugar after. Love to make this with my toddler--and she can help!"

"reviewBody": "Fun and very easy. My 3 yr old thought this was the \"best ice cream\" lol It really was pretty good, we each had a bowl. I reduced this recipe for 2 servings. Before I went out to gather clean snow, I whisked together the milk, sugar and vanilla until well mixed and a little frothy. With a plastic rice scooper, I scooped snow into a plastic 8 cup measure bowl with my 4 cups needed. Then used the scoop to mix the milk mixture into the snow. No lumps, just smooth snowy ice cream. Great use of a snow day and making memories as I remember my mom doing with me."

It was really good...we even cut it into 1/4 of the original recipe due to the amount of snow we had. Easy to do and was a hit with our kiddos. \n**One tip...be sure to pack the snow when you measure it. That way it will be a good consistency when you mix the other ingredients."

"reviewBody": "Wow, I guess I thought my family was the only ones who really made this! Most people you know have never heard of it. When I went to put it in my recipe book, I googled it-dang! We would not have been able to wait for snow to fill up a gallon though! We would just go out, after a few inches of freshly fallen snow, and use the largest bowl we could find and heap it full of clean snow. We used evaporated milk (unless all we had was regular milk) and sometimes half evaporated milk and half regular. Sometimes we didn't have vanilla and it's good without it too. We never premixed ingredients-we loved the crunchiness of the granulated sugar-well, what kid doesn't?! Just sprinkle sugar across top (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup), add vanilla (we did 1/2 to 1 tsp per large bowl), and stir in milk to get the consistency you want! Never tried to change it up-it was perfect the way it is! Very sweet, very rich! Grab a bowl and a warm blanket and enjoy! You can try this in a small bowl first-just a dash of sugar, vanilla, and milk to see if you like it!"

Mine appeared to be pretty dry still, but as you stir all the ingredients up and it begins to melt a bit, it works out perfectly. I also used Superfine sugar (you can find that in the baking aisle in a box) because some reviewers mentioned the texture of the sugar made it gritty. We will definitely be making this again the next time it snows. New family tradition for sure!!!"

I followed this recipe except I used a can of evaporated milk. Probably a little more vanilla than called for but it was awesome! My grandson added cocoa powder to his and after tasting it, it too was awesome. Because he had to stir to dissolve the cocoa though, his was more of the consistency of chocolate milk. Great recipe though."

I made a special batch with Splenda instead of sugar and heavy cream instead of milk for me...low carb deliciousness! For our next batch we're going to add broken Oreos. Thanks so much for this recipe!"

You should've mixed the sugar, milk, and vanilla in a separate bowl before combining it with the snow and then there is no problem. Also for those that add egg just be careful since you are consuming a raw egg. This is the exact same recipe my Mother used when I was growing up and my brother and I loved making it. It's not suppose to be the best tasting ice cream in the world, it is just fun. So loosen up and enjoy some time with your kiddos and make snow ice cream!"

And they loved it too!\nMy only thought for next time is to warm the milk a bit to fully dissolve the sugar, and then re-chill the milk/sugar mixture. I think that may help the gritty texture from the cane sugar while eating the \"ice cream\"."

I beat 1 c. milk, 1/2 c. sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla &amp; 1 egg in a large bowl, then add snow until it's all absorbed. Needs to be eaten immediately. The egg makes it taste more like homemade ice cream."

There are 2 snow ice cream recipes I made on this site, this one and the Snow Ice Cream I, I totally prefer this recipe over the other one hands down. This one was very much light, flavorful, and sweet. My sugar brokedown and melded with the recipe very nicely. My mom made snow ice cream all the time when I was a kid living in Newfoundland because it snowed all the time.. She alway used evaporated milk and it was awesome. But I won't be eating that way ever again because of this recipe. My family was soo impressed that I made 2 batches. And changed the 2nd batch by replacing the vanilla extract with Imitation Strawberry Extract and red food coloring to make Strawberry Snow Ice Cream...my family totally said this recipe ROCKS. I think using milk in this recipe made it light an airy. And I totally could replace the sugar with splenda and use lowfat milk. Awesome. it's a total keeper. Thank you very very much."
