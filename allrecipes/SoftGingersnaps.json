I also added 2 tbs of granulated sugar along with a little less than a forth of cake flour on top of the 2 cups of all purpose. THe dough was super runny but I just decided to put it in the oven anyway and hope for the best. They came out perfectly ! Soft and chewy with a little crust around the edges too. I put them in for about 16 minutes as well. SO good and I will definitely make again. Boyfriend said they great and he ate 5. His friends liked them as well. I'm super picky about my ginger bread and this was just too good. Thanks!!"

"reviewBody": "Loved this easy recipe! I didn't have shortening on hand, so I used 1:1 butter. I also used semi-heaping scoops of spices (and additional 1/4tsp of nutmeg - it's the Italian secret spice for everything!) for a more flavorful cookie. After an hour chilling in the fridge and 12 minutes exactly at 350F, these little goodies turned out incredible. \n\nThis is a bit obvious with using butter versus shortening, but the cookies spread slightly rather than the pillowly bites pictures. The result was still incredibly tasty!\n\nHelpful Note to Self: Combine wet ingredients as usual before adding dry ingredients. The creamed butter/sugar mixture first makes for a better cookie. The original avenue required an extra egg to get the usual end product."

"reviewBody": "I don't write reviews as a rule because it's really so subjective but Ginger cookies are my husbands favorite and I decided to try this recipe because my tried and true one involves melting butter, mixing with molasses and getting it to room temp. Lot of work and I didn't have the time. These were wonderful! my only changes were bumping the ginger to 1 1/2 teas, just a pinch of clove, and a dash of salt as others have said. They were perfect and made the kitchen smell real old school and cozy. If your oven temp is true, you bake at the low end of the range (8 mins), use parchment paper, and measure correctly, it should not be crumbly dough or be crispy throughout after baking. I'd check things out, measure exactly and try again. I believe they are worth it!"

If you have health issues like myself, I would never use shortening in anything. Beat the butter (or shortening) with the sugar's until fluffy, then beat in the eggs and molasses. I cook and bake often and the thing that did get me a little confused is how they separated the flour and why? I will make these again. Wish I knew how to post a picture, but they look just like the recipe picture shows. Soft and yummy cookies. Just an additional comment here--I see they want to know if you tweaked the recipe at all and want you to pay a membership to tell them what you did. Hmmmm, seems to me if a person tweak's it to make it better why would a person want to pay to share it."

The only recommendation I would make is to make sure the molasses is well mixed into the other ingredients. I had a few where the molasses had clumped a little and spilled out of the cookie, which then burned to the cookie sheet. But it only happened to two out of the 3 dozen...not bad. I used my electric mixer, which made this a super easy recipe. The dough was really easy to work with, and the final result was deliciously spiced for a Christmas cookie!"

I'm terrible at making cookies properly the first try and I managed to make these. \n\nI made some minor adjustments for my family`s taste by not using cloves and using all spice and I used an additional tsp of cinnamon. If you like soft gingerbread men like my little ones do, you can roll the dough and cut it with ease. \n\nI made 36 ginger snaps and 12 small gingerbread men with this. The serving size is a bit off, just the ginger snaps at the recommended rolling size would have easily made 48+."

"reviewBody": "What a find! I'm glad to be the first reviewer of this recipe so that I can bring this now formally initiated recipe to your attention with my 5-star review! I don't generally like teeny cookies but these are SERIOUSLY adorable. The dough is easy to work with and the cookies come out of the oven perfectly round with those cute little cracks we love in gingersnaps. I prepared the recipe as is, save for adding a quarter teaspoon of salt to heighten flavor, and I'm not even so sure that made a noticeable difference. I also used the more traditional method of creaming the sugar and shortening, adding the egg and molasses, then adding ALL of the combined dry ingredients. All brown sugar all but guarantees these will be as soft as their name says they will be, and the spice is just right. They're not just good, they're \"D\" good. No wonder the submitter's friends ask her for this recipe!"
