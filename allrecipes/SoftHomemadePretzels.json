This is not to say that they wee terrible, but I wound up slicing them open (I shaped them like logs), and putting butter on them. I would not recommend this recipe for pretzel-making, however, I suspect that if you add ingredients as others have suggested (cinnamon, cheddar, etc.), they might be good for that."

I made one batch, and they were so good I made them again on the same day :) The changes I made were letting the yeast, water and sugar sit for about five min before I started, and for the second batch, I mixed in some cheddar cheese to the dough. Would recommend eating these with mustard!"

"reviewBody": "It was raining outside and I wanted to make something new. Why not pretzels? I went through a bunch of recipes, but this one seemed easiest. And it was! I used brown sugar instead of regular sugar,only 3 cups of flour (as suggested) and I boiled them because others said to (I didn't boil one and it is just as good...so I won't next time). I did do the water, yeast and sugar first and let it sit for a few minutes, but that's really all I did differently. These were so easy and my husband likes them. This is definitely a keeper and one to do again and again!!! There is really no reason to change anything! Great recipe!!!!!\n*update: made them again...didn't boil. They smell and look great...smoother. Next time I will make 15 smaller ones. Never thought I would make bread....never say never!"

I managed to make 16 pretzels with this recipe, once I got the consistency of the dough right it ended up being just a bit more than the called for measurements. Also, I baked mine for about 18 mins at 375Â°C to achieve a perfect golden brown."

The only thing I changed after reading reviews was the amount of flour. I only added 3 cups. Dough came out perfect. Instead of shortening, I melted 1 tablespoon of butter. I WILL be making these again!"

I use vegetable shortening. Main thing I'd like to point out is to make sure you MELT THE SHORTENING! I was moving pretty quick cooking other things etc. and I didn't melt the shortening, the dough was impossible and I thought I added too much flour. Also, I wouldn't use packed cups of flour, I just scooped out rough cups of flour with out packing them and everything comes out excellent. Great recipe!"

I won't win awards for their looks, but these did disappear quickly. : )"

I use an upside down cookie sheet with paper and after the dough raises I put the Pretzels in a bath of boiling water and baking soda for about 10 to 30 seconds. Then I put them on the parchment paper and brush them with egg whites and salt them and bake at a higher temperature of 425 to really get a crunchy and chewy pretzel."

The baking time was much more than listed on the recipe, so adjust the time according to your oven as every oven is different. But, having said that, how could you not enjoy homemade pretzels?"
