I rolled the dough balls (snicker doodles style) in raw sugar to give it a pleasant crunch shell to the super soft innards. I did add in colored sugar with the raw to give it a festive Christmas look this time around."

My favorite sugar cookie comes crisp edges and soft chewy centers but I wanted to find one that was all-over soft. Too much like a biscuit according to my grandson. Still searching. ( I think there is too much flour in recipe by at least 1/4 cup, maybe more and yes I spooned and leveled )"

I also made this same recipe adding the vanilla along with a smidge of lemon extract and grated nutmeg. There is a lot of versatility in this recipe but the fact that the cookie consistency itself is so nice makes it a standard recipe to keep in your file to be able to add whatever extract or spices you want while keeping the basic baking chemistry the same. thank you for this recipe. a keeper for me"

I rolled out about 3/4 tsp each and came out with 72 cookies. I would highly recommend making these. I use regular sugar and colored with liquid food coloring for topping. Only laid sugar out on freezer paper after coloring....I did not put in oven. Worked out fine. LOVE THESE COOKIES!!! baked for 8-10 mins instead of 10-12."

For me, the gluten free version spreads well on its own, but I have to slightly flatten the regular cookies with a cup. The final result does turn out a little salty, so I will try reducing the salt a bit. But they are gone in a flash at our house."

These turned out great first time! After making the dough I put it in the fridge for 30 minutes then rolled it out and used cookie cutters for Xmas cookies. Rolled out about 1/4” thick and they get thicker while baking but don’t spread out so you can position lots on the pan. I’ve already written this one down on paper for a permanent keeper. Thank you."

This recipe makes me look I’ve been baking for years. The only thing I had to change was swapping all butter for shortening as recommended by the organization to keep the cookie from going rancid before reaching destination. I used butter flavor crisco and added 4 tsp of water to account for the conversion. The batter was ridiculously easy to work with after mixing so I decided not to refrigerate as I originally planned. I dipped in Halloween colored sprinkles and baked. The cookies turned out awesome! Buttery and chewy with the right amount of sweetness! We almost ate them all and I had to make a second batch so I would have enough to ship!! This recipe is great and I’ll be using this as my “go to” cookie batter for sure! Thanks for sharing!!!!"

But, on regular trays, the bottoms burn quickly and the tops don't even feel fully cooked. Not sure why because my other cookies are fine on the regular trays. It was just these ones. Also, I thought the picture up top was what they would be. Definitely not, but that was my mistake."

The only substitution I made to the later batches was to turn the heat up about 5-10 degrees and cut the baking time down to like 8 or so minutes before letting them cool and set for at least twenty more minutes. The result is a soft chewy cookie. Thanks for this recipe!"

I made these and was in the mood for a lemon cookie so I used lemon extract rather than vanilla BUT I can tell by the texture and taste of the cookie that they would be phenomenal sugar cookies. They are soft and moist. The recipe didn’t specify the consistency of the butter. I used it straight from the fridge and my mixture didn’t form well for me, stayed crumbly, so I reached in a used my hands. Came out perfect."

A friend suggested putting the dough in the fridge for an hour then try again. It helped but was still not much better. If you are going to make these I would stick to the balls, per the recipe, unless you are a seasoned baker. They were not very sweet. You need to ice them for sure. I think if I had more experience under my belt it would have gone better."

We used cookie cutters &amp; we had to refrigerate the dough for a little while, maybe 45 minutes, and were able to roll it out &amp; cut shapes. We iced them using the sugar cookie icing recipe.

Came out soft, yet firm enough..just perfect cookies! I made larger cutouts so I had to cook for about 15 minutes. Looking forward to making this recipe during Christmas. I was running low on butter and had to substitute 1/3 cup of butter flavored Crisco. They turned out amazing I have zero complaints with my substitute. Will make again following recipe exactly."
