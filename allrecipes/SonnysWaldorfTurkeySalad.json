There seemed to be so much crunch going on that when it came time to add the apple, I just did a few tblsps. I also added a little extra sugar. I found that it really needed a little salt, so a few shakes before serving really made a big difference. Thanks for the great recipe that I'm sure to make again!"

I made as instructed with just a few minor changes. Used left over turducken from Christmas, added more mayo, 2 dashes of chipotle pepper (we like heat) and substituted gram masala for the curry (don't think we've found the right brand yet). I'll be making this again for the next holiday with family."

"reviewBody": "As tempting as it may be, don't mess around with this recipe too much. It is fabulous!! I made the dressing as-is, but used 1/2 fat free mayo and 1/2 fat free sour cream because I tripled the recipe and ran out of mayo. I stuck my finger in the dressing and tasted it . . . and I got a bit nervous because I wasn't sure this was going to work at all. I almost threw it out but I decided to see it through as see where this recipe was going. No turkey on hand, so I oven baked 3 large breasts with olive oil, salt, and pepper - about 30 minutes. I also only had glazed walnuts, so I chopped them very fine, threw them in, and crossed my fingers that they wouldn't be too sweet. I held my breath and pulled it all together. WOW! WOW!! WOW!!! I'm telling you - the pop of the curry, the zing of the vinegar, the bite of the red onion, the sweet of the fruit, and the salty-peppery chicken was AMAZING. The glazed walnuts added a fun \"nut candy\" effect that we loved. It is a bit of work to put this together, so make sure you make ALOT of it so you can enjoy it more than once. I have a little left over and can't wait to try it tomorrow after the flavors have really had a chance to blend. Thank you SKYBLUE1963!!"
