"reviewBody": "Amazing! So easy and everyone loved it. I used cocoa powder on each layer instead of the chocolate shavings and added a bit more Amaretto. I added the 2 Tbs Amaretto to the Marscapone mixture and it had such a lovely texture and soft flavor that I didn't want to mess that up so I added a splash more Amaretto to the coffee. Turned out perfectly, not too strong. I needed more than 1 cup of coffee and had to make more, so it is true that you just dip the ladyfingers fairly quickly. It didn't turn out soggy though, so next time I will probably make 1.5 cups of coffee. I had to use pound cake because my store was out of ladyfingers, and it still turned out great. Will make again and again and thanks to everyone for the tips!"

"reviewBody": "I made it 3 times this week to perfect it for my mom’s bday. Here is what I learned: 1) The marscapone needs to sit out to get warm for it to whisk easily. Don’t beat it to be faster! That makes it curdle. 2) Coffee brewed at 3x the normal strength is almost as good as espresso. 3) Cocoa tastes better than shaved chocolate. 4) It’s significantly better after 2 days! Just as good as in an expensive Italian restaurant."

I served it in a decorative ice bucket (clear glass). It looked much like a trifle without the gelatins, fruit etc. I shaved chocolate wheals above the top layer of grated chocolate."

But this is by far the BEST Tiramisu ever (and I've made &amp; eaten many)\n\nPS...If your ladyfingers are too soggy then you are letting them soak in the espresso too long. They are like sponges so just dip them for a few seconds."

"reviewBody": "Easy and turned out great. The only thing is: I had to use more than 8 oz of espresso because ladyfingers absorb liquid very quickly. I'm not sure I would use so much espresso next time. Maybe next time I would even do one layer soaked (like the bottom layer) and the second layer unsoaked because although I love espresso it was slightly overpowering. It still gets five stars because it is so incredibly easy with no baking required. Can't beat that!"
