We loved it. We have tried many different cornbread recipes (some gluten free) and some with buttermilk, etc. I just happened to only have sour cream so needed something that would work with what I have on hand. I will definitely make this one again."

I assuming they said not to use stone ground because it would make it too heavy or mushy . Does anyone know the reason? Was anyone else's gritty or textured due to reg cornmeal? I did add can of drained corn for texture &amp; replaced some white sugar for brown for depth. The taste was wonderful &amp; you didn't need added butter when eating. Of course sour cream makes it delicious &amp; moist so much better than using milk."

If you leave it out it will get moldy."

Low and behold,I used baking powder mistakenly,so I added 1 tsp baking soda. I tasted the batter and to me it was still a little sweet,so I sprinkled a bit more salt in. I was not sure how it would turn out,but it was scrumptious! I've been baking over 50 years,so I kind of know what to do when I screw up a recipe. Again,it was delicious."

It has more in terms of ingredients and though others say to use a 9x13 pan, this one actually fills the pan well when baked. It is dense but airy. I reduced the sugar by a 1/3 and it was a vaguely sweet bread, which I liked. Throw a bit of butter on it and it is heaven!"

This may have been a bad idea as in the morning it had fallen somewhat and it ended up with a soggy layer throughout the middle portion. The edges were unaffected and the whole thing was eaten.\nIt had passed the toothpick test and I had baked it 32 minutes in a ceramic Corelle baking pan. The Corelle doesn't cool nearly as fast as metal and was warm to touch an hour out of the oven.\nI'm open to suggestions..."

I also reduced the sugar to 1 cup and wound up with cornbread that was more to my taste."

I melted bacon fat in the pan and allowed the grease to get hot in the oven. When the oven reached 375, pulled the skillet out, pored the batter into the skillet, and 30 mins later, Voila! Served for our “Friendsmas” with spicy chili and it was a crowd favorite!!! Thanks for the recipe!"
