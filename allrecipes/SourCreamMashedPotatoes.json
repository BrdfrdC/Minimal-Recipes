I didn’t use all of it, but it’s easy enough to figure out if you’re aware it’s going to be too much as you start mashing. I agree with the others that the garlic infused butter is fabulous! It’s just too much."

These potatoes were part of another recipe I was making, and I needed a firmer consistency. The garlic-infused butter on the top was a nice touch adding a nice layer of flavor."

"reviewBody": "Mashed potatoes are one of my favorite foods, so I was excited to try these. I loved the garlic-infused butter that was added over the top. Unfortunately, I thought there was just too much liquid, and too much tang from the sour cream. Normally for 3 pounds of potatoes, you would use much less. I'd start with 1/2 cup each of milk and sour cream. If additional liquid is needed, add more milk, but not sour cream. I had to let the potatoes sit over low heat for a bit to try and evaporate some of the excess moisture. You could also get away with using less butter. I'd also be careful with the kosher salt, as I found 2 teaspoons to be too much, and I'm a salt lover."
