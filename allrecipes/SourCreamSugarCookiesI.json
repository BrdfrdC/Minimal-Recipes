The frosting was the biggest disappointment though. It was like wet icing that you put on canned cinnamon rolls, and it never really hardened, making it very difficult to pack in cookie tins without it all smearing. The picture is very misleading. I will look for another recipe next time."

"reviewBody": "I started baking when I was 8. I am now 58 with 10 grandchildren and always bring the \"goodies\" for Christmas dinner. I love to bake and cook, did it for a living at several times in life. Getting depressed I would bake. My grandmother was my inspiration. She was the head cook at an Air Force Base where they tried to get the President of the U.S. to allow her to work when she was forced to retire. We are talking great cook unparalleled by anyone. We could never find a roll out sugar cookie that just said \"YES!\". Found these doing a search as I had received more sour cream than I had ordered from a warehouse store where my husband picked it up. So, in a week's time, I have now made this three times. EVERYONE who has tried them can't stop eating them. AND I NEED SOME FOR CHRISTMAS. If the dough is sticky, either it was under chilled (I only had to wait an hour) or a little more flour, go slow, should have been added. I personally didn't have any problems. They rolled out well, rose great while cooking, and taste fantastic. If they are like \"sugary biscuits\" they are too thick and have too much sugar as these have just the right amount of sweet, not so much you get sick. This is the recipe I have spent years looking for. They are soft, full of flavor and even the ones I rolled too thin tasted great! I use my own cream cheese frosting I created so I can't comment on that but the sugar cookie is the best ever! Thank you for posting it."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was THE hit this Christmas season. I made two batches one as posted and the other with a 1/4 tsp of almond extract. I preferred the almond version, but both were absolutely fantastic. We were looking for a puffy cookie that held together well when frosting, and this is THE recipe. Unlike a previous review, refrigerating the dough overnight did not have a negative impact on it's workability or baking, but when the dough was completely chilled, it did work better to let it sit on the counter 5-10 minutes before rolling. \n\nSpeaking of rolling, this is the first time I've used parchment paper. Using a quarter of the dough, estimate the size of parchment paper so when it was folded over, the dough can be rolled to the 1/4\" thickness and still have the parchment paper cover the entire dough surface (top and bottom). The trick I learned was after rolling, pull the top layer of paper up and away from the dough, then flip the dough and paper over so the bottom is now on top. Pull this layer of paper away from the dough. This helps the cookies to EASILY release from the paper with out adding the extra flour (never been a fan of this). Oh yeah, way less messy with baking with kids! These cookies are saved for ever!!!!!"

"reviewBody": "These cookies are quite good. They puff up and are soft and cakey inside, but they also keep their shape pretty well. They don't have a whole lot of flavor, though; I added some extra vanilla and some almond extract, though, and it turned out fine. Because they are a little flour-y, I would recommend rolling them out in powdered sugar instead of flour (if you do it on a silicone mat, it is easier to get the powdered sugar spread evenly). Also, be sure to refrigerate for at least 1 hour. If the dough isn't well-chilled, it is kind of sticky and hard to transfer from the countertop to the cookie sheet."

The cookie is good; it's very soft and a little hard to get off the pan so you have to be sure and grease your pan well and don't let the cookies cool very long before moving them to a cooling rack. It's not a real sweet cookie so it definitely needs icing, but wow..this icing is SO yummy. I've made powdered sugar icing many times to frost cookies but never thought to add cream cheese. I had some icing leftover and just ate it with a spoon :)"

The dough is soft and cake-y and subtly sweet while the frosting is creamy and sweet. The only modification I make is to add a teaspoon of almond extract to the batter and the frosting and MAN do people go crazy for the almond! The response I always get is, \"What's that flavor...I can't quite put my finger on it but it's AMAZING!\" It's not over-powering, just a little something different. These are PERFECT cookie-cutter cookies, but do be sure to chill the dough for at LEAST a couple hours (I do mine overnight.) I also bake mine only 10 minutes and they are perfectly soft yet strong enough to support PLENTY of frosting. These are a BIG winner in my book! I have given this recipe to at least 12 different people and they keep passing it on...I love it!"

"reviewBody": "We just got done making these cookies and found them to be very good. 1/4 is perfect for a nice thick fluffy cookie. Do not overbake or you'll get a hard cookie instead of a nice soft one. We had enough frosting for all cookies and even had a little left over. Both the cookie and frosting have very nice flavor, prior reviewers may have over floured. The dough was not hard to work with, we did flour our work surface, rolling pin and cutters. I give this one 5 stars easily. Definately a keeper."

"reviewBody": "I found a million sugar cookie recipes, and I decided on this one to mail to my niece &amp; nephew. They were really tasty and sturdy enough to mail. The only thing I did differently was to roll them out with powdered sugar instead of flour, like one reviewer said. I had to make more frosting, so I will do a double batch of frosting next time. What's the point of doing frosting, if you're not going to do it right. Parchment paper really came in handy, since I rolled them and baked them on it. I think I will put another sheet of parchment or wax paper on top, so they don't stick to my rolling pin. My husband hates sour cream, but he loved these. He compared them to the really good ones you get at the grocery store bakery. You won't be sorry!!"

"reviewBody": "These cookies tasted fine- very light and not too sweet- but I found them difficult to roll out and work with even after a longer time in the fridge. Also, I didn't like the poofy texture after they were cooked- I didn't bake them the whole 10-12 min suggested because they started to brown...at 350...after 6 minutes. Maybe they would have looked less like a biscuit gone wrong if they had baked the whole time given, but then again, maybe they would have been a bit overdone/burnt. I'd rather have strange looking cookies than burnt ones."

When I found it again today I was thrilled. These cookies are PERFECT."

I used it on the counter, on the roller, on the cutter, etc. Also, watch it so you don't over cook. The cookies will be white on top, but if you can peek at the bottom, they will be a light golden brown. If you over do them then they will be like biscuits; it happened to me. The thicker the better, use the guideline (1/4inch thick). I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I've passed it along to a lot of people. I've been using it for over a year and for every holiday/birthday. The kids at daycare love em."

I, however, like my cookies SWEET (Hey, if you're going to have dessert, it might as well be decadent!) These cookies were very easy to roll out and cut. My neighbor's young boys assisted me. Instead of the cream cheese frosting I opted to use the \"Big Bird\" frosting I've always used for our cut-outs since it guaranteed a frosting that always works well for decorating. (I was taking these to a party later in the evening.) As for cut-outs, in general, I like to mix them a day or two ahead of time. I then roll and cut the next day and bake them. The third day, I invite my neighbor's boys and my neice over to help decorate. It allows me to remain sane! Otherwise, there's just too much work involved."
