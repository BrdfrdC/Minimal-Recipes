Added gluten in place of some of the flour and Bakers Special Powdered Milk in ADDITION to the powdered milk. They were even better than the soft pretzels in the mall!!! I am going to make them again, only THIS time I will ALSO add some potato flour in place of some of the flour. EVERYONE loved them! I also made them into pretzel bites--personal preference--and I will use a little less salt (I used coarse sea salt)."
