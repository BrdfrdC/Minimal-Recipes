I've never sous vide anything in my life, but I double bagged the seasoned meat (as instructed) and cooked it at 135 degrees for 60 min in the IP. Apricot glaze: 1/4 apricot jam or preserves cooked low on the stove until melted. Add 1/2 Tblsp. rice wine vinegar and 1/2 tsp. low-sodium soy sauce, off heat. Brush the glaze on after the breasts are cooked on the stove, before resting."

I infused the duck breast with Oregon black truffles, then sous vide it with slices on the meat side. I served it over parsnip puree and made an Orange Brandy glaze that I made with Turbinado sugar, my first time making both of those. Then topped with fresh shaved Oregon Black Truffles! Dinner is served!!!"

"reviewBody": "Wow! Hubby just started hunting so I turned here for how to make duck breast. Loved the rating, so gave it a try, and wasn’t disappointed! Had to improvise a bit - no skin on, so seasoned the wild breasts (and added rosemary) first, then wrapped in bacon which I skewered with toothpicks underneath. Popped them in my food sealer to vacuum out air, which worked great for the water bath later. [Hubby told me that’s good for drawing all the blood out of the meat, or even to put in a saltwater bath without the plastic...for those wondering.] Kept the bacon on for cooking in the cast iron pan, then removed toothpicks after. Attaching a photo or two...just delicious!!! Served with stuffing, steamed carrots, and a cranberry-orange relish I had on hand. Hubby already asked me for this recipe to share. It’s a keeper!"

I used an immersion circulator - 135 degrees for an hour, meat came out a perfect medium rare, duck was nice and tender. I did find that searing the skin for 5 minutes was not enough as not all the fat has rendered off properly leaving some chewy pieces of skin. Next time I will render the skin for a few more minutes. Otherwise, I love this simple recipe for duck!"

I made this recipe when the Ohio State Buckeyes were playing the Oregon Ducks for the 2014 national championship. ;-)\nThis recipe has inspired me to add duck to our regular rotation, as well as to buy a sous vide machin. OMG, if you haven't had sous vide steak you are missing out on life! Wow!! Between the steak and the duck, it was totally worth $150 and space on my counter. I am still experimenting with other foods (meat, veggies, eggs).\nThank you for introducing me to a new cooking method and adding a new, and very tasty protein to my diet!"
