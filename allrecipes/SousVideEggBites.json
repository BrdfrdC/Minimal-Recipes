"reviewBody": "This is a great recipe. We make 24 at a time in small ball jars. We then freeze them for later use, take them out the day before. Reheat them the next day in the microwave. You need to experiment with the microwave time based on your unit. We make some with asparagus, ham, or bacon, and some with Pico de Gallo. All are really good. One note you should tighten the lid the back off a little bit to allow for the egg to expand."

"reviewBody": "Fantastic flavor in this recipe, and adding fillings is super easy...you need not pre-saute onions, peppers, mushrooms, etc...they cook just fine along with the eggs. I added Gruyere cheese along with miscellaneous veggies and they were hard to put down. HERE'S A TIP - instead of troubling with the jars, just make the entire batch in a zip-lock bag and divide it up when eating. Eliminates clean-up."

"reviewBody": "Solid recipe (I have used several) with clear instructions for those who are new to the method. I substitute Ricotta (my Italian heritage!) for the cottage cheese, and it seems to blend in more smoothly. I always do a few without extras, then diversify with various dairy, meat and/or veggie add-ins for the rest depending on what I have in the fridge.. As an ICU nurse working 12+ hour shifts, this works nicely for me to make ahead and enjoy throughout the week; I always double the batch."
