"reviewBody": "Loved this recipe! Followed it exactly without any changes and it came out perfect! Just a tip for getting the flan out of the jars...once you have it flipped over with the plate on top, give it a FIRM shake, and it will pop right out!\n\nI had a little bit of caramel still left in the bottom after flipping it over that I used to drizzle on the white plate over the flan. I added some fresh whipped cream to the top and a few colored sprinkles (since I was making this at the holidays). BAM - yummy and impressed the guests!"

"reviewBody": "For everyone butchering the caramel (this guy), trick is to add a 1/4 cup of water to sugar before you start. Put on medium heat. Do not stir, do not swirl, do not jostle when it gets to boiling. If you have a candy thermometer clip one on and wait until you either hit around 340 degrees f or the sugar has turned Amber. Once amber/at 340 go ahead and stir. Other then that rest of the instructions were great."

Will try a slightly different technique with the sugar next time to see if I can improve it. It comes out rock solid with a bit of caramel that seeps into the flan. Ha! Over all, good stuff!"
