I did note that one of the cold eggs cracked slightly when putting into the hot water but it did not affect the look or taste. served over red potato home fries. I was quite happy at breakfast this morning."

"reviewBody": "This was perfect. I know how to make poached eggs the traditional way, but this is a game changer and my new go-to method for poached eggs. Granted It's not faster since it takes a little while for the sous vide to warm up vs. boiling water in a pot. However, it eliminates a lot of problems associated with making poached eggs, making things much easier. Issues like wispy egg whites that float away from the rest of the egg and broken yolks from wrestling the eggs in and out of the water are all off the table now. The eggs just cook in their own shells and crack open a perfect poached egg with no lost egg white or cleanup. My only suggestion: follow the timing and temperatures on this exactly; should you choose to experiment by adding or subtracting a minute or so, be very precise. There is extraordinarily little room for error when it comes to poached eggs and this could become a hard broiled egg or a runny mess very easily if you don't keep an eye on the timer. Many thanks to person who sent this in!"

I tried putting them in the bath when it was at the temperature. I tried 13 minutes, 15 minutes, letting them cool for 3 minutes and putting them in an ice bath for a minute or two. Results: a lot of wasted eggs. The whites were not cooked enough and the yolks were overcooked. Not sure what to try next. Probably a different recipe."

I’ve done sous vide eggs before with a 15 minute timeline that turned out beautifully, but couldn’t find the old recipe so tried this temp and time. Followed instructions exactly using fresh pasture-raised eggs. The egg came out with an over done yolk and sloppy, barely cooked mushy white. Inedible."

I cook mine 15 minutes because my husband likes his a bit more on the firm side, though 14 minutes is good for me. Either way, this is a solid recipe that you can adjust to your preference."

I've seen differnt times and temps and this one is my favorite. they really are easy and the best part, you don't have to sit there watching them in a simmering pan on the stovve, nevermind the mess they sometimes make in the pan. you just put them in your sous vide container and let them cook and it leaves you time to prepare other foods at the same time."
