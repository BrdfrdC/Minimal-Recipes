"reviewBody": "Cooked two rib eyes with this recipe. Knowing what I know now I would have seared the steaks in a skillet for a minute on each side rather than 1:30 for a total time of two minutes, I think 3 minutes was too long. Maybe even less depending on what the two minute turns out next time for me. The steaks came out very tender and uniform in color from the sous vide. I'm glad I bought the sous vide, well worth the money and will use it regularly cooking meat. My next project is carnitas, I will use my sous vide to break down a pork shoulder over a number of hours. Thank you for this cool kitchen gadget."
