I was surprised at how well the dill and apple complemented each other. A really nice variation for tuna salad!"

"reviewBody": "Not bad! I was a little hesitant because I've never added anything to my tuna other than the traditional mayonnaise, pepper, salt, and the occasional celery.\n\nAPPLE SELECTION: I used a \"Gold Rush\" apple picked from my local orchard. According to them, this apple is really good for salads and dips, which seemed appropriate for tuna salad. It was sweet, but not too sweet, and had a nice crisp to it. I'd recommend it to others, if you can get it!\n\nI did not have dill weed or onion, but I don't think missing either affected how tasty this is. The apple and tuna are the main ingredients you taste, with a little hint of relish flavor (I used B&amp;G sweet relish I had in the fridge from the hot dog days of summer.) \n\nYes, you WILL need more mayonnaise, it is dry as written. :)"

But, I had a juicy apple sitting there and I thought \"what the heck\". Since I'm only making one serving, I halved the recipe. They must make tuna cans smaller because mine is 5 oz. I used the white albacore in water. I wasn't sure what to think of adding olive oil, but I really liked it. I did use a bit less and added more mayo, but I like the subtle flavor of a good olive oil in there. I used a bit less apple because it seemed to be too much for the amount of tuna. I only had dill pickles so I used a bit less dill. It's a really nice change of pace from my normal tuna salad. Thanks for sharing!"
