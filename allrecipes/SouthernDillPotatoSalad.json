It’s tart but not like mustard potato salad. I would have made it as written except I didn’t have Dijon, so I substituted with spicy brown mustard. I can’t compare the two but it was fantastic the way I made it. It’s now on my favorites list and I make it every time we smoke chicken, pork, or brisket (which seems to be almost every weekend)!!"

Had to smack hubby away before I even got it in the fridge he was about 5 spoonfuls deep and telling me we could eat it warm... at 9am."

I also added an extra egg and some additional celery, just because I like those, but I suspect that for most people the written proportions may be perfect. My vinegar and mustard “to taste” meant that I added a little extra. Also, I had only celery seed, so I added somewhat less of that. I made 1/2 of a recipe, and it would make six to eight pretty generous servings. Next time I may use green onions."

I will try this again but probably add a hint of sweet to the dressing, either honey or a sprinkling of sugar, but that's just us. Otherwise, this was far better than any store bought potato salad."

I remember eating this stuff for breakfast! I'm so glad you shared this recipe because I only knew how to make it from helping her and never really wrote it down. That's what I love about Allrecipes is that it takes me back and connects me with people who appreciate memories, tradition, and just good food. Thank you."

No additional salt is needed. As for type of potatoes, my mom always used russet, so 7- 8 large one for this recipe. I made a day ahead, everyone one loved it."

My cooking philosophy goes something like this: If I can't make something in my kitchen that is notably better tasting than what is available pre-made at the grocery store, I will not invest the time and the effort to complete the recipe. \n\nThis recipe would have been worth twice the effort, but fortunately it was as easy as cutting up a few ingredients, and being willing to wait until the next day to eat it! My family loved it, I loved it, and so did my company!"

"reviewBody": "My biggest problem with this recipe was how many potatoes to put in. Red potatoes come in a variety of sizes. \"10 red potatoes\" isn't enough information (I did find 3 lb. red potatoes works well). The recipe, as written, is very bland tasting, but apparently a lot of people like bland. I took some reviewers' suggestions and added 1 T. sweet pickle relish, subbed 1/2 of the mayonnaise with Miracle Whip, and added 2 chopped large dill pickles, which improved the flavor significantly. Will add more dill pickles next time. This is a great base recipe that can be tweaked to your liking. It is going into my recipe file."

I use a high fat content sour cream and full fat content mayo which makes it taste really creamy, but I think it's the addition of the vinegar that gives it that extra special something. I add the vinegar to the still warm cubed potatoes which gets absorbed while the potatoes cool down. Everyone always asks me to bring the potato salad, it's a golden recipe:)\nThank you to the original poster, it's a fantastic recipe!."

I love dill and had a taste of a dill potato salad somewhere and I just decided to give it a try. It did not disappoint. After I finished making it I took it in the other room to have my wife taste test it and her eyes lit up. We both could hardly believe what we were tasting. I added a little bit of garlic salt, seasoning salt and a splash of Mrs. Dash. I seriously doubt that I would even try another potato salad recipe as I have found \"the one\". Much appreciated."

Hopefully there is still some left to bring, as I can't stop stealing spoonfuls. SO GOOD. Next time I might chop up a few dill pickles in it for even more dilly goodness and crunch, and maybe up the celery just a bit or add a bit of red bell pepper. I like a little extra crunch."
