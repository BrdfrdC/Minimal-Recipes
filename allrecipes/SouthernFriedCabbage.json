(and I despise when people change a recipe but I really wanted to use up items in my fridge) I think this is one of those recipes that can be a creative outlet! \n\nI used about 6-7 slices of bacon, diced fried and set aside, then added at the end. I had 1/2 head of red and 1/2 head of green cabbage so I used both. My only onion was enormous, so I used a large shallot and used up 4 green onions I had on hand along with 2 gloves of garlic I had laying around . S&amp;P and I tossed in a couple tablespoons of brown sugar (Truvia actually - diabetic here, trying not to use sugar) and this is excellent. Thanks so much for sharing! I'll be making this over and over!\n\nI think this would be awesome with the addition of kielbasa or smoked sausage, italian sausage, mushrooms, caraway, etc. But really good as-is!"

Sauteed onions then added the cabbage and sausage into the pan covering it. I stirred it occasionally until the cabbage was tender. I just prefer sausage with cabbage versus bacon. The bacon grease is the only part I used of it. There's nothing better than bacon grease when it comes to certain frying. It was so good!"
