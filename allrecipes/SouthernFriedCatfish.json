"reviewBody": "Great!!! I grew up in the South and the \"gritty\" texture is supposed to be there! If you want just fried fish, well this isn't it. This is how fried catfish is supposed to taste. I did add more Old Bays, a bit of garlic salt, and a generous helping of cayenne pepper (I like me some spice). I liked the buttermilk marinade, but I agree that there was way too much flour/cornmeal left over. I'd half that next time. That would help with not having to use so much more spice to liven it up. No issues with the breading falling off. Made sure my oil was hot enough and then didn't turn my fish over until I saw the edges starting to brown. I cooked mine longer because I like my fried stuff super crunchy. Over all, good recipe!! Thanks for posting!"

It was perfect for Father's Day. We cooked 14 fillets for 5 people. None left. How much better could it get? Thanks, Irlynda Smith for a winner."

I added more than triple the amount of old bay seasoning. And I also seasoned the catfish fillets with salt and pepper along with seasoning he buttermilk. It came out really good! My husband and even my 2 year loved it!"

Some catfish will taste like the bottom of the lake, and some won't. But you don't know what you have until it's too late. This is an excellent recipe and I even added a little lemon pepper and seafood seasoning to it."

I did not grow up eating fish, so this was all new to me. This recipe was perfect! I omitted the spices since I didn't have it on hand, but we didn't feel we were missing anything. I guess it's just personal taste, but we're very simple folks. And \"thank you\" to Ash for the recommendation to let the fish rest with the breading, which I did while frying the hush puppies. Came out perfectly and the kids actually ate it without ketchup! WOW! Also, I used melted coconut oil to take the guilt out of so much frying~ Will be using this again and again!"

Also, I learned years ago that to accentuate fish's flavor be sure to salt it as soon as it comes out of the fryer. My husband and I both enjoyed the recipe and I'll definitely be making it again."

You can use a cast iron skillet or Dutch oven with a candy thermometer. Just make sure to monitor the temperature! The temp tends to plummet when you put the catfish in."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is excellent—the fish turned out crispy and flakey, but still tender. I double breaded the filets, and had no trouble with the breading crumbling off. I only made a few slight variations... one teaspoon of Old Bay definitely wouldn't have been enough, so I used a tablespoon. Then i added a dash of lemon pepper and a hint of dill. The catfish turned out fantastic. Everyone (even my friend who hates catfish) loved it and there were no leftovers.\nThere was, however, plenty of the milk mixture and breading left over. This recipe would easily allow you to make 2 pounds of catfish, probably more."

If you are having trouble getting the batter to stick, place prepared catfish in the freezer for 15-20 min. Then go directly to the hot oil. At 375 degrees the fish will be crispy brown in about 7-8 min, turning once. If you want to pump up the golden color of the fish, add 1/4 tea of turmeric to the cornmeal mixture."

I tripled the Old Bay Seasoning, as was suggested, and it still wasn't as flavorful as expected BUT everyone loved it. I did not have trouble with the crust sticking but prior to cooking I read several fish recipes from other sites that suggested heating the oil first while preparing everything else and don't overcrowd the pan because it lowers the oil temp. The crust is amazing and browned perfectly. Next time I'll just add more salt, pepper and Old Bay. So fast and easy!! And the kids asked for seconds and thirds. Who can argue with that?!"
