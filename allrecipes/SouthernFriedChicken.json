Dip a second time right before putting the pieces in oil. Otherwise, followed this recipe exactly. Was asked by several guests for the recipe. The best, most flavorful fried chicken ever. Didn't miss the garlic, onion or other flavors some have suggested. This was tasty to the bone."

Then she'd put all the pieces on a rack and let them soak up the flour for 20 minutes or so, then dredge again. Fry in a quarter inch of veg oil, first one side on high heat, then flip all the pieces, turn the heat down to low medium, and put the lid on, and cook for 20 minutes. Then make gravy with the remaining oil and fond."

Add some eggs and dip the chicken in the eggs before dipping it in the breading of 1 teaspoon paprika, pepper, salt, onion powder, and garlic powder as well as 1 cup of flour. Then fry it slowly at maybe medium high heat and flip every 2 minutes until it gets darker brown. I'd also make an incision in the meat to check on the pinkness every so often as well. I'd do this for about 15-30 min."

"reviewBody": "I have not had truly fried chicken at home in at least 40 years in fact I avoided it mainly do to the mess. This receipt was,as expected, a bit messy but the enjoyment of the absolutely delicious and moist chicken was worth the extra cleanup. I used Crisco instead of oil but I'm sure it will be just as good either way. I used a cast iron skillet and only cooked 5 pieces at a time which allowed for more space and easy turning of the chicken. Because I haven't done this in many years I kept checking the chicken with a meat thermometer to insure I didn't over cook them. If I change anything on this receipt I believe I might add a bit of spice to the flour mix but either way it was awesome."

I'm happy to say that it worked perfectly without the egg or milk! I used chicken breasts cut into pieces and added 1 tsp garlic powder &amp; 1/2 tsp onion powder to the flour before shaking it all up in a ziplock bag. I used olive oil for frying. One tip... drain your fried foods on a cooking rack to keep all sides crispy (not soggy from placing on a paper towel."

I also let the chicken sit in the bag of flour (after washing them off) for about a half hour, then dipped them in egg, and in flour once more prior to putting them in the iron skillet. This definitely helped with the coating (that I used to have trouble keeping on the chicken when it cooked). My boyfriend LOVED it! This recipe will certainly be a mainstay!"

"reviewBody": "This is the way my mom made fried chicken. It's simple and good. I prefer to use more spices (white pepper, cayenne, poultry seasoning) and you could soak it in buttermilk ahead of time. But it's okay without all that. I would say to anyone having trouble with the crust, your oil isn't hot enough and/or you are moving it too much (don't flip it more than once.) Also if you are burning it, you probably aren't using a heavy enough skillet. I was taught ALWAYS to fry in an iron skillet, it distributes heat equally, but if you don't have one use the heaviest one you've got. Get an iron skillet though, they are cheaper than most skillets and they last a lifetime!"

"reviewBody": "At first I was concerned about putting a cover over the chicken during frying hoping it wouldn't make the skin soggy, but no, THE SKIN CAME OUT CRISPY, CRISPY!!! I turned the heat on high when the chicken was placed in the pan in order to not have the chicken cook in slightly cooled oil, then the heat was lowered to a HEALTHY low flame, the chicken then covered and was cooked 15 minutes on each side checking to see if any coloring was needed. The onion and garlic powders and cayenne didn't come through so next time I'll adjust for flavor. This will be my go-to recipe/method for making chicken no matter the recipe. Soon I'll be using the presented method for making Maryland Fried Chicken with cream gravy where nutmeg will be used both in the coating and in the gravy."

One of the key steps in the flouring, is to do it twice; once before you fry, and then after letting the CRISCO come to temperature, (about ten minutes or so), flour it a SECOND time just before you put it in the frying pan. The time per side ( fifteen minutes) was PERFECT! It came out crisp on the outside, moist and tender on the inside. Thank you for sharing this."

"reviewBody": "I made this last night and it was delicious! As others reviewers suggested, I soaked in ice water with salt for about 15 minutes while I prepared everything else. I also added a few suggested spices. I mixed all of my spices together and rolled the chicken in that before dredging the flour. I used salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and cayenne pepper (we like it spicy!). Once dredged in flour, I let it rest on a wire rack for about 10 minutes so the flour and spices wouldn't just fry off and stick to the pan. I fried in an electric skillet at 360 and turned it very often (about every 5 minutes). I used only drumsticks because that's what we like. I cooked it 30 minutes and it was spicy, crispy and cooked to perfection. I will definitely be using this recipe from now on. Thank you!"

I added the salt pepper and paprika as well. Then I did the flour dip which I added italian seasoned bread crumbs too, then into the egg bath, then back into the flour dip.\n\nThese were big thighs so I heated the crisco shortening with vegetable oil on medium high - high while I was prepping the chicken.\n\nI cooked each side for 5 minutes before flipping it and flipped them 2x each for a total of 20 minutes cook time and they turned out amazing!\n\nCheck the photo out :-)"

Following others suggestions: did an ice water bath with salt, then added a few extra seasonings to the flour mixture. Gave chicken (I used drumsticks) a good few shakes in flour mixture using ziplock bag. Let sit for about 20 mintutes. Dipped chicken in 2 eggs whites &amp; 1/4 cup water, then put back into ziplock for a few more shakes. Let that sit for 15-20 minutes. Heated oil while waiting on chicken during that 15-20 minutes, that way I knew oil would be hot enough. Cooked legs about 15 minutes. They were perfect! Will definately make again. Everyone loved them!"

"reviewBody": "excellent recipe for real southern fried chicken, i actually ate a chicken leg and loved it, I usually eat white meat only. only modification I made was replace the paprika with a generous amount of msg (accent), if you are not allergic to it it won't hurt you. I didn't add garlic and all that other stuff, that's northern fried chicken like people here in maine make, true southern frien chicken is made with flour, salt, pepper, and msg. Self rising flour is a must, or liberally add baking powder to your flour. Dip your rinsed wet chicken in beaten egg than roll in flour which you may add more salt and pepper (you can never use too much msg) according to your tastes. re dip in the egg and once more in the flour and do not put it into a frying pan till the oil is 350 degrees. with an electric you need 48 oz oil for perfection. fry legs and thighs for at least 25 minutes, turning frequently to prevent overbrowning, do not pierce the chicken use tongs. fry breasts a total of 30 to 40 minutes. When your chicken is dark golden brown it's readu test with a thermometer to be sure, should be 165-190 in the thickest part. This coating will make the juciest chicken you ever ate. If you want, experiment with spices and make a good northern fried chicken, but if you want REAL deep south soul food fried chicken you use only salt, pepper and msg. And if you are not allergic to msg it's perfectly safe, it's glutamate made from corn. Good luck and bon appetite."

I also decided to try the icey salt water before hand as many reviewers mentioned. Then, I decided to brine it for a couple hours since it was already in salt water. I also used a viewers idea of letting the flour sit on the chicken for a half hour and then shaking it again. I don't know what variable was the key or if they all were key but this was the best fried chicken I have ever eaten let alone made myself. Yummy and simple. Just wish I could eat it more but it is def not low fat!"

I did marinate the chicken in buttermilk w/Old Bay Seasoning and a bit of garlic seasoning for about an hour (because I like it marinated), then dipped in seasoned flour mixture, let the chicken 'rest' on a rack for ab. 10 min. then fried. Yum. This recipe is in my favorites and have used it several times. Also, because it does not absorb the oil it is great cold for lunch/dinner the day:)"
