"reviewBody": "This is a simple recipe that always works. I heavily season my flour mixture with granulated garlic, onion powder, salt, good pepper, dried parsley flakes. I do not heat the oil to 375 because that temp is too hot. I heat to between 360-365 and cook them for about half the time the recipe says. Livers are very tender and cook quickly. The high temps and long frying time renders the livers hard, dry, and quite overcooked."

It worked!"

"reviewBody": "These came out very delicious. As the previous reviewers have mentioned, it is important to poke the livers to prevent popping. I like to cut them up into smaller bits because they taste better to me. Also, I added Nature's Seasoning to my egg/milk mixture as well as my garlic powder/ flour mixture. I just sprinkled about a half to a whole teaspoon altogether of the Nature's Seasoning to add an extra \"umph\" to the recipe. (I love using Nature's Seasoning to almost everything I cook because it has a perfect blend of salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and parsley flakes)........I also pan-fried these babies in a cast iron skillet. Wow! I will definitely make these again! Thanks everyone for the pointers!"

I also poked the livers with a fork. \n\nI typically fry in a 1/2 inch of oil rather than deep fry, which I did in this case, using coconut oil. \n\nI mixed a some siracha and mayo for a dip. \n\nBest liver ever. I found it hard to save some for my husband."

"reviewBody": "I did make changes. I was looking for a recipe that was like what I used to eat at a restuarant in mid missouri. This was close, I combined this one with the recipe for garlic chicken liver. I added lemon, garlic and olive oil directly to to the very very well drained chicken livers. ( I think that is the biggest key to making liver is to make sure they are well rinsed and drained) Then, I dunk and dip them and put them in the oil. I put enough oil in the deep pan to be like a deep fryer. But, when they stop really sizzling I was able to stir them. \nWhen removing from oil use plenty of paper towels to pat dry."

"reviewBody": "First time ever making chicken livers and they turned out awesome! Only change I made was about half the garlic and I shallow pan fried them. I don't really like chicken livers that much but my 85-year old mother loves them so I thought I would give it a try. I used the \"poking with a fork\" trick, which works like a charm, to keep them from popping so much. Believe me when they tell you these will splatter you had better believe them. My microwave is covered with cooking oil after the first two that I did not poke full of holes. I have a couple burns for my trouble as well. Be careful!! Hoping there are some of these left to take to Mom. They are pretty tasty! Thank you so much for the recipe and all the hints and tips. Especially the one about poking them with the fork."

I do not deep fry them I shallow fry them. Heat up Avocado Oil I use that oil due to its very high heat tolerance. Get the Oil very hot and gently place them in the pan and cook 2-3 minutes on each side remove from the skillet place them on a wire rack to cook and touch it off with some salt while hot they get nice and crispy and make a chili sour cream dipping sauce."

I only have two small tips for first timers.. Using a fork, untrue each liver a few times and it will reduce/stop all the popping while frying. And serve with your favorite hot sauce!!! Much better tan gravy....just sayin' ;-)"

Added livers to bag of flour with the garlic powder, onion powder, salt and lots of black pepper. Sealed bag and kept turning it to move livers around. Left livers in the flour until ready to cook. Pan-fried in about a half inch of hot oil, punctured them and had no spattering at all. Absolutely delicious. Served with some leftover gravy and potatoes. Not one left!"

After rinsing the livers in the colander I placed several layers of paper-towel in a large bowl and put the livers on top, then placed several layers on top and covered with seran wrap and let it sit in the fridge for an hour. Once they come out they will be relatively dry (accepting the dredge more easily) and won't spatter at all. Hope this tip helps !"
