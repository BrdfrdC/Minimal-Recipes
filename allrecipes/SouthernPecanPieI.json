But after 34 years of being married to a Southern man, and being adept at making homemade pies with crust from scratch, my hubby finally asked me to make a pecan pie--my very first in 64 years. As suggested by a couple of others, I used half dark and half light Karo syrup. Husband said he \"liked it a lot\" and \"the sweetness level was fine\". Consistency was fine also, not soupy. This is all from hubby--I didn't partake--I prefer fruit pies."

It became 5 stars when I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar as well as 1/2 cup light Karo syrup and 1/2 cup dark Karo syrup. I even saw one guy pick up the pie tin and scrape the bottom. LOL! My husband and I think the secret is to keep cooking it until the center is completely jelled...no longer runny. Put aluminum foil around the pie shell edges so that does not burn."

"reviewBody": "great recipe! i tried the half light, half dark syrup suggested in reviews. resulted in 'just right' sweetness. i used fresh pecans and chopped them. as in other reviews, when time is up, check for jiggle in the center. no jiggle, remove from oven. the times were good. would suggest covering the crust with strips of foil until the last 15 minutes. the pie came out wonderful!! will make this again!! UPDATE: first used regular pie crust and it was full! need steady hands! so i tried a deep pie crust and i am going to have to make adjustments....same times as recipe except : cover entire pie loosely and bake another 10-15 min. the times are good, but ovens are different, so just watch for the jiggle and cover if going over original time. will keep making until i run out of pecans in the yard!!!"

I baked it at 350 for 50 minutes. And let it cool as recipe suggested it was delicious will definitely make again and again. And i'll have to do an extra mile on my walking trail. Lol"

"reviewBody": "I made this pie a cpl times to rave reviews, although it wasn't quite as good as my grandmother's (she was a pie master). \nI specifically recall her using brown sugar so I substituted brown sugar, but this made the pie just too sweet. I decided to use both, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and the result was a home run!!! I've seen other reviews doing this with the corn syrup.....I may try this in the future, but then again why fix something that isn't broken ??\nIn addition, I brown/warm the pecans (I add an extra 1/2 cup) in a skillet on the stove top until the natural oils are released. This makes the house smell wonderful and gives the pie a rich, nuttier flavor!!!\nIt's still not quite my grandmother's, but is equally as delicuous. Everyone raves over this pie and always wants the recipe!!!"
