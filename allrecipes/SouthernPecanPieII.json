Well, I followed the recipe to a T and it rose really high and was runny in the center - then when I took it out, it collapsed in the center. My husband says he'll still try it, so I guess we'll see. Christmas is in two days. Thankfully, I made another one with another recipe and it turned out perfect."

However, this pastry recipe worked very well for me. I'll be using it for all of my pies in the future. I did have to add an extra tablespoon of ice-cold water but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and the results were wonderful."

Hint - if you don't have time to make the crust and want to use frozen premade - make sure to use the \"deep dish\" ones because this recipe yields a large amount of filling."

It was still good but I don't think I have the art of pie crust making perfected and I didn't have a food processor to mix it like some places suggest. But overall is was a great pecan pie!"

One thing I would suggest is to mix in the pecans with the mixture, not put them on the bottom because then when the pie is baked, the pecans tend to come off the pie more easily because they are not mixed in with the mixture. Overall, very delicious and I will be sure to make it again!"

Also, it took about 20 extra minutes to bake, but it was no big deal. Just make sure when you give the pan a slight shake that it doesn't move like jello. I would also suggest putting aluminum foil around the edges of the crust, so it doesn't get too brown. Overall this pie was awesome and not difficult to make!"
