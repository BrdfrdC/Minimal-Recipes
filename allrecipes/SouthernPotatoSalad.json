"reviewBody": "Potato Salad is kind of hard to make. You can make it once and its perfect and the next time your scratching your head as to what did I miss. This is pretty spot on except I had to increase it to 6 servings and not 4. The little button that was suppose to help with changing the servings doesnt seem to work so I had to use math and eyeball. Haha The only thing I will confess that I changed was the celery. I didnt want to buy a whole bunch for just a Half a stalk that was silly, so I used about 1/4 tsp of celery flakes. Maybe too much but not bad. Couldn't find the equivalent so it was a wild guess. If anyone has a suggestion please chime in."

Turned out exactly as I expected and wanted it to."

"reviewBody": "I can finally come to the family bbq's with my own homemade potato salad. I basically used this recipe as a base. The instructions are a little vague if you have never made potato salad. My number one tip would be to boil your potatoes with the skin on and allow them to cool for a few hours. Cold potatoes are easier to work with. Also keep in mind that potatoes hold a lot of water and using hot potatoes will generate steam thus making your potato salad watery. I boiled the eggs in salt water for about 15 minutes and allowed them to cool as well. I also added chopped green onions and red bell peppers. About 1/2 cup of each. I mixed the mayo and mustard together first, so that if it was too strong or not strong enough I would not ruin the entire potato salad. I should just write my own recipe lol"

I've made potato salad that's been flavorless, so while the potatoes were still warm, I sprinkled about a tblsp of Greek salad dressing over and let soak in. At this time, I also followed what a reviewer who knows about Southern cooking mentioned and that was adding apple cider vinegar and a little sugar. Adding the dressing and vinegar were probably what made this a little mushy, but I didn't care.....it was so delicious! I also did not miss the onions. While serving, I like to also top with some green olives or radishes. Thanks for this great recipe which I'll surely make again!"

Also added a splash of dill pickle juice and it just amped it up. Will definitely make again. Good cold, too!"

"reviewBody": "This was great! I added some apple cider vinegar, dill, and forgot the garlic. I used 6 small potatoes, which was just about 2 pounds. I think the recipe should specify that but it's okay. I boiled my potatoes for 15 minutes, drained them and left them in the colander with a clean rag over them to let them continue to cook while I made the dressing. I did not peel them because I like the added texture of the peel left on. I always like to dress my potato salad while it is still warm so the potatoes can absorb the dressing. I also added some extra salt and pepper since potatoes can usually handle a lot of seasoning. This turned out fantastic! Thanks for posting!"

"reviewBody": "This was a really good base for potato salad dressing. I made not quite a double batch using about a cup of mayo and half cup of relish. Also I used more celery (about 2 stalks), some very finely grated carrot (1 big one), and spicy brown mustard instead of just the regular ol' yellow stuff. I thought it was a little bit too sweet so I added about a teaspoon of ground New Mexico chili powder and 1 finely diced Thai chili. It turned out great. Tried it served warm as the recipe suggested but I liked it better after it was refrigerated for a few hours as the flavors had more time to blend."

Maybe because all my life I've lived in Florida where we like our sides cold on a warm afternoon or evening. I enjoyed this potato salad and it tastes very similar to the 'old fashioned' recipe we enjoyed many years ago. Needless to say I prefer it cold. I added a little more mustard and a touch of vinegar which is a matter of personal taste. Thanks for the recipe."
