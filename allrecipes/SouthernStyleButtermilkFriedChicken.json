"reviewBody": "What a terrible recipe. I’ve been cooking for 54 years. My husband &amp; sons &amp; other family members always enjoyed my food.\n\nOne of the things I’ve never been able to accomplish was good fried chicken. My mom’s mom (granny) always made the best pan fried chicken. Crispy, golden brown &amp; juicy. \n\nWhen I was a teen &amp; into my 20’s, I would watch granny make her fried chicken. Mixed together flour, salt, black pepper, paprika. Rolled the wet chicken pieces in the flour mixture &amp; fried chicken in a cast iron skillet. She made a beautiful cream gravy for the mashed potatoes.\n\nMy mom tried frying chicken &amp; never was successful, same with me. I would end up with at best mediocre fried chicken along with a waste of my time, a greasy &amp; flour mess in my kitchen!\n\nAfter not making fried chicken for about 20 years, I thought my husband &amp; I would make this recipe. Followed the recipe, except for Dijon mustard (I can’t imagine including this in fried chicken). Soaked the chicken, breaded it &amp; let set on a rack for 30 minutes. Used a cast iron skillet, used our temperature gauge to try &amp; keep the oil @ 350 degrees. It took quite awhile to fry the chicken, leaving an oily &amp; flour mess.\n\nThe chicken got too dark, breading was soft not crunchy (I was wondering about the wisdom of including baking powder in the flour), the breading was flat tasting.\n\nNEVER again will I make fried chicken! KFC for us."

Every single bit of this crust fell off my chicken and I ended up with nekkid as a jaychicken pieces. Served the blobs of crust on the side and advised hubby to interchange bites. It had pretty good flavor but nothing to write home about. I'm stickin with my tried and true Grandmother's approach, which involved nothing more than salt, pepper, flour and fry it up. THAT worked. I'm sorry, but this is a 1 star for me. And indeed, I did not change a thing."

The way the marinade and dry mixture finishes is the best I've seen and I used skinless tenders. \n\nThe recipe can be improved by improvising with spices in the dry mixture.

I followed the marinade instructions exactly and marinaded the chicken in the fridge for about 6 hours. Based on other reviews I added some extra seasoning to the flour (1 tsp white pepper, 1 tsp chipotle chili powder, and a quick sprinkle of cayenne). To my surprise, the dipping and dredging process went very quickly. In fact I'm considering doing it 3 times next time to get it super crispy! I let the tenders \"rest\" for about 30 mins while I heated the oil and then fried them up. It was fantastic and I will definitely make this again."

I took some tips from other reviews and added a fourth teaspoon of paprika to the dry ingredients, added a little extra salt and only dipped the chicken into the batter once. I cooked the chicken for about five minutes on each side, and it got so crispy! I made it with some corn and mashed potatoes and it was absolutely amazing!"

It wasn't spicy, just gull of flavor. I'm ditching my other fried chicken recipes for this one! Oh, one more thing, I made sure to allow the chicken to come to room temperature/slightly cool before breading it and I let the breading set up for about 30 minutes to ensure that the breading stayed on the chicken and not on my fryer ?"

I followed the directions to the T and it came out perfectly! I did find that i needed more flour than the 2 cups stated in the recipe and about half way thru the battering of the chicken in flour, i decided to use a big plate instead of a plastic bag, and it worked better for me. I made mashed potatoes with country gravy and fresh chopped spinach with melted butterand salt. I loved it and so did my family! I have made other recipes and they really didn't work out that great but this one is a keeper for sure! Thank you for sharing!"

I took some other reviewers suggestions and let my drumsticks marinate overnight (by the time I cooked the chicken it was probably about 14 hours). I skinned them first because I hate the skin that much, threw together some breadcrumbs and seasonings for my coating, and baked the drumsticks at 375 for about 45 minutes, turning once. My party guests loved it and I got a ton of compliments! The chicken was so moist and tender with just a kick of heat. I will use this marinade over and over again."

It could have had more flavor, though I did add salt and paprika into flour, and skipped onion powder. Made wing drumsticks and boneless thighs, so it didn't burn until it was done, but I do believe bigger pieces would have burnt on the outside (I've read oil temperature on thermometer, so it wasn't too hot). \nWill only use this recipe as the guideline for variations with spices and flavors."

I would have appreciated some general guidelines on how long to fry the different pieces - I used chicken thighs and it was trial and error with the oil and the timing so that the chicken was cooked and moist without the coating being nearly burnt. Thank goodness I bought a value pack, because my first batch didn't leave very many edible pieces! I have a better sense now, but more detail in the recipe would have been helpful."

"reviewBody": "We loved this recipe and my husband is not a big chicken fan. I heeded the advice from other cooks and omitted the onion and garlic powder. Instead I added salt and paprika. I also added 1/2 cup of cornmeal to the flour. Not only did that add flavor but it also added crunch and a great texture. I like lots of crunch so I followed suggestions to double dip. The recipe did not have a suggested oil temp. So I used my deep fryer and set it to 350. The chicken browned beautifully but too quickly to cook the legs I was using so I fried first then placed the legs on a rack over a cookie sheet. The legs finished cooking in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes. The outside was golden, crunchy and the meat tender and very moist. I will definitely make this again."

I changed a few things - added hot sauce to the marinade, and instead of using dijon I used boar's head gourmaise which is highly seasoned since I read reviews saying it was slightly bland. I also recommend letting the chicken sit for 30 mins or so after coating and before frying so you don't lose the breading in the oil like I did!"

None of the crust came off in the pan as some have experienced. My husband said it was most definitely the best fried chicken I have ever made. For the few times a year I will make this. no guilt whatsoever on the fried/calorie laden dish. You won't be sorry if you make this one! Thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Thank you many times for this incredible recipe! I'm a single adult male. I almost always ate outside until this year. I always disliked spending time in the kitchen previously. Now that I work from home and also for the cost cutting reasons, I decided to learn cooking a little bit recently. I'd like to mention that I always stayed away from fried food except french fries I occasionally (once a year or or so) ate at Mc Donald's and etc. I came across this website and the recipe while searching to know how to cook Country Style Chicken which I accidentally watched on a TV show. Theirs was different but i read your recipe and it seemed simple. Normally, I won't bother trying out anything that has more than 4 ingredients and at least one of them is unknown to me which I may never use again. Anyhow, the only different thing I did was I used reduced fat buttermilk with two thick and large pieces of chicken breasts cut into 10 pieces (drumstick size) which I bought to cook Curry Chicken with Coconut Milk. I said\"what the heck!\"I just served it with white rice and flax seeds. I couldn't wait to give your recipe 5 stars and tell my experience. I took two bites and my reaction \"OH, MY GOD!\"Seriously! It was crispy&amp;yummy. The chicken breast melted in my mouth! Btw, after a few bites, I decided to add some hot ketchup sauce (like buffalo sauce) on the side. Thnx 2 Utube,I used the left over marinade IMMEDIATELY to bake some biscuits-made my 1st ever dough and biscuits. :-)"

Make sure your oil isn't too hot and you won't burn it. I started out on med and then moved it a little lower after I flipped the chicken. 15 mins on each side for me but you really need to watch it while cooking. Don't let your oil overheat. The breading was a little tougher than I'm use to."
