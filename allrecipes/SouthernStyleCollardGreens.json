They were so salty we couldn't eat them. Our attempts to eliminate the salty flavor resulted in these going in the trash."

Did the hocks in my 8 qt Instant pot for 45 minutes and quick release, then added the greens, vinegar and seasonings and pressure cooked for 25 minutes with a 15 minute natural release before qr. Outstanding results in half the time - highly recommended."

"reviewBody": "In previous comments, I misunderstood the cooks comment about cutting down cooking time when using smoked turkey instead of pork. He was only referring to the cooking time of the turkey, before adding the greens, which is totally correct. Here are a few other comment: The chicken broth is much more bland than the flavor extracted from the smoked meat. You can easily omit the brother...just add a bit extra salt and you will hardly know the difference. About the cooking time...sorry for you Instant Pot (or other pressure cooker) aficionados: You can get the same tenderness, and it will be \"OK\"...but you will NOT get the same flavor as from cooking \"low &amp; slow\", if you cook greens fast, under pressure. Only low and slow does it...hence the \"crock pot\" sort of cooking works well, but \"express\" cooking methods do not."

Followed with chicken broth after letting everything get fragrant, and then followed with collards from the garden. We had about 2.4 lbs of green versus the 3 lbs called for. \n\nThe recipe states “medium heat,” but you have to go based on your appliance. We used medium heat, but it was too close to a boil. Aimed for a simmer, and found they were tender after just an hour. Amazing recipe."

In fact the last time I noticed, without comment, her sneezing seconds.\nGreat recipe!"

I diced up hickory smoked bacon and cooked crispy, once I added the greens I added the bacon and a few spoon fulls of bacon grease. I also added some cajun seasoning, other times I’ll just do red pepper flakes and if the kids are eating I’ll divide the batch once the greens cook down and just keep some with out spice. Overall amazing and easy to follow recipe. I’ll definitely be using it again."

If any of the brown sugar crust from ham is used, reduce the amount of sugar you add.\nAlso to reduce bitterness in your greens, after you wash them, throw in brown paper bag &amp; put in freezer overnight. \nThe “frost” is what brings out the natural sugars. \nNow I’m thinking of trying them with cornmeal dumplings."

She usually makes them and has perfected them, but I decided to cook them for her for a recent birthday celebration. My barometer of success with this recipe was her opinion. She absolutely loved them! I really liked them, too and will make them again for sure. The only changes I made was to sub in smoked turkey neck for the ham hocks since some in my family don't eat pork and I added maybe 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes because I like a little kick. Everyone loved these. This will be my go to recipe for greens."
