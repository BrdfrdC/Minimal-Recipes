"reviewBody": "French onion soup is my favorite. This recipe is seriously lacking. Olive oil should be added with the butter to keep butter from burning. The onions must be caramelized - this takes time, up 2hours in cooking on kow heat. 10 min saute is not going to do it. Try 2 bay leaves, not 6. White wine - good, needs to be dry, try Pinot grigio. Add 2 tbsp sherry too. Swiss cheese, not mozerella. These would be major improvements"

I did not use canned broth, I used boullion, also, I did not bake it, I let it get up to a simmer and at that point turned the heat down to medium/low for a little over 2 hours. This is EASY and a fall/winter must!"

Followed directions exactly, and this stuff tastes fabulous!!!! It was so easy... I'll never buy onion soup mix again (and I'll have an excuse to keep more wine on hand!! :) Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe"
