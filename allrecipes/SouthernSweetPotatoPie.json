I added extra vanilla and cut the sugar to 1 cup.It took longer than an hour to cook. I had to turn the oven up to 400 degrees to get the pastry brown. The pie was very good. These are my first sweet potato pies!"

I just add lemon (1/2) squeezed, I double the flavoring an add 1/4 teaspoon of ginger. It taste like Christmas!

My new mother and father-in-law each had a piece and they really loved it! I like the fact that it's not as heavy as a pumpkin pie; my mother-in-law had never had it either and said it had a \"good flavour\". It does make two really full pies and I had filling left over. I saved it to make some tarts with, so there's no waste. (BTW: My dogs LOVE sweet potatos and one was trying to eat the peels as I made these pies! So, I boiled two extra potatos and mashed them with their skins on to feed to the dogs. I give them a spoonful in their kibble. They just inhale it! Another way I've cooked sweet potatos for them is to cut them up and boil them in chicken broth with cut up cabbage. They just go crazy for it!)"

My boss said it was the most delicious pie he had ever eaten and my friend said she'd kill me if I didn't give her the recipe.\n\nMy rating is a four star because of the evaporated milk. I could taste it with/over the sweet potatoes. It added a rich/caramelly touch which I thought was really nice but detracted from the sweet potatoes. I would have given it three stars, as a good recipe, but the rave reviews pushed it up.\n\nFor alterations, I did half white, half brown sugar and topped one with marshmallow. I also used my own spice blend and upped the spices, as milk products mute the flavour of pumpkin pie spice. I also used orange sweet potatoes, but I'm keen to try it with purple, as I have had good success with purple candied yams."

I also read from another review to add ground cinnamon and extra milk so i did that to. Im soooo excited about this dish and can't wait to share it with friends and family. I defiantly recommend this recipe."

I also add 1 tsp. of cinammon. I bake for 40 minutes at 350, then turn the oven down to 300, cover the crust with aluminum foil and continue for another 30 minutes. This prevents the crust from getting too dark. I use ready-made graham cracker crust."

"reviewBody": "Being from GA I had never had a pumpkin pie! It was always Sweet Potato that my family made for the holidays. I had been wanting one for some time now. My husband's family is from KY - Pumpkin was it and I never got SP. So I decided it was time to try to make one like I had as a child. Store bought have way too much spice and just didn't do it for me. This pie was very close to what I remember. Recipe calls for 3 sweet potatoes. Sweet potatoes come in all sizes and shapes. I wish that it had stated how many cups. I ended up with 4 cups of potatoes. I only used 2 cup of sugar and that was plenty, any more and I think it would have been too sweet, as some people have said in their review. I did not have nutmeg, so on one pie I sprinkled a little cinnamon. Both were good with and without it. Other than a little less sugar the only thing that I would change would be to add maybe 1 teaspoon of salt to the mixture, other than that it is a good recipe that I am keeping. Oh, and I started checking it at 45 min.s so I did not burn it. The pies were ready at 50 min.s but ovens cook differently. I start checking though at 45 min.s."
