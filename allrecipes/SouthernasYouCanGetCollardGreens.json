Did add low salt soy sauce (a dash). Some chopped onion, crushed red pepper, couple lemon wedges and a bit of whole peppercorns. My ham bone was left over. Simmered on low for 3 hours. Excellent!"

"reviewBody": "The ingredients are right on, but not the cooking directions. First, wash your ham hocks off and put them in a pot, cover with water, bring to a boil and cook over medium heat for about fifteen minutes and pour the water off. Then, start a fresh pot with water to cover and cook until almost tender, but not quite done. It could take as long as three hours. It depends on your cookware, your fire, etc.. You can boil them on high heat, but watch them and add water if necessary. Then, when they're almost tender, but not too tender, add your remaining ingredients and bring to a boil. You won't need too much salt and I always use crushed red pepper, a white or yellow onion, quartered, a few cloves of garlic, chopped and even some cajun seasoning. Simmer about an hour, or until the greens are the way you like them. Some people like them chewy, so take a few out after about 45 minutes and taste them for tenderness. These steps are necessary to keep from having your greens too salty or overcooking them. Serve with vinegar and hot sauce, like Louisiana Hot Sauce. Yummy!"

I used 2 smoke ham shanks and 32 oz chicken broth with water in slow cooker all night. Woke up to a wonderful aroma! Used 2 bunches of collard greens. Agree to coarsely chop onions. Minced onions make the predominate flavor onion. Not good. Thank you for a wonderful recipe! This has become a very regular recipe."

I also used chicken bouillon instead of broth and as other have suggested, I added a tbls of brown sugar to take out the bitterness. The sugar did not make it sweet at all. I also cooked the ham hocks a bit before adding the greens. A new staple to our menu THANKS SO MUCH Southerngirl!"

I did use a little less than half just regular verge broth and the rest water for the liquid because I was worried about it being too salty. I also added just a bit of honey like others suggested. I ate them with cornered and sime caramelized onions. So good!!!!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe is ALL that!!\n\nI have never cooked collard green until today. My picky kids wanted seconds! Some small changes I made: Used packaged concentrated tubes of chicken broth, rather than the can. Used 1/2 smoked turkey leg for flavor, since we dont eat pork (If you use the whole leg, the smoked turkey might be overwhelming in taste). Put a Tablespoon of brown sugar with the vinegar. I think I will use 1/2 tablespoon of vinegar instead, cause it still had that vinegar taste (Thats the purpose of the brown sugar, to eliminate that taste). Oh man, this will be a favorite at te table. Especialy since my kids wil eat their veggies!"

Followed the basic recipe to the letter, minus the hocks (used smoked turkey wings). Oh, I did simmer the turkey wings for about an hour in the broth and water before adding the greens because that what mom does). Also added about tsp of dark brown sugar and dash of red pepper flakes. I used kosher salt and black pepper in the grinder to taste. Plan on looking at the rest of your recipes Southerngirl3.

I also added about 1/8 cup of chopped pecans, to reduce the strong smell that the green make when you cook them. It works perfect every time. My fiance and daughter both ate these , even though neither one of them like greens, so they say. :-)"

I always slow cook my ham hocks in my broth and vinegar. That seems to produce the best flavor. Then I strain the broth before using it for the greens. Whooo!
