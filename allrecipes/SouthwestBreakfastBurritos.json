If you have an air fryer that’s our preferred way to reheat in the morning \n\nWe did half bacon and half sausage because ... bacon. \n6 inch tortillas were way too small and we found rolling was easier with bigger ones. You can add potato if you want a heavier breakfast."

I did not change much...just used Jimmy Dean's Bacon Lover's Pork sausage, and instead of taco seasoning, I used fajita seasoning, and finally instead of the tomato, I used a well drained can of mild Rotel. This made so many burritos that I was able to freeze several and had a quick breakfast whenever I decided to use them. The prep takes a while, but I would imagine it would go faster with at least 2 people. Thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe is AWESOME. Followed the recipe exactly. Love the concept - spend a little more time up front, and have some to throw in the freezer later. Used about 1.5 pounds of sausage (hot/mild mix) and made 15 burritos. Make sure to drain the eggs and sausage well! Probably will take it down to 1 heaping tablespoon of Taco Seasoning I (to taste) and may play with adding brown rice to stretch these further. No luck with the whole wheat tortillas - they tore, will stick with white or multigrain from here out! Didn't wait for the mix to cool down before adding in the cheddar, it all worked fine. Had to microwave the tortillas in batches of 3-4 for 30 seconds at a time to make them pliable enough to wrap without tearing. 40 seconds from the fridge (in the microwave) to my tummy! I'm wondering how these will be out of the freezer - will update at that point."

I LOVED this &amp; love how far it stretches too. We 1/2ed teh recepie &amp; he still had plenty to take for lunch the next day. LOVE IT!"

Also, I wanted to try this because I need something FAST to eat in the morning, but these burritos turn tough as rubber after being frozen. I literally had to use a steak knife at some points."

"reviewBody": "Hubbie exclaimed \"Yowza!\" when, on the way out the door to work in his typical grab-for-granola-bar, I placed one of THESE in his hand instead. In his words, caveman-style b/t bites, \"Ev.Er.Ey.Day.Me.Wantie.\" I scaled the recipe back, not expecting the elated response, and added some bell peppers, and instead of fresh tomato, I used a drained can of Rotel. Also, we eschew taco packets in this house, since having discovered \"Taco Seasoning I\" recipe on here, so I used 1 TB of that. Just the right kick, and really tasty."

Not to mention it tastes AMAZING too ;) Edit: I did leave out the cilantro (I'm not too fond of the flavor) and the jalapenos (I didn't have any) and just added a little more taco seasoning."

"reviewBody": "Breakfast burritos are awesome and pretty much contain every food group! They can be made ahead of time and are perfect for on the go. I cut the recipe way back because I didn't need quite that many and made my own taco seasoning. I added some crumbed bacon and diced green pepper plus a mix of cheddar and jack cheeses. You can add pretty much anything you want or have on hand because once you combine meat, scrambled eggs and cheese in a warm tortilla it's bound to be good. All you need is a side of salsa, sour cream, a little tabaso or cholula and you're in breakfast heaven!"

I garnished these with homemade salsa and FF sour cream. We all ate the heck out of these. There was a little leftover so I just assembled it and wrapped them up for a late night snack for my husband. YUM. It really makes a ton which is a blessing for me because my three boys can EAT. You saved my behind this morning, Norman. I swear this whole meal didn't cost me any more than five bucks."
