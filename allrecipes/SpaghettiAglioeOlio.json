Just as a reminder on how to successfully toast the garlic in the olive oil. Adding the pasta water to the toasted garlic really aids in coating each strand of spaghetti with all that goodness. My husband added sautéed shrimp &amp; mushrooms to his dish. Such an easy and delicious meal with a garden salad and garlic bread. Company worthy! Thanks Chef John!"

Family loved it, box and a half of pasta and 3 chicken breasts with nothing left to show for it!"

"reviewBody": "I love this dish. It's been a staple of mine for years. While I use the same ingredients, I find it much easier to mix all the ingredients, except the cheese, in the pan with the olive oil and garlic. I pour it over the drained pasta and then add half the cheese and mix well.\nA few other notes: I don't like to brown the garlic. I find that makes it bitter. Here's what I do: heat the oil over medium heat. When it's hot, turn the heat to low and add the garlic. Saute it slowly until it's soft and translucent, but not brown. It takes about 5 minutes. Then add the pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt. Heat for a few minutes to blend flavors. Add the parsley. Then pour the sauce over the drained pasta and mix well.\n\nI use 3/4 Cup of olive oil for each pound of pasta.\n\nAlso I like to add a can of anchovies to the pan along with the red pepper and black pepper. Stir and break up the anchovies with a fork until they're dissolved. Do not add extra salt when using anchovies.\n\nBuon appetito!"
