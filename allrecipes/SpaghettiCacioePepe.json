I thought I was buying a high-quality cheese, but it turned out that it had a chemical side taste, even though it was not a ready grated packed type, but a freshly cut from a slab in a grocery store display. Make sure you like the cheese before you buy it because it can ruin your entire dish"

Or maybe I didn't pack the cheese in the measuring cups enough? I'm not sure. We added some salt and that helped a lot. I used freshly ground pepper and I'm glad I did, it tasted great. I wish I had read through all the reviews first, because I just dumped all the cheese right in there and it did get clumpy. Maybe that was another cause for lack of flavor? Either way, we liked it, and I'm definitely making it again, but doing so with Romano (hopefully I can find it next time!) and carefully adding it to the spaghetti."

Add some red pepper flakes, or a touch of some crushed chili peppers additional heat. Simple, economical, versatile and delicious!"

"reviewBody": "Yummy!!! We made this, with a few changes, based on other recipes I had read. I used butter instead of olive oil, just for the creaminess. Then, we used bucatini pasta, instead of spaghetti, for a heartier bite. I also split the cheese and used 1 cup Romano and 3/4 Parmesan. Gotta say this is a keeper and SO much better than the cacio e Pepe I recently had in New York at an “authentic Italian” restaurant. I can also say that, while it’s perfect on its own, you could add any number of things to this dish, like shrimp, pancetta, a little veg, etc just for kicks and giggles."

The olive oil overwhelmed the taste and the butter tasted exactly the same as margarine. I use Asiago cheese but essentially the same recipe."
