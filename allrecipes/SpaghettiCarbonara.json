Sausage seems to always be on sale, and with prices the way they are, I found sausage to substitute perfectly for bacon in this recipe! Cook the sausage in the oven, slice it up, and follow the rest of the directions. It is hearty, delicious, and budget friendly. Tonight, I am adding in mixed vegetables. YUM!"

The only thing I did differently was to add a little more olive oil than what it called for as the last time I made spaghetti carbonara (a different recipe) it had come out a little dry. Also kept back a 1/4 cup of the pasta water to pour over it after all the ingredients were mixed in, as well."

Another reviewer also mentioned to much spaghetti - curious as to what the ideal ratio is. Also, I don't think more olive oil is needed once the spaghetti is added and thoroughly mixed. But it must be mixed thoroughly. I added some additional oil when mixing it together and thought the final dish was a bit too oily for me. Overall a good recipe and I will make this again."

So I'm always casting about for a more \"fool-proof\" recipe. This one was pretty close. One negative: I have learned to NEVER mix oil with just-drained pasta so I didn't do it here. Sauce will not adhere to oily pasta. Oh, yeah, one more thing - ALWAYS reserve some pasta water to manage the consistency of the sauce. You don't have to use it but you'll want it there in case you need it. All that cream and peas and other stuff just makes it a different recipe, not a classic carbonara. Overall, a pretty good recipe."

"reviewBody": "I believe the instructions for the egg/parmesan mixture are wrong. I am surprised so many people had success making the dish this way. The minute I added the eggs into the pan, I knew this was not right. I ended up with scrambled eggs, even on the lowest heat. I looked at other carbonara recipes and they said to mix the beaten eggs with the parmesan first, then add to pasta OFF the heat. Also, it suggests to add a little of the pasta cooking water to the the entire mixture in order to get the desired consistency. I think the eggs can also be reduced to just 2 and that would be enough for the sauce. The saving grace of this dish is the bacon. My son still loved the pasta, even though he thought the scrambled eggs were a little weird. I will make this again in the future but with modified cooking method."

"reviewBody": "My husband made this a few months back and it was just okay ( 2 star rating), BUT then I tried it again and merely followed the advice of one of the reviewers who stated, \"An Italian friend of mine who cooks told me that the proper way to make smooth Carbonara sauce is to combine the beaten eggs with the grated Parmesan, and then to pour that mixture onto the spaghetti once the spaghett has cooled slightly (so that it's still hot, but so the eggs don't cook (that was our problem last time making it dry and sticky) and the cheese melts seamlessly into the eggs and pasta)...\". I followed this to a \"T\" and it was INCREDIBLY CREAMY!!! 5 STAR PLUS!!!!! Here is my husband's previous review (what you can expect when you don't allow the spaghetti to cool): This pasta is just a little bland and dry for my tastes, but I am largly ignorant of what Spaghetti Carbonara is supposed to taste like. That being said, our company loved the dish and said it reminded them of the food they ate while living in France which apparently tends to have a little less zing than American recipes. Maybe I'll try preparing it next time with some salmon mixed in rather than bacon."

And it was delicious, but it was the bacon/onion ratio to the noodles that isn’t enough. So I would do more bacon/onion or 1/4lb less of the noodles."

Definitely a crowd pleaser and a keeper!!!"

Used 1/4 Cup sauvignon blanc. Made it in a heavy high walled cast iron pan so when it was time to turn the eggs in with tongs it was on residual heat sitting on the stove. Transferred to large serving bowl that wasn't hot and at that point worked and the parm in so it struck to the hot food not the wall. Had to eat before the salad it was too good to wait!"
