I put the canadian bacon on the cheese, then more cheese on the cb, then after putting on pineapple, a little more cheese. Used a 26 oz jar pasta sauce. It was yummy! Thanks for the great idea!"

Doubled everything else, and used basil, shredded Swiss, sharp, and grated Parmesan, along with the mozzarella. I used a large cast iron skillet. I put the oven back to 425° during last 10mins to brown the pepperoni. Super good!!!!!"
