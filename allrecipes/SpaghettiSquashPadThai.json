I also add a bit of lime and sometimes add curry paste."

To finish it, I sprinkled some chopped peanuts on top for more texture, but otherwise made as directed. You don't really need the chicken, so I'll skip it next time. I will also probably try the squeeze of lime, others have suggested, to brighten it up but it is delicious as written."

I made a few changes out of necessity ( used teriyaki sauce instead of soy and no cilantro) added red pepper flakes because I cook Thai and know our spicy level, and For next time I would for personal preference reduce chicken broth a few ounces, and stir fry the vegetables a little less time. So good!"

"reviewBody": "I made several omissions/substitutions just based on what I had in my pantry. I did not have fish or oyster sauce. I am sure that leaving them out changed the flavor profile a lot, but on the plus side it made it vegan (for those who need that), and still delicious. Instead I added an additional tablespoon of soy sauce. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and omitted the chicken, because I am vegetarian. \n\nI also did not have chili garlic sauce but I know from experience that siracha + garlic powder will work. You need less siracha though because it is spicier.\n\nI made noodles on the side for those who prefer that (I have kids), and left the spaghetti squash seperate from the sauce and veggies. I sliced broccoli into matchsticks for the vegggie, along with a diced onion. I had a huge broccoli head so I decided not to add any additional veggies.\n\nThe sauce with the just barely crunchy squash noodles was a satisfying combo. I would suggest adding tofu or something of you omit the chicken because I realized once I was eating that it really could use more proten.\n\nMy favorite recipies are versatile and can take a good amount of tweaking. This one seems to fit the bill. Despite my changing it a good deal it was delicious."

I agree with a previous reviewer that keeping the squash separate until the end is good, but tossing the squash into the rest of it is important to make it more pad-Thai-ish. This was my first attempt, so I split the sauce and chicken, half over squash, half over pho noodles (for my kids). They loved it! Next time I’ll probably up the chili sauce for more spice. It’s a solid recipe, as is."

I used mushrooms since I did not have zucchini and I did increase the chili garlic sauce since we like spice. I used the spaghetti squash as a bed for the vegetables and sauce, glad I did not mix the squash into the dish. Peanuts and lime juice on top are a must! I will put the cilantro as a garnish on top next time rather than cooking it. We will definitely make again!"

Didn't have broccoli slaw, so used some matchstick carrots. Also used Xanthan gum instead of corn starch to lower the carbs a bit."

I believe that maybe adding coconut milk to the sauce would give it a richer flavor and a more Thai flavor. And as others suggested, slices of lime with crushed peanuts on top would make this perfect. . I would definitely make this recipe again with those changes"

I added a bit of honey to the sauce because we like it that way, and I used the veggies I had on hand for the stir fry (shredded cabbage, carrots, onions, bell peppers). I used tofu instead of chicken. I microwaved my spaghetti squash and served it under the pad thai instead of adding it to the veggies. See what I mean by adaptable?! I love it. Thank you so much!"

To the sauce i also added a bunch of pb2, as it increased the peanut flavor, added an extra spoon of garlic chilli sauce, as i like things spicy, and added a few tbs of brown sugar. I also used precut strir fry mix and chicken. In the end there was a ton of food and actually a ton of sauce. I could have used 1/2 the sauce, but it was really good, so i used it all. Yum yum yum.....thank you!!!!!"

It was a small amount, and I followed the top reviewer's suggestion of just topping the squash with the sauce and veggies. Easy, and it all basically mixed in. I sauteed shredded green cabbage (also leftover!) and added a handful of frozen tri-color peppers just until they still had crispness to them. I didn't add the chicken or zucchini, but this dish could work with so many things (other veggies, shrimp, etc). I would make this again. Thanks!"

Then I stirred sauce into vegetables and topped sp. squash w/the veg. sauce. I squeezed lime juice over top. I used ketchup for chili/garlic sauce left out oyster sauce and used EVOO instead of sesame oil. 2nd time I only added 1/2 of the broccoli slaw, 1/2 the pepper and 1/2 the zucchini. It seemed like there was too much sauce for the ingredients. So either cut down the spaghetti squash or add closer to the original amts. of vegetables. I also thought it could have used a little more peanut butter, I didn't get too much of the peanut butter taste."

The only changes I made is to add Thai peppers to the peanut sauce while it is simmering and to increase the peanut butter 1 T to make the peanut flavor slightly stronger. Also, the easiest way to cook a spaghetti squash is to poke it with a metal skewer and then bake at 400 for 1 hr- 1 hr 15 min in a lined pan. So much easier than trying to cut an uncooked spaghetti squash."

Only change I made is that I added the veggie mixture to the chicken and sauce instead of vice versa. I felt like there was more veggie's for the amount of sauce (could have been due to the size of the spaghetti squash) I did this to make sure there was enough sauce. I ended up using about 3/4 of the veggies. I also sprinkled chopped peanuts on top."
