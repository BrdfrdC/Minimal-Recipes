"reviewBody": "My entire family loves this classic carbonara recipe! I used 4 oz of pancetta from Trader Joe's instead of the guanciale. I didn't add olive oil; there was no need. I just started the pancetta off in a cold pan over medium heat while the spaghetti was cooking. Then, I transferred the drained spaghetti to the pan with the pancetta and tossed to coat. I then added that to a large mixing bowl containing the egg and cheese. I tossed to coat and returned to the pan briefly over medium low heat. Perfect! I love it with a lot of black pepper to serve."

Cook the bacon and discard about half the fat. Add the chopped garlic and sauté until fragrant, 2-3 mins. Fish out most of the garlic and add “un po” (about 2-3 tablespoons) of EVOO. Keep the oil/garlic mixture warm but not super hot. After adding the egg mixture to the pasta, pour in the garlic oil and toss. A family favorite!"

I made it exactly as written, only I doubled it so I would have leftovers for lunches (something I usually do but have since realized may not be a good thing to do with carbonara due to the eggs; haven't tried reheating yet, so I guess we'll see!) The only thing I can think of is that I possible added a little too much cheese, as I just eyeballed it. Although chopping the bacon/pancetta was a pain, I may give this another shot and hopefully it'll come out a little more creamy next time."

He asked me if it had cream in it...because an authentic carbonara does NOT have cream. I assured him that it had no cream in it. Once we started, he was a bit frustrated because I wasn't doing it \"his\" way but he still was a great help. It turned out wonderful and he admitted that it was \"just as good as his\". I looooooved it, and will be making it again. It was VERY easy....and seeing the video before I made it ensured that I knew just when to add the egg mixture so that it wouldn't \"cook up some scrambled eggs\". Thanks for the great, simple recipe!!!"

"reviewBody": "I really love carbonara. This recipe didn't disappoint. When I got the pancetta from the deli, I had them slice it fairly thin. I think that was a mistake. It made it more salty then I intended. What I should've done is get it cut thick and cube it so that you get small pops of salty flavor. When it is thin, it spreads out too much and gives too much salty flavor to it. But still, I'll make this again! I have to get the recipe right. ;)"

Next time will make it with parmiagiano reggiano cheese for a nuttier, milder flavor. Leftovers are great for breakfast. This is the best recipe I have found."
