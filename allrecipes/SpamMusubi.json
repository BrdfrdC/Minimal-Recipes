I personally prefer the more traditional method: just rice (with or without sushi seasoning of a bit of vinegar and sugar), spam, soy and sugar. As other reviewers have said, you fry up the spam with just a tiny bit of Pam or no oil at all, then add the sugar and soy to the pan allowing it to caramelize. Marinating it is salt overkill, as is the oyster sauce."

Here are the slight tweaks I have made. I don’t add vinegar to the rice ( I did before and prefer it without), I actually marinate my spam a little longer at least 15/20 minutes per side as it lets it soak up more of the flavor from the sauce. I use an old spam can for my rice mold and I add furikake to the rice then add the spam on top. You can even add a little of the left over sauce on the rice as well for more flavor. I wrap with seaweed and water helps seal it together. Then wrap in"

"reviewBody": "I’ve tried many musubi recipes and this one will be my permanent one! The only thing I would do differently next time, is I wouldn’t use so much rice vinegar in the rice (I didn’t soak for 4 hours; just cooked as usual). The vinegar taste and smell was so overpowering. I even added two more cups of unseasoned white rice, and added scrambled eggs to the musubi, and the vinegar was still so strong. Maybe only 2 tbl would be enough; just enough to get the rice the right consistency. I also burned the first patch of musubi.I turned the heat down, scraped off excessive marinade, and kept a closer eye on the rest and they come out perfect."

He isn’t a fan of the fishy or vinegar taste tho so I omit the rice vinegar and don’t sub anything in place of it. I also double the soy sauce and omit the oyster sauce. Tastes just like the ones he gets in Hawaii so he’s a huge fan."

(I can see why they use narrow strips because it gets tough to bite thru without the filling getting squeezed out.)\n\nKeep a small bit of water nearby to keep your hands wet and nonsticky for forming the rice. Great to wrap individually in plastic wrap for a filling snack."

I may go with low sodium soy sauce as they were a bit salty, or half and half. Will definitely make again."

The only thing we did differently is use less rice (didn’t want to get full too quick!) we were able to make like 6-10 musubi per container. My biggest tip is to try not to cook it when it’s soaked in the marinated sauce. Or else it’ll “burn” a little more than you want. Also, that rice vinegar is key!!!! Balances out the saltiness!!! We added scrambled eggs and avocado for taste.Enjoy!!!!"

Place that on top of nori, add rice, press down, add spam and press down to release mold then fold nori over. I don’t eat spam but my family does and we normally don’t use sushi rice but regular calories medium grain rice and fry the spam in shoyu and sugar. This recipe sounds interesting to make for my family. Thanks!"

People that came that never eat spam nor would ever, ate this. The Nori was too chewy on the first try, but after it sat for a few minutes and was moist it was easier to eat. So the second time I made it, which was today. I ran the Nori gently through the water before setting on my prep mat and adding the rice and spam. Super easy."

I mainly used this recipe to get the marinade I was looking for. I didn't bother soaking the rice. I would definitely say follow the rule of only marinating the spam for 5 minutes because any longer and it gets very salty. I did not have any rice vinegar so I didn't use it but it tasted just like the musubi I normally buy."

Husband had it and really enjoyed it. I only used two sheets of nori and toasted it on the burner and cut into 1.5 inch strips with scissors. Like someone else mentioned, I used the spam container as my mold. Use Saran Wrap to line the mold then add rice. With a wet spoon, press down the rice. Pull the Saran Wrap out with the rice. Will definitely make again."

Most of us are the former, and love this Frankenstein'd meat.\n\nAnyhow, just want to say I've been using this recipe for a while as it captures my preferred flavor of spam musubi. You can, of course, substitute chicken, bacon, pork, etc., but only in addition to also having dedicated spam musubi as well. Because if you make this without any spam, you are not worthy.\n\nIf you're in the mood to build further upon this recipe, then you can do what I dub as the Royal Hawaiian Spam Musubi. To do this, cook some bacon and scramble some eggs. When \"assembling\" your masterpiece, do the rice half-way, then add a bacon layer, topped by the egg, then add the spam layer. Wrap it up fully in seaweed (only flaw in this posted recipe is the thin band of seaweed - this baby needs to be fully wrapped in seaweed) and you have a nice variant of the base spam musubi.\n\nThat aside, even if you just do the spam musubi per the directions, it's great."

"reviewBody": "I tried Spam Musubi at a local Hawaiian restaurant and loved it so I had to try and make it at home. \n\nI didn't have 4 hours to marinate the rice, so I used short grain rice, rinsed it 3x until it ran clear and then cooked in my rice cooker according to the package directions. It came out fantastic and really shortened the recipe time. \n\nI also used the low sodium variety of spam. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out so good! My friends commented that they would never have guessed it had spam in it. Marinating and cooking the spam really changes the flavor and texture. It's salty, but the rice is not so it creates a fantastic savory unctuous balance."

"reviewBody": "I think the addition of the oyster sauce is pretty good...I always use aloha shoyu...you definitely do not have to soak your rice for 4 hours...the secret to getting a good sauce is to fry the spam and while it's hot dip it into the shoyu mixture onto steamed rice ...making sure to generously dip so that the sauce soaks a little into the rice while its wrapped and wrap quickly....the steam when the musubi is wrapped with saran wrap will soften the wrap to the correct consistency. You can purchase the correct sized wrap at the Asian store it comes in packs of 100 to make it easier...the above picture barely has anything...you can use other things but the spam, sauce, rice combo if done correctly should be all you will need...because there are alot of flavors already"

I put the rice into the rice cooker... add water and push the button. Perfect rice in less than 30 minutes. A fun way to shape the rice so it fits the spam slices just right, is to pat the rice out on a sheet of parchment paper to the thickness you want. Then use the spam can like a cookie cutter to cut the rice. (Works best if you cut off both the top and bottom of the can)"

It came out more appetizer size, which end the end was better. This is only a four for me when using the seasoned rice vinegar.

"reviewBody": "I grew up eating Spam and Spam Musubi. I always make Spam Musubi using a \"basic sauce\", Spam and nori. I cook rice first then set it aside to cool a bit while I assemble other ingredients. I bring Aloha soy sauce and brown sugar to a medium boil in a saucepan until sugar dissolves. I just eyeball the amount of soy sauce and brown sugar, to taste, never measuring. I omitted the oyster sauce (never used it). I don't fry the spam in vegetable oil. I just cut up the spam in thick slices and add it to the saucepan. I also roast the nori right before putting everything together. Using a musubi maker I place the nori inside, add rice and press it into the mold, add a slice of cooked spam, another layer of rice on top and press the top musubi maker onto everything together tightly. I then remove the mold and use a sharp knife to cut the musubi in half. Sometimes I make this for breakfast or lunch. While I do have \"my own\" way of making Spam Musubi sauce (without oyster sauce), others may find adding a little more seasoning to theirs, such as this recipe, more suitable. Thou Spam Musubi is easy to make, it is a filling and tasty snack. Some people add nori furikake and other ingredients to the Spam Musubi to jazz it up. You will find Spam Musubi anywhere here in Hawaii, even at the 7-Eleven stores. This can be served as an appetizer, part of an okazuya and a snack on-the-go! Very popular and Onolicious!!"

I also add Furikake rice reasoning to the rice. I wrap each spam musubi in plastic wrap (after it's cooled). If you put it in the fridge, the rice can get hard.
