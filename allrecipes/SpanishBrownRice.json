I like mine with heat, like a mix of fresh ground chilies. I charred a few for deeper flavor and bit more garlic, (also charred a couple cloves) add black pepper and yum."

Added a pinch each of cumin, mild chili powder and ancho chili powder. This is a fabulous recipe to work to your taste. Thanks for a brown rice recipe that is so so good."

Followed this recipe and it turned out perfect - you would never know it's brown rice. I add black beans, corn, and use pam spray to fry up onion, garlic, red and green peppers with it. Add shrimp at the end. So healthy and so delicious."

I know what I did wrong, so not blaming the recipe. Other than that, this made a tasty meal. I paired this with Honey Glazed Chicken. Came out very good. Will make excellent leftovers."

I doubled it and placed it in my ricemaker (i have never been able to make rice). I did not use extra tomatoes. I used chicken stock with tomato sauce for the liquid. Everything else remained the same. The rice still seemed a little chewy but since i always have problems with rice, who knows. I also altered the recipe so i can't blame that. The flavor is spot on goodness!"

But add onion, pepper, corn, black beans, green onion, and lime juice (plus salt), and it’s a pretty decent main dish salad."

Added the rice to brown a little before adding the liquid. Susbstituted some of the water with leftover Chicken Broth (1/4 cup) to use it up. I used medium salsa (1/2 cup), omitted the tomatoes because I used onion and red pepper, and at the recommendation of some, added garlic powder and chili powder - 2 shakes of each. I will make again and may add a little more of the seasoning because I love extra flavor. I would give 5 stars but I altered the recipe."

Also increased the garlic to a tablespoon and added a small handful of Cilantro leaves for good measure and it was outstanding. Attractive presentation as well. Definitely use chunky salsa and diced tomatoes with chilies. The only tweak I'll make next time is to cook it one full hour since the rice keeps turning out a little firm for my tastes."

Used a fresh Roma tomato instead of the cup of diced tomatoes. My rice was done right at the 45 minute mark. The family said they would enjoy it more if it was white rice, but personally, I liked the brown. Next time I'll add some cilantro for personal family preference."
