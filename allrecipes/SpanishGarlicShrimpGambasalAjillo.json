"reviewBody": "Lovely recipe - and as easy as Chef John describes. Although I had 'Hot Smoked Paprika' - I found it not 'hot' - so I added a 1/4 teaspoon or so of Cayenne pepper powder - be careful I suppose. I par-cooked the shrimp, and then took everything to a dinner party as a tapas round. finishing and serving from the hostess' kitchen. Also, the hostess I prepared this for - from Barcelona - surprised me by giving the finished bowl of shrimp and sauce a quick squeeze of a half lemon. Was great with the added tartness but did change it from the original, I suppose. Still very rich and complex. The lemon did 'brighten' the flavoring. VERY Scalable - I used three bags - each bag had 2 lbs of Jumbo frozen raw shrimp - 8/12 pieces per pound. Par-cooked and finished in batches."

I didn't have sherry so used marsala instead.\nI then added the shrimp and in about 2 min everything came together perfectly. \nIt needed a little something more so added a little salt on the cooked shrimp and it made the flavors stand out more. \nStill need to find something to make it pop but will def make it again... Good recipe."

I dried the shrimp before tossing with the salt and paprika - it keeps the paprika on the shrimp while cooking so it retains the rich red color. I brought it to a Spanish- themed dinner and it was gone in minutes. I don’t drink so substituted balsamic vinegar for the sherry. Wish I had taken a picture but I will next time I make it. Loved it."

I’d added a crostini to the bottom of the bowl, but just didn’t have enough sauce to drizzle over the shrimp to moisten the bread. I know I could double the oil and sherry, but then I'd be adding a ton of calories and fat, as well. Regardless, still delicious and quick-and-easy."

Take the time to thinly slice the garlic instead of dice it as it makes a difference (especially if you soak up the sauce with a nice crusty bread, which you definitely should!). Next time, I will make sure I have a better paprika - the regular stuff is fine, but a smoky hot paprika would have been better. I tried to make up the difference with a bit of chipotle tabasco, which was not out of place but could've been better. This is a very simple recipe which I'll definitely make again."
