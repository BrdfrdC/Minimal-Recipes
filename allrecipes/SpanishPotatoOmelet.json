All I was missing was the crusty french bread! *recipe as-is only fed husby and me. He is a big guy though but I am petite ,so double up if you need more."

I had this as a child but forgot about it. Now it will be in regular rotation with my other favourites. I’ve also had leftovers cold and this was also really good. I skipped the tomato and green onion garnish and served it with a simple lettuce and tomato salad. A perfect light meal! Thank you for this recipe and reminder of my mother’s wonderful kitchen."

This needs to be seasoned well otherwise the combination of eggs and potato could be bland. The addition of tomato and a green salad on the side would make this a very attractive meal. At the point of grilling next time, I will try a sprinkle of strong cheese over the top."

I cook the onion &amp; bell peppers 1st until tender &amp; then I add a can of drained cubed potatoes to the pan . They also make canned sliced potatoes -just be sure to drain well. This eliminates the need to precook in the microwave &amp; saves time because you don't have to peel &amp; slice. I prefer the potatoes soft but cook to your desired brownness. Then add the eggs. This saves so much time on busy mornings"

I was concerned with the amount of oil and would like to try par cooking the potatoes in water and then crisping in a lot less oil.\nOtherwise the method was quick and easy and an excellent option for a simple meal served with salad or a slice of meat."

I always cut the potatoes in the shape of French fries (I have an attachment for my food processor that makes this quick &amp; easy) - for me it is easier to cook this way than using sliced or diced potatoes. Next time I make it I will try it with onions - sounds good. I use my biggest dinner plate to turn it over - have never had a problem.

Then once the egg at bottom were browned on the other pan, I cover it with the other pan and flipped it and let the eggs on top to continue cooking for 3 min until light brown meanwhile I set my tomatoes and garnish with parsley.

"reviewBody": "After the potatoes and onions were done, I simply turned off the heat, added the eggs and left everything to sit and absorb flavours for 20 minutes. No need to dirty up another bowl. I also added a few Brussels sprouts cut into quarters, then near the end of cooking, grated a bit of cheese on top and garnished it with chopped parsley. This recipe is also a great way of using leftover potatoes from last night's dinner."

Served with tomato wedges and green onions. Because the omelette is (supposed to be) plain, I made some flavourful dill bread with cream cheese on the side. A pot of strong coffee rounded out a great breakfast!"

My friend taught me a time saving trick for busy moms that does not change the flavor - she cooks the sliced potatoes w/ the onion &amp; olive oil in a glass pyrex dish in the microwave for 7 minutes or so, or until they're tender. I have a newborn baby &amp; less time, and found a great bag of frozen hash browns at Trader Joe's, no ingredients other than potatoes; I throw the bag in the microwave for 5 minutes with the onion, olive oil, salt/pepper (uncovered in a glass pyrex dish). Then cook the omelette with 7 eggs, use plenty of oil for when you flip it. So good at room temp., better than hot. No other additions. YUM!"

Basic ingredients such as eggs and potatoes are crucial but you can add anything to the mixture that you want such as tomatoes, ham, cheese, (and since I'm from New Mexico) I add green chili. Don't forget to add a generous amount of salt. You don't want to overpower the recipe with it but it is a crucial flavor for the eggs and also helps keep the dish from falling apart."

I think I could cut it in half. 2) This time, I added the onions when I turned the potatoes over but then had to remove the browned potatoes so the onions could cook further. Perhaps next time, I should add them halfway through the cooking time of the first side, at maybe the 5 minute mark? There will definitely be a next as this is a delicious, filling meal."

Should only have added pepper once, I think. Served it with a little shredded sharp cheese &amp; optional salsa instead of tomatoes. Toast &amp; baby carrots made it a quick light supper!"

My only change for next time is to use the same (large) frying pan to cook everything in, and then transfer it to a smaller one before I add the egg mixture...my pan was so big, it tended to make the eggs thin...also hard to flip, but that's not the recipe's fault! The tomatoes (LOVE YOU JOANIE!) and scallions put it over the top! Thanks again! Another staple in my recipe mix!"

It was actually quite quick to make and very filling. I sliced the potatoes on my cheese grater and it made thin slices quickly. The potatoes and onions browned up pretty fast. I would like to try to make this again using half the amount of oil and see the results, as it was a tad greasy in my opinion. Plus, in reality this seems to make 2 large or 3 small servings and not 6 at all. It was nice to make something with what I had in the house that was tasty to."

I also wish it would have specified how long to cook this on low. It took so long that I finally kicked the heat up to medium. Can anyone let us know cook times? Please be careful with over plate flipping because I ended up having my omelet crash back into the pan and break up. I also think you only need 3/4 of a large onion and 1 large tomato. 3 TBS of oil is the perfect amount. To \"Americanize\" this dish I heated the potatoes for 3 mins on 80% power before cooking as someone else suggested (they were perfect), I warmed up the tomatoes for 20 seconds, and covered the omelet with cheddar cheese shreds before garnish. I couldn't imagine eating an omelet without cheese. I will make this again, it tasted so gourmet!!"
