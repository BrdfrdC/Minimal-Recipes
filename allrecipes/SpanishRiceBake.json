I followed the directions and did not substitute anything; this was the first time I used Chile sauce and cumin in a recipe and I think those 2 ingredients help create the distinct flavor. I think you could even skip baking it especially if you're going to eat right away; cooking it in a large covered pan would do the trick. This same dish could be used as ingredients for burritos."

But since brown rice takes longer to cook they were still a bit undercooked. However, my husband seemed to like it actually! It was super Spivey since I jazzed it up a bit to much with extra seasonings, we served with sour cream which took care of that extra spice. This will remain in my arsenal."

"reviewBody": "This was an enjoyable and simple to prepare meal. The flavor was good (although we expected somewhat spicier and added some mild hot sauce) and I decided to use Mexican cheese blend as opposed to sharp cheddar. One instruction that should be clarified is about the rice preparation. It doesn't state anything about needing to cover the pot while cooking the rice, which can have you come out with hard grains at the end. The liquid was insufficient to cook that amount of rice, a little more could have helped the rice to plump us and be tender. Otherwise, it was very good and I will definitely make it again. This is easily altered to fit individual tastes!"

"reviewBody": "It had a lot of flavor, my issue is that I shouldn't have to read the reviews before I make this to have it turn out right. I should know from cooking rice on its own, you are never supposed to lift the cover off when cooking or the rice will not completely cook. This recipe tells you to stir it occasionally. Don't do it unless you don't mind crunchy rice. THAT should be corrected. Then after it was done on the stove, I checked out reviews because after 30min. on the stove, rice not done. Thought maybe I could fix the faux pas by covering the dish in the over for 25-30 minutes. Wrong, it just made it like a soup. So don't cover it while in the oven. It finally solidified more after sitting. Would I make it again? Since I know not to pick up the cover and stire while on stove top, and I know not to cover it while cooking in oven, probably--very flavorful. I added more cheese."

"reviewBody": "We all liked it. Used it to supplement as a soft taco filling. My changes were to cook everything in the same pan. I cooked the onion with the beef which was so lean, I didn't need to drain any grease. I added all remaining ingredients to the pan with just a bit more water and put a lid on the pan cooking almost 40 mins without removing the lid or stirring ( to make sure rice cooked). The only ingredient changes I made were some red and yellow pepper for the green as it was what I had and I used petite diced canned tomatoes. I did by mistake add 3/4 c. chile sauce as I read the recipe wrong. It didn't hurt it, and in fact I might just add the whole bottle next time because there wasn't much left in it. Once it had cooked on the stove top, I removed the lid, stirred it and sprinkled cheese on top then placed the pan in the oven for 10 mins. My husband commented later he really liked it. And he had tried to talk me out of making it!"

I used fire roasted tomatoes with garlic and green chile enchilada sauce.\n\nI also used my Instant Pot to brown the meat along with the onions , then pressure cooked everything for 15 minutes. \n\nit came out really well."

So I improvised and it really turned out great. I used a large can of tomato sauce and 1 can rotel tomatoes and the cup of water, 1 teas. cumin and chili powder, 3 garlic cloves and the onion. Browned the beef with the onion and garlic and salt and pepper. The rice was done in 30 minutes cooked on medium low. Used shredded Mexican cheese covered the pan and cooked on the stove till cheese melted. Served with chopped cilantro, sour cream and Franks hot sauce. Canâ€™t figure out why you need so many pans and place in the oven. Husband loved it."

"reviewBody": "Agree with others that changes make this a much better recipe. I cooked the meat with garlic and 2 T. taco seasoning. Added salsa and tomato sauce. Left out brown sugar, reduced rice to 1/2 cup. Added water only when it seemed to need it. Used the same pan for both browning meat and creating casserole. Despite having less rice, it took more like an hour (on low) to get the rice cooked well enough to eat. But it was worth it in the end! Next time I might add corn too. There's a lot you can do with this dish."

Yum!\n\nTonight, I made it with chicken (boneless breast, diced very small) per hubby's request. It's just as delicious! This has become a family recipe. Thank you!"

The liquid to rice ratio is perfect but you do need to cover the dish while simmering. You can substitute just about any seasons depending on your mood. I've also added a bay leaf and used chili powder instead of cumin. Sometimes I'll put a little Adobo in it as well. \n\nWell done Melodie!"
