I sauteed the I onion and bell pepper together removed them added 2 tablespoons of more oil and toasted the rice. I only added 1 teaspoon of chilli powder and 1/2 tsp of cumin and 1/2 teaspoon of crushed peppers 1 can of tomatoes with mild diced chilis drained. sorry this is not all in order but this is the only way to make it the original had way to many problems."

Then I decreased the water to 1 1/2 cups. Also I was short on time so I skipped sauteing the rice, onions and peppers and put it all in my Insant pot on the rice function. I will definitely make this again. It went great as a side dish to our Sheet Pan Chicken Fajitas, also a great Allrecipies find!"

It was more flavorful than I would have expected, judging by the ingredient list. \n\nEl Pato hot tomato sauce is a good alternative to the can of tomatoes and green chilis, if you're serving it to someone who doesn't like the texture of tomato chunks, just fyi (gives it a richer spicy flavor, too)."

I sometimes use a few dashes of onion powder or garlic powder and chop up a bit of jalapeno to throw in with the onions and rice. Yum!"
