I have never used jasmine rice, fish sauce or siracha before! Nice! I also like to cook my eggs in a separate small pan and add them back to the rice at the end. Finally, I skipped the MSG. This is already addictive enough! Served with Mongolian Beef with Spring Onions from this site. Amazing! Will make again!"

Of the optional ingredients, I used sriracha, green onions, and cilantro. I also used a corn, carrot, green bean, and peas mix in it. The family loved it! Tasted as good as if it was from a restaurant"

Although it wasn't blazing hot it just overpowered the flavors of the fried rice. When I make this again I will only use 1/2 tablespoon so yes, as the recipe states, add the Sriracha to taste. Otherwise this is a keeper and no MSG is needed."
