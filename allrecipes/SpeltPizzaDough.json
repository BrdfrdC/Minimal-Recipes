My wife said it was the best pizza she has had since we moved to our mountain home 10 years ago. When we finished the personal size pizza, I combined the other 3 balls of dough and made a 14\" pizza with the dough rolled out to 1/8\". This one I cooked on a preheated pizza stone in a 500 degree oven for 14 minutes. EVEN BETTER! We ate it all. No more Papa Johns!"

I can roll it out fairly thin and get something light and crispy, or leave it a little thicker, and get something more traditionally pizza-doughy. It's delicious either way. My spelt flour is not sprouted -- just plain spelt flour. It usually leavens faster than the recipe predicts, which is good, because I'm usually hungry and ready to cook faster! Thanks for this great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "The instructions for making the dough were perfect (following along with the video for more details helped a lot for this inexperienced dough maker). I will say, rolling the dough out to about the size of the cast iron pan is a good size, as the ones that we rolled out thinner and cooked on a cookie sheet ended up burning in a 525 degree oven on the bottom rack for 5 minutes (cooked in the bottom of the oven because I wanted a crispy bottom). I took off one star because pizza crust is my son's favorite part, and this pizza crust was inedible for him."

My family has been playing around with spelt flour for pancakes and some bread. This is what i've been looking for. Tried it out today and it taste great! Great tip on how to make it crunchy with a cast iron pan. Threw it in the fridge after it proofed. Took it out 30 mins before using it and it worked great!"

I was doing a lot of fireplace cooking during Irma as my power was out. This would be Incredible to cook on a campfire or grill. Never thought of pizza over the fire. I am on it! The beauty of it is taking the skillet off the stovetop and popping it right into the oven!"

I followed the advice from the video and heated it in a cast iron pan on the stovetop before baking, and that was a mistake. The crusts burned on the bottom, and it was unnecessary anyway, since they baked plenty crispy at 475. Next time I'll try using a pizza pan and seeing if they might be a bit chewier that way."

"reviewBody": "Just as a tip make sure you are not overzealous with the amount of dough you use for an individual pizza. After the dough rises slightly its a good idea to stretch it out relatively thin so you end up with a lighter feeling pizza. It's heavy if you use regular/fast food pizza thickness. You can also make small pizza pockets or eat thirds or halves of individual pizzas."

"reviewBody": "Tasty. But you need to do your research on spelt. It is NOT gluten-free so celiacs and other gluten-related diseases may NOT use this. It is much lower in gluten than bread wheat and has more nutrients. Makes it healthier for most of us to be sure and I use it frequently in my flour blends when I want a little more rising action. The two wheats belong to the same genera but spelt is either a different species or is a subspecies. Apparently this last issue is till being debated."

"reviewBody": "I have made many spelt pizza dough recipes, getting soggy crumby bottoms that stick to the pan....This one is hands down, the BEST. I followed the recipe to a T, and got a wonderful little pizza, with a crunchy base and a soft middle. It held up well to the toppings I added--and one of the pizzas was a meatlovers, so it had a lot of toppings on it. My family avoids wheat as we do not tolerate it very well, however we digest spelt just fine. I don't think I'll find a better recipe than this one, so I think I'll stop looking! Although I am wondering if this one might lend itself to my grill....we'll see!"
