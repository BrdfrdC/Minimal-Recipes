I will try with roasted squash next time. I added an apple for slight sweetness. The spices were fine, but might add more ginger next time. I did not have vermouth, so I substituted dry white wine. I garnished the soup with roasted pumpkin seeds &amp; skipped the extra sour cream. Yum!"

After cooking potatoes and carrots in broth for 20 min, added squash (oven roasted), 1 cup sherry, and spices and cooked covered for an additional 15 - 20 min to get the flavors well blended. Then added 1 cup coconut creamer and blended with stick blender. Added fresh thyme, parsley and rosemary. Incredible. Will definitely be making again and again."

"reviewBody": "This soup is going to be a favorite this fall and Winter! I do think the liquid ratio is off for my taste, and probably because I only used one med squash and 2 small potatoes. It's something you'll probably need to make once and then alter to suit your preference. \nI also think there is some confusion with the chicken broth amount as written. I used 49.5oz total, and I can't imagine doubling that! I think that is supposed to be the total, not 'per can' amount, but is confusing the way the recipe states it.\nInstead of roasting the squash and boiling the potatoes, I cooked the squash the day before in the crock pot (wash, toss it in whole on LOW for 4 hours) and it literally fell apart. Just had to scrape it out of the skin. Also crocked the potatoes in the am before making the soup. Otherwise followed the directions as written. Will make this again and again, and probably start adding little things like shrimp, crab, bacon... - thanks for the recipe!\nEDIT: This makes a ton, so I froze some of it, and it defrosts beautifully. Just made it for a second time :-)"

For the potatoes, I used red instead of russets. And I also did up the amounts on the spices just a bit to suit my taste. It came out delicious, and I had two bowls of it. My husband took one bite and said \"Good soup\". He's picky about butternut squash soup and I have tried several other recipes. This one's a keeper. I like the combination of flavors. I added some diced walnuts as garnish for a little crunch. This is a hearty, and very flexible recipe. I will make it again. Thank you for posting."

Unfortunately I had no sherry and I will make sure to add it next time as something was definitely missing. I also sprinkled cinnamon on the leftovers and it definitely enhanced the flavor, so add cinnamon! If you all are looking for a more flavor in your BNS soup, check out the \"Butternut Squash Soup with a Kick\" recipe on this website."

"reviewBody": "Wonderful soup. I cooked the squash with the potatoes adding them to the sauted leeks, onions and garlic. I also added two stalks of celery. I covered the mixture with 32 oz of chicken broth, as another reviewer mentioned the thinness of the final product, brought to a boil, covered and simmered for about 20 minutes. This cuts the cooking time in half (especially if you buy the peeled and cut up squash at the grocery store). I pureed with an immersion blender. I used 1/2 cup heavy cream instead of half and half. The potatoes give it the thicker texture even though I'm sure the apples provide another level of sweetness. I make a mushroom and bacon soup by Ann Burrel using a similar process. I will definitely make again!!! Maybe next time I'll add some spicy sausage!"

I tasted it before I added it and thought the flavor was better.I also did not use as much chicken broth (homemade) to avoid the runny-ness others have talked about. I used one apple and one potato. I might use two apples next time. I think this recipe could be modified to include other spices; it seems like it would be very versatile. I did add more cayenne pepper for some extra spiciness. Thanks for a great recipe."

"reviewBody": "I love getting spiced butternut at restaurants so when I decided to make some this ended up being a good base. I took some advice from previous reviews and made these changes:\r\n\r\n1/4 teaspoon cayenne\r\n1/2 teaspoon all other spices\r\nNo russet potatoes--- instead 1 yam and 1 apple\r\nSilk brand of Almond milk instead of half and half and 2 cups\r\nOnly 4 cups of chicken broth\r\n\r\nI like a lot of spice to my food so upping the spices was just a hands-down-must. Going with the yam and apple just seemed to be a favorite of people on here and I went that way. I used almond milk since I'm lactose intolerant and it is still fairly thick (Silk brand that is) and taking that to two cups smoothed it very nicely while only four cups of chicken brother helped bring down the liquid.\r\n\r\nI baked the squash, but then cut everything and put it in my slow cooker for ten hours while stirring it occasionally and using my hand blender at the final hour mark. For this size of the recipe using a 6+ quart slow cooker would be ideal.\r\n\r\nWith these variations I LOVE it!"

To make it easier for me, I just roasted the squash whole. It's so hard to cut those in half raw."

I like my soups a bit thick so I used 32oz of chx broth, which was a bit too much as it was too thin after I pureed it. Therefore I used only half of the sherry and half-and-half. I would have liked to use the full amount because I love the flavor that they fave it but I did not want to thin out the soup any more. I also put LOTS of cayenne pepper since I like it spicy, brown sugar and cinnamon as other people had suggested. Next time I will add and apple and a sweet potato, I wish I had listened to other reviews and done it this time. Either way it was super yummy! The basic recipe is great and tweaking it to your taste will just vamp it up! I cant wait to make this again."

Then I had to use a second pot to receive the blended mixture. I had to wash two large pots and the food processor. I did use milk instead of half &amp; half and apples instead of potatoes.

I think there is way too much broth + the other liquid from the sherry and half-n-half didn't help. The onion/leek/sherry overpowered the taste of the squash and the spices just seemed weird. I'm not sure if there was a typo in the amount of broth, but if I was ever to make this again (probably won't) I would halve the amount of liquid and skip the sherry. The reason I gave it 2 stars was because the rest of my family actually really liked it. My 3yo kids ate 3 bowls of it in one sitting and my 16mo kept asking for more."

Boil a chicken in just enough water to cover it (add some slices of ginger and spring onions for flavor). Let it boil for around 10 minutes, then switch off the heat, and leave the lid on for 40 minutes. The chicken will be juicy and tender, and the stock is a million times better than the stuff out of the can."
