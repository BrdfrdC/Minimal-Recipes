After having the seeds in the oven at 300 for 10 min, I stirred them and realized the recipe stated 350 degrees, so I turned the oven up. I set the timer for only 4 minutes. When I opened the oven, they were burned!"

I cooked them for about 20 mins over medium-low heat and then transfered them to a lined baking sheet and baked at 300 for 20 mins stiring once. Not sure if they were supposed to turn out any different then they did, but the whole family thought they were excellent. Even the cat liked them! My 8 year-old was beside herself when she looked down to find the cat eating her pumpkins seeds out the bowl she was holding. We will definately be making these again!"

The only thing I changed about the recipe was that I sprinkled sugar on the seeds and stirred them well, again, about 10 minutes after I pulled them from the oven to give them a sweeter taste. And my home smells better than any expensive candle could offer. I wish this recipe had \"smell-a-vision\"!! You couldn't pass it up if so!"

I chose this recipe (for the sweet) and another one that was more spicy. Truth be told, after they cooled, I mixed the 2 batches together for a co-minglng of savory and sugary. However, as this recipe stands, I enjoyed it, but really recommend going 300 deg. instead of 350, b/c some of my seeds got sticky and burnt. The smell wafting through my house while these roasted -- DEEEEEVINE!"
