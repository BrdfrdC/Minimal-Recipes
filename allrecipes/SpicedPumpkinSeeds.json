My kids love it and think it taste exactly like microwave popcorn (but I didn’t tell them it’s healthier ??) You can reduce the salt (since the worchestershire sauce has sodium) and I used coarse sea salt to add more texture. Will be saving this to make next fall"

Instead, just pull off the pumpkin threads, but leave them covered in the pumpkin 'goo'. Gives them more of a pumpkin flavor that way. I do cook them a little slower as it helps them to dry off and break down the seeds a bit better."

Results said that pumpkin seeds cook unevenly with the inside cooking faster than the shell resulting in burned insides. So ...\n\nI boiled for 10 minutes in salty water first as suggested. Mixed up the spices, butter and seeds in a bowl and spread on a cookie sheet. Stirred every 10 minutes for about 65 minutes. They were perfect. Now I'll tailor the spices/salt ratio to my taste. All in all a good recipe."

"reviewBody": "Thanks for sharing! This stuff is addicting!! As recommended by other reviews, I doubled the recipe for 2 cups pumpkin seeds. I was also looking for a spicy recipe and decided to add 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper. The flavor had a buttery smokiness to it that was delicious. T I used these on raw in-shell pumpkins seeds from Halloween pumpkins, I was disappointed at the thought of having to wait a year until next Halloween or until we dared to make pumpkin pie from real pumpkin. So I just bought raw unshelled pumpkin seeds, cashews, pecans and almonds. I am excited to try this recipe on those so I can enjoy this flavor year round. I hope it turns out well."

"reviewBody": "So easy and delicious, but I recommend decreasing the salt!! The recipe is perfect except I use garlic powder instead of garlic salt, no measured salt, and then only salt the seeds once they are on the pan, lightly. Even this way I still find it a challenge not to salt too much, so I can’t imagine making it as written. Worcestershire sauce has lots of salt already. We make these every Halloween evening as we carve our pumpkins."

"reviewBody": "This was my first time making pumpkin seeds, but thanks to the good folks at Allrecipes, things were made a lot easier. I picked all the seeds out and they turned out to be less than what the recipe called for. Plus I soaked them in salt water beforehand, and besides, other reviewers claimed they were a bit on the salty side. So I cut down on the salt, but that turned to be a mistake. However, they made a healthy snack (though chewier than I expected). They're good for snacking on or salads, but a little disappointing considering we only make them once a year when we carve our pumpkin. Next time we will use all the salt."

The smell out of the oven was driving us CRAZY! The taste was good but I think the smell is better, and that PRATE002 is right -double or triple the seasonings for sure. Great snack! Super easy."

Thanks for a great recipe! This will become a regular season pleaser for us."
