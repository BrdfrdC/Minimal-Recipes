I wanted to stay true to the original ratio of ingredients so I didn't adjust now I'm looking for other thing I can use it on before it goes bad. Worked well on tomato omelet."

"reviewBody": "Well seasoned as described. This recipe has potential but I think it needs some tweaks. I let my tzatziki sit in the refrigerate overnight but it was still somewhat bland. It was in desperate need of salt and could have used more dill as well. The falafel itself had a lot of flavor but shaping them into balls was time consuming and quite messy. I made my balls fairly big (think average meatball) and I'm glad I checked them after 30 minutes instead of waiting the full 45. They were still edible but were definitely overcooked. 45 minutes plus 5 minutes under the broiler and they would have been inedible. While this recipe may have potential, the time it took to prepare them is not worth another try for me. Sorry."
