"reviewBody": "If I could give this more than five stars, I would. You know how you have a dish in a restaurant, and even if you go back it still doesn't taste as good as it did the first time? This is that good. But you can recreate it. Highly suggest marinating overnight. And, oh yeah- price performer!! Yes, you might need to invest in a few things for the marinade, but I doubled the recipe, and we fed a hungry family of four with at least three lunches. Two pounds of beef, $9. Cooked with basmati rice and a steamed veggie, like snow peas or broccoli. Great flavor, heat and sweet. Excellent."

Marinated for about 6 hours and cooked the meat and marinade in a Wok vs on the grill (about 3 min per batch.. turning half way through). Served over white rice."

I used Gochujang instead of siracha and added more of basically every spice, as well as a couple shakes of tabasco. I marinated my beef for 16 hours and pan seared it because I don't have a barbeque, then put it over rice. it was delicious! thanks for a great recipe :)"

I didn't have sesame seeds or whole dried cayenne peppers so just skipped them. Even the picky eater ate three portions. The best part is that it is super easy to throw together - you just have to remember to marinate in advance. I made up the rice and made a bed of rice and put this over it. Really lovely - thanks for sharing."

"reviewBody": "5 star all the way! I've always loved Bulgogi and then you go and add spicy to it? Yes please! This recipe rocked. In the footnotes the recipe creator mentions reducing the spiciness by eliminating the cayenne pepper, the chile, and then some of the Sriracha if necessary. We both like heat but cayenne is not our favorite way of achieving it so here is what I did. I eliminated both the cayenne pepper and chile but then upped the Sriracha from 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup and this was perfect for us. One thing the recipe did not mention and that is that you need to slice your beef against the grain . That is very important with this cut of meat in keeping it tender. This is a great recipe and one I will make often!"
