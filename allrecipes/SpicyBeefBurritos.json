You could always make it half hot and half not depending on who is eating with you with the heat they like or not. When I placed the meat on the tortilla, I added a little cheddar cheese then rolled them up (it rolled 6). After placing them in my dish then I topped it off with Hatch Valley 505 Green Chile Sauce, I sprinkled cheese on top and in the over at 350 for 10 - 15 min. After over, I then dished one on a plate topped with lettuce, cheese, tomato, sour cream and avocado! Deeelicious!! Excellent!!"
