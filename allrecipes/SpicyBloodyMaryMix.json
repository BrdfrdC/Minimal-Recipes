The beef consume sets this apart from the pack. The only thing I changed was I used a half a tbsp of celery salt and a half tbsp of Old Bay Seasoning instead of all celery salt. I'm a huge Crystal Hot Sauce fan, so I used that instead of the Tobasco. You will not be disappointed."

Some serving suggestions: cook some medium shrimp and chill then on a long toothpick (I use cut in half bamboo skewers) add shrimp, cocktail onion and pimento olive or some other green olive (no black olives) and stick in cocktail glass then add vodka and BM mix...be prepared to be amazed."

"reviewBody": "This is the first bloody mary I actually liked! This blows away the store-made mixes which pale in comparison. This mix has just the right amount of heat to it -- not too much heat in the front on the tongue, but enough heat at the back to give it some heat and a kick. The flavor, overall, is very balanced. \n\nWe used Campbell's low-sodium tomato juice. I made this and let the mix meld in the fridge for about two hours before I mixed it with a shot and a half of vodka. I'm very impressed with this and will certainly make this again.\n\nThanks for posting the recipe!"
