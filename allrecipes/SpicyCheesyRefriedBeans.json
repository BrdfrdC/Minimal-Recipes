I substituted the cheddar cheese for a Mexican cheese mix and added it to the crockpot approximately 1 hour before serving. I thought straight cheddar cheese might have made it greasy. Anyway, it turned out great, and I would cook it again."

Once I add in the refried beans and they are heated through, then I stir in the cream cheese along with the shredded cheese until melted and remove from heat.

I now use it for my Double Tacos recipe here on the site - http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/220773/double-tacos/ Thank you so much for sharing this! ?"

Otherwise, it is too strong.The Cream Cheese is the key, but too much of a good thing is a bad thing, same with onion and garlic. Either add 2 more cans of beans, or reduce the other ingredients by 1/3.Plain beans are fine too."

I like the recipe just the way it is, but I have to admit that my husband is right, it does taste very much like cream cheese that way, and he didn't care for that as much. So, we only put half the cream cheese when we make it and everyone is happy with that."

"reviewBody": "This is a delicious refried bean recipe! Adding the cream cheese... what a great idea! This side dish will give your main dish some hefty competition for center stage. I also didn't have spicy refried beans so I added 1/8 tsp Cayenne, and I think next time I'll add even more. I also used a mixture of pepper-jack and cheddar cheese. The only thing I'd caution about the recipe is the serving sizes: the recipe says it makes 6 servings, but those would be 6 measly little servings that would only leave you sad and wanting more (each serving would be about 1/3 of a cup, which might be a true \"serving,\" but most people tend to eat more than that for beans). I made the recipe for a dinner with 6 people, and after making one batch, decided I needed to double the recipe. I'm glad I did because at the end of the night there was only a spoonful left, and everyone commented on how yummy they were and kept going back for 2nds, 3rds, and 4ths!"

My cream cheese was right out of the fridge, so I just put the flame to low and added it in, so that it would melt and combine easier. We really enjoyed these, and I will def be making them again...great way to do something different w/ refried beans! Thanks for sharing. :)"
