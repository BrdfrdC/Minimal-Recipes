"reviewBody": "This was tasty, but there are a few things that I would do differently in the future. First, if you’re browning boneless chicken breasts for 8 mins/side (total of 16 mins), you really do not have to then simmer it for one hour. That much time actually changes the texture of the chicken breast, making it a little stringy and dry. I would cut back that time DRAMATICALLY. Also, the sauce is sooooo good on its own that I will skip the half-and-half and parmesan in the future, and just serve the chicken with the rich tomato-marsala sauce. You’ll save a lot of calories and fat by eliminating that parmesan sauce (2 cups is way too much parmesan), and I think the dish would have MUCH better presentation without it. I don’t think that the parmesan sauce added much flavor, and it really didn’t develop into a smooth and creamy sauce. As I always do, I try to make a recipe as written the first time, and the only thing I did differently was add some mushrooms, they're an important and traditional ingredient for chicken marsala. This is quite a different combo of ingredients, and I will make this again, but with the modifications mentioned above. One final comment, the recipe name is a bit of a misnomer because there really isn't anything in it that makes it spicy."
