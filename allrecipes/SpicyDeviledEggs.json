The tart of the Mayo and Dijon mustard (Bookbinders Stone Ground Dijon) and the sweet of the pickles and Tiger Sauce (and the heat) made these a real hit. Same as others have written I added about twice the mayo as in the original recipe. They came out creamy, sweet, tangy and delicious. This is definitely a keeper recipe that you can adjust to make it your own."

I eliminated the black olive, added a little extra mustard, cayenne pepper, and some Garlic Tabasco and topped it off with cooked Hot Jimmy Dean Sausage. Don't get me wrong, I love olives, I am a food chemist and test olive oil to make sure its the real deal for a living (not adulterated with a lesser quality oil). But still, the 24 halved eggs didn't last 3 minutes in an office of 4.... It took a little longer to prepare, but it was worth it. Next time I will know to double the recipe as the JD sausage was the longest part. Thank you for the start!!!!!"

After 10 minutes I drained the hot water and covered with cool and then shelled them. I used a small cookie scoop to fill each egg white. For the bodies of the spiders: I halved the drained olives and then patted them dry with a paper towel. For the spider legs, I just cut slices. The red eyes are made out of Betty Crocker Cookie Icing but I DO NOT RECOMMEND doing this because within 30 minutes the icing slides right off :( :( The taste of the egg is excellent. Will make again and will continue trying to figure out a way to make eyes."

Once they are done, put in cold water for about 2 minutes, then crack each egg softly, one crack each side or each end, and let soak in cold water for an hour, when you go to peel, it practically falls off for you."

"reviewBody": "My husband loves deviled eggs and this recipe was a nice departure from my usual \"go to\" recipe. I used a little less dijon and a little more mayo. I also had some smoked paprika on hand so I used that to dust them with - I never decorate them with olives so I left them off. My grandmother sometimes used olives, but when she did she always used the green ones stuffed with pimento."

I did add a little more mayonnaise, used yellow mustard which was on hand, and added a little chopped dill pickles and worcestershire sauce, and it was great. these made my first attempt at devilled eggs a smashing success :)"

"reviewBody": "Great recipe. I stuck with Dijon, because (at least the brand I have) it doesn't have synthetic color or preservatives added. There's also a more horseradish-y taste to it, I think. I also added LOTS more Tobasco sauce, but next time I might just try a couple drops of habanero sauce instead... tasted too acidic to me."
