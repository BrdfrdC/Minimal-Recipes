Now, I’ve heard critics say that they didn’t like the amount of sugar in there, but I don’t have a problem. 5 stars, because it’s Mexican, and delicious. Plus, it’s very healthy. Definitely try it. You’ll really fall in love with it, to the point you’ll want to marry it."

So with that said I change the recipe I made taco bowels to put these in it was really good much more fulling the store was out of Colby so I used Mexican blend cheese it worked perfect. I also cooked the kidney bean with the beef adding them in about 3 min in cooking the beef and left some kidney uncooked. cooked with the beef tasted better too us. made the dressing too sweet I also had ranch dressing and salsa on hand just in case we liked those options better."

This is how we always made it, for 27 yrs now. I'm sure this recipe is great, hence my 5 star rating, but my way is just easier. Try both!"

Our recipe calls for Taco Flavored Doritos and Taco FLAVORED grated cheese (must say flavored, it is different from Taco Cheese) and bottled Creamy Italian salad dressing (the creamy whitish kind) Kroger Brand is what we use. We also use an envelope of taco seasoning and make make the taco meat according to package directions. Hint- Do not add hot meat to the salad, let it cool first. Mix the taco chips and dressing write before serving or it gets soggy. I omit the jalapeno peppers. Not everyone likes it hot.\nEvery party we go to, we are asked to make this. I know some people use Western or Catalina Dressing, but that is too sweet. The tart Creamy Italian is the key ingredient to this salad."

It was different and a method I would use again. I did only use a 1/4 cup of sugar and had 2 smalls ears of leftover corn-on-the-cob that I threw in the salad. Also added a garnish of avocado slices. The Doritos® were added right before eating so that they would remain crispy. My DS and DH both commented during dinner how good the salad tasted and it hit the spot. It was a very nice evening tonight, so we had dinner on the patio which made the meal even more enjoyable. Thanks Lora R, for sharing your recipe. It is a keeper in our house."

"reviewBody": "This is an old-fashioned taco salad - I remember eating this as a very young teen. This is good although we would prefer a bit more heat. Adding the chips at serving is definitely the way to go to avoid sogginess. The dressing is good - but way too sweet. I cut the sugar in half and it was still too sweet for our tastes. But overall it's a very good recipe for those who don't care for much heat but still enjoy the taco flavor."

I left out the jalapenos and I put the dressing on the side. Everything else I followed the recipe. Very good taco salad. I would serve this at a potluck."

The dressing was very unique. For us, it was VERY sweet. I would like to try it again but cut back on the sugar by at least half. Fun quick dinner recipe."

Made exactly as written, and thought it was perfect as is...I mixed everything but the dressing (which I made earlier in the day and let it set) and the Doritos, then just mixed those in right before serving. This is a keeper and one that I will be making often! Thanks for sharing. :)"
