I must say it turned out very well, although I did not have ancho chile powder or chile powder. I used a chipolte spiced barbecued sauce, some steak rub along with the other ingredients and was happy with it. I will try it again when I can get the other spices."

My variations on this are based on my pantry: I use 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper instead of the combination of chipotle and ancho, and I use Lawry's seasoning salt, skipping the \"to taste\" salt. This rub is amazing! I use it on sirloin steaks all the time, and they are juicy, and perfectly spicy-sweet. Thank you for the great recipe!"

Didn't have chipotle or ancho chili powder so I used about 1/4 tsp each of cayenne pepper, cumin and red pepper flakes. I cut the sugar down to 1 Tbsp and only used about 1/2 Tbsp of chili powder. We found this was perfect. I think that if you use all the chili powder called for it would be too much. The steaks were so juicy and the juice was delicious. Served with perogies and mushrooms cooked with garlic and peppers. Resturaunt quality meal. Thank you for sharing."

I had to alter the recipe a bit due to ingredients on hand, I didn't have ancho chili powder (not sure what this is) so I used cayenne pepper and some red pepper flakes and I also used a regular season salt instead of a salt free seasoning. Only complaint I had from the family is I only did this on one of the steaks for a test run. I enjoyed mine but my family was regretful I didnt \"rub\" theirs."

I modifed the recipe to include 1/2 of the sugar, due to other reviews, and also did not have all the various chili powders, so I substituted cumin, cayanne pepper, white pepper, and a spicy salf free seasoning blend. It turned out wonderful. Will definetly make this again."

I used what I had on hand (red pepper flakes and cayenne as \"other peppers\") and only used a 1/4 tsp...this was plenty spicy for me. I also added 1/4 tsp of cumin....it just seemed a natural pair with chili poweder and isn't too much on the \"heat\" like the hot peppers. This is probably one you won't make everyone happy as different folks have different likes on how hot they like things."

The brown sugar mellows out the spices, so it's not too spicy or sweet. Hubby and I are trying to alter our diet a little so I went for a rub on our lean steaks instead of a marinade with a bunch of oil. I sprayed both sides of the meat with olive oil cooking spray before putting it on the grill and served over a nice big salad. Wonderful flavor, will definitely make again soon."
