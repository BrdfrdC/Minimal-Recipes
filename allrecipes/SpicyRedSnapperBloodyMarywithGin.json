I admit.....I am a bit of a wimp when it comes to \"spicy hot!\" And, I do prefer gin over vodka..... I did tone down the hot sauce and the horseradish, but otherwise, this is THE tomato based savory drink for me!!!!! Thanks!!!!"

"reviewBody": "This was exactly the recipe I was looking for when I went searching. I make my own improvised version normally, but I can never get it to be the same twice in a row, so I decided to find out what the \"real\" amounts are to put in everything. This recipe is really close to what they make at my favorite bar, so I made it exactly as written to see if I like it. I love it. Be warned, it makes a spicy beverage! It's a bit complicated to make just one drink though, so I think I'll double or triple the batch next time so I can share it with friends. FYI: 2 tablespoons of lemon juice is about 1/2 of a lemon squeezed out. I like to put the lemon in the microwave for about 30 seconds so the juice comes out more easily."
