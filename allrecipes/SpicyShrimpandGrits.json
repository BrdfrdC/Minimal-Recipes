Used 4 cups of water and 3 T of Knorr chicken granules (no additional salt) to cook quick grits for 20 minutes (even though the package directions stated differently) stirring frequently on simmer. Had most of the ingredients on hand, but used up 1/2 bag of shredded swiss &amp; Guerye cheese + cheddar on the top. I did press excess liquid out of Rotel tomatoes and only had three green onions. Used 1# of med shrimp...no complaints. Poured into a pie plate coated with clarified butter (ghee). Baked in center of oven, turned broiler on for last few minutes to brown the top. Be careful with this step if your casserole dish is not broiler-proof. A definite do-over."

I did use a 2 lb bag of shrimp, because that's what I had, and used a mixed 2 cup bag of shredded cheddar and jack cheese for convenience. Next time I might bake it in individual ramekins, to make portioning easier, and I think it would make for a nice presentation, but that's the only thing I might change. It looked great coming out of the oven, but kinda blah on the plate. I served it with a salad, so it was a nice simple dinner. I like having the 30 minutes of bake time to make the salad. It looked so good coming out of the oven I texted a pic to my friends to torture them \"look what we're having for dinner.\""

I did not drain the tomatoes &amp; green chilies since I reduced the broth. I used 1/2 tsp Creole seasoning vs 1 tsp salt. The finished product was a little runny with the first serving, but appears to be thicker now that it has had a chance to cool. I think it will reheat nicely also."

Sure, it's a slightly time-consuming recipe, but the steps and instructions are put in extremely simple terms that even a novice cook like myself can follow. I made this for multiple people and wanted it to have a lot of shrimp, so I doubled the amount of shrimp and only increased everything else up to 1.5X more of what the original recipe called for. The only substitution I made was for the chicken broth because I prefer vegetable, but it didn't (or shouldn't) impact the taste as much due to the strong flavors in all the other ingredients. Definitely a top recipe in my books and will be making it again soon!"

It's good to note if using quick cooking grits, use 3 cups of broth to one cup of grits or if using old fashioned grits, use 4 cups of broth to one cup of grits. Quick cooking grits are already cooked done a bit and don't need as much liquid as old fashioned. Thanks for sharing William!!"

If you let the dish sit in the fridge for a day (or better, yet, two) before you eat it, then it is a four-star dish...maybe almost five stars. It was better if you lightly season the shrimp with Tony's (or other brand) seafood seasoning before cooking, too. This is now my go-to recipe for shrimp &amp; grits that I make the day before I'm going to eat it. I also left out the salt, as the broth is salty enough already."

When it came out of the oven, it did indeed seem surprisingly runny (even though I drained the Rotel tomatoes), but we found it to just be creamy when ladled into the low bowls we like to use, and as the dish sat waiting on our second helpings, it absorbed the liquid. I don't think I'll change a thing next time. We loved it."

Used a red bell pepper instead of green, used only 3 cups of low sodium chicken broth, plus drained tomatoes and used that liquid in addition to broth for grits. Cooked grits 20 minutes and in last few minutes added a splash of heavy cream to ensure rich creamy texture. Added andouille sausage as well as creole seasoned shrimp. Used pepper jack cheese and sharp cheddar but did not add cheese on top. Baked for 30 minutes. Let it rest for 10 minutes and then served with a fruit salad and crusty hot bread. Sprinkled with chives when serving. First bite and everyone said, this is on the make again and again list!!!"

After a recent trip to the South where I ate grits for the first time (at a Waffle House, of course!), I was inspired to make this. My two kids devoured this dish - practically licked the bowl clean! And my son usually doesn't like casseroles or things mixed together! I followed the recipe completely except that I didn't have the canned tomatoes so I used medium salsa, which I scooped out using a fork so that I didn't get too much liquid. Thanks, William! I'll be making this again!"

It wasn't as visually appealing as the composed version, but was FAR better than I expected and I'll definitely make it again! Using what I had on hand, I slivered half a yellow onion and subbed it for the scallions, and added two fresh diced jalapenos. I drained the RoTel into a glass measuring cup and then added the broth...I actually used leftover seafood stock and the flavor was fantastic. I was afraid that baking for 40 minutes would make the shrimp rubbery but it didn't. The end result was creamy (not soupy) and I served it in shallow pasta bowls, topped with fresh chopped flat leaf parsley. Delicious comfort food that's not too heavy -- a perfect weeknight meal!"

I'm not quite sure why, but I thought it made a bit more of a flavor statement the first time. I might have used onion rather than scallions, probably more cheddar and less Monterrey jack, and certainly white, rather than black, pepper. That being said, the dish is easy, fast (the quick grits cooked in 5 minutes), delicious and attractive. Tricolor peppers add a nice bit of color. Also, rather than draining the tomatoes and peppers as one reviewer suggested, I drained the shrimp and vegetable mix, instead of pouring that liquid into the grits. The consistency was great."
