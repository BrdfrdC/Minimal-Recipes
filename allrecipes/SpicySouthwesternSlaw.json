I admit that it is very spicy, especially if you make this a day in advance. Adjust the recipe if you don't like spicy. My favorite ways to eat this are as a taco topping or as a side with pulled pork. I don't like canola oil; instead, I use olive oil. I love that this is not a mayo-based slaw."

"reviewBody": "This slaw tastes good and is refreshingly different. I added an extra 1.5 tablespoons of the cider vinegar to make it a little more zesty (for our tastes). I also used red cabbage sliced into long very thin shreds and green onions in place of the regular onion. Giving the slaw ample time to sit allows the cabbage time to macerate, so this is important step in my opinion. The finished product had great flavor and interesting textures. The variety of colors made it visibly appealing as well."

I used a medium sized red onion and only used 3/4 of it because I had a feeling it would be too much.I should have used even less. I also cut the cayenne in half, but it was still very spicy. Any way I look at it, it didn't knock my socks off. I'm going to try it in fish tacos tonight, maybe I'll like it better that way than as a side dish for pulled pork. I will say that it is a beautiful looking dish. Very colorful."

Also reduced the onion, pepper &amp; oil. Instead of going through the hassle of shredding cabbage we just bought a bag of coleslaw &amp; that worked well. We put over pulled pork &amp; was very tasty. Usually use creamy coleslaw for things like that, but this was a nice change. Will make again with our reduction changes."

We will cut it back to about 3/4 tsp next time and may also try adding some cumin as another reviewer suggested. Overall though, thought this was a great twist on coleslaw. I have several recipes that this will work well with. We have to be careful of fat and sugar so I did make a couple of changes in the dressing. Used 3 tbsp cider vinegar, 2 tbsp canola oil, 1 tbsp lemon juice, and 1 tbsp water. Instead of sugar, I added the low calorie sweetner equivalent of 2 tbsp sugar. Really helps reduce calories and tastes great with that combination. I'm planning to serve this on my son's birthday. Think it will be a big hit!"

A nice change from the usual creamy coleslaw and it went really well with the pulled pork. Thanks DEBNJAMES for sharing your version of coleslaw."

"reviewBody": "Spicy hot, but oh so cool! This is a very good side dish to BBQ, Mexican food, or any grilled meat, such as pork, chicken or fish. This is even good scooped up by a tortilla chip. I like that this slaw has no mayonnaise - the oil really seals in the flavors. I embellished the recipe by reducing the vinegar to 1 TBS and adding the juice of 1 lime. I also added more cilantro (but that's to my taste) and 2 TBS of minced radish. I halted the amount of cayenne pepper and added 1 TSP of cumin powder. As a note, the color of this slaw is beautiful, and if you use a combination of green and purple cabbage, it's even more so."

Keeping it under constant refrigeration isn't an absolute, so would be great at picnics/cookouts."

Couple hints .. unless you truly are a fire breathing machine, there is not near enough slaw for the amount of heat in this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly using 3 cups of a bagged slaw mix ... and ended up using 2 pounds of bagged slaw to make the heat more palatable. This would be awesome on top of hamburgers or hotdogs."

I used a firm unripened mango (actually, half ripe which is firm, but still has a touch of sweetness) - this got RAVE reviews at the party and EVERYONE wanted the recipe.

This looked worth trying....and SO glad we did. Other than adding habanero to the recipe, we followed it to a T. And it was delicious. My anti-slaw man has been converted and even made regretful noises when the leftovers had to go. Great recipe."

I used a bag of pre-shredded coleslaw mix and instead of measuring out 3 cups, I just used the entire thing. As a result, the dressing was a little muted, and even though the cayenne still made your lips tingle, the result was a little bland. Still, I'm giving the recipe four stars because I have high hopes for it; the dressing (before adding) was simple but terrific, and it's so nice to have a fresh Tex-mex-ish side dish that I know I'll try this again!"

"reviewBody": "Neither my fiance or I cared for this. For me, this was so-so (I didn't hate it as much as he did...). Perhaps if this sat in the fridge for longer than an hour, it would be better??? I too was afraid that a t of cayenne and an entire jalapeno would be too much, but oddly enough, it wasn't at all. I could definitely detect a spicy bite, but it was never overpowering. Sometimes I tasted a very subtle sweetness and sometimes just a spicy punch (which was odd). The flavors never seemed to mingle together as they should have. I think this would be much better as a garnish for fish or shrimp tacos. The crunchiness of the slaw would complement the tender fish nicely. Add a chipotle mayo or Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce (also on this site), and you'd have one darn good taco. NOTE: To make this extra pretty (and to speed prep), I used a combo of shredded slaw mix (i.e. green cabbage &amp; carrots) and purple shredded cabbage, both found in my grocer's produce section. I also want to mention one tidbit about jalapenos. The heat is contained in the membrane and seeds. As long as you remove both, you won't get any spice from it (just a nice crunch). Although I'm not jumping out of my seat to make this again, I would consider it as suggested above (I'm considering Chipotle Shrimp Tacos!). I think my fiance might like it this way also. Thanks for sharing! :)"

It didn't taste *too* spicy, but maybe it was since my mouth is all tingly-burny now!!! I eyeballed the cayenne and probably came up a bit short. I ate two (ground turkey) tacos tonight, one with this on the side, and one with this as a topping. I preferred this as a side dish, but i think it would make a great topping for a more delicate meat, like shrimp or fish tacos, and some avacado to mellow it out. I'm going to try that with the leftovers. One more thing...probably a little less oil next time. Vinegar was right, though. **ETA: I made a single shrimp taco for lunch with the leftovers (sauteed 5 med. shrimp in butter with cumin and chili powder, piled in taco shell, topped with chopped avocado and a generous helping of this slaw)--DELICIOUS! I prefer this slaw used this way."

I think next time I'll use mild green chiles in place of the jalapeno and cumin for the cayenne to try to keep that delicious flavor but lose some of the heat.Excellent recipe as is if you tolerate super spicy foods well and I will make it again with those changes.Thanks for sharing."
