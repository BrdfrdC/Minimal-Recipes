Probably would have turned out even better with Thai chilies."

On the second attempt, I added more soy sauce than required and didn't hold back on the peppers. I realized the first attempt the juices from the chicken took over when adding the sauce but on the second attempt, I simplify raised the heat to high. Everything came out great. My wife said it was spicy but not overbearing. This definitely beats $23 takeout."

"reviewBody": "First off this is a fantastic recipe as written. Rave reviews!! But I did see another review which warned people that it’s difficult to achieve the same level of heat that this recipe requires from a traditional residential grade stove and I agree. I’m a real amateur but I’ve tried this several times and I think I found a way to get around this issue. 1. Drain excess water from the chicken after its cooked through, before adding the aromatics. 2. Triple the sauce - you will need extra to get the best caramelized glaze on the chicken and it’s so delicious you will want more for your rice or noodles! 3. Take the glazing slow. Add just as much as you need to deglaze the pan then once it evaporates, repeat until it’s gone. 4. You may want to incorporate a little corn starch slurry into the sauce at the very end for extra thickness but if you drain the liquid at the beginning it’s probably not necessary. This dish has gotten the highest of praise from my boyfriend and he requests it frequently! You really can’t go wrong as written but I added red bell pepper with the aromatics and used 5 thai chilis (perfect medium heat - could have done one or two more for a legitimately hot Thai dish). I have previously used 4 Serrano chilis instead and that upped the spiciness considerably. This is sooooo good!!!"

I followed the recipe pretty much but used a large jalapeno (seeded) which I grow. I tasted the sauce before dumping in and decided to add a splash of rice wine vinegar. Made jasmine rice at the same time as the recipe, so everything was ready in about 20 minutes. We have lots of late summer basil growing, and I might have had a bit more than one cup. I chopped 1/2 cup of low-sodium peanuts and added them to the top. All in all, really really nice. The chicken without the rice could be used in lettuce wraps. Just double the sauce, so there is plenty for dipping."

Great recipe and instructions, only thing I'd say is add more sugar, soy sauce or maybe sweet chili thai sauce as mine was super hot with Serrano/Jalapeno's. I'd back off on the fish sauce to avoid it from being too salty. Thanks, great recipe I'll add to my repertoire."

I really followed this recipe closely so a little disappointed it wasn’t better tasting."

"reviewBody": "This is a great dish but, of course, it's not truly authentic without Thai holy basil. I found a local Asian store that sells frozen cooked Chinese duck, and I've been making this dish with this, instead of chicken, for a few years now. It's still not authentic, of course, but what I've found is that the star anise/five spice flavours from the duck provide a similar aniseed-like flavour to that of holy basil. It works REALLY well. So now, when I cook this dish with chicken, I add just a pinch of five spice to the sauce mix. I just adds a whole different dimension to the taste without being too obvious. I also add blanched round beans, just 'cause I like a few greens in my dish, and I always have to have the fried egg on top... it just has to be there! LOL"

I've just discovered fresh rice noodles (in the refrigerator section of the international grocery) and it absorbs the yummy sauce really well. I also get the thai basil at the int'l grocery. yum yum!"

"reviewBody": "Made exactly as written with a mix of Thai basil and Genovese basil from my garden and it was SUPERB. It is rare, in my experience, to be able to recreate the depth of flavor found in popular Asian dishes without all the time and tools. This recipe is the exception. We used one serrano with seeds, half a deseeded jalapeno, and a diced red bell pepper and were satisfied with the heat. I may add the whole jalapeno next time. TIPS: 1. Be sure to cook the mixture, stirring OFTEN and vigorously until the water is cooked out before adding your sauce. 2. Use a high-walled, heat conductive pot such as a wok or dutch oven so that you can crank the heat and stir aggressively to replicate the wok flavor and technique. 3. Take the time to chop the chicken. It's really worth it."

This was my first time using oyster and fish sauce so I used another reviewers suggestion of using half the amounts. Tasted delicious. Chopped my chicken meat smaller than bite size, liked the texture and it really took on the sauce flavor. Growing fresh herbs this winter so we used our Thai basil and it added a really nice flavor.

I used a grinder and ground the chicken up. Hit that in a wok with the oil until the raw color went away. Added more oil and cooked the shallots, garlic and chilies until fragrant. I doubled The recipe so I added about a quarter cup of the sauce. Let that evaporate and caramelize. Then added the rest of the sauce and cook that for a minute. Add the chicken back in and let it simmer until there wasn’t really any liquid. A couple more tablespoons of soy sauce, and a little bit of salt. Then fold in the basil. You absolutely have to add a fried egg on top though."

But excellent flavor! I usually triple the sauce just because I like it a little saucier. I also find that I have to cook the chicken liquid down before I add the sauce ingredients. So I tend to cook mine a little bit longer to cook off all that liquid before creating the sauce. If need be you can pull the chicken out of the pan and cook down the liquid n the pan before creating your sauce. That way you don’t over cook your chicken. I’ve also tried it with chicken breast but it is definitely better with thighs."

I tried putting the chicken thighs in the freezer as suggested, but the chicken never got hard enough to make cutting/grounding it very easy. Instead of ground chicken, i cut it into about 1/2 inch pieces which was great - got good seared edges and a nice texture. Also, the chicken skin was really tough to cut through, so I removed it completely from the thighs, used scissors to cut it up into smaller pieces and cooked it in the oil first before adding the chicken which added a lot of flavor. Also, we added quartered Japanese eggplant after the chicken was cooked but before adding the peppers, garlic and shallots. It was insanely good!"

Pad is the Thai word for noodles so you can’t call it pad if you are serving it on rice instead of noodles. Kow is the Thai word for rice so you should replace the word pad with kow in order to correctly translate the name of this dish from Thai. I prefer to use sugar in the raw because it is the closest thing we can easily purchase to the original Thai cane sugar."
