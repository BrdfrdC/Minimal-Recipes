"reviewBody": "As this was my first time making sushi, I was quite impressed with myself. However, as a sushi connoisseur I thought this was just okay. Maybe it was the tuna from a can or maybe it's because I thought it was a tad too dry. I feel like you needed more mayo and spiciness to mix in with the tuna. I bought a little container of spicy sauce from Wegman's in the pre-made sushi section. I was 99 cents if I remember correctly. I put a little dollop of this on each piece and it SO improved the taste."

"reviewBody": "I had really high hopes for this recipe since my husband and I are big sushi fans, especially any spicy rolls. However, this did not taste like restaurant spicy tuna. Instead, I tasted each part (chili powder, tuna, wasabi) instead of the sum of the parts: Spicy tuna. The tuna was dry, as noted by other reviewers and somewhat fishy. To the rice, I added a bit of salt and sugar and it was great... but not good enough to fix the tuna. Sorry."

I actually think this one tasted better the next day. The tuna seemed a lttle dry, maybe more mayo? I used the pouched white tuna as recommended by a couple of reviews."

"reviewBody": "We eat sushi at home pretty regularly. The 2yo and the 6yo love to help layer veggies on the rolls. We usually just do vegetarian sushi but I had the rare can of tuna in the house and decided to try it. The flavor is good. The texture of canned tuna was less than desirable. I think if you used a chunkier, higher quality pouched tuna, it would be MUCH better."
