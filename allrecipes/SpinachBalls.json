A little too salty for my taste, but that varies from person to person (my friends all loved them).\n\nI found that if you don't bake them long enough they fall apart really easily and if you bake them enough so they don't fall apart the outside is a little too crunchy. \n\nI found putting the mix in the fridge or freezer helped a lot before rolling them into balls. When I didn't do that I had a hard time getting them to form and not mush out of my hands. \n\nChanges I want to make in the future:\n\n-a little less garlic powder/salt\n-freeze before rolling balls\n-more spinach"

If time allows, make the mixture in advance. It gives the ingredients time to soak and soften, and makes it easier to shape into balls and stay together during baking. I used a combination of parmesan mozzarella cheese and added some diced onion. I used 2 tsp. of garlic powder for a triple recipe since I was adding the onion. They were really buttery, so I may decrease the butter next time by a stick."

I think the breadcrumbs compact too much, and when I use stuffing mix, I actually use the 1 cup of water and make the stuffing. My spinach balls are tender and soft, and absolutely delicious. I also tweak the recipe, and add different cheeses etc. I DO NOT add any butter or oil, and they are fine. I use a one inch ice cream scoop and it works perfectly for the 20 minutes at 350, and use silicone aluminum foil, so they do not stick. I also have made broccoli balls, and they are great too. Am now thinking about cauliflower balls, lord help me."

I will definitely have to tweak this recipe till I come up with something much more tasty and moist. I've made these in the past and decided to try a different recipe this time. Sorry that I did."

(Just because) Just drained and chopped them. Also sautÃ©ed onions and garlic in the butter. And used bread crumbs instead of the stuffing mix, so I upped the Italian seasoning a bit. Served with Marinara sauce and there were none left!"

I forgot to add the garlic powder &amp; I can see where it would add the kick they were missing. I used the stove top stuffing for chicken bread crumbs so there was a good seasoned taste to the balls. We used the leftovers in spaghetti with a tomato sauce 3 days later. They absorbed a lot of the moisture from the sauce &amp; were better then they were the first time around. I will make these again &amp; get all the ingredients in!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe needs a lot of work. As is, it is very bland. I decreased the amount of bread crumbs by a cup and added a ton and it came out very dry and bland. I had only baked 10 to test so with the remaining spinach mixture, I added garlic sauteed in oil, a little vegetable bullion cube and more garlic powder. It still came out bland and dry! I won't be making this again but I suggest sauteeing the spinach and adding all the flavoring and THEN adding it to the bread crumbs. Frozen whole cut spinach works better than chopped and consider covering the spinach balls with foil towards the end of baking to keep in some of the moisture."

I didn't have stuffing, so I used italian style bread crumbs. I added garlic and white onion cooked in EVOO, then added the spinach in and added just 2 tbsp of butter at the end, then added to the dry ingredients, plus a little cayenne. I used shredded parmesan (didn't have any grated) and the result was sooo yummy. Even my super picky 5 year old, and my non-spinach loving hubby liked them! Thanks for the delicious recipe!"

I don't buy stuffing mix so I started with a few slices of whole wheat bread, then added a tsp of poultry seasoning, threw in a small onion, used fresh garlic, and omitted the butter altogether. Made 4 large patties out of this, and topped it with a little mayo and spicy mustard on a whole wheat bagel."

"reviewBody": "I just love these. I basically made them the same except I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and didnt add the Italian seasoning. I kept them after cooking in the fridge. I am a vegetarian and I found the consistency of these remarkably like meatballs I had while growing up. So I tried a batch using basil, oregano, and marjoram. I cooked up some pasta about a day later (because the consistency of meatballs comes after a day or so in the refrigerator) and used these as meatballs. I no longer miss meatballs with my pasta. They were fantastic. So from now on along with the forty I make that are a little over an inch in diameter, I will make some larger ones, maybe twenty or thirty, for meatballs. Thank you for this recipe that I will be sharing with friends. I know even my non vegetarian friends and relatives will enjoy them."

"reviewBody": "I made these last night, but I had to adjust the recipe quiet a bit. First I scaled the recipe to make about 30 spinach balls. I used three 10 oz packages of spinach. About 2 cups of Italian bread crumbs instead of the 5 cups it said. I also adjusted the butter and eggs. Otherwise it would have been too mushy. Even with less butter it still was a bit too much. The way I made them they turned out perfect. The prep and cooking time was longer though. I put the spinach in the toaster oven to dry it out easier and I ended up baking these for about 30 minutes instead of 20. This recipe is a good guide though."
