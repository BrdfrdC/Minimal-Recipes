"reviewBody": "I love this recipe! I think I've made it a little differently almost every time because the other reviews had so many great suggestions. I like to halve the amount of butter and saute the onions until well cooked. Add the spinach to the pan and continue to saute until wilted, then add minced garlic and cook just until fragrant. I use seasoning salt instead of plain salt and add a pinch of paprika. I've tried it with italian seasoning and also with a pinch of red pepper flakes alternatively. They're both good depending on your mood. I've only ever used mozzerella but may try others in the future ... mixed italian cheeses or white cheddar sound good. I see this being a part of my regular rotation all the time!"

"reviewBody": "I made this last night. I used a dish that was not as big as stated in the recipe, when I put the mixture in the dish, it was a good 1” thick, but after baking, it was quite flat. I would not call this an appetizer but rather a side dish. I used 10 ounce of frozen chopped spinach that I just squeeze the water out of rather than using fresh spinach which saves a step as you don’t have to cook it. Next time, I will use an even smaller dish, probably a 9” square which should keep it from being so flat! I would also leave out the salt because it did taste somewhat salty and the mozzarella cheese has salt in it so the other salt is unnecessary, in my opinion. I’m still debating as to whether I will make it again."

Made mine by cooking bacon in the oven, once that was done, removed the bacon from the pan, threw 2 boxes of chopped spinach into the bacon grease and backed in the oven for about 7 or so mins. Drained the fat from it, mixed it with sautéed garlic and onion, mozzarella &amp; bacon, threw some parmesan cheese on top and cooked it. Probably the best healthy (sugar wise) snack around."

"reviewBody": "I stumbled upon this recipe at least 10 yrs ago, it has become a favorite among everyone who has ever tried them and so now I feel quite obliged to write a review.\nI love how easy this recipe is to change to fit anyone's liking. I have made this recipe exactly as written, as well as changed up almost the whole dish itself. I love adding bacon and using the grease in place of the butter. I have added fresh herbs to this like parsley, oregano and basil. I have also used half and half spinach/kale as well as entirely replaced the spinach with kale. (I am not a fan of kale but it is soooo delicious in this recipe) Every single time I have used this recipe it ALWAYS comes out absolutely DE-LISH. I have even made this for children ranging all different ages as young as 9mos and older and ALL of them love it too, they ask me to make it all the time. Not to mention it is SOOOO EASY to make, almost effortless. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe it has become our families favorite!!"

I used a 9x9 dish not a 9x13 and it worked perfectly. I didn't have any problems that others had. My husband &amp; son didn't care for it but they are both miserable picky eaters who hate all veggies so they're opinion doesn't count!"

I might try to use half the butter next time.\n\nI used garlic powder because I had no cloves, and I forgot to add the powder to the mixture so I had to sprinkle it on the top after it had already been baking a few minutes, and it was still great. I used the convection oven and a metal pan, and it made the bottom of the bars nice and brown."

Cooked the onion in 2 TBS butter (no extra butter), added spinach, salt &amp;pepper and garlic powder, whisked the eggs with the milk, I used bag of shredded Mexican mix cheese (it was what I had in house) I think I will try Feta next time. Mixed all together. Came out great, nice spinachy texture and taste."

It was good as is, a little too oily and I didn't care for the slightly cooked onion.\n\n2nd time I cut the butter to 1/4 c (2 Tbsp to cook onions, 2 Tbsp for flour mixture). Absolutely delicious with these two simple changes and doesn't stray too much from the original recipe."

Dill Weed. It was reminiscent of the flavors of Spanikopita, but much less work. Make sure you really squeeze out the liquid from the spinach after cooking it. I also followed another reviewers recommendation of sauteing the onions first. I thought is was equally delicious cold the next day."

They were easy to make, but it did take me longer to prep than the directions state, probably because I used fresh spinach and had to chop it first. I had a few leftovers; they kept well in the fridge and were great heated up just a bit in the microwave. Highly recommend this recipe!"
