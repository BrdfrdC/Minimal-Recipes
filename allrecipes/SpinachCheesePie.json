It tastes like the filling of a pasta, very rich to eat on its own, but tasty. You need to really like cheese to enjoy it, which my daughter does. I won’t eat a lot because that much cheese it rough on my diet, but if that isn’t your concern, enjoy!"

Also, some onion or garlic would give it more than just a cheese flavor. I like the idea of prebaking the shell a bit. My crust was a little \"doughy\". So, great taste, some tweaking and I would give this a 5. Also a good recipe for someone who has problems chewing. I had 5 teeth removed but could still handle gumming and chewing this recipe."

"reviewBody": "After reading other member reviews and making some tweaks, this recipe is a keeper. I used Marie Callender pie shells and divided the mix btwn the 2. First I prebaked the parchment lined shells weighted down with ceramic pie shell balls for 5 minutes at 425 degrees, then removed the parchment and baked 5 min more before adjusting temperature to original recipe. I added 4 beaten eggs to the spinach mix, 6 or so chopped raw mushrooms and 2 sliced scallions. I decreased the cheese by about 1/3. The nutmeg is critical in my opinion, gives this dish a flavor much different than a spanakopita recipe I make."

"reviewBody": "OK, the recipe itself is good but I fiddled with it and came up with a delicious quiche-like pie. Here's what to do. I beat three eggs, omitted the second pie shell and the nutmeg (too spicy-sweet and a strange contrast with the spinach and cheese), cut the cheeses by about 1/3, added sauteed onions and sauteed mushrooms in low-cal butter, and it rocked! (Mix sauteed veggies with beaten eggs.) I suppose making it into a quiche defeats the purpose of calling it a pie, but really, you will save on calories and stress, and the mushrooms and onions give it such flavor. Oh yes and I used part-skim mozzarella with the parmesan and ricotta, both of which I cut, which I said already. The mozzarella melds with the spinach and mushroom flavors and of course gives that lovely long cheesy-string effect while eating. Add salt to taste because the onions do give extra flavor as does the cheese. Anyway, with the adjustments it was yummy, but I can't give it 5 stars since I made so many adjustments. A good starting place from which to experiment."

If you decide to make this - and I stress if - halve the cheese mixture and double the spinach. I think it would still be too much."

"reviewBody": "This sounded great, but it ended up tasteless and bland, and I'm not sure what I'd do to jazz it up and improve the flavor. The amount of cheese, plus the double crust, made both my husband and me feel like we should go out and plow a field or something after supper. It wasn't difficult to make, just not worth it. The leftovers were even more boring than the first night."

I served it with long grain and wild rice and it was so good to my husband that he had three pieces! \"You don't want this to go to waste,\" he said. Thanks for this recipe that helps make vegetarian eating fun!"
