Then I added 2 chopped jalapenos and 1/2 chopped red bell pepper. I added 2 teaspoons of salt to my vegetable mixture and added a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper and 2 teaspoons of chili powder. Because I added vegetables to the spinach and the entire tub of ricotta we ended up with 16 enchiladas. I will make these again, I may take them to Thanksgiving dinner as a side dish."

"reviewBody": "I made a few changes, but I would love it as is, I'm sure. Because I'm gluten-free and also because of what I had in the garden that I wanted to use, I subbed several ingredients: used chard for the spinach, lots of chives plus a sliver of onion for the green onions. Also added a jalapeno to the onion/garlic mix. Didn't have Jack cheese, but Chihuahua shreds worked beautifully.\nEnchilada sauce has flour in it, so I made my own version of it with gluten-free flour. Started with a little GF flour in oil/butter, added tomato paste, water, salsa (from a jar), garlic powder, cumin, oregano, salt and lemon juice. \nI had a cooked, partial chicken breast to use, so I shredded it and added it to the filling, expanding the volume slightly and making 12 enchiladas (they still fit in the pan with 2 lengthwise along one edge). \nSuperb! Seems fool-proof and super-flexible. The ricotta is key. We both loved it."

"reviewBody": "Growing up in San Diego, CA, I have had access to amazing Mexican food...authentic as well as Americanized. This recipe sounded good, but I wasn't sure what to expect. Some reviewers hated it, many loved it, and some were indifferent. I ended up really enjoying it, but depending upon how others made them, I can understand why they may not have been as fond.\n\nFirst, there is a lot of spinach in each enchilada. Depending upon your relationship with spinach, I would recommend adjusting amount to suit your preferences. Also, frozen and fresh spinach taste much different, try both to see which you like better (cook down fresh spinach first as it contains a lot of water). And if you just don't like it, you can easily sub in other veggies...roasted poblano/pasilla peppers would definitely go well with the ricotta and could add a bit of spiciness.\n\nSecond, green vs. red enchilada sauce makes a world of difference. I've never been very fond of red, canned enchilada sauce...it just lacks in flavor imo. Homemade sauce in any variety is almost always better, but not everyone has the time to make their own enchilada sauce. We did make these both ways and while the red ones weren't bad, using green sauce (canned) really gave them so much more flavor.\n\nThird, if you have had ricotta before, you know it is a very soft, creamy, mild cheese with a hint of sweetness. It is not going to lend a lot of flavor to the dish. That didn't bother me because it paired well with the green enchi"

We loved how cheesy and creamy these enchiladas were the first time I made them, but they were on the bland side. I add corn, red bell pepper, Mexican oregano, cumin and some medium chili powder to give them a kick. Now this is one of my go-to recipes!"

I didn't have any enchilada sauce, but a friend gave me some homemade salsa verde that I added on top. The filling is super delicious and was totally adaptable into a baked roll up even without the sauce!"

The only change I made was beating an egg into the cheese mixture, like when I am making ricotta filling for cannelloni, lasagna, pizza topping, etc. They turned out beautiful and held their round shape! Husband is a meat eater but really liked these too, very rich, tasty, and filling."

I also used low fat cottage cheese instead of ricotta and low fat sour cream to lower the caloric impact a bit. Final adjustment was we used red enchilada sauce because we couldn't find green. Overall very yummy!"

And if you don't want the corn tortillas to crack you really need to heat them with oil. When I make casserole enchiladas you can use the corn tortillas right out of the bag, but with rolled you really need to fry them in oil first."

An entire can of chilies is likely too much for most people, but as I said, I love spice. Instead of warming the tortillas separately, I layered them as if this were a lasagna. Much easier. I will likely make this again."

Added sautéed crimini mushrooms, two cans of diced green chili’s, red onions; the rec’d onion powder, chili/cumin powder and two tablesooons of roasted garlic paste. Mixed Mont. Jack and super sharp white cheddar. \nYielded one pan of 10 enchiladas, then vacuum froze another eight. \nDelicious for two meals to start. Of course, lotsa sour cream on! Black Goya beans baked mixed with fresh organic salsa on side. Winner fer sure! This Cal-Tex couple is very happy!"

I forgot the green onions, used 4 garlic cubes (instead of fresh since the cubes mix better) and added garlic powder and sea salt to taste. I used fresh and frozen spinach, a 16 oz. bag of frozen spinach plus about 1/2 to 3/4 of a bag of fresh spinach that I rough chopped. We like white flour tortillas instead of corn so that's what I went with. We will definitely be making this again, everyone agreed that they were the best enchiladas I've ever made. Yummy yum yummy"

The Green Enchilada Sauce was perfect for us. Not to much heat. Will make this recipe again."
