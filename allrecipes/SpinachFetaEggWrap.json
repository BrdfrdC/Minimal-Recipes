We have it on our food calendar to make again.\n\nThree slight modifications: \n(1) I think I misread the ingredients and used a whole 6 oz jar of oil packed sun-dried tomatoes rather than 1/2 half tomato (2) Added 1/2 avocado sliced on top of the diced toms.\n(3) Made two tortillas and had left over scramble."

I made two big batches of the insides and just heated the tortillas at the last minute, stuffed them and put all ten wraps/burritos in a 9x13 glass pan to keep warm. I transported them to the party and it worked out well! My recommendation is to add a LOT more sun dried tomatoes, as that's the best part of this recipe!"
