I'm thinking if I maybe changed the type of nut it'd be better for me at least. I will definitely do the spinach feta part again though."

Will maybe use less feta/try sunflower (as others suggested) or pumpkin seeds instead of pine nuts on our next 'pasta making' adventure! Oh, and our pasta ravioli roller made making these a piece of cake!"

I used the freshest of ingredients with home made pasta. I make pasta almost every other day. Not sure what went wrong but the fresh filling blended was wonderful. I was so excited. But once boiled, it was gross. tasted like expired spinach and the feta was lost. Sorry. wanted to love this. would use the fresh filling as a dip any day. But not ravioli material for my family"

I also added a little bit of nutmeg. I used a stick blender since I didn't have a food processor to mix it together and it came together fine with 1-2 tbps of olive oil. For a sauce I roasted some garlic and blended it with melted ghee to drizzle on top. Definitely will make again."

As I was mixing the ingredients as listed I tasted it, and as others, found it rather bland. I caramelized onions and added 4 cloves garlic and white pepper. Tasted...not so great...still! Cap full of Marsala wine and then parmesan to thicken out the liquid. A little nutmeg and it finally tasted good."

I love all the ingredients and was so excited to try this recipe. I followed it exactly and ended up forcing five raviolis into my mouth before throwing it in tupperware and making a microwave meal. Now, if you took the filling, added garlic and black pepper, and then tossed some spiral noodles in it, that might have been edible."

I used wonton wrappers instead of making my own ravioli and that worked out nicely. I would suggest adding only a little bit of the filling as a little goes a long way. They were easy to cook. I had to add an egg to the mixer because with all of the dry ingredients I couldn't get it to mix and that worked nicely. I also added some garlic to the mix because I always do! Great recipe and it makes a TON."

Our store was out of pine nuts so I just used sunflower seeds instead and it tasted great; the nuts gave it more of a 'meaty' texture and the spinach and feta made it so rich. My husband LOVED it. I used the Egg Noodles recipe from this site to make the raviolis - it was really easy and wonderful. If you do that though, you only need half of the filling. Next time I'll half it. Thank you so much! I will definitely make these again."
