"reviewBody": "I used the basis of the recipe but substituted from my gardenâ€¦.fresh Swiss chard instead of spinach, substituted less expensive cottage cheese instead of cheeses which are not in my budget, used spinach lasagna noodles which I had in pantry and I needed to par cook and added 1lb of chorizo just because I had it in the freezer and I wanted a meat lasagna. Method: removed 1lb (454 grams) chorizo from casing â€¦ mince up and fry in a pan with a bit of canola oil, when slightly browned added a 15oz tin of crushed tomatoes (use MUTTI brand tomatoes if available) and add a tablespoon of white sugar to the mix. Bring mixture to a boil.. lasagna noodles boiled to par.. 3 per layerâ€¦ 3 layersâ€¦ mix in a separate bowl 2 cups of cottage cheese, spices, egg mixtureâ€¦in separate pan sautÃ© chopped whole onion, with 3 cloves garlic, 6 large mushrooms chopped, in some oilâ€¦when onions nice and translucent added chopped Swiss chard about 4 - 5 cups until chard is nicely wilted. When this mixture is cool mix together with cheese and egg mix. Layer 1/3 meat sauce on bottom, 3 noodles, 1/3 cheese egg chard mixture, 1/3 mozzarella cheese and parm, layer meat sauce, 3 noodles, rest of cottage cheese mixture, remaining 3 noodles, meat sauce, and rest of mozza and parm cheeses.. bake 45 minutes, remove foil bake until cheese is golden. ðŸ˜‹ Serve with homemade garlic toast. Thank you to all the chefs for their inspiration and contributions to this recipe."

I sauted first the onions for a minute, then added the garlic and mushrooms and sauted all of that for another minute or so, then added fresh spinach leaves on top and covered it all with the lid until the spinach steamed and softened (about 5 minutes). I also used twice as much spinach as called for (20 oz instead of 10.)"

It couldâ€™ve used much more sauce but thatâ€™s my personal opinion. The flavor couldâ€™ve been more vibrant if I used fresh herbs instead of dried. All in all, really delicious!"

"reviewBody": "Delicious, but tweaks are needed to get it to look like the photo. For that much spinach, one would need ~4 cups of fresh spinach or two bushels (maybe less if you are using the kind in a tub since those leaves tend to be flatter). We only baked 50 minutes and found the lasagna a bit dry. Next time, I'll add another 1/2 cup of pasta sauce. I also used 1.5-1.75 cups of sliced, fresh crimini mushrooms and would do that again. One could probably go up to a whole onion depending on how smooth or chunky you like your filling. Lastly, we didn't have any parmesean, but we had cotija on hand, and it worked out great. We dialed back on the salt a little since some brands of cotija (Cacique in particular) can be very salty. Definitely making this again!"

"reviewBody": "Hey, it's me again. Guess what? Even though I botched it, it still WORKED!\n\nNow understand, my husband is an apex carnivore. He PRIDES himself on his \"guys' \" lasagna. (No ricotta, etc) Each pan of his weighs +12 pounds using sausage and 7 kinds of cheese. He always says \"if I want ricotta, I'll get a cannoli.\"\n\nAs I was making this, he kept saying \"please stop calling that lasagna.\" And \"you're SOAKING your noodles?\" etc. As it was cooling, he tried to cover it w/tinfoil and asked \"who is this going to?\" (He was going to immediately give it AWAY!) Sheesh!\n\nSo, when it was done cooling, I asked \"Would you like to try it?\" and with a lot of drama/eye-rolling, he cut himself a piece/ate while I was cleaning up. He sheepishly looked at me grinning/holding his plate up &amp; asked \"can we have another piece?\" (Meaning he and the dog). He cut himself another HUGE piece! Well what do you know. As others said, even MEAT eaters like this lasagna! And yes, I did give the rest away because it was far too large for 2 people. I'll make it right next time.\n\nYeah, don't get on me about rating a recipe \"5 stars\" that I didn't make. It's not the recipe's fault I botched it."

Type of sauce would likely make a difference, we only had Classico tomato and sweet basil and Prego on hand. Overall pretty yummy for a veggie lasagna. I think the mushrooms made it taste meaty which was good without the need to use meat. Delicious, Thank you!"

As written, youâ€™ll have five noodles left over. Instead, make a fourth layer of noodles and sprinkle with additional Parmesan and/Romano and more slices of mozzarella. Then bake for 30 minutes covered with aluminum foils (spray underside with cooking spray or tent to ensure cheese and foil donâ€™t touch). Then remove foil. Bake for another 30 minutes uncovered so cheese browns. Iâ€™d make it again."

"reviewBody": "I loved the taste of this recipe and will make it again. It was particularly great the next day, and I froze a couple pieces for later!\n\n ==&gt; Some comments:\n1) The prep time of 35 minutes seems VERY low, at least for me. I think it took me closer to an hour to prep. The timing matters when you have folks coming to dinner!\n\n2) I decided there was not enough tomato sauce in each layer, so I increased it, but I think I overdid it -- next time, I think I will stick to the recipe for the sauce.\n\n3) This is the first lasagna I had ever made. To keep the noodles from sticking together after I drained the water, I laid them on cookie sheets that I had sprayed with vegetable oil spray. I used several cookie sheets for this, which meant a lot of clean up. I need to figure out a better way before I make lasagna again!\n\n4) My dish could have stood a bit more baking -- I wish I had had the extra time (note the extra prep time in #1 above!)\n\n5) I used a bag of baby spinach which I boiled, drained, and pressed. I didn't bother measuring out 2 cups.\n\n6) As a 1st time lasagna maker, the number of noodles in the recipe confused me. I knew to overlap the noodles for each layer, so that wasn't a problem. While the recipe calls for 20 noodles, the box at the store contained 18. So I was afraid I would be short. In the end, I think I only used 15 noodles (3 layers of 5), so the box of 18 was plenty. I didn't have room for any more noodles, so I certainly didn't need 20."

"reviewBody": "Delicious. Picking up on some other reviews, I used 4 c. of mushrooms, around 12 oz of frozen spinach (that I microwaved and drained prior to cooking), a jar of artichokes, and sauteed it all in one pan. I couldn't find romano cheese so I substituted around 1/3 c. of parmesan. I forgot the egg but it was fine without it. I didn't use a mixer but just stirred the veggie and cheese filling vigorously with a large spoon. I also used more tomato sauce and no cook noodles. This all made for a very large lasagna that spilled over a bit but it was totally worth it."

Other than that I followed the recipe, exact for the egg. I think what made this stand out was mixing the yummy spinach, onions, mushrooms, spices and grated cheese with the ricotta cheese. I usually think itâ€™s too bland but what was so full of flavor. Thank you! Iâ€™ll make it quite often."

"reviewBody": "I didnâ€™t bother with lasagna noodles. Just used bow tie pasta cooked to al dente. Used a lot more spinach (frozen, chopped). less ricotta, no egg, more mozzarella. Also added my secret ingredient: PESTO. Added a generous tablespoon of it (Costco brand) to the spinach mixture. As others commented...no need to cook spinach separately or using a mixer. I Sprayed the dish well with Pam before adding sauce as the bottom layer, then kept layering pasta, spinach mix, mozzarella, and sauce. Didnâ€™t measure at all. I poured a few tablespoons of water over the top before covering and baking as the pasta will absorb more water and you donâ€™t want it all to dry out. I call this dish LASAGNISH as I use other pasta instead of lasagna noodles (too much trouble.) This gets RAVE reviews at potlucks where it is especially appreciated by non-meat eaters."

I used a full 32-oz container of whole milk ricotta cheese, and a full box of fresh mushrooms. I used a full box of lasagna noodles, which I think are more than 20. Finally, I think Rao's Homemade Marinara sauce is the best, and I used a full 28-oz jar."

We had a family of 7 drop in as I was getting ready to assemble, and pretty soon had 5 young men chopping veggies, grating cheese, and standing in line to assemble it all. \"Another layer of cheese?\" \"It already has 4 kinds of cheese in it.\"\n\nI made one batch vegetarian, and the other with baked chicken breasts, as my husband won't eat anything with mushrooms -- go figure. We had guests from Spain and Mexico for dinner, and the dish was a hit!! If you have never made lasagna before, follow the recipe. If you have made it in the past, you can add other ingredients as you choose. I added zucchini slices to the mix, and a few red pepper flakes to the sauce, because I like it just a bit zesty. Remember to spray the aluminum foil before you put the pan in the oven or you will lose all the top cheese. Enjoy"
