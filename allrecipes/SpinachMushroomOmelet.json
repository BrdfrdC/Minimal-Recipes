Eggs are a symbiotic creation! And that myth was disproven a long time ago. Annnnd omelettes taste *far* better with whole eggs...\n\nChange that, and you've got a five-star winner!\n\nI also recommend the folding of at least half of the veggies inside.. they keep more of their original shape/texture/mouth-feel that way, and it holds the omelet together nicely."

Full disclosure: I only added about 1/16th of a tsp of nutmeg because I was wary it would be too overpowering and based on the results, would stick to that amount in the future. I also used baby arugula instead of spinach and feta for the cheese because that's what I had on hand."

I was surprised that the addition of nutmeg was so good along with the addition of cheese INTO the eggs rather than on the veggies. I adjusted the omelette for one using two egg whites and one egg-it still came out thick. The only change that I would make is to cook the veggies and then add them into the omelette because the spinach can burn if the egg doesn't get under it properly. This will be my new \"normal\" omelette. Also very heavy so you don't hungry all day. Last note: added zaatar and feta to the top of it...and dill in with the tomatoes - not needed but delicious!"

A trick I learned long ago was to use a large cast iron skillet. After eggs are added, turn heat to low until about halfway cooked through. Put skillet under broiler for ~4-5 mins to cook the top. This prevents total destruction while attempting to flip omelet, and it ends up looking picture perfect."

It completely falls apart and ends up a scramble. Still good though. I'd probably use this many veggies for a 1-whole-egg-and-3-egg-white-omelet for myself AND a bigger omelet for the hubby. Or of course it's always nice to prep veggies at the beginning of the week so they're ready when you want 'em!"
