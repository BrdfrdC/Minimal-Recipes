I also had a supply of feta and substituted that for the mozzarella and parmesan. I added chopped shallot and yellow pepper that I sauteed in a little olive oil. The resulting dish was delicious - moist, tangy from the feta, and substantial due to the sausage. I can foresee changing the stuffing ingredients based on what is in the frig and coming out with a great dinner each time. Thanks for getting me started with this!"

I did adjust some of the recipe, not measuring the cheeses (extra), added Italian seasoning and an extra egg since it wasn’t enough filling for how large ours were and it turned out amazing! Highly recommend."

Delicious! Hubby wants more so I will be picking up some more portobello mushrooms tomorrow."

Substituted the pepper for the pepperoni as suggested. Added two teaspoons of Italian seasoning. Used Fresh Expressions salad dressing to brush the mushrooms prior to the first bake. Got lots of compliments and passed the modified recipe on. Also topped each mushroom with grated smoked Gouda for another layer of favor plus it browns beautifully."
