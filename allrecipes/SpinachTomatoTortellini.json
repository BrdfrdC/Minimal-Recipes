Also, I used milk and half-and-half instead of any heavy cream. Even then, I wished the sauce were a bit thinner, so next time I make this, I'll use only milk. My vegetarian family loved this, and I'll make it again soon."

First I minced a medium yellow onion and sautéed for about 2 minutes, then added 3 cloves of minced garlic and sautéed about 1 minute more. I then added all of the ingredients from the second step and cooked for a few minutes while bubbling. I turned down the heat and added about 6 cups of fresh spinach. I let that wilt about half way, then added baby Bella mushrooms. I mixed 1/4 cup of the milk with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, then whisked all of the milk mixture together and added it to the pan. I let that get to a boil and then turned it down to cook for about 5 minutes (stirring occasionally). I added the cooked tortellini last, and tossed to coat. I ended up with a thick, creamy, wonderful dinner!! I’m still going to add more garlic next time though."

"reviewBody": "I was so excited to try this recipe. I went to my local Aldi’s. They had a 9 oz package of cheese tortellini for $1.99. (For $2.20 more they had a package of chicken and cheese tortellini.)Their bag of fresh spinach was $1.19. They had a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes for .92 cents. Their heavy whipping cream was$1.55. So, for under $6, I got the main ingredients. I was extremely happy with that price. I was being cheap so I stuck with the one package. For those who love cream sauces as I do, I think using heavy cream is the way to go. I did not have basil so I used Italian seasoning. I forgot to add the garlic in my rush, and I really love garlic, like I said I was excited to try and hungry, so I probably had this cooked and gobbled up with in a half hour, lol. I would probably use two packages of pasta for next time. I would also like to try chicken and wine next time as well. This was sooo quick and affordable to make. I will most definitely be making again!"

And started with sauteeing one chicken/garlic keilbasa, took out of the pan, then sauteed pancetta and took out of pan, leaving the oil. Then sauteed one sweet onion chopped. Added the ingredients per recipe along with FRESH chopped basil, for sauce. Then added in 2T lemon juice to sauce. Once sauce thickened I stirred in cooked keilbasa and pancetta and placed on low heat for raviolis to boil on side. Once all items cooked through, spread raviolis in a rectangular dish and added all sauce to top and folded in. Garnished with freshly chopped basil. We will have this as a staple dish now-family loved it!"

Also, I couldn’t find diced tomatoes with garlic and onion, only one with onion, so I doubled the garlic. I used fresh basil instead of dried, and used fresh shredded Parmesan instead of grated, which I believe is a must for good pasta. Loved it!"

Maybe it is because I didn't use cream or maybe because I didn't drain the tomatoes? Anyway it makes a ton of sauce for 16 oz. of pasta and I always forget that. I usually end up cooking more pasta to use up the leftover sauce. Tonight I added mushrooms. Mmmm It’s good with artichoke hearts added too! (And Russian Perogies) I didn’t realize they weren’t tortellini until the sauce was already cooking."
