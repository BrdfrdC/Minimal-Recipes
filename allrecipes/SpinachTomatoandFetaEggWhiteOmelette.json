Halve the tomatoes and saute with a small amt. olive oil and as much garlic as you like; just to soften. Add spinach just long enough to soften, not really wilt. Stir in cheese. (I prefer goat cheese, but feta never disappoints.) Make your omelet w most of the filling inside and a little (or just more..) on top. Brunch or dinner for 2!"

This tricks the eye with adding some yolk color and is super good for you so I add it a lot when I cook. The 1st time I made it I put way too much tomato and spinach in so it didn’t look pretty but tasted great still! The second time I backed down a bit and it looks more omelette like."

It's good with and without the feta cheese. By the way, I use garlic salt and freshly ground black pepper when I whisk the egg whites. I wonder if we can call this a Greek egg white omelette? \"I'm strong to the finish, 'cause I eats me Spinach, I'm Popeye the sailor man! (toot, toot)\""
