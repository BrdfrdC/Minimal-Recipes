Here are the ingredients of that dip...Cream Cheese, Spinach, Mayonnaise, Onions, Artichokes, Monterey Jack cheese, Parmesan Cheese, Garlic, Sea salt, Sugar, Spices. So the missing ingredients, in my opinion, for a more flavorful dip are: Cream Cheese, onions, garlic, sea salt, sweetener and spice in that order."

I played with the cheese combination a bit, adding a little Romano Asiago blend to the Monterrey Jack that the recipe called for, Parmesan was added as per recipe. I added some dehydrated white onion bits, ground pepper and seasoned salt. The recipe yielded enough to split in 2, even 3 portions, freezing the remaining dip in small containers for later use."

"reviewBody": "The EASIEST, BEST recipe for spinach artichoke dip ever! Look no furthur. However it doesn't call for any salt, pepper or spices. Make sure you add these!! I added salt, white and black pepper, crushed red pepper, Italian seasoning, fresh garlic(or garlic powder) and drizzled a little olive oil over the top! I used \" veganese\"instead of real mayo because it is what I had, but it was great and I will always use it instead. Came out amazing, will be my go to from now on!\nFYI**I didn't use the exact measurements the recipe called for because I was making it in a small ramekin for two people, not a large serving. I actually just eyed the whole thing and stirred it all right in my baking dish. You don't have to be super precise with it just make sure it has almost an even distribution of veggies and cheese and mayo!(add a little more spinach then you think you should) justMake sure the veggies are coated well! And don't forget the olive oil drizzle instead of pre greasing your pan! ENJOY!"

One thing I did differently was to add pepper jack cheese, it was pretty tasty. What I disliked the most, no fault to the cook who posted this, was the saltines of the dish itself. I have been using sea salts for so long that the salt used in most things is overpowering, so next time I will use a low sodium salt and I think that will do it. Thank you for posting this recipe."

I will definitely be making this again!"

If you want a warm and hearty dip that guests will enjoy, I recommend this recipe."

Added salt, pepper, powdered garlic &amp; minced garlic. One of the times I made it, I used fresh spinach which I sauteed prior to mixing with the other ingredients. Both versions were VERY well received!! Thank you!"

But I could imagine it without it and it would've been great anyway. Next time I might try adding a shallot. But great recipe and everyone loved it!\nWill definitely keep it in a crock pot next time to keep it creamy and hot.....it got cold sitting out and became not quite as appetizing, I think, because there was still a lot left. But kept hot,\nit would've been totally gone. Thanks for the recipe!"
