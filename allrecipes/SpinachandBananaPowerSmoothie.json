I think next time I’ll add some ice cubes—I like my smoothies to be cold—and also some yogurt or something for a little extra thickness. Overall, not bad. It’s a very plain smoothie and I wouldn’t have it every day but it serves a purpose."

The recipe was right that you can't taste the spinach, but I could smell it, which after awhile, became a little off-putting. However, that's probably more of my taste than the recipe. Great smoothie!"

I now make this several times a week so keep frozen strawberries and blueberries on hand...plus old bananas and bags of fresh spinach in the freezer to make the smoothies cold without adding ice. I only use 1/4-1/5 banana to add a touch of sweetness without lots of carbs. And I add 1 TB of a healthy seed mix (chia/flax/hemp) to make it extra filling and add protein, fiber and iron. I use soy milk and two big handfuls of spinach. Thanks for the basic recipe—it’s a winner!"

Every other flavor is represented subtly and it's a wonderful flavor! \nI was alittle worried because I just have a regular $10 blender that it wouldn't get the pieces small enough to drink but it worked fine. I can't afford a magic bullet or vitamix so I'm glad to know I can still enjoy a smoothie without it!"

"reviewBody": "I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk in place of the soy milk, but cut it down to 2/3 cup. I also froze the banana before using. I added a half scoop of vanilla protein powder as well as a couple tablespoons of almond butter. This is probably the tastiest smoothie I have ever had; I could not even taste the spinach. Thanks for a fantastic base recipe that can easily be modified according to your tastes!"
