Added all the other ingredients per the recipe. The raw mixture was pretty loose (maybe my spinach was too wet) so I pan fried the burgers. Next time I might use chopped raw spinach, or add some bread crumbs to absorb the excess moisture. used hearty rolls, topped the burgers with lettuce tomatoes and tzatziki sauce. Yummy. BTW, my guys who usually eat 2 burgers could only finish 1 of these. The recipe made 5."

It came out great! \na long time ago there was a burrito place near me that had the biggest burritoes I have ever seen, sadly they are gone. But their marinated tofu recipe survived.\nI got this from them before they closed:\nTofu marinated in orange juice and chopped chipotle peppers (rehydrated dried peppers then chopped). salt &amp; pepper to taste with some oil (I like a bit of sesame oil). Marinate overnight crush it up and mix with this recipe.\ncooked and crumbled Tempeh would also work with this recipe."

"reviewBody": "These tasted very good but, despite refrigerating the turkey mix for about 2 hours first, I had such as hard time shaping these into patties. The mix was just too mushy. I used an organic ground turkey from Costco and it was a soft ground turkey to begin with so that may have been my problem. There was no way these would have survived the grill so I made them on a non-stick pan on the stove. They firmed up fine once cooked but I literally had to gab a handful of the meat mixture and plop it on the pan then try to flatten it while on the pan. It was so sticky that it stuck to my hands too which made flattening it difficult. Served it on tortillas with tzatziki sauce, sliced cucumbers and spinach leaves. I told my husband and two sons that I would not make this again and they all groaned and asked me please to make it again. I couldn't believe it. They loved it therefore I will try again and use a different turkey meat. Maybe that was my problem. BTW I did saute the garlic ( I don't like raw garlic) with a little onion and I used chopped baby spinach instead of frozen which I sauteed just a few seconds."

For bread, I used Naan bread nicely toasted. It was so delicious that we are eating the same thing tomorrow since I had enough meet leftover."

I followed the recipe with the exception of using fresh spinach (about 8 oz's) and (6 oz's) of crumbled feta cheese. \nMy husband normally does not like turkey burgers but loved these. They were moist and flavorful without the need to add salt. I will be making them again soon."

"reviewBody": "Made as directed, it was tasty but too dense to my liking. Next time I cooked, I just beat egg whites till their foam held its shape and folded into meat, which greatly improved texture for me. Cooked with thermometer till ready. Adding feta to a burger was a brilliant idea that I have adapted for a meatloaf and sausage variations of this recipe. Having cooked this several times, I sometimes add a tsp of lime or lemon juice to brighten it up. Thank you for the idea."

The meat mix is mushy but firms up well when cooked. I used a grill mat because I wasn’t sure how well they would turn. They turned fine but I will continue to use the mat to avoid flare ups as they do drip a bit. They cook towards the lower time, I would say 7 minutes on each side. Served in a pocket with tzaziki and lettuce. Yum!"
