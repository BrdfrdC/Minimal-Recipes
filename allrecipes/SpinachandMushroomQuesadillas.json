Once the mushroom/spinach mix was cooked, I spooned into a bowl and used the same pan to do step 4 (I didn't add any oil and it turned out not to be necessary). I put some salsa, sour cream, and shredded lettuce on top of the finished tortilla. The taste was OK--too much spinach. I won't make this recipe again unless I made significant changes. I'm sure there is a recipe out there that is more to my liking."

"reviewBody": "1.17.18 - I continue to make this recipe, but there's no need to bake the tortillas (I use GF corn). I just make the filling, heat a little olive oil in skillet, place tortilla in skillet, sprinkle cheese, top with mushroom/spinach filling, fold other 1/2 of tortilla over mixture, wait 1-2 min, flip, 1-2 minutes more and it's done. Delicious and easy to make! 10.13.16-Very simple and easy to make. I scaled the recipe in 1/2 and used 5 oz. fresh spinach (I chopped it), sliced baby portabella mushrooms, gluten free corn tortillas, and lactose free shredded cheddar. Made the recipe as is and it yielded 6 quesadillas. Corn tortillas are obviously smaller than flour tortillas, but I feel the recipe would yield the proper amount of filling for flour tortillas. The filling is also easily modifiable to include more seasonings if youâ€™d like, but I felt you get enough flavor from the mushroom and spinach with garlic. You could substitute olive oil in place of the butter to make it healthier if you want, but hey butter makes everything more delectable right? Topped my quesadillas with a dollop of guacamole and salsa. Thanks for the recipe!"

I decided to use our George Foreman grill for browning as couple others have suggested. It did a good job, BUT what a mess. Guess they were a bit overloaded with the extra mushrooms and oozed out the side. Great taste though and I will be making these again soon!"

"reviewBody": "The idea is fine and the ease of cooking is great, biggest problem was cooking them in the pan at the last step.\nThree minutes is /way/ over-kill for them. I barely got past counting 10 seconds and it was already browned. \n\nThis is after decreasing the time drastically when the first one /burned/ on one side at 3 minutes, followed by still burning the other side at 2 minutes. I lowered one side of the second to 1 minute, followed by the other side at 30 seconds, and all of this culminated in me just counting out 10 on each side and them looking perfect. This is with oil in the pan, as per instructions, on medium heat.\n\nMaybe it's different with a gas stove over an electric one, but with an electric stove: beware."

Once they were soft, I added the spinach, seasoned with salt, pepper and red pepper flakes and cooked until wilted. I wiped the skillet out and melted some butter. I placed the tortilla in the skillet, scattered the cheese throughout the tortilla and spooned the spinach mixture on one half of the tortilla. When cheese was melted, I folded tortilla over and cooked until crispy and golden brown. Delicious."

"reviewBody": "This is a fabulous recipe. I had these at a tex Mex. restaurant and had to have the recipe. Found it on, where else, here. I followed the recipe, closely, except, you do not need oil in the pan to finish. Just use a non-stick pan. I used 5 year old cheddar and spicy shredded cheese(the one in the bag). It was excellent. Made this again and used blue cheese, but the flavour wasn't right. I like that this is folded in half in the pan, much easier to work with, to serve I cut each half into 4's. I served with salsa and low fat sour creme."

I used fresh spinach, 4 cloves of garlic, mexican shredded cheese blend, and I added a can of black beans (suggested by my wife). I noticed quickly that I should have had the burner on low-medium when I put the quesadillas in the pan. They browned up very quickly. Next time I think I will add some yellow/green/red peppers and diced tomatoes. Overall, a very quick, easy, and delicious meal."

My whole family loved it, including my two year old, which was a shock since there wasn't any meat in it. The only thing I might change for next time is to add more mushrooms because I thought the spinach/mushroom ratio was just a little bit off. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!"

So here's how I adjusted it to suit my tastes: I used fresh spinach and sauteed it with the mushrooms, garlic, onions, salt and pepper. The only other change I made was that I used a peppered cheese blend that gave it just the right amount of kick! Even my dad who doesn't like spinach loved it!"

I also added Adobo seasoning (you can find it in the mexican food section of your grocery store) to the spinach mushroom mixture. The first quesadilla I put in a skillet with 1 teaspoon canola oil. I cooked it for 3 minutes on each side and it was way too crispy and over cooked. So the next three, I added 1 teaspoon of oil each time and did them seperately. They took about 2 minutes on each side to be lightly browned but still moist. Overall, this was very yummy and with the changes I will def make again!"
