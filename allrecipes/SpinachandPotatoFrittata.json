I had leftover roasted red potatoes in the fridge so I sliced those and put a light golden brown on them with bacon fat. I added 1/4 of an onion, saut√©ed, and doubled the spinach. I layered with white cheddar and seasoned each layer with garlic and seasoned salt and additional black pepper. Topped with sour cream and served with a toasted baguette. I did stove-top it until semi-set and finished in the oven at 400 degrees F for about 6 minutes. Broiled for an additional minute. Will keep this recipe handy."

I cooked it on the stove in a cast iron skillet till the edges turned lighter, then put into a stove at 425 degrees for ten minutes. Delicious!"

As other reviewers pointed out, the potatoes were very bland, to combat this, I used some restaurant seasoning from a local burger place. This is an awesome vegetarian dish, but I live in a house of carnivores so we had to add meat. I added some deli ham and some cooked, chopped bacon just before adding the spinach. The 4 star review was from the as written recipe, the slight modification of seasoning on the potatoes made it a 5 star dish. The addition of meat made it a dish my family wants again."

Being Italian, I feel parmesan cheese just adds flavor to everything! I like the potatoes on the crispier side too. I only use onion powder because I don't like onion.

Not sure if it is because I live at high altitude or what but I do have to finish this in the oven, 10 minutes or so at 350 degrees and it is perfectly fluffy and delicious...I know it is done when the center has risen and the edges have pulled away from the side of the pan. It is really easy to modify this recipe and add whatever veggies or cheese you have handy."

I needed to finish the dish off in the oven as I had a hard time getting the top center of the eggs done. It was pretty good, but I was not 'overwhelmed'. Still ended up more bland than I was expecting. Maybe next time more garlic and onion, or maybe use leeks instead of the green onion."

There were no leftovers and many requests to make it again. We served it as a side dish, but it could easily have been the main dish. This is such a great basic recipe as is, but you can make it personal with just a few additions. Bacon, ham, fresh herbs, tomatoes and mushrooms are just a few things I'd like to try (a few at a time of course). Thanks for such a super fun recipe!"

However, there was still a lot of filling, so it took twice as long to cook because it was too deep in the pan, and meanwhile the bottom burned. Next time I will use the larger pan even with fewer portions.\nI also used a reviewer's suggestion of seasoning the potatoes, but then forgot to add salt later on, so the rest of the frittata needed salt after I had served it. Overall though, the hubby requested I make it again, just without the burnt \"crust\" on the bottom. :)"

My mom said that she liked it ( I didn't try it, I don't like eggs ) the reason why I gave it a four star rating was because the eggs did not cook in 5 to 7 minutes, it took about 20! I think the only reason that the potatoes were not raw was because of the time it took to cook the eggs. By the time it was done my mom was already up, so it could not be a suprise breakfast like I had planned. I will only make this again if my mom BEGS me to."
