"reviewBody": "One of our favorite salads. Ever. It really doesn't need any more reviews, but I would like to add how much we love it. For those who posted the most *helpful* critical reviews, if the addition of that much sugar is troublesome, cut it by half and it is still great. I am always amazed by people who say they eat 2 tsp of dressing to a large salad, make the dressing as written and then say it's unhealthy. Or even better, never make it and criticize it as being unhealthy. Use your own common sense and reduce sugar/fat/whatever to what you already know you know are your own tastes. Good gracious. It's pretty simple."

As written, there is was too much dressing, way too much sugar and not enough crunch. To make it a 5 star, half the dressing and only use 1/4 of the sugar amount. Okay, maybe you could use half the sugar if you like it sweet. In order to give it crunch I added some sliced almonds.. I believe that we should rate a recipe as it is written. If you have to alter amounts, add ingredients, etc, then you are making a different recipe. As written...2 stars."

I put about 1/4 of the dressing on and it was great that way. You can always leave more on the side if people wanted to put on more, but no one will!"

If I were to make this again, I think I'd use less oil and more white wine vinegar (personal taste preference)"
