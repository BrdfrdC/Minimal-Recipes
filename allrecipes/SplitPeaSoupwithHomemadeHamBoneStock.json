I used chicken stock made with herbs and white wine to make the ham stock and added a bit of winr to the soup as well. Lots of flavor! I made it for a soup and salad event at church and most of it was gone!"

"reviewBody": "I decided to make this yesterday while I had time on my hands and a ham bone in the freezer I wanted to get rid of. I made as written except that I did not reserve the ham to add back in the soup. I love the flavor ham adds to split pea soup but I do not like hunks of it in my soup. I never have. The one main issue I had with this is that there is way too much carrot going on. The carrot taste overpowered the pea taste and it shouldn't be like that. I will use half the carrots next time. My other issue was the consistency. It was the perfect look and thickness at 6 hours. I really didn't want to blend 1/3 of it. I mean it was perfect at that point. Against my better judgement I went ahead and did it and instantly regretted it. Not only was it thick as mud but it went from a pretty green to very unappealing color. With all of this being said, I am still giving this 4 stars. The taste would be great if you cut the carrots in half. You be the judge on the blending part."
