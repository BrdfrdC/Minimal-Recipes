I learned adding the potatoes that I rarely nave to blend before serving. I bring to a boil, cover and simmer most of the afternoon (about 5 hours). I season with pepper, garlic granules,bay leaf and fresh rosemary. When I have company I do add some sea salt--no added salt for just us. This base recipe is the best. I agree with C Turner it is a lot like the Pea Soup Anderson's recipe."

"reviewBody": "I wanted a truly vegetarian split pea soup and this was easily modified without changing the essential recipe, so even though I made changes, I still rate this 5 stars -- I am quite certain that made as written it would be a 5 star recipe. \n\nI substituted a Knorr Homemade Vegetable stock tub for the chicken broth, increasing the water accordingly (total liquid added was 6 cups, and I added another cup and half during cooking as it was becoming quite thick). The soup came out very very thick after about 90 minutes of simmering. The peas broke down nicely and it would have been good as is, but I used my immersion blender to puree it more. I also added a bit more seasonings than the salt the pepper -- I added Smoked Spanish Paprika and some celery seeds, as well a few drops of Liquid Smoke to give it that \"something something\" that was missing with no ham in it. It's a pretty easy soup to prep, most of the time is spent \"hands off\" simmering. Once refrigerated it thickens up more so I add more liquid as I reheat some soup through the week. It became almost never-ending!!"

It came out nice and thick. At one point I needed to add some extra water, because it was starting to burn. I added some smoked sea salt to mimic the smokey meaty flavor. I will definitely use this recipe again. As a vegetarian, finding a good pea soup with no meat in it is a challenge. I will make mine home made from now on."

As the soup sits, it gets very thick so even with the leftovers you will have to add more broth. total broth was about 2 qts. if you cut the amount of split peas, then you can use less broth. I would make this again!"

This tastes just like it. I add a little onion and thyme, and half an hour before the end of cooking, half a cup of barley. It's hearty, very tasty, and I love the chewey nutty flavor of the barley. I cook it for up to three hours, and it is never too watery for me. If anything, it is a little too thick. The barely, of course, absorbs some of the liquid. This is a must try recipe!"

One thing about split pea soup is that to get it thick you really have to cook it. Every stove is a little different -cooking time was fine, and so was the liquid amount, you just have to figure out what level simmer you need."

Some people like it smooth. For a different texture you can put it through a blender in batches. If the soup is too watery (there are two styles), it cooks down rather rapidly. Just know that thick left over split pea soup will look a lot like Campbell's Condense. You'll have to add water. :)"

"reviewBody": "This is a great simple recipe. I did a bit of tweeking. Sauted onions, sweet pepper, garlic, chives, thyme, and celery in some evoo before adding the chicken stock ans peas. I also added a 1/4 teaspoon of geram masala. My soup was ready in under and hour as HINT: I SOAKED THE PEAS IN WATER OVERNIGHT!(2 times as much water as peas, throwing off the original water when i was ready to cook) this will help with cooking times and cause the peas to reach the desired consistency faster/more easily"

"reviewBody": "As simple as this recipe was, it was delicious! My family felt like it was at least equal to Pea Soup Andersons' (the actual restaurant). I think I might have used more broth than water. But the trick is to blend the whole thing once it's done cooking. That makes it so creamy and yummy."

"reviewBody": "WOnderful recipe. I added onion (about half of one), chopped in the cuisinart along with the carrots and celery. Sauteed them in olive oil before adding to the peas. Sprinkled some pepper and garlic powder in and added maybe 1/2 cup of half and half towards the end. Soup needs to cook at least one hour to be thick enough but is really worth it! (Even my 1 yr old loved it!)"

I also added a bay leaf and garlic powder and some thyme. I let it simmer for 2 1/2 - 3 hours to make sure the split peas got all mushy and made the soup thick."

"reviewBody": "I LOVE this recipe! I have made it several times and it's always great. I've always had to leave it on the stove a little longer then the recipe says (2 1/2 - 3 hours) but it is well worth it! The reason some people may have found it watery is because they didn't let it simmer long enough. I usually add some rosemary, salt and pepper while it's simmering. My boyfriend loves this recipe and always requests me to make it! THANKYOU!!!"
