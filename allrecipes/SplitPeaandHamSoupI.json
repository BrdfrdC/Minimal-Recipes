"reviewBody": "I rate this recipe five stars for quick and easy preparation, flavor, nutrition, cost effectiveness, and eye appeal. I resisted the temptation to add a lot of ingredients as I was looking for a simple and pure pea soup. I added 2T Herbes de Provence, used a smoked ham shank, beef bone broth, and added no salt or pepper. Because I did not pre-soak the peas, I used an immersion blender at the end and still needed to strain the soup. I added a spoonful of the strained solids to each portion for texture and that worked for me. Next time I will pre-soak the peas and allow for more cooking time. Love it!"

Cook about 1 more hr. Or until desired texture. \n Orig. recipe is a good base but you need to add more \"flavor\"\nThank you for this basic recipe.\n (By the way, if you have Hard Water, soak &amp; cook beans in Purchased Water (or Bottled Water). You can add 1/8 teaspoon of Baking Soda to Hard Waters, but I usually just buy water, works every time. Do not use hard water on any dried Beans.)"

I followed the recipe to a T, didn't add anything different, didn't change a single thing and it was PERFECT! We all thoroughly enjoyed this soup (even my finicky mother-in-law had to admit it was delicious!) I've since made it quite a few times and always with great results, the only time my husband complained was when I thought to add carrots, his response was \"it's pea soup not vegetable soup!\" So if you're looking for a tasty way to use a leftover hambone this is the recipe for you"

Really made a difference. Used Chicken broth instead of water as someone else suggested and soaked the peas all day before cooking (another tip). I also added a bunch of carrots and celery and onion that I sauteed in butter until brown and soft. YUM. My son hated it but he's 12, the rest of the family loved it. Got a request to make it again the next week but now the Easter ham was all gone."

No soaking of peas at all...just cooked up the onion with some garlic, added the Easter ham bone with some extra ham, used beef broth and water to cover the boneThen added carrots and celery. No salt either. Cooked on low and occasionally stirred for about 2 hours. We all agreed it was the best soup. Would even rock without the added veggies."

"reviewBody": "Love it. Always make as written first and it was a perfect, simple base. The beauty of I didn't saute my onions. I finely chopped a ham steak and an onion, tossed them in a Ziploc, added liquid smoke and let that marinate overnight. I like a smooth, less thick soup so I added more water throughout cooking. I also added chicken base to the water for more flavor. My seasonings were Beau Monde, garlic hot sauce and smoked black pepper. I cooked the peas down for two hours before I added the ham and onion mixture then cooked another hour or so until I had a pureed soup without having to use a blender or mixer. To serve, I ladle it into bowls, give it a fresh sprinkle of smoked pepper and pat of butter. Tonight it was oyster crackers and garlic toast on the side. SO WONDERFUL! It makes you forget it's 28 degrees outside."

So if you include the ham bone, that is pretty high. I dumped in the split peas and thought, no way is this going to work. I like recipes that specifically state the amount of ingredients. Another recipe states 2 qts of water for a bag of peas - that makes more sense."

"reviewBody": "Good basic recipe but I think I will have to make some adjustments next time to be really good. I used a smoked ham hock and added 1 tsp. bouillon but I would add more and perhaps some garlic and carrots. I would also increase the water/broth as it was too thick, and I like thick soups! But a good starting point and not bad for my first attempt at split pea soup.\nUPDATED: Tried sautéing carrots and celery with the onion, increased the water (about 6 cups) and used 4 tsp. bouillon and it was way more flavorful, with better consistency. Using a 1/2 lb. smoked ham hock and shredding the meat right before serving really helps too. So yummy, thank you!!"

As in all my recipes I do as I wish I used bacon fat sautéed up onions and carrots left on side to add later to soup . I cooked down the dry peas added ham chunks with ham bone and more bacon fat till peas are cooked down then puréed the peas after removing the ham made a little rue to thick it up then added the onions and carrots\n my husband enjoyed it very much"

"reviewBody": "This recipe could not be easier or more delicious! I had some leftover ham and decided I really wanted to learn how to make split pea soup from scratch. This recipe helped a lot. It could not be simpler, you just put the dried split peas in a pot, chop up some ham (salty ham is better I think) cover with water or chicken broth (I used water with 4 bullion cubes). I forgot to add the onion but it turned out wonderful even without the onion. If you don't soak the peas (I didn't) it does take almost two hours of simmering, like the recipe says, but that all depends on how thick or dissolved you want your soup. If you're okay with it having a lot of peas still undissolved, you don't have to simmer it more than 40 minutes. Just keep an eye on it and let it simmer until it's the consistency you want it. The salt from the ham made it so I did not have to season it at all!! So Yummy and I will definitely be making this soup all winter."

I cook the ham and onions, carrots and celery with the ham for at least an hour before adding split peas. I always use Yellow Split peas because it makes a more appetizing appearance when served. ( I think this may be a French Canadian version of the recipe)"

I didn't add salt since most said the ham bone took care of that and they were right. I also added a bay leaf. Not great changes, but it added to the flavor and if I don't have to soak or sauté then it makes it that much easier."

"reviewBody": "I like my pea soup to be savory, not bland, with more flavor, so I always follow my Grandma's recipe: Add a hefty portion of chopped bacon that has been cooked with a chopped onion (and then fat-drained), a bay leaf, carrots, and celery. Sometimes, I'll also some ham bits to the above. Let it all simmer (stirring occasionally). When it's all done, take about half the soup and blend it for a few seconds (with a regular blender or a stick blender) to get a silky texture and prevent \"wateriness,\" then combine that back into the main part of the soup. Be careful not to burn the soup as it's cooking--been there and done that!! It smells like burning leaves and really can't be \"rescued\"! All the above steps add only a few minutes to the basic recipe. Serve sprinkled with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Out of this world!"

I put this in the crock pot with the smallest shank-end ham I can find (but I love the idea of using a honey-baked ham bone.. I'll definitely try that) along with 2 outer leaves of a head of romaine lettuce, and about a teaspoon of ground black pepper. I let it cook in the crock pot on high for about 4-6 hrs, remove the ham and use my stick blender to smooth it all out. I cut up any ham left on the bone and put it back in the soup after blending, taste for salt and pepper and it's ready to eat with some crusty sour dough bread!"
