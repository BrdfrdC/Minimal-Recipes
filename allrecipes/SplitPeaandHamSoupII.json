"reviewBody": "Made it for the first time pretty much as written, and it was delicious.\n\nI'm sure this is a very forgiving recipe like most soups. Because I'm in Australia and because I prefer to create as little washing up as possible, I didn't actually measure any quantities. I used a whole ham hock, 1.5 packets of split peas, 2 carrots, a large onion and half a bulb of garlic (I love garlic) and 2 bay leaves.\n\nIt was absolutely delicious when it was done, but then I absen-mindedly overdid it with the salt. So I cooked an additional packet of peas til they were soft but still held their shape, and stirred this into the salty soup. This was a great way to add some texture and extend the soup even further.\n\nNext time I think I'll add some chilli, I think a bit of heat would go really well with these flavours."

The only thing I changed was to add a diced potato for the last half hour of cooking. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter. I let my ham bone simmer overnight in the crock pot. Easy peasy, so to speak. Try this recipe, and enjoy!"

I would start with less than half of the recipe amount and only add more to taste after the peas have cooked down. I started with a double recipe and had to double that without pepper to save the recipe and it was still peppery to my taste. Bless the person who gets the last bowl of this recipe at full power."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was perfect for the base, but I don't generally have a whole ham very often, so I tweaked the recipe just a bit. My butcher generally has ham hocks available so I use them to create my broth. He will also cut me a nice thick slice of ham steak that I cube since there is never enough meat on the hocks. I also end up with a lot of broth, so I add two onions and four carrots. With the extra meat and veggies, I still get a nice thick pea soup, even with a single pound of peas. Great recipe thanks for posting."

Sometimes the suggestions are good, but it makes no sense to grade a recipe as 5 star when the changes made have created an entirely different recipe.\n\nAt any rate, I like the seasonings in plain split pea soup. I probably use more onion, but I love onion. And I like my soup smooth and creamy so I blend it and add a little milk or cream. \n\nMy kids always liked it over thin buttered egg noodles ... yummy."

Now that I have my own kitchen finally, I decided to make some pea soup for the first time. I pretty much followed this recipe cooking a big fat hambone in the slow cooker overnight. Because it does not specify how much water/juice to use, I followed the directions on the 3 1lb bags of peas I used in a large pot. I chopped my ham and carrot up really fine. The soup tastes fabulous and was very hearty. My BF however thought it needed to be thinned down a tad so I did that. Next time I'll use more ham, carrot, browned onion and maybe even sliced baby portobella mushrooms! This is a keeper!"

I cooked the ham bone over night, then added the other ingredients to simmer all day. I then pureed everything in the blender and added it to a stock pot to simmer for another hour. The peas were still a bit hard and so were the carrots. Next time I think I'll try a recipe that is made for a crock pot"

I put the ham hock in the crock pot overnight like a couple of the other posters suggested and left out the carrots. I think that next time I am going to add a little more garlic to the water while cooking the ham hock. I also think that adding more pepper and salt would help."

Covered the bone with water, added a couple garlic cloves and rosemary. Simmered for the whole day then strained and seperated the meat from the bone, cartiledge, etc. Put it in a bowl in the fridge overnight and skimmed the fat off the next morning. Returned to the crock pot, added my soaked split peas and some onion and let simmer. Later I used a hand blender to make it smooth. Then I added some diced potato and carrots and the remaining ham and cooked for another hour. Loved it!"

Instead the liquid was ham stock. I skimmed off the fat from the ham stock before adding it to the soup. And added back a portion of this stock to the vegetables and peas to eye ball the correct amount for the pea soup. I saved the extra ham stock to the side to add if needed to get the correct soupiness of the spilt pea. My husband hates vegetables- carrots/celery but since they were so small he didn't object. Plus I soaked the peas in stock while the vegetables were cooking. Very easy and fast for split pea soup.We both loved it. thanks.."

The only thing that i found was that the recipe does not specify how much liquid to use. I used 10 cups which seemed to be just about right, possibly even a bit less. Other than that great recipe! Will use again!"

Reheat in the microwave to prevent scorching. It is just the best!Evaporated milk makes the soup!"

"reviewBody": "I had lots of broth when I cooked the bone and ham, so I used 2 20-oz packages of split peas, 2 onions and 2 carrots (that was about a cup of carrots). I sautéed the onion and carrots together in a little bit of olive oil and added them to the broth once I removed the fat from cooling it all night and heated it up. I threw in the peas, and the ham, and because I had used left over honey-baked ham, I added a dash of Worcestershire sauce a teaspoon of thyme, a dash of Cholula hot sauce and 3 bay leaves to cut the sweetness a little. I heated it up a little bit, but had to stop due to unexpected company. Today I started it back and put it on low on the stove and left for about an hour and a half. Well, luck was with me, because I accidentally have hit the button on the stove and it was on High the whole time I was gone! I thought for sure the peas would be stuck to the bottom of the pot – but all that happened was the peas broke down and the soup was done! I did run the immersion blender around a little just to make sure most of it was liquidated. I can’t believe how lucky I was, and also because this soup is GREAT. Thanks for a great recipe!"

I gave this a 4 Star rather than a 5 because it was a great base soup and I tweaked it for more flavour (so 1 star belongs to me) LOL\n\nI filled a large stock pot with water and put in my ham bone. I cut up lots of ham in order to get rid of it (probably 1/8 of a shank of ham.\n\nI made the recipe pretty much as it was written except I doubled the celery &amp; carrots due to the large pot I was making.\n\nI added a waxed carton of chicken broth, an envelope of vegetable Oxo granules, a bay leaf, some Season All seasoning and some (1/4 tsp) of crushed garlic (the jar kind). \n\nI used 1 small bag of whole yellow peas and 1/2 small bag of split yellow peas which I forgot to presoak but it turned out okay and about 1/4 cup of barley.\n\nIt is sooooo good! We're eating this as a late lunch and will have it for dinner along with some nice, fresh Italian bread.\n\nAnother keeper recipe. Thank you for sharing it with us."
