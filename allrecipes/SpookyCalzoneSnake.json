I kneaded with my hands, let rise for an hour, kneaded a second time and let rise for 2 more hours. Also, I didn't attempt the snake shape. I rolled out my dough and cut it in half to make 2 triangle calzones. They were huge, so make 4 at the least."

Using two Pillsbury canned pizza crusts lessened a lot of time and work, but still kept it very tastey! I used an egg yolk wash with green food coloring, practically smothering the outside. As it baked, it turned a slimily green/gray/brown color. Perfect for grossing out husbands, but probably not so much for kids! We couldn't believe how wonderful this recipe was. Will make often using different shapes and colors for other occasions!"

I was debating, why bother since it's like a pizza, but not really with the ricotta cheese instead of tomato sauce. I made it with chopped anchovies near the head for people who prefer them to salami and with salami instead of pepperoni the rest of the way. It was a great hit with the kids and adults. I baked it at 450 for 20 minutes and it was nice and crisp on the outside and chewy and soft inside with the cheese well melted. I also added an egg to the cheese mixture. Will definitely make again."

I cheated &amp; used a can of crescent roll for the dough (pinched together seams), then simply put a light layer of spaghetti sauce, followed by a single layer of turkey pepperoni &amp; a generous sprinkling of shredded mozzarella. Used pastry brush to add diluted yellow food coloring to dough, then used diluted green food coloring to add spots &amp; lines, dabbing gently with a paper towel to ensure green did not run. Even my incredibly picky daughter (who never eats) finished all her \"Snake\" AND salad (that is a huge compliment for me!). Great concept that can be made more easily using pre-made ingredients...great time-saver &amp; inexpensive meal for a busy weeknight...have fun with this one!"

When i proof my yeast i use 1/2 cup of water and when it is time to add it to the flour and other ingredients i use 1 1/2 cups of warm milk (to replace the left out water) In the dough I add 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic, 1-2 tbsp of parsley and 1-2 tbsp Italian seasoning. In the cheese filling I add 2-3 more minced garlic cloves! (we like a lot of garlic) and about 1/2 cup of parm cheese. I like to keep the pepperoni separate from the cheese mixture. I put a thick layer of it on one side of the rolled out dough, then add the cheese mixture and close her up. They are delicious! And if there are any left overs, they taste really good cold the next day too!!!!"

We even put the fillings into \"zones\" and tried to make a gross Halloween anatomy lesson out of it with the pepperoni zone being the intestines, the black olives being the \"spleens\" etc. Then it was extra giggle-y and gross when I could ask them which PART of the snake they wanted to eat! Sauce for dipping makes it extra delicious."

I happened to have another All Recipes one on a cue card: Jay's Signature Pizza Crust, so used that as my crust and filled it with mozzarella, pepperoni and pizza sauce. I decorated my snake with watered down food colouring. While cooking, it exploded in a couple part, but we just it guts, and enjoyed it! Tasty, and a great addition to my Halloween party!"

"reviewBody": "Came out really cute! I cheated and used Pilsbury pizza dough, and it was so easy! It comes out in a long layer, so you just stretch it and then stretch it width-wise a little, put the filling in the middle, and seal it up. I used egg whites with green food coloring to make a green snake. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was it was just a tad dry. It was probably me. I may have cooked it a little too long."

Used the bread machine to mix and rise the dough. Next time I will cut the ricotta cheese in half and use sausage with the pepperoni. Served it with pizza sauce for dipping. Will definitely make the dough again for other recipes."
