We like to fill our recipe with meat so I added 1 cups chicken, 1 large can of tuna, 1 can of crabmeat, 1 can of oysters (NOT the smoked ones) &amp; 12 ounces of shrimp to the mix. I only used one large box of Zatarain's since there's just the 2 of us eating it. Thank you!"

I browned the chicken in olive oil and butter, removed it and then added andouille and ham and onion in the remaining oil to saute. Added the cooked chicken. Then followed the recipe. Shrimp was added at the end. However, I had to cook it one hour for my desired consistencey. Low and Slow! Great. Rotel made it really special."
