"reviewBody": "Growing up in the south, I’ve had more than my fair share of squash casseroles. This recipe was a variation that my family thoroughly enjoyed and it will be my new favorite go-to squash recipe. I added some spice to the squash and onion as I cooked them down, be sure to drain them really really well so you don’t have a lot of extra liquid in your mixture. I probably used more veggies than the recipe called for but I wanted to finish up what I had in the fridge. I didn’t count the crackers but used 1 whole sleeve of Ritz and approx half of another sleeve that was left open by my kids (insert eye roll emoji). I always measure cheese with my heart so I’m sure I used more than a cup. This was so good, I’ll be making it more this summer as we get yellow squash from the garden."

We have been known to use the buttered crackers in the past though. And garlic powder in both ways. U can also have crumbled bacon add on top. Just an idea from a country restaurant employee."

I used extra butter too because I'm from Charleston SC and that's just what we do lol. Also it took longer than 5 minutes in the skillet. I cooked the squash and onions on medium for 15 minutes with minced garlic. I also added a half tsp of dried oregano, half tsp of dried basil, half tsp of dried parsley. I did everything else the same though. Absolutely delicious! So good! Making it again tonight for the 7th time."

The first time I cooked it, I realized (after starting the squash on the stove) that I didn’t have any buttery round crackers, aka Ritz. I didn’t panic but used what I DID have - Cheese Itz. While the recipe isn’t exactly how the author prepares it, mine tuned out so yummy. I made it for my parents and was told, “that’s the best squash casserole we have ever eaten.” Win!"

"reviewBody": "I made the recipe exactly as stated and it was a huge disappointment. Very bland and as one reviewer stated, “the eggs ruined it, it was a glorified soufflé”. As I ate it I kept thinking of how many calories I was consuming without the reward of the delicious taste I usually require for such consumption. I honestly would have rather eaten it just steamed with a bit of butter and salt and pepper, as is my usual habit. I won’t make it again, but if I did I would use half the eggs or eliminate them completely, reduce the butter (but NOT eliminate it), reduce the milk, and add some additional seasonings - at a minimum. If you like a soufflé-type texture (and are EXPECTING it), then keep the recipe as is with the exception of adding some additional seasonings. I expect that would be quite tasty!"

Then added that mixture to the squash. Everything else was pretty much the same; tweaked the cheese and butter according to the way the mixture looked. It cooked beautifully in 25 minutes and tasted absolutely delicious."

I sprinkled on a bit of Nashville hot seasoning on top and my husband's sprinkled on just a touch of sriracha sauce. I did save some time by cooking the zucchini and onions with water and the butter in my cast iron skillet. I did not feel it needed drained at all so I added some of the crackers to the zucchini and onion and then sprinkled on the rest of the topping and place it directly into my oven. It turned out perfectly and less bowls to deal with. I will definitely make this again."
