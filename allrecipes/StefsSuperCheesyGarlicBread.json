The topping seemed like a lot but it really sank into the bread and was just delicious. I used unsalted butter, but added a couple turns of salt to the mixture. Also used Mozzarella instead of Monterey Jack and chives instead of green onion (only because I had chives). I will make this again and again!"

"reviewBody": "This bread was a huge hit at my house. I'll be honest I'm not much of a cook but pairing this with the slow-cooker lasagna I make, and everyone was impressed! I just have to take a second to say, I DO NOT get the people writing bad reviews because it's not healthy. I know you are all smart enough to have realized that before you made it, if you did even make it (and if you didn't, you shouldn't be reviewing it anyway). If something this heavy, rich (ie delicious) makes you have a heart attack just thinking about it, move on, go find a recipe for tofurkey or something. \n\nThis recipe was EXCELLENT. Yum! I did make a few tweaks to it though. I used a 1lb Italian loaf from the local grocer. Omitted the onions. I did use the 1/2 c. of butter, but I cut the mayo down to 1/2 c. as well. I added in 1/2 t. of garlic powder along with the 3 cloves of minced garlic, and I think next time I'll even add in maybe a 1/2 t. of garlic salt. For the cheese I used 1 c. of cheddar, 1 c. of mozzarella, 1/2 c. of a shredded Italian mix, and then another 1/4 c. of shredded parm. I wasn't sure how it would turn out mixing everything together and spreading it on instead of starting with the butter, then putting mayo on, followed by a cheese topping. Mixing it all together was great and had the same or better result than layering it all on individually. This recipe was simple and delicious. Yes, it's a little decadent, but we could all use that sometimes."

I used all of the other ingredients as recommended. My French bread was previously frozen and halfway thawed out before I cut it and added the cheesy garlic topping. I may have let mine remain in the broil phase an extra 2 minutes (until the cheese started lightly browning). The family LOVED IT! My 9-year-old daughter and 66-year-old grandmother both asked for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Holy cow....heavy on the tummy, but gooey, cheesy and garlicky is the best way to enjoy garlic bread! Next time, I'll just eyeball all the ingredients, as I don't think flavor will be sacrificed at all by drastically reducing the butter and mayo, and I love butter and mayo! I used some minced garlic as well as a healthy sprinkling of garlic and onion powders. Didn't have green onions, so I used dried chives, which I'd do again. Also, I didn't have a loaf of french bread, so out of sheer desperation, I used a package of King's Hawaiian rolls sliced lengthwise. I slathered up both sides and forged on with the recipe. Not bad in a pinch, but I'll make sure to have a loaf of french bread on hand next time I make this! Served with AR's Hearty Minestrone soup, this sinfully delicious garlic bread was thoroughly enjoyed by myself, hubby, and 4 year-old daughter. An occasional splurge for sure, I'll hold on to this recipe."

When we have dinner guests, this is usually on the menu by their request. Everyone loves this bread, even people who don't like mayo. Btw, someone rated this 2 stars because of the ingredients. Why give a bad rating without trying the recipe just because of the calorie content? That's insane. If it's not for you, move on, don't rate the recipe low. This bread is DELISH!"
