"reviewBody": "I use this recipe as a template for vegetarian nachos. I cut out the chicken, and I re-fry my own beans (pinto). I use two bags of large tortilla chips. I use the chopped onions, the green peppers, and the sour cream, but I like to add sliced black olives, and sometimes chopped tomatoes (Roma), or whatever I feel like really (chopped sauteed garlic/onions, etc). I use a LOT of cheese (any kind I have really), and I layer like the recipe says, just without the meat. I also make a bowl of yummy guacamole to go with it, and its perfect. Love it for the Superbowl!"

"reviewBody": "I make this very similarly, but I don't like to cook the sour cream. what I add that I haven't seen in the reviews is crispy bacon rather than chicken. Bacon is a beautiful flavor mixer with the beans, the cheese (a mixture of jack and pepper jack). I put it on a big platter, bake it then broil it for a couple of minutes to get the cheese a browned finish. When it's out of the oven I add lettuce, onions and tomatoes, sour cream, homemade guacamole and salsa. Yum. Absolutely lovely."

I cooked 1 lb of ground beef with taco seasoning, then layered it in a 9x13 pan with tortilla chips, cheese, pinto beans, tomato, green onion, and sliced jalapenos and baked it all as directed. I skipped the sour cream and served salsa and guac on the side. Perfection! I will hang on to this for gatherings and the occasional tv night dinner."

I was impressed with both - the time allowed all the meat to get hot and cheese to become good and melty, and the sour cream was wonderful cooked with everything else - this is how I'll do it from now on. Thanks for the recipe :)"

We used sharp cheddar instead of pepper jack, white onions instead of green and canned chicken breast instead of fresh. I would totally make this again, but would leave out the layer of sour cream. I found it to curdle (and wasn't very appealing to the eye) and made the chips soggy. Other than that we loved it!"

I served with homemade pico de gallo and guacamole. Yum yum."

I used cheddar instead of pepper jack. I served this with fresh shredded lettuce. I also served the sour cream on the side. I had a lot more \"stuff\" than chips, so it needed to be eaten more like a taco salad. It probably would have done better in a bigger cooking dish too. But all in all, a decent recipe! I like how the chips taste with everything when you bake them in the oven, which I've never done before. Be aware that this is a first day ONLY recipe, the chips will not survive as leftovers."
