"reviewBody": "I made this the other night in a slow cooker. I doubled the recipe and used full length single cut ribs. I didn't use low sodium soy sauce. A nice subtle taste it was really good. I also took some of the sauce from the crockpot when it was done and boiled the water off to get a stronger flavour and poured that over rice! The ribs where also pork ribs! Works just as good! Great recipe it's going in the book!"

"reviewBody": "Wonderful recipe! Make it just as written! My Korean fiance's only complaint was there wasnt enough soy sauce taste and he hates soy sauce. I'm not sure if that is because of the reduced sodium choice or not. But i would rather make it this way and just add a bit of soy sauce after. Thank you for sharing!!!\n\n Edit! Added a picture of my most recent making it again. Very yummy! I haven't been skimming off the oil nor trimming the fat off the short ribs before cooking. The rib bones afterwards go to dogs and my cat loves the fat and bits around the bone we couldnt chew off. Also i increased the reduced sodium soy sauce, water and sugar this last time since i used a bigger pot it didnt cover the meat much at all. It was just fine =)"
