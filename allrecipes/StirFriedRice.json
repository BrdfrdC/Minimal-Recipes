I'll stick in my olive oil and onions and garlic. The recipe is finished when I add the rest of the ingredients once the onions and garlic are done. I'll be adding basmatti rice instead of minute white rice, so it'll take a bit longer to cook. I'll just use 8 cups of vegetable broth and 4 cups of white basmatti rice. That's it, that's my change."

I use a rice cooker and non-stick wok and it really makes a big difference in final texture and quality. Fresh cut peppers and onions from the garden + whatever frozen veggies I have on hand. I subbed sesame oil the first time and didn't have soy sauce the second time and used a stir fry sauce and both substitutions turned out great. My mother raises hens and the taste of fresh eggs in this recipe is incomparable. I cook for one but still make a large batch and can enjoy all week long or it freezes very well. Great dish for meal prepping!"

I didn't have frozen stir-fry vegetables so I cut up some onion and fresh carrots and sauted with garlic Then I tossed in some frozen corn (thawed) and added parsley towards the end of cooking with egg.. I used olive oil and no butter. Superb! My husband said it was \"exceptional\". \n\n\nThis dish is now added to my arsenal of culinary wonders that I can cook. The simplicity of the recipe allows you to easily tweak it based upon your own tastes and available recipes."

That's because it's not, the frying step is completely skipped in this recipe. I prepare the rice per the box instructions (add frozen mixed veggies) then I put the rice in the freezer to chill for about 10 min. put about a tbsp of wok oil in a skillet ( regular oil or olive oil will also work) but you have to actually fry it for it to be fried rice..... add soy and egg at this time. I also throw a lil stir fry sauce in with the oil sometimes just do it right before you put the rice in or it will burn Makes all the difference!!!!!!"

I also added cubed chicken that I sauteed in some fresh ginger and garlic (at the same time you add the cooked egg to the mixture). After I mixed everything up at the end, I sauteed the whole mixture briefly on med-high heat in about 1-2 T of butter that had been sauteed with some more fresh ginger. Delicious and tasted very fresh and healthy (although I'm sure it would have been healthier without the butter)."

I usually do not cook any vegetables in it though because I make chicken with broccoli when I serve this rice. I cook exactly as stated, but at the end before I combine the egg, I add 1-2 minced garlic cloves (depending on size) and 3-4 tablespoons of Land O' Lakes Light Butter. Once the butter melts throughout and egg is added, make sure it's well mixed. Then, I just cap it for a few minutes on low to heat back up. You can add some salt and pepper to taste as well, but you shouldn't need any more salt with the soy. Let's just say it's the best stir-fried rice you'll ever eat!!!! Such a great foundation to complete my perfect stir-fried rice recipe! Hope this helps and you enjoy!!"

I only use 2 eggs and scramble them in smart balance butter. Make sure you use minute rice instead of the other quick rices. I used the 10 minute boil in the bag rice and I had to cook it longer."

This recipe is down right the most perfect stir fry made at home...closest to restruaunt style I have found yet and it was a huge hit in the family \"chinese\" food night!! My healthy twist ~ low salt soy sauce, fresh brocolli pieces, instant brown rice and sprayed pan with cooking spray and scrambled egg whites. The best fried rice I have ever made! Thanks for the recipe!!"

I heated the veggies up in the broth, cooked the rice, drained the broth, added the rice and slowly added the broth until it evaporated. Then I added the egg right before serving (which I dont get because ill be eating it and all of a sudden and egg chunk, seems weird) Anyways it was very very good and surprisingly filling."

We used some canned mushrooms instead of the frozen veggies since we were making a veggie stir-fry to go with it. It tastes great. Also, we used a little over 1 1/3 C water mixed with dry buillion since we didn't have canned. That turned out to be the right amount of moisture."

"reviewBody": "I decided, at the last minute, to have fried rice with something my Daughter-in-law prepared. This was good and quick. Everyone liked it, thought it was really good for being so quick. I didn't have the chicken broth, so I used chicken boullion, and it ended up a little salty, but I can't blame that on the recipe. I actually \"fried\" it a little at the end by adding a little more oil, this seemed to take away the \"Minute Rice\" texture, and make it better. I'd definitely use this recipe again when I'm pinched for time."

I had to modify the rice- I had chicken flavor steam in the bag rice; so i used a 1/2 cup of water along with the soy sauce and steamed the rice in the pan. I also added garlic powder and about 1/2 tsp ground ginger.\nSuper good- nothing left- my kids who won't touch take out fried rice asked for seconds. Will use again and will add meat."
