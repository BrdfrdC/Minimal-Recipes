Shanks need red wine, carrots, onions, a little thyme, and flour to thicken the sauce before cooking in a slow cooker or 5 to 6 hours in a low oven. Sad to say this was inedible and a tremendous waste of expensive meat and my very valuable time."

I made the mistake of ordering the lamb by piece, not weight and it ended up being very expensive. I gulped, paid and headed home. I am SOOOOO glad I goofed! This was one of the most complex, rich, amazing dishes I’ve ever cooked. It was so worth the expense and we savored ever morsel of the leftovers for days. It is now our required fare for our Green Day. And as luck would have it, I found out this year I’m 1/4 IRISH!!!! There’s a reason for my blarney!"

Not as savory as I had expected, I did end up using salt (I normally don't) Cooked the lamb shanks for 3 hours: fall off the bone tender! I did have to skim off the fat before serving. Hubby liked it, he is not a lamb fan at all. Will make again."

"reviewBody": "Delicious!! I highly recommend. Restaurant quality I think, with the addition of a little brown sugar to cut the bitterness of the beer. Cooking Tip: TRIM all visible excess fat from the lamb before browning. I got rid of at least 1 cup of fat that way and did not need to cool sauce to separate fat before eating! This makes for a yummy but MUCH less greasy dish. There was NO gamey flavour, just tender lamb. I also seasoned with salt &amp; pepper before browning. We cooked up organic barley as a side dish instead of potatoes and it goes very well with this stew. Thanks for the recipe."

I pretty sure it would be awesome with a leg of lamb, as well. Anyhow, it was delicious. Super good."

I served it with cheesy polenta, also from this site, and it was definitely an excellent combination.\n\nI DID, however, use my pressure cooker instead of the stovetop method, but that was only because I was shorter on time than I planned to be. I'm not a huge fan of lamb, but this was so tender and did not taste in any way gamey. It was very delicious, and I recommend it for something different!"
