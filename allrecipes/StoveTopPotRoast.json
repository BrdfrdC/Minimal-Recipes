I used onion flakes, a garlic/herb mix, salt, pepper, a can of beef broth, 2 beef bouillon cubes, and a chicken bouillon cube—and the other herbs listed. It ended up having a really good flavor. I added baby carrots and cut and peeled Russet potatoes the last 45 min. I also increased the heat, so it would get done in about 2 1/2 hours, and kept it covered. I did the searing part with olive oil. Made some biscuits to go with it. It was delicious and easy, especially since this was the first time I ever cooked a pot roast, just took some patience."

"reviewBody": "I wanted to use my slow cooker, but I got pressed for time so I needed to so it in the stovetop. This recipe was pretty easy to follow, but I switched it up a bit. After browning the roast, I removed it and sautéed my onions (I only had yellow) and some minced garlic (I use the jar stuff). I added the roast back and used fat-free beef broth instead of water. I added the potatoes after about and hour and a half, then the baby carrots about 1/2 hour after that. I let that go for another 1/2 hour before removing the roast and the veggies. I thickened the sauce with a mixture of flour and cold water for a gravy and I stirred some horseradish into some sour cream for a sauce on the side. I’m not generally much of a cook, so I’m pretty proud of this meal."

I haven't finished making the roast but by the flavors of adding key ingredients made it so yummy not to mention I added a small amount of liquid smoke and no flour."

I had to pull out the meat and let the veggies cook longer! Also, while the roast was tasty it wasn't fork-tender and we ate it sliced instead of pulled apart. Like many other reviewers, I used beef stock, a small can of tomato paste, and generous dashes of Worcestershire sauce and red wine vinegar. I'll try this again sometime and really try to keep the temp low so it has a chance to tenderize and be permeated by the seasonings."

"reviewBody": "I am very pleased that I tried this dish. In the past, I have tried to make pot roast on the stove top and it turned out an expensive tough, tasteless disappointment and a waste of time and effort. This recipe along with the cooking instructions changed that outcome for me. Thoroughly enjoyed making this dish and eating it. However, I did make some adjustments because I wanted to use what ingredients and vegetables I have available. Instead of turnips, I used the parsnips I had available and instead of red potatoes, I had golden yellow which I used instead of the red. This turned out very good, especially since I don't know how the taste would change. I know that parsnips are a sweet tasting root vegetable, while turnips a root vegetable too, are not as sweet and are mildly peppery, to me. I believe red potatoes are suppose to be less starchy than the golden yellow. The golden yellow potatoes did not cook apart following the recipe as it stands. Thanks for sharing."

Of course, the Stout must be taste tested before going into the pot. Red wine, another variation. Beef stock is good also. I add mushrooms with the carrots towards the end. More garlic and extra onions."

I never covered the roast with water, just put in 1-2 cups, covered it and cooked it on extremely low heat for several hours (3-4). You do have to check occasionally to be sure it doesn't go dry, adding water as needed. Toward the end I remove the roast and vegetables and thicken the sauce. Excellent recipe!!!"

I found this recipe, and followed a lot of folks advice. I sear in canola oil, then added copped onions, S&amp;P, bay leaves, beef stock, onion soup mix ,soy sauce worceshire and even some gravy master and celery leaves ( always have them on hand) . Once the roast has cooked on a low temp for a few hours, like my mom, I take the meat out, continue to cook down the liquid. after the meat is cool enough to handle, I slice it, add it back and then add the veges. I just use potatoes and carrots at this point. Let if cook for another hour. Melt in your mouth."

One other thing is I like a little color on the veggies so I sear them in the oil with the meat and set them aside to add later back into the pot.\nI make variations of this recipe four ways: on the stove, in the oven, in the pressure cooker, and in the electric fry pan."

Instead of red onion I use small whole white onions and instead of turnips I use parsnips. Carrits of course. Also I use celery with the leafy parts. And sometimes I also add mushrooms. A bay leaf is a must. And lately I have been using rosemary as well. Then after roast is tender I take out the meat and veggies, place aside and make a slurry of flour, herbs and milk. Bring the liquid in the pot to a boil and slowly add the milk and flour mixture in, stirring constantly. Once it has reached desired constancy I replace the meat and veggies lower heat and cook for another half hour. Yummm"

I rarely use salt but did use Kosher salt and fresh pepper as a rub prior to browning along with rosemary and thyme (which I add to everything). This came out just perfectly. The gravy was great but tweaked a bit after cooking with sherry. My mother never used canned broth; water always seemed to do. And so water only worked great. Interesting additions in other comments and am likely to try those. Why not? Pot roast is a slow cooking process; patience always makes it a hit."

I seasoned it good with salt &amp; pepper and a spice blend called \"Greek Seasoning\" that we get at Walmart of all places! It has several other spices in it and we love it on roasts. I seared it in some canola oil for about 3 minutes on each side until it was nice and browned. Then I added 6 cups of beef broth (4 regular and 2 low sodium) and 2 cups water. I also added about 3/4 Cup of Sutter Home Cabernet, several shakes of Worchester sauce and a couple of good pours of Tamari (concentrated Soy sauce). Lastly, one packet of onion soup mix. Then one red onion chopped, two onions cut in half and then sliced, 3 stalks of celery (with leaves included), 8 peeled and quartered potatoes and 2 large bunches of fresh carrots, peeled and sliced in 3\" sections with the fat end cut in half. I added all the veggies right in with the broth because we like the flavor of the broth to penetrate the veggies. This was so delicious! And the best part is when we were done eating we just let the pot come to room temp and stuck the whole pot in the fridge! The next day we brought it out, heated it up and had another delicious meal without any additional pots to clean! After the 2nd meal we used the rest of the meat for BBQ beef sandwiches and the broth for French Onion Soup and it was wonderful!!! Nice way to get several great meals from one dish!"

I also added beef stock, molasses, worcestershire and extremely healthy \"splashes\" of red wine. I used a great deal of sea salt and fresh cracked pepper to season the roast. Then, I chose to use 3 tbsp of olive oil and put a really hard sear on the beef so that all those yummy juices were sealed in. I added the onion to the oil and cooked for about 4-5 minutes, then the garlic for about 2 minutes, so some nice carmelization could add texture and depth of flavor. I used about 3 parts beef stock to 1 part water until I covered the roast, and then added some Worcestershire and a good dose of red wine (I used a Zinfandel). Once it came to a boil and I reduced heat to a simmer, I also added 2 bay leaves and the stems from the fresh parsley that I add later in the recipe. When I added the potatoes, I doused the stew in wine again. And again when I added the carrots. Once I turned off the heat, I chopped up from some fresh Italian parsley and basil and added them, along with salt and pepper. Fresh herbs retain their flavor best if added at the end of cooking. Finally, I removed the roast and tore it into chunks, then I added it all back to the pot and cooked another 10 minutes just to really add to the tenderness of the beef. It was just so wonderful!! In fact, I found myself in there picking at the potatoes again and it's 7am! :)"

Added a splash of shiraz, a dash of worcestershire sauce, and about 2 tbsp of molasses at the same time as the stock. Also, I added the celery tops and thin bits (don't throw out the leaves - they are good seasoning in stews and roasts). When adding the potatoes, I also added a splash of soy sauce and about 1 tsp of tarragon flakes, and another tbsp of molasses. At the end of the line, about 5 minutes before removing from the heat, I added a good splash of shiraz and a very healthy grind of fresh black pepper. Don't put the pepper in too early as the recipe instructs, as you will cook the flavor out of it.\n\nI cooked this recipe with a lid half on, and had to add about 1 cup of water halfway through."
