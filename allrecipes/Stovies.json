Don't worry if the milk doesn't cover the potatoes (depends on how \"large\" the potatoes are)--it will cook down to a nice, thick consistency. Leftover slab corned beef would be an improvement over the canned or deli varieties."

Tastes fab- (more mushy potatoe and less soaked in gravy and meat than the other) I was surprised when I was introduced to stovies like this when I moved into Angus region. I got a bit addicted on ones like this I'd get from the butchers on my lunch break from school. Great with a splash o'gravy or brown sauce. Stop yer whingin and give them a go!"
