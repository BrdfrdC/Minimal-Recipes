I made a couple of substitutes such as using walnuts instead of almonds because that's what I had in hand. I also thought the smoothie was too \"dry\" to blend in our Magic Bullet and I was right. Try adding 1 cup of coconut water and a couple of ice cubes instead of what's recommended in the recipe."

Also since I used frozen strawberries I only used a little bit of ice. probably the best protein shake I ever had!! Delicious. Only thing was I don't think i added enough ice because it had a good consistency, but wasn't very cold/icy at all. But thats all my fault so no worries! Next time ill probably freeze the banana too so its nice and cold. Overall loved this recipe!! Will def be making again :)"

"reviewBody": "Although I had to modify the recipe, I enjoyed this! I need more protein in my diet and was told to try to supplement with smoothies. I'm also restricting my calories so I need to be careful what I add because they add up fast! I used: \n1 frozen banana, \n12 frozen strawberries (close to 1 cup)\n1/2 cup 1% milk (I also need more dairy) \n1/2 cup water \n1.5 scoops of Vanilla Whey Protein. \n \nThe frozen fruit eliminated the need for ice but adding a little more water kept it from becoming too thick to drink (it was still VERY thick) I would have added a few almonds if I had them, but it would have added quite a few calories. Healthy ones, but calories all the same. I used a Blendtec Blender (similar to what Jamba Juice uses) so it was able to handle all the frozen fruits just fine. Since I only had 1/2 the serving and it was a generous portion, it calculated out under 150 calories and about 10 grams of protein. I might add 2 full scoops next time for a little more protein for about another 20 calories...."

I use the vanilla whey protein from walmart called Body Fortress. This is delicious, I blend it for about a minute or two then poor it into a big cup with about 6 cubes of ice in it and a lid and just shake it around every couple minutes while sipping it after a heavy workout. Its light delicious and feels like a reward for a great workout, this felt just a bit too fruity for my taste."

I used frozen strawberries instead of ice but that was the only change I made...until it would not blend, then added 1/4c milk. It tasted passable at first, gooey though, but it was enough to give me a stomach ache halfway through. If this had been my first protein shake I would have been turned off of them forever. I'll never make it again. I think I'll stick to my peanut butter for protein in the strawberry banana mixture."

"reviewBody": "This is a great smoothie recipe! We like it better than the smoothie shop smoothies! I had to change the recipe because my hand blender could not handle the ingredients with so little liquid, but not because the recipe itself. I used vanilla soy milk and no protein powder, just to avoid overloading my blender. My blender crushed ice fine but I guess whole frozen strawberries are too much- unless I add more liquid or add strawberries one at a time to the other blended ingredients. I may be getting a new blender for this recipe. But the recipe is great. The flavor is great and I love that it is not just a sugar drink, it has protein and the whole almonds add great nutritional value, too. Who needs to pay extra for a supplement when you can drink your own \"whole foods\". Thank you for the recipe!"
