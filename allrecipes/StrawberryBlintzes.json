"reviewBody": "They were delicious! This is now my go-to cheese blintz recipe. My first crepe fell apart because I added too much melted butter to the pan and I didn't let it cook long enough. After I fixed my mistakes the crepes came out great. There are several tricks to keep the crepes in one piece. I used a long fish spatula to turn the crepes over. It gives the crepes more support. I used a 10 inch non-stick fry pan but a crepe pan is better to use. I used a small amount of melted butter in the pan for each crepe. I let my crepes cook on the first side long enough that parts of the cooking side of the crepe was browned. I loosened all the edges of the crepe with the spatula, gently shook the pan to loosen the crepe, then I put my spatula under the edge of the crepe and gently shook the pan a little so I could move my fish spatula under the crepe and gently flip it over to cook the other side of it and when it was done I used my fish spatula to help ease it off the fry pan and onto the plate."
