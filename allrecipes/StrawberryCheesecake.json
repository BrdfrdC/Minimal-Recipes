"reviewBody": "The recipe is fairly vague when it comes to cooking, and when you should pull the cheesecake out. Plus, I would add that you should put a cookie sheet underneath the Cheesecake in the oven, to catch any melted butter from the pan. Also, unless you have a convection oven, you need to turn the cake about every 10 minutes to ensure an even bake.\nWhen it comes to separating the cake from the spring-form pan, use a hot knife first, then go back for a second time and just run a plastic knife around the edge to be sure.\nAll things considered, it is a fairly good recipe."

I had never made a cheesecake so relied on the instructions completely for cooking time etc. I did use fresh strawberries because i was unable to find frozen sweetened strawberries. I just cut them up the day before/added sugar and then went ahead and froze them because didn't want to affect the puree if they were not frozen. This is not an overly sweet dessert (that is why my family loved it) if you want more sweetness you may add more sugar to the berries. We served the strawberry sauce on the side for dipping."

Just beautiful! I made it as is, but with fresh strawberries instead of frozen and it was perfect. I can’t believe anyone would reduce the cinnamon! The cheesecake itself is not that sweet, so I would not reduce anything. The cinnamon balances it out. Wonderful recipe and definitely a keeper!!!"

I got bored with making just a plain cheesecake, so I wondered if I could make something different. I followed the directions without any changes. After finishing it, there really wasn't much sauce left over. So next time I'm going to try and see what happens by not draining the strawberries."

I have a strawberry patch and it produces so many strawberries that I still have frozen berries in my freezer. Since they will be producing again soon, I'm trying to use up the frozen ones from last year. Everyone really loved this cheesecake. I gave the recipe to my daughter and she made it the next night, only with pineapple."

The only thing I change is that I add fresh strawberries, add half the cinnamon, and I use graham crackers and crush them myself because it’s cheaper than the boxed graham cracker crumbs. But I absolutely love this recipe, fairly easy to make and comes out perfect every time!\n*I have also experimented with using chocolate graham crackers as the crust, so delicious!"

I make sure my eggs and cream cheese are almost room temp and I let the batter sit for about thirty mins before I put it in. I have not used a waterbath for this recipe but I do let it cook for the suggested time then crack the door open and shut off the oven. I let it cool all the way until basically room temp, then let it cool in the fridge for about 6-8 hours. This really helps with no cracks. Awesome recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I'm sorry to say I did not enjoy this recipe! The utilization of sweetened condensed milk rather than sugar in the filling is what did this recipe in for me, I think. The flavor was bizarre for a cheesecake. Additionally, the strawberry sauce was in dire need of more sugar. I actually added a teaspoon or two of sugar, and it still wasn't enough. Maybe this recipe would be great for someone who doesn't like their \"sweets\" to be so sweet, or for someone who is trying to limit their sugar intake, but I can't see how it would satisfy the average person's desire for cheesecake."
