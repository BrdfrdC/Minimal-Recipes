Also, I used 2 oz of semi-sweet chocolate chips melted with the canola oil. After dipping the bottoms in the melted chocolate, I then dipped the bottoms in the graham cracker crumbs. This was not too labor-intensive and cheaper than buying prepped already. Thanks again!"

I think you can safely plan to use the whole quart box of berries with this recipe. Leftover cream cheese filling was a tasty treat for my husband. I used 2 squares of almond bark for the chocolate dip thinned with a teaspoon of coconut oil. It worked perfectly. omitted graham cracker crumbs. I’ll try those next time."

"reviewBody": "These were excellent! I had extra cream cheese icing and used it on slices of bananas then covered them in the left over melted chocolate (used Ghirardelli 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate chips - yummy!). I omitted the oil just because it's an extra step and an unnecessary ingredient (it's for a nice shine on the chocolate). I did not use graham crackers because I didn't have any on hand, but I'm sure that would make it delicious as well! Just because someone suggested it, and I had them on hand from another recipe, I put mint leaves on top to add to the glamour of this dessert and a nice pop of color. Thanks for the delicious, quick and elegant recipe!\n\nUpdate 7/4/17: I had a pint of large strawberries (about 20) so I halved the cream cheese/powdered sugar mix and I found that to be the right amount with minimal waste. This time I omitted the chocolate but added blueberries on top for a festive July 4th dessert."

I made this a little easier for myself, but this turned out so good, I have to share it for other busy ladies like me.\n\nI took 15 mini pre-made phyllo cups(rather than cutting into strawberries) and filled them with a small tablespoon sized scoop(I use it for cookie dough)of the cream cheese filling (rather than piping it). I then halved strawberries and placed a half on each cheesecake bite. Lastly, I sprinkled mini chocolate chips over them (rather than making a chocolate drizzle). This was pretty, yummy, and fast.

Used a wheat free, slightly sweetened cereal instead of graham crackers due to food allergies and it was still delicious! I also used milk chocolate to compensate for the fact that it's still a bit early for really sweet, flavorable strawberries. If the strawberries were better, I would have used semi-sweet as the recipe called for."

I also made some pot de creams (allrecipes.ultimatechocolatedessert) While the pot de cream took the #1 spot, these were close at #2. After dipping them in the chocolate, I drizzeled white chocolate over them. Looked beautiful and soooo many compliments. Most people don't know that strawberries are hollow once you get down under the stem. Lots of room for the cream cheese. Thanks so much for the great recipe idea. You helped make my dessert bar rock!"

"reviewBody": "These were simple yet tasty. One must really like cream cheese though to attempt this. It makes a lot of filling. After I hulled the strawberries, I didn't think I would be able to fit 8oz of the cream cheese mixture. I made 1/2 of it up, and still had a little leftover. I tried one with the chocolate and liked it better without. I thought it tasted more like candy with the chocolate and more like cheesecake with strawberries without it. I would consider making something like this for a party."

Hint: to stand strawberries up on serving dish cut tip off bottom. Also, sliced off top then used smallest Mellon ball tool to scoop out strawberry...paring knife was driving me nuts. Great recipe..thanks!"

Not only is this cute and creative, but if you love the taste of cheesecake without all the effort (and without all the calories), then this little dessert is for you! It's got cheesecake, strawberries, and chocolate - what more could you ask for in two bites? I made this for my husband for Valentine's day and they were a big hit especially when accompanied by a glass of champagne! Thanks Alex for a great recipe!"

I followed the recipe with no changes. Try them. You won't be disappointed. They will be great in spring and summer dishes too. Very festive. Thanks Alex! This is going to be a regular here. Its a winner for sure."

I added some cocoa powder to the cream cheese mixture to make it chocolate, just because I was in the mood, but followed the recipe otherwise, dipping it in the optional chocolate and decorating them w/ white chocolate drizzle and sprinkles. Of course I couldn't wait for dessert tonight to try them, so I tried one now and they are really, REALLY good! My strawberries were pretty small and not the best, but they still turned out great! Can't wait to make these w/ better ones. Thanks, Alex, for sharing this wonderful spin on choco. dipped strawberries! :)"

I made 6 huge strawberries with half a batch of the filling.I used Famous Amos Chocolate Chip Cookie crumbs instead of graham crackers and dark cocoa candy melts for dipping instead of chocolate with oil because thats what i had. I don't think my tweaks strayed from te intent of the recipe. The only thing I would change is I would add more confectioners sugar to the cream cheese because mine was a bit droopy. Thanks Alex for the yummy, versatile, easy recipe that's perfect for Valentines Day. :)"
