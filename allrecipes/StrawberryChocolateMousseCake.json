I wanted a thicker cream layer, it worked perfectly. None was left at the end of Christmas dinner."

Kinda felt bad for tossing out a whole pack of filling. Any ideas for substituting it with another cookie crumb base where i dont have to waste the filling? \n\nAlso i added a layer of marie tea biscuit crumb layer( crushed biscuit in melted butter ) and a layer of strawberries in between the mousse... that just made it sooo much better!\n\nMy friends tried it and told me that this was the best mouse cake they have ever had in their life! totally worth all the effort of whipping up the mousse from scratch."

The end result was bitter-sour-sweet. Not as good as I expected it and yet still good and very pretty. Next time I will use sweet strawberries and not as bitter chocolate. There will be a next time.\nThis was my first time making a cake like this and it was surprisingly easy. I was thought it might fall apart when I opened the pan so I lined it with a sheer plastic I bought at the baking shop. That held everything together.\""

I decided to gild the lily and piped a little chocolate syrup on the top before piping on the whipped cream and adding the strawberries. I also cut up some additional strawberries and mixed them with sugar for anyone who wanted to put that on their plate too. Everyone loved it and it's very rich. I would suggest adding a little more melted butter to the cookie crumbs since mine didn't hold together as much as I would have liked. I've been wanting to try this for years and I'm glad I finally had the opportunity to try it."

So, I made again this time with the brownie crust (Hershey's chocolate chunk brownie mix) and milk chocolate chips. The brownie crust is the clear winner, and while the milk chocolate chips did taste better, it's still not right. Like other reviewers stated...it is in fact grainy and lacking in flavor. I will try this again with a different mousse recipe."

I made a dunkin hines brownie crust on the bottom of the pans (I used one cake box to fill the bottom of 1x 8x8 square pan and one very large round spring-form pan) in order to keep the crust thin nd not to take away from the mousse, but not have it too thick. I used frozen strawberries - as it is not the season for fresh strawberries (and i made this recipe on a whim so didnt have them in the house...) I thought the mouse tasted a bit grainy. I prefer \"Polly Welby's Excellent Chocolate Mousse\" from this site which is quite similar to this mousse recipe, but less ingredients/less steps. I will make this again - but with the mousse recipe I prefer."

You must have spent all day on this.\" I usually make this the day before I serve it because it does take time to set. I've made this twice. Once with the cookie crust and once with a brownie crust. It was awesome both ways. I'm thinking of trying this with peanut butter chips and maybe a nutter-butter crust for a peanut butter version of the same dessert."

I, personally, thought the mousse was slightly on the bitter side and would be better with milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. The strawberries offset this some. I'll try milk chocolate or maybe white chocolate next time. I skipped the blender step as someone recommended and just poured the water/syrup mixture over the choc chips in a bowl - worked out fine. Oh, I also used the brownie crust as another reviewer mentioned. Was fabulous!"

My family loved it, so it's probably just my personal preference for more fruit than chocolate. It was easy to make but looked like it took a long time to put together. I did use a pre-made chocolate cookie pie crust since I don't have a Springform pan. If you decide to go with the pie crust too, you could absolutely cut the chocolate mousse ingredients by half and still have enough. My pie was overflowing with the mousse, and I didn't even use all that the recipe had called for. I couldn't put the lid back on the pie."

Not having had too many chocolate-mousse-type desserts before, I didn't know exactly what to expect. I found it was very, very rich. Too rich and too chocolate-y for me. That could partially be because I only had 1/2 cup regular chocolate morsels and had to use semi-sweet dark chocolate morsels for the rest. I just thought it was too much of all the same flavor and same consistency in this dessert."

Wow this was good but very sweet, it could be that I used mini chocolate chips but I don't think that it why. There is one step that I would do without though, and that is there really is no need for the blender. All you really need to do is put the chips in a bowl and pour the hot ixture over it to melt. This is how you do it to make a ganache. I wastes alot of chocolate as i couldn't get it all out of the blender. I would make it again but with less chocolate or even maybe try it with white chocolate hmmmm that sounds good"

Pre-baked the crust (so it would not get soggy), used high quality chocolate chips and melted them in the same pan as the syrup without heat. I also omitted the strawberries (since they are not in season). Please DO NOT use store bought whipped topping, take the time to make your own it really makes all the difference. Try this simple masterpiece and your guests will think you slaved over it (But it’s really easy). Thanks Eleanor for a superb recipe!"

The chocolate crust is well worth the effort. I didn't make any changes in the ingredients but to save a step I added the chocolate chips to the warm corn syrup mixture and stirred until smooth instead of running it through the blender.

It presented nicely with the ring of strawberries around it, and the homemade whipped cream set it off perfectly, not being too sweet, but full of real cream flavor.
