I usually add vanilla or almond extract depending on the berries I use because the dough just tastes like sugar without it and have also made this in a more lower sugar/carb version by replacing half the flour and sugar with almond flour and monkfruit &amp; xylitol sweetener and it came out really well. Definitely a summer favorite."

I did half with the cream cheese and the other half without and I would say you should definitely add some sugar to the cream cheese b/c it was just kind of odd to bite into tart cream cheese every once in a while. I doubled it and put it in a 9x13 with only 6 Tbs. of butter, didn't measure the strawberries since I had a ton and just generously sprinkled them over the top."

"reviewBody": "I read many of the comments on here and mixed and matched into my version: A minimum of 3 cups of strawberries. Cream the cream cheese (8 oz), add two teaspoons of vanilla and a couple of tablespoons sugar. After the cream cheese is creamed, stir in the strawberries. Then pour the mixture into the pan after the crust mixture goes in. I also added a couple of tablespoons of sugar to the strawberries while I mixed the crust. The amount of sugar in the crust can be reduced, but I didn't. Bake for 35 minutes at 350. Very creamy and smooth. I like creamy fruit pies. This turned out excellent. This is the second time I have made this pie, but the first time with the changes."

I used a smaller, higher baking dish. So I layered it, melted butter, batter, strawberries, cream cheese followed by batter, strawberries and cream cheese. It was more than sweet and buttery enough. I might even cut the sugar down further Next time - the strawberries were so sweet. It was super easy and delicious."

Would also work well with low glycemic sugars. New family favorite!"

I used 6 oz of cream cheese and really, the only thing I added differently was a crumble topping (I love crumble on everything.) I actually forgot to add the salt and it was still delicious. The ONLY thing I would do differently, is to whip the cream cheese with a tad of added sweetener and pipe it on evenly so that every bite has sweetened cream cheese, strawberry and crumble."

I saw a lot of reviews saying people halved the amount of butter and the dish was bland, but in my family we do not cut back on butter ?? and I dont recommend it with this dish anyway because not only does it keep from sticking to the pan, but as the batter bakes, the bread absorbs the butter and a lot of its flavor comes from that! (I use salted butter).\nIt's not really fair to call this a \"cobbler\", because it's honestly more like a buttery delicious strawberry cream cheese shortcake. Serve it with some whipped cream and it'll be gone in the blink of an eye"

"reviewBody": "Having grown up on a farm in Alabama where there were numerous peach trees and blackberry patches, I am very familiar with cobblers made with those two fruits. When I saw this recipe made with strawberries and cream cheese, I had to try it. WOW! It was delicious, and I will definitely make it again. It would be a great dessert for company with a dollop of Blue Bell vanilla. I took the advice of others and increased the the sugar, flour, and milk mixture. I used whipping cream instead of milk. I added a tablespoon of vanilla, I added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. All this was in addition to increasing the flour/sugar/baking powder mixture. In addition, I doubled the strawberries which I had cut into 1/4 as they were very big. Because I am a single person, I froze about 1/2 of the desert and will see how that works once thawed."

Great with vanilla ice cream and would also work well with cherries or any other berry."
