I also like that really the only flavour is the gelatin, so you can easily make this into flavours other than strawberry.\n\nI would caution you to eat it quickly, as the cottage cheese tends to water down as cottage cheese does. But even a week later it was still very good - just be to sure to stir it altogether again!"

Then letting that mixture cool to room temp before adding cottage cheese and cool whip. You don't want to refrigerate the pineapple/jello mixture to cool because it will set up quickly."

The second time -I only used 1 (3oz) box of jello. It was not as sweet and also used lowfat cottage cheese and light whipped cream. Liked the taste ALOT better by changing it up a bit made it a little lighter in fat and calories--which I like alot. I made it as a light cold dessert on a hot summer night. If you do not like cottage cheese by itself --you will not like this. I liked this one much better than the buttermilk salad."

I am definitely in the \"camp\" where you just add the dry gelatin to the cottage cheese and mix it in...honestly I don't understand why some people make the Jello first? It seems to me that you would then have unpleasant little chunks of Jello in your \"fIuff\". Anyway, I am adding this to my permanent recipe collection :)"

I did this after reading the reviews After several claimed it was too sweet. I personally do not think cottage cheese sounded like a good fit. Took the suggestion of another reviewer with the marshmallows. Turned out really good. Light fluffy and defiantly not too sweet."

I really liked it then, as did my daughter, so I decided to try this as dessert for Thanksgiving this year, since we aren't fans of pumpkin pie. I agree with the previous reviewer who stated that the gelatin doesn't fully dissolve. While it's still very good and I'll probably attempt again, as it's a healthier dessert option, the presentation could've been slightly better in my opinion. No sacrifice on taste however; if you don't mind the red flecks of gelatin."

My twist - refrigerate the pineapple until cold; make the jello using 1 cup boiling water, let it cool for about 10 minutes, then blend it and the cottage cheese in the blender until smooth. Pour the jello mixture in with the pineapple, combine and fold in the whipped topping, refrigerate until cold. This also makes a great pie, just change up the flavors and fruits and pour into a graham cracker crust."

"reviewBody": "I made this for my husband because I am not allowed to eat fruit. He wanted to use Orange Jell-O. He really liked this. It was funny to watch him eat it cause he was trying to do his homework at the same time. He'd take a bit set it down, try to study but not even a second later he'd pick it back up and eat more, he couldn't stop eating it. I tried some and picked around the pineapple, and it really is delicious. I might make one for me and omit the pineapple and double up on the cottage cheese. This would be a fantasitc dish for a party. Thank you so much."

Made it for a family party last night, and there is none left -the kids especially loved this! Will try again with strawberry/fresh strawberries, and other fruits and SF Jello flavors this summer too. GREAT recipe, although a little sweet for my taste."
