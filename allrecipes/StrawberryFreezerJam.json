If it does I have a few cousins that will be excited. Right now we are in the waiting to put in the freezer part of this recipe so I can only comment on how it tasted before going into the freezer. SO far so good. I did only use 3 cups of sugar based on the reviews that I was reading. I did notice that not all the sugar broke down so there is a little bit of a granular texture we will see how that is after the 24 hour set time. Hope I get to leave this at 5 starts."

"reviewBody": "Really good and easy. Initially I tasted it once the pectin was added and thought it was too sweet, but once it's setup over 24 hours the sweetness settled down, melded with the strawberries and made a real good strawberry jam.\n\nBe sure to measure all ingredients exactly, and be sure to full boil the pectin for the full minute, whisk it well the entire time. It setup perfectly and has a great jel, nice and firm.\n\nSince I made a double batch, once I poured it into pints, I then took a few pints aside and added a few SMALL dashes (and I mean SMALL) of Ghost Pepper powder (Sonoran Spice Company on Amazon, it's outstanding!) and mixed it in. It is SOOO GOOOOD!! Just enough to add a nice little burn to it, try it it's amazing! The sweet strawberry and heat of the ghost pepper compliment each other beautifully.\n\nGreat recipe, super easy. Thanks again!"

Bought whole frozen berries and decided that instead of cooked, canned jam I wanted to try freezer jam instead - the flavor is SO much fresher tasting!! I'm so glad I went this route. I smooshed and measured my berries while still partially frozen then proceeded to follow the recipe. Dollar Store containers were perfect. I ended up with about 5 1/4 cups per batch. So easy, tastes amazing and I will never go back to my old canned jam methods!! YUM!!"

My only problem is the amount of sugar! I didnt realize there was a sugar free pectin available. Next batch will for sure be the sugar free version."

"reviewBody": "Cut the sugar in half and this jam is great. I make freezer jam every year and use instant pectin, but this year I couldn't find it at the store so I looked up how to make it with regular pectin. The recipes either called for way too much sugar - like this one - or cooking the strawberries, which I don't want to do. I did what another reviewer suggested and strained some of the liquid off of the strawberries after mashing. Then I measured out 1 3/4 oz of Ball pectin from the big jar by weight to be sure. Initially I added 3 cups of sugar to 2 cups of strawberries, and my kids tasted it and even they said \"way too sweet\". So I then adjusted the strawberry to sugar ratio to 1:1. It set better than my freezer jam ever has before - I will now use this method every year."

For my second attempt, I went with 2 cups mashed strawberries, 2/3 cup sugar and 2 Tbsp Ball brand Realfruit Instant Pectin for each 2 pints (2 - 8oz containers) of freezer jam. I will say that the consistency was more like apple butter, but I'm thinking this will be wonderful in the middle of a Minnesota winter. No cooking or boiling needed. I added 1/3 cup more berries."

Handy, since I buy a ton of strawberries of all different shapes and sizes. This jam turns out yummy almost always. A previous review was incorrect about saying the recipe calls for twice as much sugar as the boxed directions. It is the same proportion sice crushing strawberries cuts their measured volume in half."

"reviewBody": "After reading tons of reviews on this jam, I have this to add:\n1 - If you use RIPE strawberries (no white or green on the berries), then your jam will naturally be extra sweet. If you don't like the extra sweetness, use the pink pectin box and follow the directions for low sugar (4 c. crushed berries with 3 c. sugar). When I used berries that had a little white and green on them, 4 c. sugar was needed. The lady at the strawberry farm told me berries with a little green/white on them actually help jam set up (and I believe her). \n2 - I like crushing the berries with a potato masher best. I think the chunkiness adds to making it a jam! (And you can use it for other things like smoothies and over ice cream.) \n3 - If your berries seem too runny after crushing, drain off most of the extra liquid before adding the pectin to the berries. This really makes the jam set up and seems to evenly distribute the berries throughout the jam. I like it thicker!\n4 - Boiling the pectin/water mixture for 1 minute and then adding to the berries and stirring again for 3 minutes also seems to aid in the jam setting up with no sugary crystals. My jam seems to set up in less than 30 minutes.\n5 - Since this is not the cooked method, I recommend letting the jam cool and then immediately refrigerating/freezing. I left a jar out once and forgot to give it to a friend. Two days later, I opened it and it didn't smell bad but had a metallic taste, so taste can be affected. I HOPE THIS HELPS EVERYONE!"

A 2lb container of strawberries comes out to about 2 cups mashed for anyone's who's curious. I also bought some low sugar pectin to make blueberry freezer jam, using the instructions inside, and it's worth noting that most of the low sugar pectin jams use more the fruit than regulars (in the case of strawberry jam, 4 cups instead of two). It may vary from brand to brand- I was using Certo, but save yourself an extra trip to the store by making sure you have enough!"

This recipe is identical to the one in the leaflet that comes inside the Sure-Jell Regular box. The only change is that when you pout the boiled water/pectin mixture into the berries, you are supposed to stir the mixture for 3 minutes, not just let it sit like this recipe says."

Then read the recipe...FOUR cups of sugar, OMG, that's enough sugar for 10x the amount of berries being used LOL. I used one cup of sugar and could have used about 1/2 cup. Wow is it sweet. But, the kicker is this...I had no idea what 1.75 oz was and used far too little pectin. My guess was 1 1/2 tsp, well I now know I should have been about 3+ tbsp. So, my preserves did jell but surely not enough. They taste wonderful though and I'll try it again after all this is gone. I loved trying it out, it was fun."
