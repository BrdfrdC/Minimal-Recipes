I will tackle making again and not even cook the crust. Or other suggestions from you. Have not made this in many years so a complete novice thanks for your help."

"reviewBody": "This was soooo easy and everyone loved it!! I did make one change ONLY because I thought it wouldn't be strawberry flavored enough when I was mixing it up. I sprinkled about half a package of strawberry Kool-Aid in it and mixed it up real good. It gave it the pink color and I suppose a little boost of flavor. I may not have needed it, but since it was the first time and I didn't get to read others reviews, I tried it."

"reviewBody": "This pie was AMAZINGLY good. SO easy to make. I used frozen strawberries and crushed them and used fresh sliced strawberries as well. I will definitely make it again as is and using different flavors for different people.\n\nUPDATE: I made this again for my husbands b-day but I made in chocolate. I used 8oz of whipped cream cheese to make it easier to blend. Instead of strawberries I used fudge syrup, mixed in white chocolate chips, Spanish peanuts and chopped up Snickers. Then added more chopped Snickers and cherries on the top. SO GOOD!!! (And still easy.)"
