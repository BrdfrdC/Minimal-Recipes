Someone recommend that to avoid soggy crust. The one without cream cheese was not soggy. The cream cheese mixture was hard to spread, maybe it didn't have enough sugar. To do over I'd make the morning of or 4 hours before serving. Made my own crust with graham's. Definitely will try with peaches."

This is a quick and easy recipe. It takes longer to clean, hull, and slice the strawberries than it does to make the glaze and put it together. I did find that this barely fits in the 10\" (2 extra servings size) pie crust so I don't know how it could all fit in a 9\" crust without cutting back to 5 cups of sliced strawberries."

I read the reviews and thought about modifying it so it wasn't too sweet, but didn't and there are no left-overs. Bummer!! I'll be making another one in the next week. YUM!!!"

I quartered the strawberries and the family raved about how good it was. The hubby thought I should have had more glaze or moisture, so next time I will use three boxes of sugar free jello and a little more water. It wasn't too sweet and didn't taste like a healthy version at all...I might just make the filling in a bowl and serve with cool whip for a potluck or something."

Used graham cracker crust I recipe from this site. Had to make it two nights in a row because the demand was so great from my family. Can't wait to try it with peaches."

"reviewBody": "This pie didn't last long in my house but even so, the next time I make it I'll tweak it a bit. I'm going to use less sugar next time. I had some plain vanilla cookies that I wanted to use up so I made a crust with them using the same method as for a basic graham cracker crust except without adding more sugar. Result was very good. Used the trick of chilling the pie crust before brushing with egg yolk. That worked well. This pie has great eye appeal. The colour is amazing. With strawberries fresh from the garden, what could make a better dessert in early summer?"

After pouring strawberry filling into crust I stuck it in the freezer instead of the fridge for a while to set up cuz i get impatient. Served the pie with cool whip.

The glaze doesn't taste like Jello at all, and it's much tastier than the gluey red stuff that you buy at the grocery to use for strawberry glaze. Excellent recipe and very easy! Next time, I plan to use my own pre-baked pie shell, simply because I'm not a big fan of graham crackers. I bet this would also be good with one of those chocolate cookie pie crusts."

I mounded them high in my pie crust. It was the perfect amount. I was surprised that it did not taste like Jello. Was better than Marie Callendar's who's pie crusts usually taste freezer-burnt. Now I can make my own! thanks Karin! I have impressed many so far :)"
