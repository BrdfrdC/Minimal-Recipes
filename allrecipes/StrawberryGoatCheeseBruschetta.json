"reviewBody": "I made this dish for a finger food party. Everyone liked it. I took a short cut since I was making a lot of dishes. Instead of boiling down the balsamic vinegar I purchased \"Balsamic Glaze\". It is a bit expensive but a huge time saver. Also, instead of mixing the vinegar in with the strawberries I just drizzled it on top which made for a nice presentation. I am not a huge fan of thyme which is probably why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Next time I'll try the basil which others have recommended."

Taste before mixing with strawberries.\n- Use another spreadable cheese with the goat cheese; goat cheese itself was too rich so I paired with an artichoke spreadable cheese\n- leave cheese and strawberries out at room temperature 1/2 - 1 hr before serving\n- goat cheese is often mixed with herbs so no need to have thyme"

Added two tablespoons of milk to smooth out the goat cheese. When I spooned the rich, balsamic infused strawberries over each crostini, I added a single blueberry- hence creating a gorgeous red, white and blue appetizer! It was the hit of our July 4th party!"

My husband really liked it!\n\nTwo things: reducing the vinegar didn't actually make it any thicker, so I don't bother heating it anymore. Also, I think this would be improved b adding a tsp of sugar or honey to the balsamic if you have out of season strawberries that aren't all that sweet."

One of the guests reluctantly tried it unsure of strawberries on a bruschetta, and she raved about the simplicity of ingredients, and complexity of flavors, additionally, very appreciative of such a delightful vegaterian option! \"surprisingly delightfully delicious!\" I made a couple of minor tweaks - I used cranberry baguette brushed with olive oil toasted under the broiler (both sides), and substituted basil instead of thyme. This dish is minimal effort, huge payoff!"

Since saving it to my recipe box I've made this 5-6 times already exactly as described. I served this to my husband on date night and he raved about it. I also served this at a dinner party and guest were asking for more. Delicious!!! Will be making this over &amp; over again. Thank you chef John:)"

Everyone at the dinner loved it, even one person who HATES balsamic vinegar!!!"
