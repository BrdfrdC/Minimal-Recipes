I don't have a powerful blender, but 1/2 a cup of oatmeal turned out to be just fine (if you blend the milk and oatmeal first, you shouldn't have a problem with graininess --or just blend the oatmeal into a powder before you add the other stuff). I tossed in a handful of spinach and used vanilla protein powder instead of vanilla and sugar, since it was a post-workout smoothie, and it tasted amazing."

It was absolutely delicious, but I ruined it with protein powder. Starting to realize i just hate that stuff."

My fiance &amp; 10 year old daughter love it, my 4 year old son said it was really good but he didn't want his own this morning, he just wanted some pieces of the bananas &amp; strawberries but he did say next time he will have the smoothie!! I am definitely going to make it again! I did use vanilla soymilk instead of original &amp; I had to add a little more to thin it out a little bit because the oats made it very thick. I also cut up a little bit of banana &amp; strawberries &amp; placed them on top of some whip cream!!! Next time I plan on using some Chobani Vanilla Oatmilk because that is one of my favorites &amp; I think it will be very good to!!! I definitely recommend this to whoever hasn't tried it because it really is amazing!"

Second, I blended the oats with the water before adding the other ingredients. That way, it was really ground and blended better with everything else. I added the fruit and vanilla, a large spoonful of Greek yogurt, and sugar to taste, about 3 tablespoons. I blended that thing like crazy at the end and it was very good, My husband liked it too. I know people hate it when a poster changes a recipe and then rates it, but I just had to share. And of course, you can use whatever fruit you like!"

I did as other reviewers suggested &amp; blended the oatmeal before adding the other ingredients to break them up. Once you do that, nobody can tell that oatmeal is in the drink. I did not have rolled oats so used old fashioned oats. My smoothie came out very thick, I had to add more soymilk to make it drinkable, maybe because my strawberries were big. It was good, I probably will make again."

I didn’t have strawberries, so I used blueberries, and I don’t drink soy milk so I used coconut, other than that the first time I made it I did it pretty in line with the recipe, the second I took out the banana and added 1TBS of cocoa powder. I also halved the recipe the second time since it makes enough for two smoothies."

After tasting, I added a pint of blueberries and half a pint of raspberries, and 1/2 cup frozen pineapple. I also added 2-3 tsp of honey. It was absolutely delicious and very filling. Definitely a meal replacement. Kids loved it! Will make this again for sure."
