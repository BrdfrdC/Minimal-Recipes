I also used kiwi and pineapple in addition to the strawberries. The meringue needed 2 hours not 1.25 to bake completely.\nAbsolutely delicious, a real hit at potlucks."

I did make a change from whipped cream for my lactose intolerants, by taking 0% fat, lactose free, Greek Yoghurt, using about 1/4 c of powdered sugar and the 2 tbsp of Cointreau. Got great raves on this."

It doesn't keep very well, so if don't have enough people to eat the entire thing in one sitting, I make a bunch of small meringue bowls instead of one big one. I keep the small bowls in the oven (for days) until we get through them all. Mini-pavlovas! MMMMMM!!!"
