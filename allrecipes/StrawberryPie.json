We will probably juice 1/2 of the strawberries and add cornstarch mixture to the boiling juice instead. Great flavor. Some of our berries were not quite ripe. We tweaked this recipe by adding 2 T. of strawberry jam to the boiling mixture. We also used only 1/2 of the sugar and are sure glad we did that. Even so, we ended up putting about a tablespoon of lemon juice into the hot mash to cut the sweet a bit. I did save this recipe, but quite a few tweaks will make it to our taste."

This was not a good idea for the gf crust as it only made it harder. I would not recommend this for a dense gf crust on any pie but I‚Äôm sure it is delicious on a light, flakey traditional crust."

"reviewBody": "I made this pie as a Mother's Day dessert and it was a big hit. A couple notes... I used two quarts of strawberries overall (1.5 directly in the pie itself, .5 for the glaze). I pureed the strawberries for the glaze rather than mash them. My glaze cooked up more pink than red, so I added a couple drops of food coloring to better match the color of the whole berries. it also came out thicker than I'd expected (more inclined to sit atop the berries than fill between them), so I'll probably step back the cornstarch a bit next time. As soon as the pie shell was done, I turned the oven off, poured about two ounces of chocolate chips into the shell, and left it in the oven for about 90 seconds longer; I then used a spatula to smooth the softened chips into a chocolate coating. The flavor was amazing (a tad sweeter than expected; I might step back the sugar a bit too next time). Really excellent summer pie."

So I modified it I did half cornstarch and half Pectin (Liquid or Powder will work) it also cut down on the boiling time and the clarifying time. Also it is much easier to put all your strawberries into a big bowl and add the mixture to them and mix them in the big bowl and then place into your prepared piecrust."

The answer is rather vague - 1.5 to 2.3 lbs = 1 quart. Well 2 lbs is too much! Although I simmered and stirred the corn starch and mashed strawberry mixture for 10 + minutes - and it thickened a lot - it was not enough to firm up so the pie was a sloppy mess. Also I think you need very ripe soft strawberries to mash them. Will try again with less strawberries because it was very tasty!"

Unfortunately, December isn't strawberry season, so I didn't get really great strawberries to work with. \n\n I didn't add to the recipe per se, but I did not mash the strawberries. I cut them into teeny tiny pieces, and it made the filling just a little more meaty and thick. What I didn't like about it was it didn't have that clear glaze look like Marie Callanders or Polly's Pies, so I put the topping strawberries on after I put the filling in the pie, and then put a little bit of the filling on top. Next time I might just make a clear glaze for it!"

Will make again. 07-02-20 Update: I made this again and only mashing 1/4 of the strawberries and slicing the other 3/4 strawberries in half. I used 1/2 cup water instead of 3/4 cup for the cornstarch mixture. My strawberries thickened immediately and I pureed the mixture using an immersion blender. Makes a better presentation."

I made it first as written then with reviewer recommended alterations the next time and thereafter and I prefer the version with alterations (use only 1/4 of the berries for the sauce and 3/4 c sugar). I use the \"Graham Cracker Crust I\" recipe on this site for my crust. I'm surprised I have seen other reviews mention using a graham cracker crust. It pairs wonderfully and it comes together so much faster and easier than pastry."

I did use my own pie crust recipe so that‚Äôs on me. An I really should have mashed the strawberries more, again on me. If you‚Äôre a bit arthritic like me use a blender to pur√©e the berries you‚Äôre using for the filling . The added extra step will make you filling nice and smooth. I was blessed with local super sweet strawberry‚Äôs so I should have cut back on the sugar, but nah it was still awesome."

I substituted Xantham gum for corn starch because thats all I had and it turned out fine. Instead of leaving the raw berries in the pie shell I decided to mix them together with the jam in order to make a more uniform filling before pouring everything into the pie."

"reviewBody": "My mother-in-law, Ivy,, made awesome strawberry pies all summer long. As a busy young mom, I sadly just enjoyed them and never got the recipe. With gorgeous berries in season, I suddenly longed for one. This turned out fine for my first ever try. In watching the video, I decided not to put whole berries in first, or to mash the beautiful berries. I used about 1 1/2 qts of berries and after rinsing drying and hulling, set the biggest ones aside. they seemed just too enormously to put in whole. I sliced in half and set aside. The others I sliced for the filling. One thing I do know is that as some other reviewers mentioned, she spread cream cheese on the baked crust and never had a soggy one. She‚Äôd love the idea of using chocolate and I will try that next. The sliced berries in the filling looked great, then I set the the half berries flat side down and used a gel glaze on the top. The edges of my crust we a little messy, but I submitted the photo without the aerosol whipped cream edging I later added. The frozen crust I purchased really wasn‚Äôt thick enough to hold up to the luscious filling. On the plates it looked more like strawberry cobbler, but even so, it was gobbled up quickly and got raves. I will absolutely make again but use the refrigerated roll out crust as it is thicker. I might us the cream cheese on the chocolate layer."

Threw everything in a pot and brought it to a boil till it thickened and the juices were clear, about 3-5 minutes. DELICIOUS! Used a gluten free crust that was the BEST PIE CRUST I EVER MADE. It is in allrecipes under gluten free piecrust It only has 5 reviews and is easy to find, you could substitute regular flour and it would work great."
