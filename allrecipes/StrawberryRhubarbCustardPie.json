I also put an upside down foil pie plate over the pie half way through the baking time to aid in baking the fruit. I baked it for the recommended time. It turned out great!"

The crust was perfect, the custard set, and I didn't miss the strawberries at all, although I have to try it with strawberries next time. I also used margarine instead of butter because I was out. So it's as if I was deliberately trying to destroy the recipe, but I couldn't. It's a couple simple extra steps for the custard vs a regular fruit pie, but it's worth it. And to Chef John, in case you read the reviews: I love your videos! I'll never forget to tap-a tap-a, shake-a shake-a :) Thanks for another great recipe."

I also had used a larger deep dish pie pan so I added an additional 1 cup of rhubarb. Would have added more berry but was out. This took about 1 hour and 15 minutes for some reason in my convection oven but sometimes I don't believe my oven is working correctly but I am noting this for myself for future reference. I used raspberry jam with water for the glaze as it was all I had and I knew it would work. I will make this again for sure. Used the pie crust recipe on the Crisco box as I was low on butter and it was flaky and browned up nice and I have another crust to use for other things. Loved this!"

The custard IS really sweet but everything else is so tart and buttery that I found it a perfect balance (and I generally don't like things too sweet). Cook time was a a bit longer, but that's custard for you! My one complaint was after I refrigerated it the condensation from the cling wrap dripped down and made it look totally gross (user error here?). But once I got it in the bowl it didn't matter at all and it was SO good. I think this would be wonderful with an crumble topper or cherries instead of strawberry rhubarb. 10/10 will make again!"

Very easy! \nThe tapping is important to keep the custard from pooling in one spot and not cooking completely and the turning. \n I did not tap and am not sure if I did a full turn - all but one section settled (about one piece) and that is all I can think could cause it. Every morsel was devoured by 5 grownups...and left them wanting more! \nIf you use frozen berries or frozen rhubarb you MUST defrost and drain...or add extra flour, It will not set up otherwise."

I thought that maybe this was the reason that it needed to be refrigerated (which I did for several hours), but that did not help either, as when I cut into the pie it was incredibly runny. The custard was also way too sweet. An okay foundation for a recipe, but if I made it again I would probably use a different custard recipe, as the one provided in this recipe just wasted ingredients and time on my end."

I was pleased to find this almost identical recipe with the addition of the strawberries. For those who found it to be runny, my original recipe called for 1/4 cup flour. That is what I used even with the strawberries, and it turned out perfectly. It was a big hit at my community happy hour tonight."

I was so embarrassed. I had even put it in a pastry box. I made the recipe exactly as written and consider myself a very experienced baker having even worked as a baker in my twenties- in my mother's and grandmother's footsteps. It was way too sweet, and I had to bake it an additional 35 minutes. Just a waste. Reputation ruined. I just wanted to take it back and throw it in the trash but she was so gracious and appreciated the effort. If you must make this, decrease sugar to 1 cup and increase flour by a tbl or 2."

So even though it still jiggled a little bit, I figured it was done. It exceeded my expectations! Perfect balance of tart to sweet to creamy. I didn't cut the rhubarb smaller, just thawed a bag of chopped frozen stuff &amp; tossed it in with the strawberries. I will DEFINITELY be mashing this again!"
