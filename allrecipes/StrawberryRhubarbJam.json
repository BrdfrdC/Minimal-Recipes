I used 2 packs of pectin, 3 cups of sugar and 1 large lemon (I zested the lemon and put that in the jam along with the juice of the lemon. THIS jam is the reason I froze rhubarb. OMG it is amazing. I am a jam specialist. So far this year I made the following jams: Apple Butter; Bannana; Blackberry; Blueberry; Cherry; Grape; a combo of blackberry raspberry strawberry and blueberry, Blueberry, Nectarine, Peach, Raspberry, Raspberry Rhubarb, Strawberry Rhubarb and now Cherry Rhubarb. I still need to make jams using Apples, Pears, Plums and Tomatoe. Let me know any of your recipes and I will happily make and rate them. Thank you for sharing this recipe and for anyone who shares their recipes with me in the future. I come from a large family so I make these jams to give as gifts at Christmas (too many young families don't carry on the tradition of canning or preserving). I also sell my jams throughout the year--A girl can't live on Social Security alone."

I found in spite of 10 cups of Sugar (I used cane sugar) the finished product was just tart enough that you knew it wasn't just Strawberry Jam! I did as Carla and hit the finished product with 2 dashes of Cinnamon and 1 dash of Cloves. Next time I am going to hit it with a Tbsp of Rum or a good Liquor as I think that rounds out the nice tart taste!"

To salvage, I added four more cups of rhubarb and used a slotted spoon to pack jars so I could avoid putting in too much of that awful syrupy stuff. What a waste of time. I should have just cooked fruit with about 3 cups of sugar and called it a day. That's what I usually do."
