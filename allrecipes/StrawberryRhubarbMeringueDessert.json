I added a little extra sugar to the shortbread crust because I knew they would like it to be a little more like a cookie. Not much, about one more tablespoon. I don’t know if you can go wrong with this desert!"

Other than the numerous times I have made it using the original recipe, I have also used whole wheat and or almond flour, or a combination of all three (whatever I have on hand) for the bottom crust. The sugar in the bottom crust as well can be light brown, dark brown or white. A sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg also adds something to the flavor. A little bit of vanilla and nutmeg spices up the custard and the flavoring for the meringue can be whatever you like. my personal favorites are almond or strawberry."

I did find that I had to cook it much longer than the recipe states until it looked like it was bubbling and starting to set. From then on, absolutely fabulous!"

Combine graham cracker crumbs and sugar in a bowl. Add melted butter and mix with fork. Transfer to 9x13 pan, spread out and press down gently with a spatula. Bake at 375 for 10 minutes.)\n\nFriends enjoyed this dessert and asked for the recipe. I would definitely make it again."

DD made a couple of fatal mistakes the first time around, so had to make a second batch. They brought dinner to my hospital room. Although the taste was wonderful, this dessert was a little too sweet for my taste. The rest of the family (fourteen of them) loved it."
