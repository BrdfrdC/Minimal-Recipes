"reviewBody": "Excellent and quick salad. We have started making it regularly. As others have noted, sugar should be cut down unless this is your substitute for a brownie. Same with olive oil. 1/3 cup is perhaps sufficient. Using this as a base recipe, we have tried different toppings (cucumbers peeled and diced, roasted pumpkin seeds and other nuts, red onions etc). They all come out good. You can mix the produce and nuts and add dressing when ready to eat and it can be reused over a couple of days. Packs well for lunch if made in the morning."

The video simply used them for a garnish. I made this both ways. The sesame seed in the dressing was WAY too much. A sprinkle on the top is nice. I avoid sugar so I used a powdered Bocha Sweet or powdered Swerve sweetener. The powder mixes better for this than the granular . If you donâ€™t have strawberries raspberries or blueberries are good in this too."

I made more dressing than needed (only needed salad for 2), the remainder went into disposable condiment containers for salads for lunches."

"reviewBody": "I leave out the poppies and sesame seeds bc they get stuck in my teeth, less ingredients to buy and they donâ€™t change the overall taste of the dressing. A very small amount of sesame oil would work too IMHO. I also used about 1/3 c sugar to see if it would make a big difference and it was still great. We didnâ€™t have fresh strawberries so we used fresh tomatoes. My 10 yr old son gets sick of salads and he made 2 tonight! We added some chicken as well."

The dressing on this is amazing - chilling it per the recipe is key to mixing the flavors. Husband loved it too and he's not a sweet salad guy. Thanks for submitting!"

Added bacon and feta, which definitely gave it more complexity.\nI only used 1/4 cup of sugar in the dressing, and it was still too sweet for my taste, but it was very well received at the potluck I took it to."

Have started adding feta cheese and diced chicken to make as a nice summer meal with deviled eggs on the side. \nMy time saving way of making this is by warming vinegar in a jar to help dissolve the sugar. Grate the onion with a cheese grater for less cleanup, mix dressing by shaking in the jar, and then can easily store leftover w/o dirtying another dish.\nThank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!"

And the spinach gives a healthy chew. Such a well-rounded salad."
