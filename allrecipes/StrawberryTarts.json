Sliced strawberries are spooned in and more apple glaze is poured on. The tarts are chilled and served with a dollop of whipped cream."

Next time I will let them defrost in my colander over a bowl and use a bit of their juice in the glaze too! This is my first stab at tarts and this recipe was great to use. I will make my own lil modifications next time around! Thanks for this!"
