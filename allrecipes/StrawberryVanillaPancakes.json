"reviewBody": "These pancakes do taste delicious, I felt like several changes were needed though. For dietary reasons I used half oat flour, I cut down the sugar to 1 Tbsp - sugar in pancakes is mostly for color so you don't need much, I used about 3/4 cup milk in part because I was using frozen strawberries, and didn't want to add too much liquid. I defrosted 1 cup of strawberries, and mashed them. I also cut the vanilla down to 2 tsp, and it still tasted distinctly of vanilla. The batter was still pretty thin - on the thinner side of normal pancake batter, but as promised, they puffed up nicely when cooked, after letting the batter sit for a few minutes."

About half way through the batter I added a little more flour and ended up burning most of the rest. A commenter said to let the batter rest (I didn't know this) so I will do that next time. I will also spread out the middle so the middle will cook better. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. It's really good! Never had brown sugar in pancakes before."

I added the strawberries to the mix at the end so they weren't too soggy when I ate the pancakes. I thought the recipe wouldn't make very many, but it made 5 average- to large-sized pancakes, which was perfect for me and my husband (no need for leftovers). Definitely saving this recipe."

It was perfect, while I was cooking it the smell was super delicious. \nI give this recipe 5 stars. \nI didn't change a thing, I just shift the flower twice. I set the batter aside for like 15 mins before I start pouring it in the hot pan. The only thing I did was I sweeten the strawberries with 1/2 cup sugar to bring out it's natural juice. Then I add that juice to my pancake batter, because of that the flavor was little stronger which my sister liked it a lot. \nOver all very successful recipe, loved it, can't wait to make is again."

I upped the brown sugar to 3T and dropped the vanilla a bit to 1.5T, and sifted the flour. I didn't find the batter to be extremely runny, like some other reviewers, but letting it sit for a few minutes before adding to the pan is crucial. Also, I chopped up the strawberries and let them sit on a paper towel, to let any excess liquid soak off, until I was just about ready to use the batter, and then mixed them in. Try these-- you won't regret it! Thanks for a great pancake recipe! =)"

I made mostly as written, 2TBSP vanilla was no problem, yes it was rather thin, but as most said, it fluffed right up. My only hiccup - when it was time to put in the vegetable oil, oops, I don't have any, no canola either.....ummmmm...ok, well I added one TBSP of melted butter (didn't want to do two, just in case it really screwed up the recipe)....no problem, tasted great as stated earlier."

I cut the cup of all purpose flour in half and added 1/2 cup if whole wheat flour. I also used almond extract instead of vanilla. My taste buds prefer the almond extract with strawberries over the vanilla. Waaaaay too much salt. I put in the teaspoon of salt but it was overpowering, so the next time I make these, I will cut it down by half."

It was nice a fluffy, and it was gooey and nice juicy on the inside filled with strawberries. I had to add a little more flour because the batter was a little runny, but once it got thickened up, it was great and easy to make. You can also make changes to this recipe and instead of adding strawberries, you can add a different fruit, like blueberries. I even tried it plain! It tasted like a nice sweet vanilla pancake. I definitely hope you try this recipe out, because it's a really great one!"

"reviewBody": "One reviewer said the egg is not included in the direction-but it is. I agree with that reviewer that the batter was VERY watery; however, since these are called Vanilla pancakes, using less vanilla extract really doesn't seem to be the logical answer. Adding more flour, however, does. I added a whole cup of flour, making it 2 cups total. I also opted to use cake flour, something I picked up from a different pancake recipe. Do not over whisk pancakes. That is kind of the first cardinal rule. It is difficult to know if you over whisked, but if batter is slightly lumpy, you probably didn't. If upon flipping the pancakes, the rise slightly, you will know they are light and fluffy! I thought the recipe overall was great! One of the tastier recipes I have found, with minimal tweeks."

Next time I'm going to try it with almond flour and almond milk but the original is definitely wonderful. 2 T of vanilla sounded like a lot but turned out to be just perfect. I also made a topping by cooking down sliced strawberries, a touch of maple syrup and a tiny bit of water. Thanks so much for sharing!"

The 2 TBS of vanilla was excessive to me not because it was too much vanilla flavor but because you end up tasting the alcohol of the extract since it's so heavy. I'd cut back on that a bit next time, but otherwise fine as is. They'd also be fine with 1/2 all-purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat."

I don't like cooked strawberries, so we sliced them and used them as a topping."
