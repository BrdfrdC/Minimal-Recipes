I prefer the Oreo cookie crust. I also used strawberry gelatin powder in the filling. This helped it firm up and also gave it a better flavor and color. I never froze it but did leave it overnight in the fridge to set. I saw several comments on here that said they were having trouble with it setting up and trouble taking it in and out of the freezer to thaw. I see no reason for that. This was a good start to a recipe though."

Knowing when to cut into it, both for ease of cutting and eating, was a little tricky. Mine was in the freezer overnight and I let it thaw for about 1 hour before serving, and could have gone longer."

"reviewBody": "I have been making this pie since the '70's when one of my co-workers brought it to work. It is so refreshing and delicious, especially on a hot summer day. I have never frozen it- just put it in the fridge for a couple of hours and it sets up nicely. I also don't add the extra whip cream on top- I just use an 8 oz. tub of cool whip mixed with 2-8 oz. tubs of yogurt. This is such a fun recipe because you can really use your imagination to change it up. Any flavor of yogurt or combination of fresh fruit (or no fruit it you don't have it) works well. You can also used a chocolate graham cracker crust with shaved chocolate on top-yum! It is just as good with the low fat Cool Whip and low or no-fat yogurt, so can be made a little healthier depending on your crowd."

I made this recipe as listed, however I blended in all of the whip cream and it was simply delicious. Initially, I? let the pie sit at room temperature to soften up a bit before cutting into it. Once cutting it, I cut the entire pie in slices and this made it easier to serve any leftover slices at a later time."

I really don't think this pie really even needs to be frozen at all. Next time I will just make the filling, fill the pie shell and keep it in the fridge instead of the freezer. Has a fluffy texture that way instead of being hard as a bullet when frozen."

Yes, I eat it for breakfast too. First, it's got 4 ingredients and it takes 10 minutes to prepare - love. Everyone always loves this pie, even people like my family who normally turn their noses up at Cool Whip. I find that the crust does get mushy on about the third day in the fridge but I haven't had problems with sogginess before that."

"reviewBody": "Can't really rate this accurately yet because I have not eaten it yet...I did taste it and it's delicious, that's not the problem. The problem is that this pie absolutely has to go into the freezer. I have it now in the fridge for over 10 hours and I can put a spoon right to the bottom of it...it's like mush. So no way (using 8 oz. yogurt cups and cool whip, does this gel..it just does not happen, it might taste great, but it is like mush, absolutely MUST go into freezer to set.) Problem with that is that when I made this about a year ago (this is only my second try) I did put it into the freezer...and the whole thing crystallized, then when it started to thaw, it was all wet from the ice crystals."

There werent any fresh strawberries at the local market, so I went for frozen unsweetend mixed berries instead. On top of the yogurt+whipped topping mix, I added another layered of sliced bananas then piled on the rest of the berries. I sprinkled some coconut flakes on top at the end. Freezed for a hour, then in the fridge for another. Tastes amazing!"

I made this and stored it in the freezer for a few days before we ate it. This recipe is so versatile, you could use all combinations of flavors."

I stirred them together, topped it with sliced fresh strawberries, and let it set overnight in the fridge.....Hardly and liquid, and utterly delicious!!!!"

"reviewBody": "This is a definite go-to dessert for summer. The ingredients are simple, and the possibilities are endless! I did modify the recipe though. I used five, 100g yogurt cups instead of the two packs of 8oz. The flavours I chose were strawberry chantilly (X3) and raspberry-cranberry crumble (X2). I also used sliced bananas (three) instead of strawberries; I drenched some in lemon juice for the topping to avoid browning. I found the base recipe makes enough filling for two pies, but since I only had one crust I saved the rest for another dessert. I also skipped the whip[ped topping on the top of the pie as there was aready enough in it. Next time I will incorporate some coconut into this, as I think it would compliment this pie nicely."
