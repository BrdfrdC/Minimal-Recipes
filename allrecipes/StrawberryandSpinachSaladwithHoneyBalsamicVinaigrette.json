The red strawberries against the green spinach was eye appealing.I was out of pecans but will definitely add either pecans or walnuts next time.

If I made it again I would use goat cheese. Also the honey was a dominant flavor, which could be the brand of honey I used. So, next time I will taste test the dressing as I add the honey to the vinaigrette. Definitely toast the pecans. This was so quick and easy I will serve it for a weeknight meal, but I have had better strawberry salads which I prefer for guests."

"reviewBody": "Yum! This is my kinda summer dinner idea - very easy, no actual cooking and delicious. I had it just like this as a main course, and that works for me, but a side of grilled chicken, or topping the salad with grilled chicken would be great too. I made it almost exactly written, but used walnuts instead of pecans (they're just so much cheaper, and the walnuts do go very well with gorgonzola), and I used more balsamic than called for; I prefer a more even ratio of oil and vinegar for salad dressing, though not exactly the same amount of each. I might have been just a touch too heavy handed with the balsamic; the bites of salad including sweet strawberries were perfect, but bites without strawberries were a little too vinegary. Anyway, this is very good. Easy to customize, yes, but there's not much of a need. These ingredients make a great salad."

Only thing I changed was to roast the pecans, as another reviewer suggested, I added a bit of thinly sliced red onion rings as well and substituted Goat cheese for the Gorgonzola. Next time I am going to top with a grilled chicken breast and call it dinner. Both my partner and I loved it! Thanks for the great recipe."

I add a little orange rind to it and/or orange juice. And white wine vinegar. If u are short of time, raspberry vinagarette also works well. Health, and simple!"
