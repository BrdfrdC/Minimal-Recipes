So I tried this and it was just as amazing as I remember her cookies years ago! I used more apricot preserves, 2 - 12 oz cans. It’s a fancy cookie that tastes as good as they look! It’s worth the time to make these!"

The pineapple helps with the tartness of the apricot. I tried blueberry as well as a strawberry version but we like the apricot/ pineapple best."
