"reviewBody": "I understand vegetable protein for vegans but actually u don't need it for who is not vegan. It should be used chopped onions (cooked in olive oil before adding the ingredients) and dill as well as parsley. I put dried blackcurrant and just a bit cinnamon for the zest as well. For saucepan cooking 1 onion chopped in olive oil until it gets golden color then add washed and clean rice and add a bit hot water it should be half cooked. after that u can add veggies and dried blackcurrant and 1 spoon of tomato puree as well as spices(thyme,mint,blackpepper,salt)(don't cook rice with blackcurrant it will change the color). then u can fill the peppers with the mixture (can cover with tomato or pepper again) put in the saucepan and add a bit water mixed with tomato puree again (will be more delicious).Shud be cooked simmer. max 30 min. It shud be eaten cold cos it is with olive oil and doesn't include mince meat. When you serve it you can add some yoghurt-garlic mix on the top of it if u not vegan. I am a mediterranean person and giving you original recipe. I am not using any measure cos I am doing automatically but wanted to give you an idea. By the way when u choosing peppers in the shop look at the bottom and buy flat ones cos they need to stand when they cooking. Secondly, don't fill the peppers until its full leave 1 cm space in case of swollen rice. Hope this helps!!"

I added a bit of cumin and cayenne pepper when sautéing the veggies, I also added some crushed garlic. Like others, I used brown rice instead of white. I mixed in cheese in the mix as well as putting it on top at the very end. I also mixed in tomato sauce (I used spaghetti sauce). It was very good. Very filling and very rich, will probably just make half next time for my family of two."

However, 1 cup,worked fine. After learning that the cup measure is for liquids, I weigh most of my ingredients. So, on my kitchen scale 1 cup of TVP weighed 3 oz. I also mixed 1 cup shredded cheese into the mixture, and I will sprinkle some on top after baking. I like this recipe for days when I don't want a heavier protein like meat."

I used a wild rice blend. I was quite hungry and thought the peppers looked pretty cooked at 22 min. so I put some cheese (soy cheese for hubby and I) on, turned the oven off and let it set in the warm oven for several minutes. The peppers turned out to be a bit crispy still which didn't bother me, but I'm guessing they could've used some more cook time. This is a keeper."
