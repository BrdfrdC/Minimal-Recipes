I'm not particularly fond of this dish but my family ended up and had many compliments!"

He was surprised that he liked it because he doesn't like meat all that much. I gave it three stars because I felt like it was missing something. I think if you added ketchup or salsa in the meat mix it would be pretty good. And maybe using Mexican rice too. I also added garlic powder which I recommend. I didn't freeze the cabbage, I just steamed it for a few minutes on the stove and it worked just fine. Other comments suggested serving with mashed potatoes, which I'm not sure I agree with... it doesn't seem like the two dishes would go well together. Maybe with rice on the side, even though there's rice in the meat mix. Anyway, didn't knock our socks off but I think with a few alterations this recipe is a keeper. Thanks!"

Since the cabbage is plain I think the meat needs to have much more kick. Next time I'm going to double up on the seasoning and add onion soup to the stuffing and make the rice with bouillon. Hopefully that will make it more flavorful."

Use 1/3 g beef, 1/3 g veal and 1/3 g pork. Cook your rice only half-done so that it easily absorbs juices from the meats. Add a can of fireroasted diced tomatoes to the soup mix. After the cabbage rolls are lined up and ready to bake, sprinkle with salt and pepper. Try adding sauerkraut over the top before poring on the tomato sauce. Traditional cabbage rolls always age a day before they're cooked/served. This recipe prolongs the enjoyment even longer!"

I also added garlic and thawed, squeesed cut frozen spinach. I tried using instant brown rice in lieu of the cooked rice, added two cans of tomato soup - and it all worked. Delicious and you can freeze left overs."

It works well and doesn't take as long as freezing and defrosting a whole cabbage. Just remove some of the core, stick the whole head in a bowl with a bit of water, cover it, then cook as you might a head of cauliflower. Depending on the size of the cabbage, it can take 8-10 minutes. I flipped it over halfway through. Let it cool &amp; remove the leaves. I have also substituted ground turkey for the beef with great results."

I always core the cabbage and boil it first. I also use 1 pound ground beef and 1 pound ground pork, 2 eggs, parsley, and a bit of garlic powder. I also use tomato sauce mixed with a bit of leftover cabbage water instead of tomato soup. I baked it the oven for 2 &amp; 1/2 hours. This is always best served with mashed potatoes."

"reviewBody": "I adore stuffed cabbage!!! I have never heard of freezing the cabbage, I will try that next time. I get tired of burning my fingers when I peel off the leaves during the boiling process. To the person who gets gas, (tee hee, me too) I use \"Beano\" first. I doubt it makes a difference in THAT department if you blanch the cabbage or freeze it. Cabbage is a roughage, made to cause gas, if you ask me!! I have never made these with tomato soup. I love to use the hot V-8 juice with mashed up canned tomatoes. I have never cooked anything without garlic, so of course I added that too. Other than that, these are my stuffed cabbage rolls!! Super recipe. I also like to do the same with green peppers!!! Stuff them with all the same stuff, and hot V-8 and mashed tomatoes. Yum yum!!!! Thanks so much."

"reviewBody": "The reason i'm even giving this recipe 3 stars is because, at no fault of the person who submitted this, at the advise of someone who previously reviewed this recipe, I did not cook the rice first. Big mistake! It was like eating raw rice. (My fault). But with that aside. The cabbage turned out still somewhat crunchy and also a bit dry even after basting about every 10 min. The meat was also very dry. I used lean ground sirloin. Not sure if that would make a difference. Also bland for my taste. In addition to salt and pepper, I also used garlic salt and a dash of worchester sauce in the meat. Very disappointed. I love cabbage rolls and was so looking forward to making my own for the first time. With the good ratings thought I couldn't go wrong. Won't be making these again."

The only thing I did differently was instead of using the soup, I mixed a can of tomato sauce with a 1/4 cup of brown sugar and a 1/4 of cider vinegar (you can also use a 1/4 of lemon juice if you prefer but I like the cider vinegar.) Pour over rolls and continue with the orig recipe. I also make extra sauce and boil it down until it thickens and add that over the cooked rolls."

I made the stuffing as the recipe stated and found it too bland. Next time I will add garlic powder and will use uncooked rice. The rice will cook in the oven."

"reviewBody": "This is just like the recipe I remember as a kid! Very good taste, and I loved the freezing the head of cabbage idea, however make sure you have enough time to thaw it before cooking--mine took about 9 hours. So, you may be better off steaming if you are in a time crunch. The only difference I made in the recipe was not cooking the rice. As stated before, it cooks in the oven, so there isn't any need. I also used tooth picks on some of my rolls b/c teh ones with smaller leaves started unrolling a bit. And, like the others, I used a family size can of tomato soup b/c I wanted extra sauce for the white rice side dish. Will make again, but next time will check them more frequently in the oven because mine got done slightly quicker."

"reviewBody": "stuffed cabbage is a great idea, but after freezing the head of letuce, i found that it was not nearly soft enough to wrap the meat/rice mixture around. it works much better if you boil the cabbage leaves, fill them and then stew the stuffed cabbage on the stove top. also it helps to mix up the meat using box beef and pork and add fried onion to the mixture. this recipe can definately be tweeked."

I also cut the rice down and used UNCOOKED rice; it bakes itself in the oven. Freezing the cabbage is the coolest tip I've found on this website. So easy to make. Too cool!!!! Thank you :)"

Only variation I made the second time was that I used the family size can of tomato soup and poured over to basically submerge the cabbage rolls. I also added 3 tablespoons of soup to meat mixture and a clove of garlic to add a little more taste."
