Smoke them at 180 degrees for 30 minutes and then increase the heat to 350 degrees for another 30 minutes. Some of the moisture will evaporate and you will have chewy greatness. Also, the slight crust along the stuffing will make you eat these over and over again!!!"

I'll make this again but might try substituting paprika for the Cayenne for a more smokey flavor. the reason I gave this 4 stars instead of five is because the filling makes a lot more than will fit into 12 mushroom caps. I ended up using every mushroom in the 16 oz container which made 32 mushrooms and still had filling leftover. I might try halving the cream cheese and seasonings next time. will def make again"

I followed the recipe except I forgot the onion powder, I used 5 oz of cream cheese, and I crushed up one strip of bacon and sprinkled a pinch on the bottom of the cup before filling with cheese mixture, and another pinch on top of the cheese mixture. Also, I took someone else's advice and piped the cheese into each cap to pack it in. I baked for 10 minutes, and broiled on hi for 6 minutes. Perfectly done. Yum!!! I can't wait to make this again."

"reviewBody": "Saut√© onion or scallion and then garlic cloves in butter along with the stems - also chopped spinach, roasted or chopped red pepper... Add some bacon, sausage, crab, prosciutto or pepperoni bits. Or change the cheese to cheddar and add chopped crab meat. Add a few drops of sriracha/hot sauce for extra spice. For more colour: maybe chives, paprika or parsley on top. Cut the corner off a Ziploc bag and squeeze filling into caps. Panko on top plus shredded Parm for extra kick. Bake on a broiler pan so they don't sit in juice - less soggy and less mess."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe and I have had a few times. Decided to try on my own. I made a few changes, saut√©ed a Jimmy Dean sausage roll and chopped up and cooled completely as step one, to be added to the mix before putting in the mushrooms. Also, used fresh grated Parmesan versus the dry bottled stuff. Lastly, I love when these are super creamy, so instead of regular bar Philly Cream Cheese I used the 8 oz. whipped container. They were AMAZING and due to the added ingredients made about 20 mushrooms versus 14."

"reviewBody": "I was looking for a keto friendly recipe and this fit the bill. I had a big container of baby portobellos to use and the amount of cream cheese mixture was perfect. I used cheddar, mozzarella and parmesan. I also poured some dry red wine over the tops and so they were sitting in a little bit of wine. They soaked up the flavor. I broiled them for about five minutes at the end and the top had a nice crunch without the use of breadcrumbs. These were dinner along with a salad. The leftovers heated up nicely in the microwave for lunch the next day. I could eat them daily!"

Unlike other stuffed mushroom recipes with spinach, peppers, crab..., this one delivers a clean mushroom taste with a hint of garlic.\nThe amount of the cream cheese sounded like alot for 12 mushrooms ( mine were medium size)\nSo I cut it by half and I had plenty of stuffing for all the mushrooms.\nMy Mushrooms were little watery though, maybe next time,raising the oven temperature little bit, would prevent that."
