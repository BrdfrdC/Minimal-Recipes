"reviewBody": "This was a good recipe, my family really liked it. I normally make exactly the first time trying a new recipie, but this time I had to add a 1lb of sausage to have enough filling for the eggplants. I did find however, the eggplant shell did not get done enough to eat it entirely. Still good though, adding the sausage gave me enough filling to cook a two small stuffed green bell peppers, which my husband loved (he refused to eat the stuffed eggplant) after he loved it, I told him it had eggplant in the stuffing, he still said \"Well I liked it and would defiantly eat it again\". (stuffed in the bell pepper of coarse) BTW made Chef Johns Tomato Sauce recipe for the sauce, time consuming, but totally worth the effort!"

I think the best thing I did after I scooped out the egg plant, I striped the skin, sprayed a little olive oil spray on both sides and baked it for 30 minutes. This way you can eat the whole thing and it’s fork tender"

I also used some bulk hot Italian sausage to give it some oomph. The sausage wasn't a great idea because it was tough.\n\nOverall this was a good recipe, but a bit more time consuming than I like. It tasted really good after I picked the sausage out! There was a bit of sausage flavor left though, which I liked. The eggplant (and skins) were nice &amp; soft. I enjoyed eating the skins!\n\nNot sure if I will make again, but will keep it in my saved recipes, just the same."

I thought 8 to 10 minutes as suggested seemed too long. I was wrong. I zapped an additional 4 minutes and next time will go for the full 10 minutes; otherwise the eggplant is too rubbery if you want to eat the whole thing. Used real parmesan cheese and mozzarella and also added a diced orange pepper. I also added diced sausage for my meat eaters but I thought it was great without and don't think I'll add it at all next time. Thanks!"

But this is not it. We could not eat more than a few bites, then we discarded the rest. Seemed unusually bitter. I am not very familiar with cooking with eggplant, so perhaps the eggplant was bitter.

My only complaint with this recipe is I think is the temperature of the oven. You either have to cook your eggplant for a longer period of time in the pan until it is soft or raise the oven temperature. I followed the recipe exactly and after 30 minutes my eggplant was not near done and still hard. After looking at a pile of other recipes I noted that they all required the oven temperature to be 375. That seemed more reasonable."

I did not boil the eggplant first, so gives it a little more toughness as opposed to nuking it. My neighbors love it. Everyone loves it except my wife who does not care for eggplant. Her loss. Have not tried with mushrooms, but will add that in today. I was also thinking of adding Feta cheese to the mix and maybe a little bit of spinach."

"reviewBody": "The receipe was amazing! I also made it for my Mom who had never had eggplant (and she didn't think she would) and she LOVED it. Very wholesome..and if you are watching what you eat, this certainly makes you feel like you are cheating- but @ about 370 cal each, 1 of them is PLENTY to fill you up! We had one each (so we only made 2 servings) and served it with a side salad of mostly green veggies.. it was amazing.\nI did not change the recipe at all. It seemed like a ton of bread crumbs when I was adding them, but did not seem that way at all once cooked.\nYou can skip the Parsley though- it is just for garnish mainly and I bought a huge pakc of it (only way it's sold at my local grocery) for 1 teaspoon. \nI used fresh parmesan cheese. We plan to make this for dinner again, and again, and again!"

I microwaved my eggplants for 5 minutes before cutting them open to make the scooping easier. I sauteed 1lb of Italian Seasoned Ground Turkey with my onion and garlic until brown, and then cooked in my eggplant until it was soft. My cousin was over for dinner and insisted on having the recipe to take with him. This will be going on my rotation! Delicious and healthy."

"reviewBody": "Very yummy! I only had 1 eggplant, so I added 1/4 cup red bell pepper, 1/4 cup green bell pepper, and 1 diced tomato, which was a delicious addition! I also opened the casing to turkey sausage, browned it, and added it to the stuffing, but would not recommend adding any meat, or else it will compete with the other flavors. I didn't have tomato sauce or mozzarella cheese, so I used spaghetti sauce &amp; cheddar cheese, which I also don't recommend. I would cut down on the Parmesan cheese a bit and make sure to use freshly grated, rather than packaged. I had to add 10 minutes to the cooking time, which probably varies depending on the oven &amp; elevation. All the produce I used was locally grown, which made this meal extra yummy! Fairly quick and very easy!"

For the tomato sauce I used one can of sauce and one can of paste to cut down on the sodium, at first I thought I had too much but when it was cooked it was just fine. I also added 2 sausages, it was very good, without the extra filling I don't think the eggplant mixture would have been enough to stuff four shells. It ended up being in the oven for 45 minutes and the shells were soft enough to eat. Served with couscous."

Then I let them drain on papertowels to help get rid of moisture. Dabbing them as much as possible is also helpful. When they bake, they release a lot of water which can make the entire dish very watery and soggy, hard to get out so try to drain as much as possibe. I put Monguni's spagetti sauce (don't put a lot)on mine and fresh mozzerella. Turned out wonderful!!"

I drew the conclusion that I just need to get used to the taste of eggplant ;) I salted it, as suggested, for a long time (about 45 mins) but it was still pretty bitter. I used plenty of salt but maybe I just needed to use more. As well, I disliked the pasta sauce I used so that really contributed to my distaste. But, honestly, I will probably make this again, but with a pasta sauce that I enjoy."
