I chopped and sauted the bell pepper and the onion with the ground beef and then followed the rest of the recipe. I poured the cooked ingredients into a sprayed casserole dish and added more cheddar cheese to the top. I then baked it for 20-30 minutes until the the cheese was bubbly and started to brown. (350 degrees) I will be making this regularly. My picky-eater husband loved it!"

I used Rao’s Tomato Basil Soup instead of a regular can of tomato soup. I poured it directly from the jar over the peppers without diluting. I added extra cheddar cheese on top of the peppers and then baked. I would suggest playing with the baking time. 30 minutes at 350 degrees didn’t seem long enough."

Instead of celery I took the tops of the peppers and reserved the good parts, chopped them up and probably had 1 cup of green pepper to add to the meat and onions. Flavors are a little bland so to add a little pizzaz to the flavor, my son suggested adding taco seasoning to the meat next time. Will do! But very savory comfort food!"

I kind of liked The tomato soup topping but over that is where I added the extra cheese. By the time I got finished it was just right!"

Placed the previously sliced top of each pepper as the \"lid\" and served! They looked great and the extra shredded cheese on top under the lid was an extra bonus! Start with this recipe and make all the changes as your taste buds dictate!"

I halved a mixture of multicolored and green peppers - cooked my jasmine rice separately in beef broth - added just a bit of sharp cheddar cheese on the inside of the peppers, then put in the filling, then put cheddar and Parmesan on top. Cheddar was in the filling as well. I used double Worcestershire, oregano, basil and Italian seasonings. Nom nom!"

I filled the peppers halfway, added tomato sauce, filled the rest of the way and added the rest of the tomato sauce. Some people couldn’t understand why you wouldn’t use a can of diced tomatoes vs whole peeled tomatoes, I think because whole tomatoes chopped have a lot more juice so the rice can soak up"

The only minor differences I made were: (1) I used fire-roasted diced tomatoes with garlic instead of whole tomatoes and then cutting them up and (2) I had to add a cup more of water (making it 1-1/2 cups) to have enough liquid to cook the rice with the ground meat. ( I'm wondering if the 1/2 cup is a misprint. ) The mixture was moist and the rice was just shy of being done before I spooned it into the peppers. Also, though the recipe said it would stuff 6 bell peppers, I was only able to fill 5 but mine were pretty big so maybe that was the difference. This is a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!"

I mixed my tomato sauce with black pepper and fresh dill. although I think these could really use a lime or lemon flavor. my dad who grew up eating these told me there was too too much tomato sauce and I have to agree. I'm not sure topping them off with the sauce at the last step is the best idea either."

It was sooooooooo good!\n\nThe only difference was I didn’t drain the hamburger fat. I used 87% lean hamburger and wanted the fat in it. I know, I know.....”fat isn’t good for you, blah, blah, blah.” \n\nI’m good with eating lean most of the time, but with this recipe I wanted the fat because it adds so much flavor. It was excellent and I have no regrets. \n\nThis recipe is a keeper."

This is a standard measurement and I knew better and had to add the additional 1/2 C. as rice was burning/sticking to bottom. I would use 2lbs hamburger next time and double tomatoes. There wasn’t enough filling to fill 6 peppers. After water bath and 30 min in oven, peppers were still crisp. Need longer cooking. I would add garlic/onion powder next time too. This is a basic cabbage roll recipe as well."

To get six you need to have peppers on the smaller side. I did make one change out of laziness. Instead of the tomato soup, I just put ketsup on top and it was very good. This is a KEEPER!"
