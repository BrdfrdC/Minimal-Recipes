Something a little bigger would have been ideal so the pepper could fit all the way to the bottom, but I didn't have anything else. It worked though. It also helped to keep the peppers shaped like a cup after they were plated. Thanks for the recipe!"

I use it as a 'base' recipe because there are a few key changes I make now that I love and wanted to share as an option. \n\nWhen the rice is cooking and the peppers are roasting, I start cooking 1lb of ground chicken, turkey or pork to a frying pan. When the meat is starting to brown but not cooked through, I add the green onions w spices, along with 2 chopped carrots, 1 chopped zucchini and 3 large chopped mushrooms (approximately; veggies are often whatever I have in the fridge). When the carrots are tender but not soft, I add the tomatoes and continue from there. This usually makes WAY more filling than the peppers can hold, but it's so good on its own, or as a filling for wraps, etc, and it also freezes well. \n\nThanks for a great recipe!"

It was a big hit with the family and my stepson scarfed down all the leftovers. This one is going into my recipe vault. \n\nI did make a couple minor modifications. As stated I used Yellow peppers cause that is what I had on hand. I used Herb de Provence instead of Italian seasoning, but they are somewhat similar (again what I had). I used fresh basil because I had some leftover."
