"reviewBody": "As written, four stars.. but.. using the same ingredients in a different order, it turned out amazing! I used 97%fat free turkey and onions, green pepper, zucchini, and spinach as the vegetables. I heavily seasoned the turkey while browning it with crushed garlic, italian seasoning salt and pepper. Let that sit. In another skillet, cook all the veggies in a little olive oil with more garlic and salt and pepper. After 5 min, added fresh diced tomato. Added the turkey in. Cooked it all together for another 10 min. while the green peppers were finishing cooking in the oven. I had large peppers and pre-cooked them wrapped in foil for 30 min. which was the perfect amount of time to chop and cook the filling! I took the peppers out, stuffed them with the filling and threw them back in the oven for 30 min. I halved them and sprinkled white cheddar cheese on each one and microwaved for 30 seconds. They were insanely perfect! It was juicy and flavorful! I will definitely make these again!"

Added about 3 teaspoons of the tomato paste, it could've used more. Also, added some cooked rice and topped with sharp shredded cheddar. Overall the design of the original recipe is great and I loved it. I followed everything else to the T. I will make again and add more seasoning."

"reviewBody": "I sprayed the pan with cooking spray and pre-baked the peppers covered with foil for 40 min. I used two pounds ground beef and was generous with the Italian seasoning and garlic powder. I tossed in a couple teaspoons of dried parsley as this helps blend the flavors. I used two skillets, one for beef and onions, one for other veggies. After stuffing peppers, I poured a can of tomato sauce in the pan before baking for 45-60 minutes. I baked longer because we don’t like crunchy bell pepper. It takes about this long to soften the pepper. Another reviewer suggested using a crock pot, 2 hours on high, then 2 hours on low. I’ll definitely try that next time as I wouldn’t have to precook the peppers or watch the oven! Everyone who eats these absolutely loves them. I also read that you can freeze these and have a ready meal from the oven on a busy night (haven’t tried it yet)."

Baking the peppers yielded them too firm/raw for our needs so I boiled them a bit like I do for beef/rice stuffed peppers. I added much more seasoning than that specified. The final product was dry, dry, dry. Too bad I didn't read the reviews first but I think adding marinara sauce to bake them would help a lot. Not a keeper; I'll stick to the beef &amp; rice version."

My hisband and I thought they were okay but rather bland tasting. Also, the pepper stayed crunchy even after baking the recipe’s 30 minutes plus an additional 15 minutes. Next time I think I would mix in some grated cheese or somthing else to give the stuffing more flavor."

"reviewBody": "I was looking for a basic Keto friendly recipe for stuffed peppers and came across this one. Used zucchini and bell peppers from the garden, a volunteer puff ball mushroom from the yard, a hand full of basil from the herb garden, an onion, a sprinkle of chili powder and another of ground cumin (to disguise the ground beef flavor; didn't have any ground turkey). Added some awesome fresh tomato marinara from this website. I stuffed the whole peppers really tight, laid them flat in a pan and poached them. Served with grated cheddar over top. Great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This was a great recipe! I was surprised just how much of a punch of flavor this packed overall. I was liberal in my use of the garlic powder and Italian seasoning but didn’t make any additions in terms of spices. I opted to use a variety of cherry tomatoes that I had on hand instead of the recommended can of diced tomatoes. I also added 3 diced jalapeños (seeds and all) to give it a kick. I topped the peppers with manchego cheese for the last 15 minutes of baking since I enjoy a cheese element to stuff peppers. They turned out great! My wife who wasn’t especially excited about the meal was fully converted after tasting, requesting that this be put on the list of regular meal options. This is a keeper. It is healthy, economical, and easy to prepare."

I used tomatoe sauce with a lil splenda brown sugar to cut down on the acidity in the tomato sauce. I baked it for 1 hour . 30 minutes uncovered and 30 minutes covered with aluminum foil. I used red, yellow, and orange Peppers. The green peppers are a little too strong and don't agree with us afterwards. I also added an egg to the mixture and a lil water. so it would be moist. Very good. Hubby really liked it."

Next time I'll just use ketchup. What ever didn't fit in the peppers I added around them in the casserole dish. Baked for 30 min. Cutting things up ahead of time made things easier too. I'll definitely make this again."

I did not add the zucchini, and honestly, I can't see how I could have gotten all the stuffing ingredients into only 4 peppers, and mine were not small peppers. I used a can of diced fire-roasted tomatoes, and it was a good choice. I could see this with more sauce over zucchini noodles or spaghetti squash, rather than inside a pepper. Again, we did enjoy the flavor--a lot of our favorites were in the dish, and we hardly noticed we were eating ground turkey. Thanks!"

Piled the filling into the peppers alternating scoops and cheese, finishing with cheese on top. Put them back in the oven uncovered for about 15 min or less, just until the cheese was bubbly. They were very tasty! I also added some garlic and onion powder to the veg while it cooked. My husband put hot sauce on it, like everything, and loved them. We ate the leftover mixture in a tortilla and still good! Thanks!"
