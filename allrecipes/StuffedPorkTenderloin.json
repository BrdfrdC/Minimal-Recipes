Knowing that white meat pork can be bland, and knowing that spinach and mushrooms are also bland, I amped it up. I doubled the Dijon mustard. I doubled the parsley. I salted the stuffing mix and ALSO salted the pork loin. I doubled the black pepper. I doubled the thyme. I pan seared the loin as instructed to get a tasty bark. This recipe is missing something and once I figure it out I'll try it again."

The only changes I made were to substitute uncured honey ham for the prosciutto (due to budget constraints) and to double the cooking time in the oven. The loin was still a bit too pink in the middle after a half an hour. I think maybe I didn’t butterfly the meat properly or pound it thin enough, so that may have been a factor. Still, I’ll make it again!\n\nTip: If you’re serving roasted potatoes with this meat as the recipe author suggests, don’t throw away the fat/juice leftover in the skillet and roasting pan. Coat the potato pieces in it for roasting!"

I followed the recipe as written except that I added thin slices of provolone cheese on top of the mushroom spinach mixture and then rolled it up and tied it. I also made an Apricot glaze which I brushed on after it had baked 20 minutes, again when I took it out of the oven. it was moist and delicious and so pretty to serve. The 3/4 inch slices stayed together nicely. I served it with a simple green salad and Mashed Sweet potatoes with Cilantro and Jalapeno Pepper from this site. \n\nI also requested the butcher at my supermarket to butterfly the pork tenderloin for me and he gave me some butcher's twine to tie it. A little extra work but well worth it . Will definitely make it again"

Once tenderloins were stuffed and rolled, I sprinkled some celery salt on outside, wrapped bacon slices around each and then tied with string. I browned in a cast iron frying pan then finished baking in oven. \n\nServed with Green beans with shallots and roasted red peppers, black eyed peas with country ham chips and green onions along with corn bread. \n\nMy family loved the meal-tenderloin recipe is definitely a keeper! \n\nHappy New Year!"

Also used a whole 10 oz package of baby Bella mushrooms, 2 cloves of garlic, 1/2 tbsp of fresh thyme. Didn't use sage because I had none, 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 3 cups fresh spinach and 1 tsp Dijon and 1/2 tsp dried parsley (didn't have fresh). Instead of prosciutto y used pancetta on the outside after I rolled before tying. Had to cook almost 40-45 minutes after searing. Tented and rested for 5 minutes. Will definitely make again."

Just need to cook it above 140 and your good. I used fresh Garlic instead. Truly excellent and my family enjoyed it"

I added a little parmesan cheese because I had it around and used chopped yellow onion instead of shallots because it's what I had. I also made some brussels sprouts in the same pan and they soaked up the flavor beautifully. Highly recommend!"

I followed advice of other reviews, layering pounded sections of the pork rather than rolling it, and then cooking it in the oven at 425 instead of 350 for half an hour, and it turned out great. I used cooked bacon instead of prosciutto. I'd readily serve this to guests."

And follow ingredient list adjusting for the added area to cover. Roll it up and sear it on a iron griddle and bake covered 325 degrees for 1 hr. Comes out fork tender. Mmm"

It wasn't but I did make a sauce by deglazing the pan w/ chicken broth after sauteeing the mushrooms and then after the meat finished in the oven. I used an oven safe pan so I didn't have to transfer to a baking dish. I added some cream and a bit of unsalted butter to the sauce. It was just right. I'd love to add some red wine next time. We made roasted red potatoes and some roasted zuchini as well. Very good :)"

My prep time was about an hour saute to sear, so keep that in mind if you are budgeting time for a prep. Also, after 30 minutes in a pre-heated oven my pork was medium rare pushing medium, and I used 1.3 LB tenderloin, smaller than the recipe calls for. Next time I prepare think I'll preheat to 400*, and roast 30min. Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR!"
