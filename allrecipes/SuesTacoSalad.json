The only reason this is rated down a star is because I found it quite salty so didn't finish my serving, and upon eating each part separately I discovered it was the ranch dressing I had used that was the issue. When I have the leftovers I will try another dressing - maybe a Caesar as I love that with anything. I recommend using a dressing you love and then you should love this dish as well."

Cool Ranch Doritos are my family's favorite on this salad, but regular Doritos are good, too!"

I was not making as big of recipe and yet it made a whole lot. I used only one head of iceberg lettuce and only a couple outside leave of green lettuce. For the dressing, I used my own concoction for ranch dressing using 1/4 cup each of light mayo, Fage plain Greek yogurt, and homemade Kefir milk. I used 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder and dill weed. The taste was nice and always a hit with kids. I also added black olives and used regular tortilla chips as many in my family do not like the flavored types."

"reviewBody": "I've made this for years and have a couple of suggestions to make any left-overs as good as the original. First, fry the ground meat with some chopped onions. When done add the kidney beans, any seasonings, and the cheese of your choice (I often use processed pepper jack cheese as it adds some flavor, replaces the need for Taco seasoning mix, and melts so nicely). In a separate bowl, add dressing (I like Catalina) to chopped lettuce, using only enough for the number of people you will feed. Place the lettuce mixture on the individual plates, top with the ground meat mixture, and garnish this with freshly diced tomatoes, diced green pepper, chopped green onions, and maybe some sliced black olives. Serve tortilla chips in a large bowl for scooping up the salad. No soggy left-over lettuce mixture or soggy tortilla chips. Refrigerate left-over ground beef mixture for another day... Perfect!"

"reviewBody": "In making this, cut back on cheddar cheese to 1 cup, used a whole can of kidney beans, and 1 tablespoon Taco Seasoning I by B. Echols from this site rather than store bought. We liked this but prefer San Antonio Taco Salad on this site (AR made this recipe private some time ago but still available if it was in a member’s recipe box). The main difference between these two recipes is that beans and salsa are added into the cooked ground beef in the San Antonio version which gives it a more in-depth flavor and it uses 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese. Sue’s version is so simple and extremely fast to prepare that we will likely use it again when short on time."

It's nice and refreshing and you don't have to stand over the stove for very long AND you can get rid of veggies easily without altering the taste too much.\n\nHowever there are a couple changes I usually make when making this recipe...I use spices I have on hand (Chili powder, garlic powder, salt, cayenne and cumin to taste) instead of taco seasoning. I toss in some finely chopped green peppers (since that's what I usually buy and never end up using!). I switch between black and kidney beans, and sometimes use both. I use Spanish onions as opposed to green because we really like onion flavor in this family and we use creamy Italian dressing, which we both prefer over the French. \n\nI also tend to mix everything but the lettuce, chips and dressing since we both like the lettuce crisp and the chips crunchy and have different ideas of what a substantial amount of dressing is...\n\nAlthough this recipe is great, don't be afraid to play around with different veggies, dressings and chip flavors!"

For some reason when the meat is really fine it tends to taste better, don't ask me why, lol. Really easy to make, I used sour cream and salsa as opposed to ranch dressing. Yummy!"

I also left all the parts of the salad separate to keep it from getting soggy. We used spinach mix for the greens, then topped with meat mixture, cheese and chips. I mixed a very small amount of ranch dressing with some salsa for mine and my boyfriend did the same but with sour cream. I think the way we had it made this a pretty healthy meal. I will definitely make again."

"reviewBody": "My review for this recipe disappeared! This is one of our favorite meals in this house. Any kind of ground meat will work (I usually use ground turkey or chicken), I make my own taco seasoning/ranch dressing and I like to use organic black beans in place of the kidney beans. Sometimes, I'll mix a half cup of homemade salsa into the ranch dressing. Any kind of chips will do--we alternate between Doritoes, Fritos and chili-lime tortilla chips. Because I eat low carb, I skip the chips on mine and double up on the lettuce. This is also a great way to use up leftover taco meat from the night before for a quick lunch. You can layer them so everything is ready to go in the container--just make sure that you seperate your dressing or make it so the dressing is on the bottom and not touching your lettuce otherwise it will wilt quickly."

I bought three different salad dressings to try (creamy italian, peppercorn ranch and chipotle ranch) and Chipotle Ranch by Naturally Delicious was by far the best one for this salad! Also, I think the scallions are a nice to have but not necessary. I got SO MANY compliments on this dish when I brought it to a potluck. Will definitely make again!!!"

I used leftover browned taco seasoned meat, I choose to use refried beans in place of the kidney beans, and threw in some leftover santa fe style rice with black beans and corn. I used some salsa because I didn't have any tomatoes on hand, and white onion in place of the green onion. Seems like a lot of changes but nothing major that really changed the flavor of the taco salad. Will use this recipe again!!! I also added some chopped pickeled jalapenos!!"
