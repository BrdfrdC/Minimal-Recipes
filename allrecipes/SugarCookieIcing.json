You can easily swap out for your extract of choice. I also have successfully used oat milk in this recipe since I was out of dairy milk. This icing is easy to thicken or thin depending on your preference and easy to double or triple as needed. Definitely my go-to recipe for sugar cookies!"

I left them out on the counter to dry overnight and they are certainly hard enough to be stacked! I think the others who said it was a sticky recipe just didn't let the corn syrup milk and powdered sugar settle into each other long enough by stirring it smooth. Thank You so much for this recipe!"

I then made another doubled batch and added a little more milk to thin it and used that for flooding the cookies. It was enough for 14, 4” cookies with some left over. I used the almond extract and let the cookies dry for 24 hours on a cookie sheet. When I first made the icing as written I thought it was too thick but let the stand mixer continue to mix for a couple minutes and the icing ended up being perfect."

"reviewBody": "This will be my go-to cookie icing from now on. The taste is so much better than traditional Royal Icing. Once it is completely hardened, it holds up very well; even the flavor keeps well. My cookies were left out overnight before I could consider them sturdy enough to stack. Then they were frozen and thawed more than once, and survived being shipped across the country; after more than TWO weeks, they were still beautiful and delicious! I have given this only four stars, because it is quite difficult to work with until you get the hang of it. One batch makes a very small amount of icing, and it is no where near the consistency needed to pipe and fill cookies, so it requires a lot of thinning. But use caution, adding more corn syrup to thin it out as the recipe states will cause the icing to never fully set. The trick here is to keep the corn syrup:milk ratio close to the same. Once you get it right, though, they dry to a beautiful, shiny icing! I also added extracts and oils to make almond, lemon, and orange flavors!"

"reviewBody": "Full disclosure: I am not a sugar cookie fan. I do not think any icing could fix the blandness of cutout cookies. They are wonderful fun to decorate the the kids always like them, so I make them a few times a year. This icing was way easier to make and more forgiving than royal icing and tasted a bit better. I love how shiny it is. The only downside is how quickly you need to decorate before the icing sets to the point where it won't grab sprinkles. That can be a good thing (it takes longer to ice the cookie and let kiddos decorate it, thus drawing out the fun time) or a bad thing (I can't ice multiple cookies and let the kids decorate while I concentrate on my own masterpiece)."

I've made this several times and it's extremely thick as is. \n\nI automatically add 2 additional teaspoons of milk for each batch following this recipe. Then I use a spray bottle of water to change the consistency. \n\n(Don't add more corn syrup to this to make it thinner! Doing this makes it way too sweet and sticky. I just add milk and water)\n This recipe makes a small amount- enough for each color. So make a big batch if you want and then seperate to bowls for adding color or to make your different consistencies. \n\nChanges: add 1/2 teaspoon of Vanilla &amp; 1/2 teaspoon of Almond Extract and a dash of Salt.\nWhen you want a very bold color -add 1 teaspoon of Cream of Tartar. When you what a bright solid white outlining batch of icing, don't add Vanilla Extract ( the brown color will make the icing cream colored). Instead, just do that batch with (clear) Almond Extract and the 1 teaspoon of cream of tartar. \n\nIf it's the first time making total icing for decorating, watch some YouTube videos to learn the consistencies you want before hand!"

I liked the suggestion of another reviewer about adding the powdered sugar into the milk. I did the opposite and didn’t think it would turn out by the way it was clumped up. It wasn’t until I added the extract and corn syrup that it smoothed out. It was very flavorful and I love the glossy finished look. I ended up making another batch because it didn’t look like one would be enough."
