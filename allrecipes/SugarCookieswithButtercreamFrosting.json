,"description": "These cookies are melt-in-your-mouth delicious. They are simple to make and kids love to lick the frosting off the tops. Butter flavoring is in the buttercream for added flavor. You can find it in most supermarkets, in the baking aisle, where there are other flavorings such as vanilla."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe. I used about 4 teaspoons of vanilla (instead of just 1 teaspoon), but made no other changes, and I’m still giving it 5 stars because everything else about the recipe works well. After refrigerating overnight, the dough was easy to roll and cut. It does puff a little while baking, but not too much, and it gives the cookies a wonderful texture. It is important to use butter (not margarine), measure the flour carefully, and chill the dough thoroughly before rolling/cutting. If you want a sweeter cookie, sprinkle sugar on top before baking or add icing after baking."

I topped them with the Glossy Royal Icing from this website (1 tablespoon of white corn syrup mixed into 1/4 cup of warm water with a teaspoon of almond extract. Add 3 cups of powdered sugar and an optional teaspoon of vanilla extract)."

After chilling the dough it is hard as a rock and requires quite a bit of pounding before it can be rolled out and cut.

I just brushed on a simple glaze made of milk, confectioner's sugar, and vanilla."

The second time I made this was with royal frosting and it was GREAT! The cookies were good except I ended up baking them for 7-8 minutes because I wanted them hard enough so that they wouldn't fall apart when the icing was on.

I ended up putting the dough on my cookie sheet in spoonfulls flattened with a flour coated fork, but even that was a sticky mess. When finished, the cookies weren't that good. Very disappointed."

I did have some issues with using cookie cutters on them, the dough seemed to get really soft too quick, then the shapes just kinda melded back together and had to go into the freezer for a bit in order for me to get them onto the cooking sheet. But other than that, it was easy to make, they did only take 5 minutes to cook and I use a stone to cook them on. Great cookie recipe"

I baked them a little longer than what the recipe calls for but they continue to bake after you take them out of the oven so you have to be careful when adding time to the cooking time. I found keeping the dough in the fridge for 2 hours a little too long. Next time I would only put the dough in the fridge for about 1 hour. Certainly a recipe keeper."

We split the dough in half and chilled each for 30 minutes before rolling out and cutting cookies out with mini cookie cutter/punches. They were adorable and delicious! We cooked them for 6 minutes as we like the edges a little toasty. Highly recommend. Didn't alter the recipe at all."

If you sincerely need more than 30 regular sized sugar cookies, double the recipe. Also, I opted out of the frosting and made a vanilla cream cheese frosting instead which complimented the flavor of these cookies perfectly :)"

I used almond extract, which gave them a nice flavor, topped with tinted sugar, and baked them about 7 minutes. That being said, I probably won't make them again, as my family prefers a crisper sugar cookie and these are on the soft side. But it's a great recipe if you're a soft sugar cookie fan!"

I did chill the dough for about three hours instead of the two recommended. I did not, however, make the icing based on previous reviews. That being said, the taste is kind of bland. These are cookies that need an icing to give them that extra flavor. The cookies are not bad at all, airy and light. They just need a little something to give it that extra \"Yum\"."

I had to add a lot more butter when mixing the dough so it wasn't just dough-colored dust, and even with icing (I just did powdered sugar and milk- I didn't try the buttercream here), they just taste like flour. Maybe the proportions are right if you make the full batch or do the math yourself, but I've never run into problems using that feature before."

I chilled the dough overnight and busted into smaller sections to roll out. It is very forgiving and melds into itself well when I had cracks or breaks. This is by far my new favorite sugar cookie recipe as they tasted fantastic! I did not try the frosting recipe. Instead used royal icing then decorated with \"Simple &amp; Delicious Butter Cream Frosting\""

Therefore, my cookies were RATHER on the small side (obsiously, less than a pop can diameter), and a half receipe turned out to make about 40 of these small little cookies. The cookies were soft and delicious!\n\nI just used butter and powdered sugar with some vanilla for the frosting, because what the heck is the point using shortening and butter flavoring!?"
