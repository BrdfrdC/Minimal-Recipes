Even those in the family that are not sugar free or gluten free ate big pieces and went back for seconds. I used cranberries because my mom doesn’t like raisins. Win win!"

MONKFRUIT... its a natural sweetener that looks and tastes like sugar! There is no chemical aftertaste like most sugar subs. Monk Fruit is grown on a vine and is native to Asia, specifically China and Thailand. It's a game changer for people with Diabetes. I appreciate bakers, like this L. Kahrl, who took the the time and their talent to be creative; to come up with a healthier dessert."

I did leave out the raisins and walnuts because this was for a 1 year old. I'm sure the raisins provide a nice pop of sweetness. I personally found it bland, but the spices added a nice flavor. If I have to make this again I think I will use regular apple sauce, but the birthday boy loved it, and that's all that matters."

But I used the full amount of cinnamon and nutmeg (so it was doubled for the half recipe). They did come out a wee bit dry with these alterations, but I would rather have that than the oil."

Vanilla to taste.(Since I got the hard sauce too sweet I kept adding some cornstarch and milk til I got it the right taste) (I prefer the cornstarch to flour.) Mix your flour or cornstarch with your sugar or sugar substitute, add the boiling water cook til it thickens, if too thick add some more water. once thickened, add butter, half and half and vanilla and a dash of salt , )since I did not have brown sugar substitute I put in a few drops of molasses.Since brown sugar is regular sugar sprayed with molasses.) Then serve it over the cake, This cake was very good witout anything over it."

"reviewBody": "I used dates instead of raisins because I don't like raisins - they worked well! In fact you probably could substitute any dried fruit. This cupcake tasted a tad bit like pumpkin I think due to the texture of the applesauce and the spices which are normally found in pumpkin bread. I used 3/4 cup unbleached flour and 1/4 cup wheat flour to make it even healthier. I omitted the nuts simply to make it more like a cupcake and not a muffin. Great! I may even substitute the applesauce with canned pumpkin next time! Thank you for a healthy cupcake recipe!"

"reviewBody": "DIABETIC note...for those who are not familiar with counting carbs for diabetics; who think 'sugar free' means 'diabetic-friendly'. One serving (12 servings from a bundt pan) of this cake has 375 calories and 43 carbs. I randomly checked for another cake made in bundt pan, and found Pina Coloda Cake, made with a cake mix and a box of pudding (neither sugar free), and one serving (14 servings from a bundt pan) was 40 carbs...less than the 'sugar free' cake (but the serving was a bit smaller). If you're preparing food for diabetics, PLEASE look at the carbs and don't assume that sugar free is diabetic-friendly."

The second time I made it I added a tsp of baking powder and let it sit about 5 minutes before I put it in the oven. That seems to make it a little lighter. Overall a good cake for someone who is limiting sugar intake. I also used half whole wheat flour. I might cut back on the splenda next time. with all the raisins, it is plenty sweet."

This cake comes out a beautiful spongy brown color, and if you like, you could put the tiniest sprinkle of powdered sugar on top... BEAUTIFUL!!! This is a wonderful recipe!"
