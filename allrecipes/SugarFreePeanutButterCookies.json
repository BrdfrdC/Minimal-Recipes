"reviewBody": "These cookies are yummy. No sugar, no flour, not your Grandma's PB cookie recipe. I used 3/4 C of Splenda which is sweet enough for me. Also added 1/2 C quick oats and 1 T vanilla. No matter how good they smell, leave them be on the cooling rack for an hour unless you want crumbles. Once they set up, they will stack and store just fine. I used 1/4 C scoop dropper to form and drop the dough. Only makes 9 cookies that way, so went 15 min at 350. You can see from the pic that I forked them flat and you can see they really do not spread. So if you drop them and do not flatten, they will retain their shape and not cook properly."

"reviewBody": "I also made these for my 84 year old father who had recently been diagnosed with diabetes. I read the reviews and, knowing oatmeal helps maintain glucose levels and can be beneficial to diabetics, added 3/4 cup of dry oatmeal. I substituted 1 cup Splenda BROWN sugar for 1 cup of the Splenda white sugar. Fearing the oatmeal might make the cookies too dry, I used extra large/jumbo eggs and I added 1/2 tsp vanilla simply for flavor. Not only did my dad love these cookies, my mom, my whole family, including grandchildren LOVED these cookies. This recipe, with my changes, made 32-36 silver dollar size cookies. The natural peanut butter isn't cheap and we limit sugar substitutes for our kids, so in our family, this is pretty much an adult cookie and the kids get real cookies."

Some people who had problems with them probably used a processed type of peanut butter, try using all natural peanut butter ( I used Smucker's all natural) probably any all natural peanut butter will produce a good outcome. They will not settle during cooking so you should press with a fork before cooking. They also didn't stick together as a traditional cook would, they are delicate. Mine remained moist and fresh until gone. They are a great replacement cookie for diabetics , its better than going without."

"reviewBody": "I am on prednisone so I have to watch my sugar intake for 90 days. I googled sugar free cookie recipes and this came up. I read through several reviews before making these cookies. Here's what I came up with:\n\nI used crunchy peanut butter. It added a nice taste and texture to this recipe. I only made a half batch since I wasn't sure if I'd like them or not. \n\nI added 1/2 cup of oats\n1/2 tsp of vanilla extract\n20 packets of splenda (it was sweet and good but next time I'll only do 15 packets). I use packets so I can tweak until I find a nice level of sweetness that I like. \n\nI put a tablespoon amount in my hand and squeezed the dough until they were tight (they were sort of falling apart so I squeezed them to make sure there were no cracks in the dough. I think this helped with the crumbling others spoke about when making these cookies). I rolled into balls and put them on parchment paper. I used a fork to spread them out and do the criss-cross pattern. I baked them for 8 minutes and let them sit while I did my homework. I came back later and they were fine. They didn't crumble and fall apart like others said in their reviews. They were a little dry, but not too bad. They were still good and this is coming from someone who usually cooks with sugar. \n\nI hope this helps!"

"reviewBody": "These cookies are delicious! I tried all the things that people said to try in their other reviews. I added a third a cup of oats, a teaspoon of vanilla, a splash of milk, and a tablespoon of cocoa. The Coco Gave great flavor and made the cookie slightly darker. The one thing I didn't do is add less Splenda. The cookies were a little crumbly, but not much. By adding only one and a half cups of Splenda would've helped with this. What also helped with the crumbliness is making the cookie smaller. My cookies a tablespoon in size. All in all this was an amazing recipe that tastes amazing too. All you have to do is tweak it slightly."

"reviewBody": "I have food sensitivities so these gluten free peanut butter cookies are a fabulous option for me! I also have food sensitivities to eggs, dairy, and sugar cane. As such I had to make a few adjustments to these. I used a Vegan egg replacer that I found at my local grocery store. I used Earth Balance creamy peanut butter because it is sweetened with Agave instead of sugar cane or sugar cane derived products (i.e. molasses). The last thing I added was some vanilla extract and about 1/4 cup of unsweetened maple peanut butter just to add a bit of a different flavor and because the Earth Balance was extremely thick vs the maple which was more oily and helped to incorporate all of the ingredients more evenly. These cookies came out AMAZING! I am not someone that just says something is amazing, as a former culinary arts connoisseur and someone very new to all of these food sensitivity issues, I need my food to have a lot of robust and vibrant flavors. These cookies are a life saver for me because they help curb my sweet cravings when I am unable to have much else."

These cookies are awesome. I stopped eating sugar about a year ago. It is so nice to have cookies that are both delicious and healthy. You do have to cool the cookies completely before eating, otherwise they will crumble in your hand. Even after they cool completely, they are still a bit more crumbly than traditional cookies. Best to eat them over a plate or napkin."

I checked them at 8 minutes to see if they were done and found that the cookies were still round balls on the cookie sheet - they hadn't flattened into cookies at all. I tried to use a fork to flatten a few, and they fell apart - didn't hold together at all - literally just turned to crumbles right on the cookie sheet. I let what remained cool completely (based on the reviews I read), and they also fell apart; although, fall apart doesn't really describe what happened. Disintegrated is more like it. The small amount I was able to get into my mouth was not tasty at all and was very gritty. Very disappointed. :-("

In hindsight, I wonder what brand of natural peanut butter was used for the development of this recipe; because they vary alot in consistency and ingredients. \n\nAlso, for those who found the recipe too sweet, many peanut butters labeled \"natural\" still have extra sugar in them, just no additives; so that will affect the taste quite a bit.\n\nFor diabetics, a sugarless recipe with flour and levening in it would be much better; but my interest was for an Atkins, or low-carb, version."

I would never try it with splenda however because the taste isnt as good as truvia.

I used dry splenda sweetener which caused the cookies to ooze on the parchment paper in the oven but didn't change the outcome. I added 5 minutes to the bake time. I also added a few Tblsp of water as I mixed it. It was stiff, really stiff but after the few spoons of water it mixed really well. Let them cool completely before eating or storing. I read where these crumbled easy. Well to cure that store them on a paper towel in the container and they will stay soft till gone. They remind me of no bake cookies without the sugar. \nLets see, no sugar and low carbs. Yup I will fix these again."

Since Sucralose is really bad for you, I used 1 cup of natural Stevia instead. I also added the recommended 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 cup of natural oatmeal and cooked for 10 minutes. To avoid the dryness, I added 2 tbs of milk to the recipe. After 5 minutes of cooling on the cookie sheet and 15 minutes on the cooling rack, they were good to go - no crumbling. I definitely miss the brown sugar, so I think I will add a bit of cinnamon or other sugar free flavor next time."

I mix Splenda, Nutri Sweet and Sweet-n-low, instead of using just one type of sweetener. (An old Atkins trick to cut down on the after taste.) The last time I made these, I added about 4 heaping tablespoons of unsweetened apple sauce, and instead of rolling them, made them into drop cookies. I also cooked them longer - 12 minutes. (because of the apple sauce, they will leach water during the baking process, so be prepared with a paper towel) Store them in a cookie jar so that they don't lose their crunchy chewy outer texture. This was the best batch so far."
