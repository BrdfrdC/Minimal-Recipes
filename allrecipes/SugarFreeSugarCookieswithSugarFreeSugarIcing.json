"reviewBody": "Cookies were OK, not bad for sugar free. The dough is sticky, so definitely refrigerate longer than the 30 minutes suggested in the recipe. The icing though? DO NOT BOTHER. Trust me. Pyure is WAY too expensive to waste on a recipe that doesn't work. It doesn't come together - it's loose and chunky. (Edited to add: the recipe might be missing vital instructions - I was able to salvage the icing by throwing it in a saucepan over med-low heat and whisking constantly - sort of like a gravy)"

"reviewBody": "For a sugar-free sugar cookie, this really wasn’t bad. The dough was a little sticky even after the 30 minutes so I put it back in. After around 1 1/2 hours, the dough was perfect. While baking, the cookies didn’t spread too much outward but puffed up a good amount. Taste-wise, they are pretty plain and definitely need frosting or icing of some sort. Overall, I’d recommend to anyone looking for a guilt free treat."

"reviewBody": "Excellent. Shortbread sort of taste and very light sweetness. Like a Bisquick biscuit almost.\nI used Kroger Apriva sweetener and didn't make the frosting. This was just one of a handful of sugar free recipes I have made, so making frosting was not on the agenda.\nThese took another 3-4 minutes to get to the golden brown stage in my electric oven."

"reviewBody": "Loved these! Used honey (same measurements) instead of stevia and added 1/2tsp of lemon extract to sweeten it a little more! Also made a 2nd batch with chocolate chips and was awesome! My husband (who is a sugar cookie fanatic) loved them as did my daughter!!!! \n\nWe didn't make the icing. Instead I blended cream cheese and fresh fruit with 1 tsp of vanilla extract. Wasnt ideal to let sit on the cookies but great to dip!"

They were a hit at the kids birthday party. The kids got to ice them and enjoyed every bite. They didn’t know they were sugar free."

"reviewBody": "I followed the recipe exactly and I have a few tips for anyone looking to make this:\n- Instead of using 1/4 cup of Stevia, I would actually double that and use 1/2 cup. The cookies are pretty good, they just need to be a lot sweeter. I fixed this by using some packaged icing (not sugar free, so this isn't an option for everyone). \n- I would suggest buying/making your own icing to put on top to add a little more flavor."
