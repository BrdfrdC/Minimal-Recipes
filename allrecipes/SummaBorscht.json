"reviewBody": "For this recipe to be authentic, it needs farmer sausage (some people use ham). Vegetarians can use liquid smoke or imitation bacon bits, but the smoky flavour is necessary. It also needs sorrel... If you don't have access to sorrel, try using beet greens, and add some lemon juice towards the end of cooking. In my family, we skip adding dairy to the pot, and add buttermilk to our own bowls."

I find it much tastier if you cook chunks of farmer sausage in the water first and skim off the fat when it's done. Then I add the potatoes and green onions to the sausage in the skimmed water. When that's cooked, I add a bag of spinach leaves...mmm. Add the dill and salt. Boil til seasoned. Depending on how large a pot your using, add 1-2 cups of sour cream. Boil that together and add 1-2 cups of buttermilk. Truely a tasty soup :)"

This tasted very similar to hers, except as others have added she always used farmer sausage. When i made it I didn't have any on hand so i used fresh bacon bits instead and it still tasted great! I also think it just isn't the same without buttermilk, that is what i believe adds the extra kick!"

"reviewBody": "I made a few changes simply due to personal preference and of course due to tradition of how my grandma used to make it. I boiled the potatoes in chicken broth instead of water to add more flavour. I also threw in carrots and onions and raw farmer sausage at the same time and let it boil for 45 minutes. Added lots of dill and then pureed it in the blender as my kids don't like potatoes but will eat it this way. I added half and half cream only. Amazing flavour and my house smelled great. Definitly going to be a staple in my household this winter."

"reviewBody": "My great grandmother made this soup and it is a family favorite. I'm so glad I found this saskatchewan recipe! It is almost the same, but hers starts with browning mennonite or farmer sausage in the pan, then drain the fat but keep the brown bits in the pan for flavor. She used to use fresh greens from her garden (nobody knows exactly what they were!) but I used fresh dill and parsley. She didn't use buttermilk either, just half and half at serving time. This is a delicious, hearty soup. My husband loves it (without half and half). My kids hated it the first time and loved it the second time, can't wait to see how the third time goes tonight!"
