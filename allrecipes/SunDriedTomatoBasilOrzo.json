Those that find it bland and try unsuccessfully doctor it with red pepper, feta, or vinegar are missing the point and probably have a rather unsophisticated palate to begin with. Follow the directions, use quality ingredients, and enjoy!!"

I used two 7.5 oz jars of sun-dried tomatoes (undrained), 4 oz of fresh basil, 2 or 3 oz of Parmesan (a better grade), a bit of salt and some goodly shakes of pepper to a whole box of orzo. I added olive oil after I blended the pesto in the food processor, and only enough to make the consistency blendable with the orzo. I want to try this with feta, and adding sliced olives would be great for either cheese - if my family didn't have a tendency to pick them out!"

So, I added a clove of minced garlic, a very thin slice of minced red onion, and some chopped kalamatas. I combined everything beforehand to allow time for the flavors to meld. Then I cooked the orzo in veg broth, drained and mixed everything before cooking the steaks to allow some time for the flavors to coat the pasta. I will be making this one again."

"reviewBody": "I found this recipe to be really easy but the orzo to be just ok. I had to spice it up a lot. I served it hot and after following the original recipe, I added sautéed garlic, onions and spinach into the orzo. I used grated parmesan cheese to taste (which ended up being a lot) as well as salt, and very little pepper. I also used lemon juice and a pinch of brown sugar. After those altercations the dish was great. Ill defiantly make it again!"

"reviewBody": "Thanks for sharing this delicious flavor combo! I make my orzo a little differently and I halved the recipe as it is just the 2 of us. I melt 2 tbsps butter in a saucepan and then add a cup of orzo and saute until lightly toasted. Add 14.5 ozs of water and 2 teaspoons of chicken base and bring to a boil. Boil for about 15 minutes or until liquid is absorbed. I then added the tomatoes, basil and Parmesan cheese. Salted and peppered to taste and left out the olive oil as it had great flavor, and I didn't feel it was needed. Loved it!"

"reviewBody": "This is a great \"idea\" recipe! Like so many others I tweaked it just a bit to fit my tastes. Instead of orzo I used pipettes. I used regular sun dried tomatoes instead of oil packed and added a little starchy pasta water to help everything blend and keep the oil down. Then I tossed in 4 or 5 pitted kalamata olives, 1/2 a small shallot, a garlic glove, 1 tbs of vegan parmesan (instead of 3/4 cup) and 1 tbs giardiniera on top of the other ingredients (minus the salt - the olives are pretty salty). Then I mixed it all with the warm pasta and topped with a bit more vegan parm. Even my ridiculously picky husband liked it. I will be making again! So simple!"

I scaled down this recipe for two people thou I wished now that I hadn't because we gobbled this up and it was just tasty. I added a T of olive oil instead of 2T because I used some of the oil from the sun dried tomato jar to add some flavor to the pasta. I seasoned this with salt and black pepper and served this warm alongside, \"Mushroom Stuffed Chicken Roll Ups,\" and \"Smothered Green Beans, \" all from this site. They complemented each other very well. Amazing flavors and wishing I could have some more!"

"reviewBody": "I thought this was rather decent, I can see me changing one slight thing in this recipe. decrease the amount of basil I chop and stuff into a 1/3 cup. Thats where, I feel it was over powering for me. My family liked it, my son was a 3 star because of the tomatoes but still ate it. What I did when chopping the basil was chop and stuff, chop and stuff into the measuring cup...not next time. I'll chop and toss into the cup, when it reaches the top...I stop. Plan and simple. As much as I love basil in some things..I don't like the overwhelming flavor of it to the point I can't taste anything else. And in this case...it's exactly what I did. But the ease of the ingredients and the quickness to throw it together, is a 5 star. Live and learn. ;-)"

We just cook the pasta and dump the rest of the ingredients in &amp; stir! Much easier than using a food processor! You can add salt &amp; pepper to taste. We add shrimp to make it a main dish.

Thought the salad was a bit dry as made by the recipe, although we didn't let it sit overnight which may have changed my opinion. Added probably 1/3% more each fresh basil and oil from the sun-dried tomatoes. Added some balsamic and lemon juice to taste, some Walla Walla onion for crunch and some fresh cherry tomatoes out of the garden just because we had them. The orzo sucked up all that extra juice and it was dynamite. The wife couldn't wait for it to sit and marinate. Added some Genoa salami and Kalamata olives to my portion the next day and it was even better. Thanks to kgwen."
