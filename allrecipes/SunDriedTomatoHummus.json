I don't think this is the recipe's fault, though, as it could have just been due to the particular can of beans I used. I wound up adding more lemon juice and some of the oil from the jar of sun dried tomatoes. The basil at the end gives it a very fresh flavor. I served it with vegetables and later used the leftovers as a sandwich spread. Some reviews mentioned difficulty getting the hummus smooth - I used a food processor and had no issue."

I didn't have oil packed sun-dried tomatoes, but substituted sun-dried tomatoes I reconstituted with a some boiling water. I drained them before adding them to the mix. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, except to add a bit of the bean liquid to help with the consistency. It was a nice change from the basic hummus recipe I've used in the past and reminiscent the flavored store bought varieties I've tried."

I also thinned the hummus to the desired consistency/smoothness by adding water as it pulsed in the food processor. (Was a bit shocked the recipe didn't tell you to do this, so I can not give it 5 stars!) I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried. Also added 1 tsp of cumin and an extra tsp of salt. Topped with dried basil for appearance. (Oh, be sure to wash the garbanzo beans off well in a drainer--helps reduce gas!)"

I was intrigued by the idea of adding sundried tomatoes...the only change I made was to roast the garlic first as I find raw garlic to be very bitter in hummus. Roasting gives it a nice, sweet taste. I also used tomatoes I dried myself and elminated the use of the oil altogether as I find it isn't necessary and adds calories. I drizzle up to a 1/4 of water into the hummus while pureeing to obtain the desired consistency. With these tweaks - I have a heart healthy snack!"

We have friends who own a restaurant and they ahve been using the recipe for their appitizer. They give credit to the poster though, thanks for this great recipe"

My family did not like the texture- the nubbins of tomato made the humus seem gritty which was off-putting too. Lastly, the color was strange- an unappetizing brownish-salmon with flecks of red and green."

I like bringing in my own but since i never made hummus I brought this one.. My chef as well as a few other top chefs in our school went crazy for this!! I used more sdt's and even used some of the oil. I left the sdt's kinda chunky and made some fresh pita bread. Perfect score!! I'm deff. going to do it AGAIN.. for my catering business ;)"
