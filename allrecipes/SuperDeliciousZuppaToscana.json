"reviewBody": "Great Recipe that is way better than any Zupa you can get out to eat. I do use Kale I like the texture and flavor much better however that is preference. I may use a bit more garlic and a bit of cayenne if I am feeling spicy. Please be aware that if it is too salty I would look at the PRE-made or mixed ingredients you are choosing to use, chicken broth is often the culprit and secondly the type of sausage you are using. Most of the main brands of broth are loaded with salt Organic or homemade is really the best way to leave out the salt. I often will use bacon bits that we can use as a topper instead of it getting cooking in the soup but I like the flavor of it. I also like to put a bit of fresh parm on top."

We also love bacon, so I add about half a pack instead of just the four slices. I have made it both by leaving the recommended 'few' tablespoons of bacon grease and also by leaving all of the grease. I highly recommend leaving only the few tablespoons. The texture was off when I left it all. I also use chopped up Kale at the end because we like the stiffer texture better. This is such an easy and flavorful recipe!"

Here, you have 3 ingredients over which you have no control on the level of salt: chicken broth, bacon, Italian sausage. So not adding any salt of your own and keeping the integrity of the soup, use sodium-free chicken stock OR make and freeze your own chicken stock (to which you never add salt!). I have purchased some Italian bulk sausage that was ok, tasty but not overly salted and then bought same brand and could barely eat it! We are on sodium restricted diets and try to be very careful!"

Both are great and are amazing choices to use. However, kale contains more than twice the amount of vitamin C than spinach. Likewise, spinach provides more vitamin K, vitamin A, and folate than kale."

I made it exactly the first time but we like meat and heat here so modifications I have made since are: added a whole pound of bacon, added HOT Italian sausage links for another 1/4 of sausage and some heat, added more red pepper flakes (1 tablespoon), potato sizes vary so does how many I add. When I finish it is very hearty and is requested once or twice a month through the cold season. Thanks for sharing souporsweets."

"reviewBody": "I keep Italian sausage in the deep freeze all the time, just in case I feel like making this soup. It is the easiest and yummiest thing. The only thing I change is that I use kale instead of spinach because it holds up better for left-overs and I just use a 32 oz carton of low-sodium chicken stock instead of 5 cans. If I don't have cream, I just use whole milk and add some butter. I used half and half last time and it was just great! Russet potatoes are going to give you the creamiest texture, but I've used yukon gold and other types. I definitely recommend draining the sausage and the bacon grease before sautéing the onions. This is the best!"

I like the spinach better (it's what OG uses) because it is softer and blends well with the texture of the soup. Love kale but it isn't for this soup. Unpeeled thin sliced red potatoes are perfect. This is not only one of the easiest soups to make it is delicious and everyone loves it. It's light enough to go as part of a meal or substantial enough to have alone with OG's bread sticks. Every thing on this recipe is spot on. Using milk or half and half will not change the flavor at all. If salty is the problem, use salt free ingredients and add your own to taste. Oh and keep the parmesan handy, it's a must to sprinkle in this soup."
