My family was very disappointed and I learned my lesson..."

I did add the full amount of chicken stock though since my biscuits were the grands version. I also added carrots, bunch of seasonings (pepper, dried parsley, minced onion, oregano, and a dash of chili flakes), as well as sauteing the chicken in bacon fat (since I had it left from breakfast that AM). I also cut the chicken into cubes before sauteing and just added everything to the pan after. I suggest using a Dutch oven or larger pot if you go the extra liquid route."

Then I added a can of mixed vegetables. I think the best part about this recipe is that my EXTREMELY picky stepdaughter, loves it. Finally! Thank you for sharing this great recipe!! ??

I'll probably use more broth to the biscuits next time, and although I have to make a roux to replace the soup (we're lactose intolerant), it doesn't add too much to the time to make. Hint: you might to cut the biscuit dough into eights to get a better-cooked biscuit before too much soup is soaked up."

The biscuit dumplings just would not cook up correctly, they were awful, but the soup was really good. Next time it's just the soup and probably back to bisquick dumplings."

"reviewBody": "Really good! Super easy, especially when I only picked the stuff up on my way home from work and didn't want to stand around cooking.\nI did tweak it a bit. I did season it all with salt, pepper, celery salt, and a tiny bit of thyme as I was cooking. I used 1 can of lower sodium cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of celery. I used 1 can of lower sodium chicken broth and almost 1 whole can of vegetable broth (I eyed it). I wanted it to be more thick than soupy. I only used 1 can of biscuits, which was a 16 oz can, and cut each biscuit into 6-8 pieces. We loved it. My fiance is a picky eater and he ate his whole bowl. I can't sneak veggies in with him, so having the veggie broth and cream of celery gave us the flavors without him ignoring the food. Will definitely make this again and again."

"reviewBody": "I always tweek recipes, this one was a good guide. Here's mine, altered to more my Southern taste:\n\n- Rotisserie chicken, deboned\n-Only 1 Can Cream of Chicken(or Cream of Mushroom is good too)\n-1 box (about 4cups) Chicken STOCK (not broth!!)\n-1 Can of biscuits, open, flatten them, and cut up. (I also like whipping up Bisquik drop biscuits and just dropping them by the spoonful into the simmering broth.)\n\nI get a deep pot WITH a lid. I bring the chicken and the broth to a good simmer, add frozen veggies if I want, then drop the biscuits in. Stir gently, add more biscuits, and repeat til all biscuits are dropped. When done, reduce the heat. Keep the lid on the whole time. Sea salt, pepper, and add a little teaspoon of butter if desired (I do.). You can add onion powder, garlic powder, whatever, if your heart desires.\n Voila! Dinner is served after about 30 minutes. Stripping the chicken takes the most time.\nTip: Keep any biscuit stuff cold!! Also, Bisquick does best when you let it rest for a minute, after whipping it up."

Not the old fashion southern recipe I grew up on, but it also only took 15 minutes to prepare and my family loved it.

"reviewBody": "Here are changes that I made that I think make a huge difference.\n1. Most important: Don't cut the biscuits into quarters. This method creates dumplings that are too thick and doughy. Instead, on a well-floured surface roll the biscuits to 1/8th inch thickness (or until the flattened biscuit is about the size of your hand) and then cut into strips. I use a pizza cutter for this part. Boil the strips for about 15 minutes.\n 2. Add the chicken carcass into the broth while you're prepping your other ingredients, then strain the broth before you add in the dumplings. Lower effort alternatives: add in a couple of bullion cubes and/or use a microplane to grate in a clove of garlic - just one! You want a little flavor, but you're not making garlic dumplings. I also like to pulverize a few teaspoons of poultry seasoning in a mortar/pestle and add that to the broth. Throw in a few sprigs of fresh thyme or rosemary if they're handy. Just throw in the whole sprig and then fish it out before you cook the dumplings.\n3. I prefer to use evaporated milk over the cream of chicken soup. It gives me more control over the final salt levels. You'll need about half a 13oz can + a bit more for #4.\n4. Reserve some of the evaporated milk and use it to make a cornstarch slurry. Slowly add until broth reaches desired thickness.\n\nIt's still a really low effort recipe even with these changes. Rolling out the biscuits adds the most work, but it's so worth it."

When I made it again, I used one can of cream of celery soup instead of one of the cream of chicken because my husband isn't a huge fan of celery. I also added onion. I boiled boneless, skinless chicken breasts in the broth, when the chicken was done, I shredded it, added it back to the broth, added the soups, onion, and biscuits. I did find that the biscuits are way too big if you use Grands biscuits and if you don't cut them really small."

I used a little less broth than the recipe called for but mostly because my pan wouldn't hold it all. I added some seasoning as it was otherwise a little bland for our taste. Some dried time, a little shake of garlic salt and about 1/2 tsp of regular salt and that livened it up a lot. If you have chicken in the freezer, this is an easy week-night supper."
