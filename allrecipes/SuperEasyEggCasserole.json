I made as per the recipe but used a small yellow onion instead of green, which I fried first and, as others suggested, a thin layer of frozen hash browns along the bottom of the pan, which I put in the oven while it was preheating and I was mixing the other ingredients. And, of course, I cooked the bacon first. Was this good? Yes! Would I make it again or serve to company? Yes! Was it amazing? No. There's a few other breakfast casseroles that rank higher."

Half a teaspoon of raw garlic in the egss was way too much and overpowered everything else. Garlic is good for this recipe, but I'd reduce it to 1/3 tsp and fry it with the bacon and green peppers instead. So, the recipe as it stands is pretty bad, but it can be fixed easily enough."

"reviewBody": "EASY is spot on! I loved this recipe and so did my family. Great flavor and very little prep made this a great \"quick\" breakfast. I made it and it fed my family of four (4) perfectly with no leftovers. The only thing I would suggest as a minor change to recipe, is to mix everything BUT the bread first. Then after everything is mix really good, then add the bread. Only because the bread sucks up so much of the liquids before you can get everything good and coated. that is it! Things I changed: I precooked the bacon, peppers, and onions before I baked the casserole. I didn't full on cook everything, just enough to get it started, I was just worried that twenty (20) minutes wasn't enough time to cook (to my liking) the bacon. I used a cast iron pan, so I just left (most) of the bacon grease in the pan (instead of greasing it) and just mixed everything up in the bowl, then reused the pan to bake it in the oven. The recipe seems very versatile, where you can add just about anything to your liking, and it will still taste great! I will definitely make this again."

I also put 1/2 the cheese in, then sprinkled the other half on top and put it under the broiler for an additional 5 minutes. \nThe onion is the only change I regret."

Baked at 350F for 40 mins and it came out great!\n\nOur family will be keeping this recipe, and I would like to thank all those before me whom put in their thoughts about this recipe to help me know how and what to do to get this recipe perfect for us. :-)"

Today I added sausage, bacon, red onion &amp; a can of mushrooms.. always cook your ingredients first then mix them in the egg mixture.. spray your baking dish with cooking spray.. I used a square 8x8 baking dish, cover with foil, bake at 365 for 45 min.. Turned out delicious."

I'm not personally a fan of onions or peppers in the morning so I omitted those. I also used brioche bread that I baked last week instead of white bread. Lastly I used some diced sausage that I precooked/browned and doubled the recipe. Yes I changed quite a few things but they just goes to show you can really tweak this to your family's taste! Definitely will try this again."

"reviewBody": "My casserole looked better than this one but, unfortunately, it did not taste as good as it looked. This dish was too salty and the consistency of the eggs was grainy instead of fluffy. Cheese, bell pepper, onions, milk and black pepper amounts seemed right. Ham was a good substitute for bacon which can be rubbery when baked. Not sure why recipe has bread; 2 slices were too much and made for a weird, grainy texture. I did not use the optional garlic; it would not have improved this dish. I had to increase temp &amp; cooking time; after 20 min at 350°, the dish was watery and hardly gelled so I increased temp to 400° and cooked dish for another 15 minutes. This worked - BUT then my lower oven temp might be off (although it worked well for 2-hour roast pork the other day). The recipe’s 9x13 pan size would have been too big for this small amount of ingredients (it would have produced a big pancake). I used an oval 7”x 9 ½” casserole dish and increased to 8 eggs and added one more T. milk. This seemed right. My cooked casserole was ¾” to 1” tall, which was still a little flatter than I would have liked. A bigger pan would have made it lower. I let it rest 10-15 min before serving."

Mushrooms and onions and garlic cooked for 5-7 mins tills the garlic smell was in the air .

I didn’t have white bread, so I cubed some mini Thomas’ bagels. Sounds crazy, but the bagels were a great substitute bc they gave it another texture. I doubled the recipe and added 2 extra eggs. It was thicker than shown in the video, which was nice. It just took a little longer to fully cook the middle. Delicious &amp; a great way to feed a crowd!"
