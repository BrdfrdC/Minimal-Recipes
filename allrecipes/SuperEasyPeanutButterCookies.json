"reviewBody": "I have been making this recipe for literally decades now. And, I have progressed to a healthier version using natural peanut butter and monk fruit sweetener. They can be a bit harder and spread less, but still a fantastic cookie, kinda more like store bought consistency when you use the healthier ingredients. Also, I occasionally add a handful of caramel or Skor chips to the batch. Adds a kick of toffee flavour. AMAZING! As others have mentioned, ovens vary and also ingredient density varies as well. So, they may not be identical each time you make them, but thatâ€™s the nature of home baked goodies. I have never had a complaint with this recipe and my variations. My whole family devours them as fast as they are permitted! And, I love that I can whip a batch up so quickly and seem like a domestic goddess while exerting very little effort! ðŸ˜€"

"reviewBody": "Made the recipe exactly as stated, but doubled it. The cookie was delicious, but quite crumbly. I'm going to add another egg and some chocolate chips and see what happens with the second tray. Be right back with an update...second batch is in the oven. I noticed as the first tray has cooled, it is not so crumbly. I added an egg, 1 Tb water and 1/4 cup Lily's chocolate chips. The dough was amazingly like what I'm used to in a cookie with flour. Waiting...oh, yes!! This is more like it. Holds together well and the addition of a few chips is yummy. The additional ingredients make a different mouth feel, if that makes any sense. Still a tasty cookie (a bit 'oily' but I used an organic peanut butter with all its oil intact.), but I will make it again, next time using monkfruit/erythritol instead of sugar. I do believe different peanut butters may make a difference in the 'crumb' of a cookie. It's worth it when you make a new recipe that doesn't quite suit to tweak it a bit to see if it can be made more to your liking. Oh, and the results made a total of 54 cookies. Would have made the expected 60 but I tend to make them bigger as the work progresses for some odd reason."

I like to add semisweet or dark chocolate chips. The bitterness really compliments the nutty flavour and they add gooey goodness. \nThese definitely are burn-prone though so donâ€™t put them on the bottom rack; and keep a close eye on the browning edges!!!"
