I made two changes: reduced the ground beef to 2 lbs. and used green pepper instead of celery. Yes, it IS \"super easy\" and very kid-friendly since it's not at all spicy, but if you like more zip in your Joes you can easily add something to punch it up to your taste. One note -- 3 lbs. of ground beef yields 6 servings??? I got 8 generous servings using only 2 lbs."

I also used enchilada sauce when I couldn’t find any chili sauce in the cupboard. It turned out really yummy. Made the mistake of not draining the fat off my meat. Definitely will next time. I followed this recipe as a base, I’m a cook not a scientist. I make adjustments....like a cook."

Simple to make, I followed some other commenters and added a Tbl of Worcester and also added the onion and celery before draining the grease to cook them a little easier. If you have yellow mustard around definitely add it because it counteracts the sweetness of the sugar. I used a full Tbl. This came out delicious and my roommate who told me she doesn't even normally like Sloppy Joes even enjoyed it!"

I would imagine the meat would be very dry if you use 3 lbs and ONLY the 12 oz of chile sauce. Next time I will up the amount to about 16 ounces. This was still delicious and I will definitely put it on the menu again!"

"reviewBody": "We loved it! I used the \"Homade Chili Sauce\" brand that I bought from Safeway. I found another reviewer had mentioned it so I tried it instead of Heinz. I also used the mustard that's optional - I had Gulden's Spicy Brown mustard on hand so that went in (I eyeballed it) and I did use some brown sugar but way less than what was called for. I tasted it beforehand and realized it needed just a hint of sweet and again eyeballed it. It came out great. There were only 3 of us eating so I used 2 lbs. of ground beef and about 3/4 of an onion and less than a full cup of celery. Terrific recipe. Oh, and since another reviewer had mentioned perhaps sautéing the celery and onion with the beef while it was browning, I tried that. I seasoned it with salt and garlic powder. After it was done, I drained it, added a little more salt and then added everything else.\n\nI'll definitely make it again. I served it with Alexia brand potato/carrot/green bean sauté. It's frozen and fires up quickly in a pan with a oil-based seasoning pack that comes with it inside. Super easy kid-friendly meal."

This recipe appealed as I always have chili sauce sitting around going unused. Super economical and couldn't be faster, the taste was a little sweeter than I am used to and so I added a couple of ingredients to add a little heat, chili powder and hot sauce. I liked that there were no peppers, and these hit the spots."

I saw in other posts where the writer felt the joes were to \"dry\".....just add more chilli sauce and that will take care of the problem. Nor Did I think it was too sweet{ maybe because of the extra CS?}.This will be my sloppy joe recipe from here on out."

"reviewBody": "I found this recipe searching for sloppy Joe with chili sauce. I think it’s key to any proper Joe, but unused in so many Joe recipes. This is easy, as the name implies. Few ingredients too. Sweet is fine and I expect some in my personal Joe preference. Sorry to say, that’s where my kudos end though. First of all, 3 lbs. of ground beef for 6 servings? Wow! I like to eat heartily, but still, I made this recipe with only 1 lb. and got respectable helpings on 6 open face bun halves. (I left out the celery too, had none.)This 1lb. could also translate into, at least, 3 very, very generous closed bun Joes (probably a little too much for children’s portions.) It would also be 6 reasonably portioned closed Joes when served with sides. If you can stand a little more math, this 3lb. recipe should yield at least 9 super-sized to, perhaps, 18 sensibly served sloppy joe sandwiches, on normal sized hamburger buns. Also I used over ½ a bottle of chili sauce for my 1lb. I used the appropriate scaled amount of vinegar with 1 Tbsp. of Worcestershire sauce. What little sauce there was, seemed watery. The chili sauce added flavor and colored the watery sauce, but disappeared into the meat, instead of making a thick, sloppy sauce. It needs tomato sauce or ketchup or something. Note; more, and thicker, sauce would also add further volume to the portions."

I didn't have celery (husband doesn't like it anyway) so I put some celery salt on the meat as it cooked, and added celery seed to the mix.\n\nI LOVE the sweetness! I did add a bit of red pepper flakes to taste. The sauce I used was garlic chili sauce and it made it so tasty! I think I did add a bit more than called for (I'd halved the recipe).\n\nI made this the day before while cooking chili on the stove at the same time (love to make two meals at one shot) and since it sat overnight, it tasted even better than when I tested it after cooking!\n\nThank you for a great alternative!"

"reviewBody": "Simple &amp; absolutely easy recipe to follow and tastes good! My boyfriend hates celery so I substituted it by using yellow bell pepper and dicing it up to little pieces. \n\nThe other reviewers were right in saying it's too sweet! I cut the sugar by half and it was still too sweet! It may have something to do with different brands of chilli sauce but I suggest a tablespoon (for serving of 6) is enough. Because during taste test while cooking, the sweetness will not come out till e after the flavours mix which can take up to an hour or two after the sauce is cooked. \n\nWould definitely make this again but I would suggest substituting about 20% of the chilli sauce with ketchup! And the tobasco sauce was a great idea!\n\nThanks for the recipe still! :)"

Perhaps using a little less beef or a little more sauce would help to intensify the flavor. Also, the onion and celery should be sauteed with the ground beef in the grease that accumulates before it is drained off. The onion and celery do not become tender in 3 minutes of cooking it with the dry beef. Decent flavor, but would be better if flavor was more intense."
