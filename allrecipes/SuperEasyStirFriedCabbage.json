It did nicely compliment my teriyaki salmon though. Since it provides bulk and is low calorie, I will probably make it again as part of our healthy diet push this year. I'll have to think on how to spice it up a bit more, --maybe some fresh ginger or teryiaki sauce."

This would make a good rice bowl but just on its own it was really good. I do not recommend using rice wine vinegar or any type of vinegar as it changes the taste of this dish ( unless this is the way you prefer it. ) If you do not have mirin, but have sake you can add a bit of sugar to it."

I used 1/2 medium sized cabbage &amp; it was perfect. Wouldn't change a thing about this recipe! Will definitely use again. Thanks so much for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "Oh my this is good and easy to make. Didn't have the wine so substitued rice vinegar as others suggested. Used Napa cabbage cooked for about 3 min and kept warm in oven (at 190deg) while I stir fried the rest of dinner.. This is not a spicy dish and so it was a nice balance to the spicy pork and fried rice main course and also had a cucumber salad (rice vinegar style)."

"reviewBody": "A good complimenting side dish for other Asian cuisine. I used rice vinegar instead of wine and added about a tsp of white sugar. Using cole slaw mix with carrots and purple cabbage gave the recipe some additional color which was nice. Served with a little hoisin sauce on the side for dipping, the flavors reminded me of a vegetable egg roll minus the wrapper."
