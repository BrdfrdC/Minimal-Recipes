This recipe is almost the exact opposite -- just ridiculously heavy because of the large number of egg yolks, etc. Moderately unpleasant to eat, actually."

You only need a 2 quart ice cream maker. 2 quart ice cream makers can hold up to approx 3 cups of ice cream base, which is what this recipe produces. If anyone has held off due to the size of their ice cream maker, don't! A smaller size ice cream maker did the trick for me. I will be making this again."

The kind of ice cream you’d be willing to pay a lot for in your local ice cream shop. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested pulsing the zest and sugar in the food processor! That made it smooth and no need to strain. Reminded me of my mother’s homemade lemon frosting—so delicious. Can’t wait to make this again."

I also cut the lemon juice by half b/c I was tired of squeezing lemons. AND I used 6 yolks. The result tastes like lemon curd--but an ice cream! The lemon flavor was strong but not too tart. Just so, so good. Cannot recommend enough, and I am confident the recipe as written would have been delicious, too."

There was so much zest the mixture was chunky after it chilled and I personally don’t care for pulpy textures. The second time I made this recipe I added half a cup of lemon juice (3/4 cup was a touch too lemony) and added crumbled up nilla wafer cookies (reminds me of Three Twins Lemon Cookie ice cream). Overall I really like this recipe, it’s not too sweet and the fat percentage is just right."

Karo prevents the formation of larger ice crystals and you'll get a softer, creamier finished product. Beware, other brands may contain HFCS."

It is absolutely wonderful and a naturally beautiful yellow hue! Not too sweet and not too tart. 3 lemons yielded just enough juice but 2 of the 3TB of zest. Seems to work out fine. We don't mind the zest in the ice cream but as others have mentioned, can strain it, if it bothers you. We've made this recipe twice now and it's perfect each time."

"reviewBody": "Tart Lemon Lovers... you NEED to make this ice cream!\n\nThis is the BEST ice cream I have ever had. Summer and lemons are the perfect pair - add ice cream to the mix and it's a triple win! This recipe will not disappoint if you like a tart lemon flavor.\n\nI researched other recipes online and after landing on this one, and reading several helpful reviews (thank you fellow reviewers!), I made a few slight modifications;\n* I added more lemon zest - about 5 tablespoons\n* Steeped for 30 minutes instead of 10 minutes to bring out the lemon zest\n* Added about 1/8 tsp of salt during the cooking process\n* Strained through a fine mess sieve before refrigerating the base for extra creamy texture\n* Added nearly one cup of lemon juice (instead of 3/4 cup) prior to putting in the ice cream maker.\n* Next time I'm trying Limoncello (subbing 3 tablespoons of the lemon juice). Has anyone tried adding a tiny bit of lavender to the base during the cooking phase, then straining out? \n\nOther things I did to follow the recipe (and probably why it turned out so amazing!); \n* Refrigerated the base overnight\n* Used really fresh lemons and zest\n* Made sure the freezer bowl was rock hard frozen\n* I have a Cuisinart ice cream maker and it says to pour in the base and churn for 25 - 30 minutes. After 15 minutes it was the perfect soft-serve consistency with no crystallization around the inside of the freezer bowl. So I stopped churning at 15 minutes, poured into a container and put in the freezer. The next"

I love lemon and this had the perfect amount of tart and sweet lemon flavor. It was wonderfully creamy and had the right \"mouth feel\". I followed the recipe exactly, except I strained out the zest before cooling and prior to adding the zest to the cream mixture, added some sugar and let it sit for a few minutes to help draw out more of the oils and flavor. Not sure if that made any difference but it was amazing ice cream. I also only had 1/2 c fresh lemon juice, so the remainder was bottled. I will definitely be making this again....and again....and again!!!"

Also made a strawberry version using the same base with added 1/3 cup of strawberry puree when letting the base sit in the fridge overnight and substituting the 3/4 cup of lemon juice with chopped strawberries when churning in the ice cream maker. This was also fantastic. For strawberry version, a little less sugar and lemon zest would have been better though since strawberries are naturally sweeter than lemon. I have already made several batches of the lemon ice cream. One friend was inspired to go ahead and buy an ice cream maker after tasting it, and other are looking to buy now."

When the mixture was cool, I then put in lemon zest. I may experiment and put some lavender in it next time, if I can find. Hard in SC. I did find a recipe where they put chopped candied lemon peel in the ice cream. That maybe something to try."

I don't mind the lemon zest at all, but others who tried my recipe weren't so keen on it even though they snarfed down my first batch without hesitation.

Now all I need to do is buy a bigger ice cream freezer to make double batches."

"reviewBody": "Mmmmm, refreshingly tart, but not too tart. Just right sweet. A GREAT after dinner dessert because of it. But...I made a couple of (minor) deviations. I made a lemon-lime version, using half of each. Also, after juicing enough lemons and limes to get that 3/4 cup of juice I found I only had about half the zest required. I wasn't about to have \"naked\" limes and lemons laying around, so I used the 1-1/2 T. of zest and called it a day. It was perfect! In fact, I'm not so sure I would have enjoyed this any more using twice as much zest and may even have enjoyed it less. I loved that the recipe called for my preferred ratio of 2:1 heavy cream to half-and-half and, while I was a little concerned about how the added large amount of lemon juice would affect the mouth feel, I needn't have worried. In spite of adding essentially 3/4 cup of \"water\" to the mix, the resulting ice cream was still creamy and rich, with no unpleasant iciness. This tasted darn close to a Key Lime or lemon pie and I'm thinking some coarsely chopped graham crackers folded in at the end would be awesome good."

"reviewBody": "Fan flippin TASTIC! I have made this several different ways, beside just as written. It's great like it is, but we prefer to reverse the proportions of heavy cream and half-and-half, meaning one cup heavy cream and two cups of half-and-half. It's a bit less unctuous that way, with less cholesterol and fewer calories, allowing that fresh, clean taste to shine. It's still wonderfully creamy this way, and quite rich enough. I especially like to use Meyer lemons from our back yard, harvested just before making the base. Subbing 1/4 cup limoncello for 1/4 cup of the lemon juice keeps it scoopable right from the freezer. I have also steeped 1 cup of roughly torn basil leaves in the heated cream/sugar mix for an hour, straining the leaves out before proceeding with the custard. SPECTACULAR, as well as quite chic. We love it topped with fresh strawberries, raspberries, or blueberries. Any which way you make this, however, you're going to love it even more than you think you will. It's the type of thing that sneaks up on you. After it's all gone, you'll be pining for more."
