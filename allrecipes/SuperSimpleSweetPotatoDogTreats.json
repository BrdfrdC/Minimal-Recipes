I did discover that you have to refrigerate them because there are no preservatives so they will get moldy if you leave them out for more than a couple days. They keep in the fridge for 3-4 weeks."

I had it sitting on my counter for about three days and then decided to put them in the refrigerator because of the eggs. I’ve made other treats for my dog and normally when they’re baking they don’t have a good smell but this treat has a faint smell of the cinnamon. This recipe is a keeper."

Luckily it didn't seem to bother her. She still keeps asking me for more and my dog is not a foodie or beggar. She loves how crispy it is. Very impressed with this recipe."

I'll just add a finger-smear of peanut butter to each treat after they're done next time."

"reviewBody": "Seeing that many people had issues with the really sticky dough- this should help:I upped the flour in the mix until it was more of a workable dough.Do that by feel...Heavy flour on board- used my bench scraper to incorporate it with a few folds- another addition to board and dust the top. I did NOT ROLL THIS. I patted it out. Flouring hands as needed. Also dipped my cutter in flour every few times and kept it clean.RE folded the dough to use all- it got easier to work with as it was a bit drier.I used parchment paper on my sheet pan.Rotate pans midway.When they were done- I used a pastry brush to remove any excess dusting flour- a small extra step- but necessary due to the texture of dough. Then put them back into the warm but Off oven- to dry out more.My friend’s finicky dogs loved these too.My 4- absolutely loved them.I got over 100 pieces(small hearts- see picture)I actually ate one- not bad at all!N.B. You can sub the sweet potato with bananaOr sub the applesauce with banana.Don’t be afraid of adding more flour as neededUse your judgment.I should mention- I have a degree in Culinary and a few European certifications.So my tips have a bit of knowledge behind them.Happy baking for your fur babies everyone!"

Used chunky applesauce, only 2 cups of whole wheat flour, 1 tsp each of molasses, honey and cinnamon and 1/3 cup of peanut butter. The dough was gathered into a large ball, covered and chilled overnight. Only the normal amount of flour was needed to roll out the dough. It was only slightly sticky. My doggie nephew enjoyed it both times. My doggie niece liked it the first time but not the second. The second time, I used a medicine bottle to cut the dough into little doggie cookies. Great recipe! Thanks!"

"reviewBody": "OH MY GOSH I was so surprised by these!\nMy 13 year old golden, Roxy, was recently diagnosed with kidney disease so we've been trying to change her diet a little. Low protein foods are better for her kidneys as well as foods like sweet potatoes and apples.. (Well, they're good for humans with kidney disease id assume they're good for dogs too!) Roxy LOVES meat and cheese which stinks because that's the exact opposite of what she should be eating. I decided to make these because why not? It's worth a try! She usually hates vegetables though. Anyway, after I baked them I woke her up and handed her a piece. She loved it so much she followed me back into the kitchen for more!!! I'm so happy I've finally found a treat that's good for her and she actually likes!"

My dog LOVES, LOVES, LOVES, them and sweet potatoes are really good for her diabetes. I just wonder how long they will stay in the refrigerator, I froze half, and put the rest in a baggie in the fridge. She is little and only gets a 1/2 cookie about 3 times a day. But I guess I will have to figure it out, because my lil Macy girl is hooked on them."
