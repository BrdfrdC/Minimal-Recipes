I used 1/4 habanero pepper, decreased cayenne to 1/2 tsp and decreased hot sauce to 3 shakes. I may add a little more lemon and/or chopped parsley. This is one recipe that will always be prepared a little differently in my household - we love variations, but this base is great!!"

He absolutely LOVED it (I don't do the spicy stuff) and ate a whole weeks worth in one day that by the time I got home he already ate it. So I took a photo of the remnants. :-) he stated it has a better texture, as in its not smooth like the store kind, and tastes more fresh than the store bought. I will definitely be making this again."

Incredibly delicious."

I think cayenne are my favourite peppers so I admit, having followed the recipe to the letter, I ended up adding some more cayenne on top, but as is this is a five-star recipe. I added an extra Tbsp of olive oil because it seemed a bit dry but this is our preference. Also, next time, I will add a fresh cayenne in with the mix. Thank you for the recipe."
