However, I don’t eat a lot of red meat and got tired of waiting to make this so I just made the “surf” part. I substituted 1T of onion powder in place of the minced onion just out of preference. I grilled the shrimp skewers on my Foreman grill and they were awesome! Will make again."

"reviewBody": "This is a great recipe! As with the other reviews, the shrimp marinade was Soo delicious, although I may have marinated the shrimp too long (6+hours). My marinade got thick and solidified on my shrimp. (too much butter?) I used my homemade old Bay seasoning and since I didn't have parsley, I used fresh cilantro. I also added a squeeze of lime. I can't wait to try this again. The filet speaks for itself... extra thick, steak rub, medium done. Perfect! Here in Indiana it's mushroom season. So I added fried morel mushrooms to this dinner. Nothing better... oh, except the strawberry shortcake I made for dessert."

I LOVED the shrimp so much! So much, that I enjoyed them MORE than the steak (unheard of, as I'm a steak lover)!!! Just, wow. This will be my go-to marinade for shrimp from now on. In fact, I want to try to make a scampi with linguine and fresh parmesan. The possibilities are endless. Make this and impress your friends. Thank you for this fantastic recipe!"

Still turned out wonderful. I think I need to perfect my timing on the scallops, I think they should soak in the sauce longer than the shrimp was supposed to."

The shrimp seasoning was delicious, we plan to make it again soon - we did not make enough for left overs. In the future we will be doubling the shrimp so we can have leftovers! We had cesaer salad (the shrimp went especially well with that) and baked potatoes as our sides and it was a great evening. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"

I made this on the Cuisinart Griddler en brochette, the steak and shrimp each on separate skewers because of different cooking times.
