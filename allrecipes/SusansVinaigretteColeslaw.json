"reviewBody": "This is a good recipe, a bit sweet for my taste but no harm done. The thing I haven’t seen mentioned in these comments is the difference between a good slaw and a great slaw. The key, is thin veggies. The only way I’ve found to achieve the required thinness is with a mandolin slicer. Take care not to lose any appendages! Those bagged veggies just won’t do! Use whatever veggies and spices that suit you but make sure to slice those veggies paper thin! You won’t regret it. Unless of course you slice off a finger so be careful!"

But I am going to do just that, because I kept proportions (mostly) the same and four people polished off an entire bag of coleslaw mix dressed with this in one sitting. I wanted an Asian slaw, so I reduced one tablespoon of the canola oil with sesame oil; replaced the white sugar with brown sugar; replaced the poppy seeds with sesame seeds; replaced half the mustard powder with ginger; used sriracha as the hot sauce; replaced some of the salt with soy sauce; and threw in some thinly sliced green onions. People declared it the best coleslaw they ever had, and a guest who doesn't like cole slaw had two servings. The only alteration I made to proportions was to cut the sugar back by a tablespoon. I'm glad I did and might cut it back even further next time. And next time I need a regular cole slaw, I will make this recipe as written (with the reduction of the sugar!)"

Much better to me. I think that this is also a great vinegarette for everyday salads. I use it a lot and can change flavors with just using different vinegars. Sherry vinegar is my favorite."

I will make this over and over again; I've made two batches in the last few days and again, there is none leftover."
