"reviewBody": "I thought these were pretty good. I had to cook them quite a bit longer than recommended, but I think that might be because of my potatoes, not the recipe. I love little additions that reviewers add to recipes, but I made these the same as the recipe says. The base, without salt or pepper, is a bit bland (of course), so I added quite a bit of each, and, because I still thought something was missing, I added some garlic powder (in lieu of the real stuff) to my helping (other's don't like garlic, so the rest is still unseasoned in that regard). Thus, I think these are pretty good mashed potatoes, but not the best because of the lack of garlic. One might also want to heat up the cold ingredients before mixing together."

Turned out great for my first time making mashed potatoes from scratch!\n\nTweaks:\nI scaled the recipe up for 5 pounds of potatoes, and the ratios for the butter and sour cream were spot on still. I was hesitant to put that much milk in as I like my potatoes nice and thick so I added it a little at a time, and I only used about 2/3 cup of milk (recipe ratio would have been 1.25 cups) so that's one of those things that doesn't scale linearly. I also scaled up the time that I cooked the potatoes to 30 minutes as I had a lot more potatoes to cook and some of them were kind of large."

This is a personal preference, not a flaw in the recipe. Keeping in mind also that I did use high quality unsalted Irish butter, so maybe that bumped up the richness factor. I salted my potato water generously and also added some salt near the end to taste. less than 1/2 tsp probably."

Its funny that after all the recipes I've tried I had never made home made mashed potatoes.I know right!! This recipe was my first. This recipe was also the first that I had finally decided to sign up for an account with allrecipes.com, as well as my first food review. This recipe was great! It was easy, and I took a few recommendations from other reviewers, such as heating the milk, butter, and sour cream before adding to the potatoes, and I also added some minced garlic and garnished with chives!

"reviewBody": "When made with the quantities listed, it was too liquid for my taste. After combining everything, I cooked it a bit more on low heat to evaporate some of the liquid and thicken things up. Still not quite my style; I prefer a more “fluffy” mashed potato, which this was not, but at least it salvaged the side for us. Probably won’t make again, as I have other mashed potato recipes I like more."

If chicken stock isn’t on hand, then boil the water and add a few boullion cubes or better than boullion mix to the water and mix it in before adding the potatoes. It makes for more depth of flavor instead of just salting the water."

I would recommend, while the potatoes are boiling, to heat all other ingredients together in a bowl in the microwave or on the stovetop, so that when they’re added to the potatoes, everything stays nice and hot!! We love these, thanks for the wonderful recipe!!"

Occassionally I add loose frozen spinach when I drain the potatoes …… GREAT AGAIN."
