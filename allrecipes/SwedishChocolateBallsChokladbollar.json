"reviewBody": "These taste so good. I don’t even know how to describe them. I had to use what I had on hand: salted butter, table salt, sweetened shredded coconut, &amp; Keurig caramel flavored coffee. I took Chef Johns suggestion and used powdered sugar as an option to avoid a grittiness. I left out the cayenne and I didn’t toast the oats. (I just don’t care for pan toasted oats or nuts personally). One thing I would not substitute is rolled oats for the quick oats. I have tried that in other recipes and the texture is not good. I missed the part about rolling in coconut and I had already stirred it in the bowl. It seemed fine to me. These would be an easy and safe treat for a child to make. Except they seem to melt quickly because of the coconut oil. So, they may be a bit messy. I used a cookie scoop and got 18. Ty so much John."
