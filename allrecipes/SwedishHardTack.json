The last time I did this, I added a quarter teaspoon of mint just before I rolled it out. Also, I like using other shapes besides triangles. Great recipe."

"reviewBody": "Ummm ummm, right out of the oven with hot coffee and cream honey, delicious. Any mountain man, or Civil War buff can appreciate the light sweetness and crumbly texture of this recipe. I substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour with the all-purpose flour and found it more than acceptable. Might not have the shelf life of old-fashioned military hardtack but there won't be enough left for you to carry around after you spead on some honey or deviled ham."

"reviewBody": "With a few minor tweaks, this recipe is just as good as the stuff grandma used to make : ) There was no measurement for salt so I used discretion and put in 1/4 of a teasoon. I also used margarine instead of butter and and I swapped out the buttermilk for 3/4 cup of skim milk mixed with 1/4 cup of fat-free sour cream. Splenda instead of sugar and whole-wheat flour completed my transformation of this recipe. Grandma also made it a bit softer so I brushed it with melted margarine before baking it and shortened the baking time to 6 minutes."
