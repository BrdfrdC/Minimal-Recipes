Once mixed like a pastry crust I divide it in half roll out each half to a rope, place both ropes on a standard cookie sheet (11x15), cover with plastic wrap and with a roller, roll dough to two 4 in wide by length of pan pieces. Remove wrap. Second layer made as instructed, spread half over each crust. Bake as directed. When just barely cooled spread with icing. I make my icing using vanilla, not almond and up to 2 Tablespoons warm water instead of dairy. I then sprinkle with chopped pecans or walnuts depending on choice of diners. For my family I have to make at least 8 of these (4 recipes, do not do more than double at a time) to feed my children and grandchildren. This has been a tradition of being served first thing Christmas morning just before gift opening."

"reviewBody": "I have been making this pastry recipe for 35 years. My recipe is the same as this one with the addition of sprinkling toasted slivered almonds over the top of the pastry after the icing. I noticed that one reviewer suggested making the pate choux without the short crust. This would be a mistake and would completely change not only the texture but also the flavor of the pastry and is not worth saving a few minutes. One tip for making the pate choix, after boiling the water and butter, add the flour all at once and stir completely until smooth and pulls away from the pan. Stir until cooled before adding eggs one at a time in order to prevent cooking the eggs as they are added."

"reviewBody": "This is an easy pastry; rich and is not too sweet; good with coffee. The sweetness comes only from the frosting. It's really nothing more than a pie crust base with pate choux (cream puff or Ã©clair dough) spread on top! The top collapses because it has one less egg than traditional pate choux and it's spread out over the pastry crust so it doesn't have the same heat exposure of smaller crustless pastries. I imagine this could be made as a savory pastry by the addition of some grated firm cheese and herbs stirred into the top layer (called a gougere )to be used as an appetizer (without extract and frosting, of course!)"

It's true that the first two layers aren't sweet, but the icing layer soaks in and adds just enough sweetness. I wouldn't change anything. We liked the different textures of each layer and it wasn't overly sweet for an after dinner dessert. This is nice as a light dessert or morning pastry."

"reviewBody": "This was just okay to me. It was very rich and buttery, but didn't have much flavor, besides an extremely strong almond extract flavor. I even cut the amount of extract in half for both the puff and the frosting. The pastry looked just gorgeous, even though it fell a bit. I frosted it when the puff was cool, and sprinkled it with toasted sliced almonds. However, I was really unimpressed with the taste and texture of this. The puff sank, and created a very strange, flavorless custard-like center, which was somewhat drippy and unappealing. The bottom layer was really yummy to me, like a savory shortbread. It really didn't have a lot of flavor though, but the texture was magnificent. Altogether, this recipe is definitely not inedible, but I wouldn't make it again."

The middle layer needs more flavor and sweetness. It was very bland. The best part was the frosting. I think I might try this again but skip the bottom layer of crust because it really doesn't need it and it just crumbles and is dry and flavorless. I will add some sugar to the middle layer and more almond flavor. I couldn't taste any almond in the middle layer. Also, I don't know if it just my oven, but I don't usually have a problem and I bake A LOT....but I baked for 55 minutes and it looked done, I stuck in a toothpick and it came out clean, but it was NOT done in the middle. I tried to stick it back in but by the time I got it in, it had already flattened out and it was too late. Don't trust the toothpick test. I think when it looks done, keep it in another 10 minutes or something. I am going to try to find another recipe, but if I can't find one, then I'm going to try this again and alter it."

"reviewBody": "This is one of my favorite pastries. It looks &amp; tastes so fancy but is easy to make. I've found 1/2 tsp. almond flavoring is enough both in the 2nd layer &amp; in the frosting.\nBe sure and mix the water, butter &amp; flour well before adding the eggs in the second layer or you will have a gloppy mess. Also it's probably important to add the eggs one at a time and beat after each. I sometimes take shortcuts in recipes, but this is one you should follow pretty carefully.\nWhen I make these I divide the first dough into 2 parts and flatten on an ungreased cookie sheet to make 2 strips three inches wide and the length of the sheet. Then I spread the second layer evenly over each crust. \nI also use skim milk in the frosting &amp; it turns out great."
