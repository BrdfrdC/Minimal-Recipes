The real recipe has no sour cream, no ginger (not optional at all), no brown sugar (use juniper berry jelly if needed), beef broth or veal broth is used to get the flavor right. Tips: Use soy sauce to get the right color, shred the onion to not get too many big pieces and use heavy cream for the sauce too"

"reviewBody": "Have made this recipe dozens of times with some modifications. I use 1/2 C of plain panko breadcrumbs with the heavy cream and I substitute ground chicken (not ground chicken breast) for the pork/beef. The rest of the ingredients remain as-written (and I always use the Tbsp of brown sugar) and I use closer to a 1/2 C chicken broth than a 1/4 C. The other modification is in the cooking method, I use only a 3 qt saute pan for the dish. I saute the onion in the pan while the breadcrumbs soak up the cream and mix together per the recipe and cook the meatballs in two batches in the pan (makes ~24 meatballs so 12 and 12). Ground chicken tends to flatten out a bit more than red meats so they wind up with flatter edges but nobody seems to mind and nobody has ever said anything to me about that (and they all loved it). Once the second batch is done I throw the first batch back in, add the broth, cover, put into the oven and bake. Once that's done I'll take the pan out of the oven, remove the meatballs and back to the stovetop for the roux. At this point I may use a little more butter as chicken doesn't yield nearly the amount of fat that the beef/pork will. I think the fond in the bottom of the pan from the browning and baking is a key to knocking these out of the park. As long as you didn't burn anything that stuff is pure flavor and with everything cooking in the same pan leaves none of that to waste. For that I'm hesitant to brown the meatballs on a baking sheet to keep them 'rounder'. After I finish the roux, simmering the sauce and adding the sour cream the meatballs return to the pan to warm and simmer in the sauce for a bit. Then the whole thing seems to get devoured with the egg noodles no matter how much I make. Five stars for the inspiration!"

"reviewBody": "WONDERFUL and so authentic. I love the simplicity of this recipe and the results were incredible: tender flavorful meatballs, a savory gravy, all atop fluffy, creamy egg noodles. The nutmeg is the star player and transforms the meatballs into an exotic comfort food. I followed the recipe closely but only added a quarter cup sour cream. Take note: The recipe AS IS will really only serve two adults and 2 children. After all, It’s only about a pound of meat, and roughly 30 tiny meatballs. They’re so delectable , you can seriously eat 8 meatballs, maybe more. I recommend getting a pound of pork and a pound of beef, and just doubling the recipe if you are feeding 4-6 adults. it reheats beautifully. I’m eating leftovers today and I swear it’s even better than yesterday. If you like Swedish meatballs, try this recipe. It’s a keeper!"

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe almost exactly as written with two modifications. I didn't have bread, so I used panko breadcrumbs. And, as some other writers suggested, I added a little nutmeg to the gravy at the end. Two aspects of the recipe were a little confusing. One is the amount of sour cream. It says half (8 oz) container sour cream. Does this mean half of an 8 oz container, meaning 4 oz? Or is it a total of 8 oz? My husband and I disagreed on the interpretation, so I went with the 4 oz interpretation and the gravy was superb. If others are using the full 8 oz, I can see why they feel there is too much sour cream. The other aspect that was confusing is whether the pan drippings are coming from the saute skillet or the baking casserole. I used both. In any case, it was a true winner recipe! My husband was totally wowed! Me too."

"reviewBody": "These meatballs were delicious! So this is what I did and didn't deviate much at all. With my kitchenaid and grinder attachment I ground trimmed bottom round once then added sweet Italian sausage. (3lb beef to 1lb sausage) added my spices then ground again. I had so much that I had to mix the eggs and soaked breadcrumbs with the dough hook. Too much to pan fry so I broild them to crop them up. it made 188 1\" meatballs. I used the 24 servings because it doesn't state how many counted as a serving! so I'm guessing it's about 8. I baked 2 dozen as directed then using drippins, beef stock and a pinch of each spice plus sautéed fresh mushrooms I made the gravy. The more you make the more time consuming it is. So what did I do with the rest? I filled 7 pint jars and pressure canned them in the stock. I can then turn it into gravy when we open them up. My husband absolutely loved them for his birthday dinner."

The meatballs are extremely soft and tender and yummy, the gravy is perfect. I didn't have any egg noodles, so served them over farfalle pasta, which was the closest I had to flat noodles, and it was totally delicious. My BF grew up with several Swedish friends and used to eat meals over their houses, and he said these taste just like those. You always hear that it's rather challenging to make Swedish meatballs, so I am happy they turned out so great on my first try!"

I try not to handle or mix the meatballs too much and I think it makes a difference. I loved the gravy too. I think heavy cream would have great results too instead of sour cream as I saw a lot of reviews frowning on the sour cream. I liked it though. I felt the drippings I used in the gravy to be enough for that “beefy” flavor. I have made this recipe twice. Once exactly as is and once with venison and the pork. I was very worried about the venison but it was so good. It took any “gamey” taste right out. Thank you for sharing!"

I added some allspice, nutmeg and ginger to the gravy as well, and that did the trick! \n\nLike others, I went easier on the broth, as well as the sour cream. And since it's what I had, I used only beef broth, not both chicken and beef. \n\nWith spaetzle, it was a real treat! And now we have leftovers!"

I tripled the recipe because I happened to have 2 pounds of ground beef and 1 pound of ground turkey thawed, and I’m so glad I did! The meatballs were so tender and flavorful, and with the gravy they were swoon worthy. I served them with mashed potatoes, and my family ate way too much. The leftovers warm up beautifully too— I nuked the meatballs and warmed the gravy on low in a saucepan. Even after freezing, they were just as good."

(Have to get my gas oven fixed.) then I added the gravy mixture to the meatballs after some fo the broth evaporated. I added some more nutmeg &amp; allspice to the gravy.

The mixture comes out very soft which can be tricky when you are browning as they can start to come apart. But the gravy is delicious!!! I find it doesn't require as much sour cream as the recipe calls for, so start with less and add if you want. Sooo good with mashed potatoes. A new favorite."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was amazing!!!! After reading the reviews I also followed the recipe regarding soaking the breadcrumbs in cream and using all the spices. I upped the serving size to 10 to equal my meat weight because I used 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground pork (2# total) and to get correct ratios for all the ingredients and spices. I followed the instructions, kept all the spices the same and used all of them, even the ginger, seared the meatballs in a pan with butter and put in a baking dish. I used beef stock instead of chicken stock for the baking dish and baked as directed 30 minutes with foil and that was the perfect time. I used the drippings from the fry pan in addition to the drippings from the bake pan and made a wonderful gravy with the remaining beef stock. I used half of the amount of sour cream recommend based on my serving size of 10, which ended up being about 4 oz because like past reviews we liked a meatier gravy. I added a little bit of fresh chopped parsley to the gravy and served with egg noodles. My husband and my kids loved this meal and my husband actually said I could serve it at a dinner party! we will definitely be making this one again!!!! Thanks NomNom!"

I omitted the brown sugar and used slightly less sour cream. I had more than a pound of hamburger to use, so I increased the other ingredients accordingly. \n\nThe downside is that it was time-consuming to make, brown, and bake so many meatballs. Luckily my son was available to help. Even so, I was tempted to simply scramble and fry the meat mixture and then stir in the gravy. I may do that next time for a much faster meal prep. It wouldn't be Swedish meatballs, of course, but the flavor would be about the same."

I also added a couple of drops of Worcestershire sauce to the sauce and only used one big scoop of sour cream. Everything else stayed the same. I didn't use \"day old\" bread because I forgot to leave it out, so the meatballs were very wet and the cooked meatballs were incredibly soft. However, my son actually liked the extra soft meatballs.

"reviewBody": "About a year ago, I made this exactly as written, but had to purchase the meats since we are hunters and usually only have venison present. This recipe was so delicious that I had to try it with venison, so the second time around, I used 2lbs of venison and replaced the cream with buttermilk (this eliminates any \"gamey\" taste from the venison). This recipe came out even better with the venison and buttermilk, in my family's opinion. I've read the reviews that say they would use less sour cream, but honestly, some of us loved that sour cream taste and some of us would have preferred it with a little less.... so it is really a personal taste kind of thing. I'm making this again tonight and plan to put sour cream on the table and allow people to add however much they prefer ;)"

"reviewBody": "So good! Read the reviews before hand and used less sour cream in the end and it turned out amazing. Didn’t use ginger, as I didn’t have any and I used ground turkey meat instead. I can only compare them to IKEA meatballs and those pre-package seasonings at the store, but honestly, these are by far the best Swedish Meatballs I’ve ever had! Definitely adding this to my recipes to use again and again! I put them over Amish Egg noodles which were good, but I think I’d like this better with mashed potatoes, so next time we’ll try that route. Great Recipe!"
