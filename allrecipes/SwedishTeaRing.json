I shaped one piece into a circle and the other roll I cut down the center and then made a twisted braid. Before baking I brushed them with cream and sprinkled coarse sugar on top. Will definitely make this again"

Although we devoured a ring almost immediately... it is not quite as good as my mom's. I followed the recipe but added 1/4 tsp more yeast as another person suggested. The rings didn't rise much. I remember my mom's Swedish Tea Ring as being denser. They rose better and were wonderful. I will give this a try one more time but I may keep searching for a new recipe. Good, but not quite as good as I'd hoped. BTW- I used vanilla in the icing vs. almond extract."

"reviewBody": "I used to have a bread machine cookbook with this recipe in it, and this was the one recipe I missed. This is almost exactly it. Of course I don't have a bread machine anymore, so I had to make by hand. Still delicious. I used dried cherries because that's what I had on hand, and I added some chopped pecans. I got praise from everyone who tried it.\n\nIf you want to make it without a bread machine its pretty easy. I warmed the milk in the microwave then added the yeast and let it sit for about 15 minutes. Place the milk/yeast in a stand mixer and add the egg, sugar, and salt. Add the flour, mix until absorbed, then the butter. Mix until doughy. Cover and let sit for 1-1/2 hours then proceed with the recipe."

Also, I'd like to mention that although I love that the recipe makes two rings, they are a bit small. That being said, the instructions were well written and it looked great."

"reviewBody": "I only wanted one coffee cake so I cut the recipe in half. Because I don’t use a bread machine, I proofed the yeast in the milk @ 110º with a teaspoon of sugar and then finished off the rest of the dough in my KA, kneading it on my pastry board at the very end, and then set it aside for its first rise. As another review noted, the filling does escape slightly from the dough during baking, but there is plenty of cinnamon-roll flavor. This recipe makes a wonderful coffee cake that is as scrumptious as it is attractive."

"reviewBody": "I had such high hopes for this bread but was very disappointed. I should have known there would be a problem when I saw the amount of yeast...3/4 teaspoon is a third of a package of yeast and that was suppose to make two bread rings rise??? It came out of my bread machince just fine, but after 1 1/2 hours of letting the rings rise, they hadn't grown at all. I baked them anyway and there was brown sugar all over the cookie sheets and the bottom of my oven. They didn't rise at all during the baking time either."
