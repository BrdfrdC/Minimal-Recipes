It was the only pie that was completely gone Thanksgiving night. (I make 8 pies). I used butter instead of margarine. I would do heaping amounts for the pie crust, mine came out a touch small. Other than that, perfection!! I'll make this every year now! Oh, I will NEVER use blueberry pie filling from a can again!"

"reviewBody": "This is flawed. The consistency is way too loose. The fam loved the flavor but the inside; even set flows off the crust. I even made some modifications based on the reviews and the pictures. I doubled the amount of cornstarch and only 3/4 C of sugar in the blueberry topping and it was very sweet. I only added a 1/2 can of milk and it was still plenty sweet. I can’t imagine using the full amount of sugar or Sweetened condensed milk- it would be way too sweet and super runny."

I poured the blueberries directly over the crust and realized that it was the cream cheese filling that I should have poured in first. I poured the cream cheese filling over the blueberries and marbled the top. It still came out delicious. The crust is amazing and I will be using that for other recipes. Thanks for the recipe."

After I put the cream cheese layer over the crust, I sprinkled some lemon zest over it before I put the blueberries on top. I used about a tablespoon. The recipe turned out amazing! I will definitely make this again! It’s much easier than the recipe I was using and it tastes just as good if not better!"

"reviewBody": "This was simply wonderful. I used butter not margarine but otherwise followed the recipe as written and served it at a dinner party....and then shared the recipe with everyone there. The crust is so delicious and unexpected I'd like to try a modification of it as a topping on a crumble. Just the right amount of sweetness, the lemon really boosts the berry flavor and the creamy centre was divine. I loved how easy it was to get it out of the pan without it falling apart as well - presentation was lovely. Thank you so much for a new favorite at my house."

I used frozen blueberries and will add an extra Tablespoon of cornstarch next time. Hopefully that will thicken the blueberries a little more. The cream base wasn't very firm either, but it was okay. Flavor was a 10"
