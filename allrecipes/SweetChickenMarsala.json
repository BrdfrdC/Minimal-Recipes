"reviewBody": "I made this recipe last night for 7 of us. I followed the recipe as written with the exception that I eliminated the Karo syrup and I added 1/2 cup extra of marsala wine. I wanted a little more sauce for the rice I was serving along with the chicken, thus the extra wine. Next time I may increase the sauce a little more, but the flavor of this recipe was great. A little time consuming but well worth it."

Also why is there no basic seasoning on the chicken?? Salt &amp; pepper before tossing in the pan to cook. Not sure I'll make this again."

I made it for dinner this evening with my 2 adult children and their spouses who all raved about this recipe. A keeper for sure. The only change I made was to coat the chicken with flour, garlic powder, salt and pepper before placing in the pan to have a slight coating."
