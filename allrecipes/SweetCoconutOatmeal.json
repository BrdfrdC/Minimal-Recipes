"reviewBody": "Delicious and easy to make. I used about 2.5 cups of heavy cream and a little over 1 cup to get 3.5 cups in replacement of the coconut milk. I had left over heavy cream from the holidays thst I wanted to get rid of before it went bad. The oatmeal turned out creamy, flavorful and thick. My husband and 2 year old loved it. I doubled the recipe and so instead of using 2 tsp of cinnamon, I would recommend 1.5 tsp. Thank you for the recipe."

It was tasty, and with the Silk coconut milk it has a lot fewer calories than the canned. I topped it with raw honey, a handful of blueberries and a splash of coconut milk. I would most definitely make it again."

"reviewBody": "This was delicious! I had half a can of coconut milk left over and was scouting Allrecipes for a way to put it to use. I used 2/3 c of coconut milk, about 1 c water, 1 c rolled oats, and 5 generous dashes of cinnamon. I brought the coconut milk and water to a gentle boil (barely looked like boiling) with the lid on the pot - took about 20 minutes. After mixing the oatmeal in, I let it sit for 15 minutes without the lid, then stirred in cinnamon and immediately removed the pot from the stove. The oatmeal was rich and creamy, with a perfect amount of coconut and cinnamon flavor. 10/10 would make again"

"reviewBody": "Very decadent oatmeal recipe! It was a nice treat, but not something I'd make every day. It was definitely tasty, but very rich. If I make this again, I'll either use light coconut milk, or use half coconut milk/half water. I only used half the amount of honey and half the brown sugar and that was plenty sweet for me, but given that the name of the recipe is Sweet Coconut Oatmeal, you may wish to use the full amount, and yes, it will be sweet! I also used unsweetened coconut, and sprinkled some over top before serving."
