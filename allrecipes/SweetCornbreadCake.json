Since I was only cooking for four people, I cut the recipe in half and cooked it in a 9\" x 9\" square baker. It turned out perfect. Because it is thick, be patient. Wait for the top to crisp and crack. I've made this twice now, and the first time I took it out too early. The second time was perfect!!"

I had a bunch of very ripe bananas so I used all the dry ingredients and mixed 2 cups water with 4 ripe bananas and a mixture of oil/melted butter to equal a cup. I didn't add the honey because the bananas made it sweet. It was supposed to be a breakfast bread in the morning, and luckily, there is still some left for tomorrow, because we had it for dessert. So moist. The point being that use what you have and adapt. Breads are versatile and breakfast breads are a treat."

I FORGOT to add the honey to the mixture, so I made honey butter instead, and brushed it over the hot cornbread as soon as it came out of the oven. I subbed b'milk instead of regular milk. The cornbread was so moist, and it baked up nice and soft. I also baked this in a 10 in cast iron skillet. I ate this with a basic chili recipe on a rainy, and cold day.. The few leftover slices we had? I nuked my portion of cornbread in the microwave for about 30 seconds...Mmmmm hmmmmm!!! Tasted like it was just made! I'm a southern girl, and this is not my usual way of making cornbread, NEVERTHELESS, it's a cornbread CAKE, and I really enjoyed this one, and so did my fiance... a nice change from the norm! This WILL be MY go to when I want to break tradition and do something different with my cornbread! Thanks for sharing! Peace and blessings!"

I did use 1 1/2 c. cornmeal and 2 1/2 c. flour. I used half brown sugar and half white sugar. I used buttermilk instead of regular milk, and I listened to the original submitter and added some baking soda. I have been searching for a cornbread that is moist and not dry like the recipe on the cornmeal box!\nThis one fits the bill!"

"reviewBody": "I’ve never heard if cornbread “cake” before and I did not like it at all. The flour to corn meal ratio was off and I did not enjoy the cake like texture of it. Cornbread is supposed to be gritty/grainy the way cornmeal is, and this was fluffy and soft, more like cake. \nI give it 3 stars because it wasn’t bad for what it was, it’s just not cornbread. Now I understand the 1 star review that said it’s great for people who don’t like cornbread. I tossed it and made a simpler smaller recipe that turned out perfect. I’m just disappointed that I used the eggs and milk for this recipe and it didn’t turn out the way I wanted."

I think it gives it more of a cornbread texture while still keeping the cake texture. It tastes wonderful very sweet, moist and tastes great with chili (or just by itself). This is the only cornbread we make anymore."
