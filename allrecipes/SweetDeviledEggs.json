"reviewBody": "Great recipe, however I did make slight changes. I used spicy mustards &amp; a Tsp of real honey. I also cut the tip off a 'New' Rx dispenser syringe &amp; it was perfect for injecting each egg half with the mixture. I had very little left over &amp; probably could've used it all but I don't like my eggs too stuffed. Again, delicious recipe! Highly recommend to try it for a something new twist on traditional deviled eggs :)"
