Just sprinkle enough for each slice at a time, or the flakes will end up all at the bottom soaking up your batter mixture and become a soggy mess at the bottom.\nI just put the flakes in a Ziploc baggy and beat them to smithereens!!\nEasy, delicious recipe."

"reviewBody": "I did like the crunch from the cornflakes but the idea of soaking these for 2-3 minutes is unrealistic unless you are using a baking dish or something that fits all of your bread. I doubled the mix and put like 7 pieces of bread in and it soaked the ENTIRE MIX UP. So if you need to double or can’t fit all of your pieces in the batter at once you really need to portion the mix out. I am sure the fact that the pieces soaked up all of that mix significantly affected the flavor so I can only give this 2 stars."

Only dipped the bread in the egg mixture for a couple of seconds on each side rather than soaking them. Fried them in melted butter and poured maple syrup on top. It was more like dessert and so very delicious!"
