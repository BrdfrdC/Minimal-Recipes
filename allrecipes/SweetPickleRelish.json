"reviewBody": "This is a great recipe, but I'm also disappointed that the amount of cucumbers isn't designated by weight rather than amount. For a relish similar to store-bought, send all of the ingredients through a food processor; it's fast and you wont have huge chunks. I also did some research, and it's recommended to let the relish sit for a week before eating to let the vinegar taste settle."
