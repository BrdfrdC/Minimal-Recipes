And that's straight out of the blender. Can't wait till it's been in the fridge and melded! Thank you--loved it. (Added more coriander &amp; lemon juice; my yams were old SO! used a CAN of sweet potatoes, rinsing all the syrup off. Don't know the difference, so, don't KNOW the difference.)"

The potato gave it a nice creamy texture and a light sweet taste, and the seasoning was mild.\n\nOne thing I like about hummus is that you can easily make the recipe your own. One could easily spice it up by doubling or tripling the coriander and cumin, or use other spices such as garam masala or herbs."

The texture is spot on. i did not use any of the reserved liquid from the garbanzo beans, however, next time i will double the corriander and cumin and perhaps incorporate some roasted garlic as i found the recipe on its own a little bland. i will also leave the lemon zest out as i thought it to be a little overwhelming, but not terrible. Overall, a good recipe!"
