I need to share a very important step to ensuring that your pies are the best ever! There are tons of fibers in yams and sweet potatoes and if you do not extract them from your filling, your guests will get a mouth full of strings - YUCK! I learned that when I was new at pie making. So... blend and then clean your beaters under water and then blend for a second time. Trust me... it will make a difference."

I had decreased it to 1/2 cup, but find that it's still too sweet for my taste. In general, I find many recipes call for too much sugar, and in this case, sweet potatoes are already sweet. I suggest using less sugar, as they say \"less is more\" (flavor)."

I read another recipe that said to bake the sweet potatoes because it concentrates the flavor and sweetness, so I did. I also used half and half and added an extra egg because I had 3 in the carton and they were near the best by use date. Also, I weighed my yams on a scale after I peeled off the skin and used slightly more than 1 pound (not sure if I read that on this site or elsewhere). My brother and son loved it! I'll be making another one later on in the week."

"reviewBody": "I’ve made this recipe a bunch of times now. It’s become very popular. I did take the liberty to tweak it a little bit. First, I use just over a pound (1.13 to 1.24 lbs) of sweet potato or yam. In fact, I’ve come to find that doing half sweet potato and half yam is the best. I also use the skins in my pies. Just cut them up into small pieces. Second, I have been using a 10 inch graham cracker pie crust. Keebler makes one and it tends to be pretty good. Especially if you’re not making your own. Third, I use a half cup of light brown sugar instead of one cup of white sugar. I also add 1/4 teaspoon of all-purpose white flour and 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda because the brown sugar adds moisture. But my last pie I added a 1/2 teaspoon of King Arthur’s pancake mix instead of flour and baking soda. Fourth, I use my hand mixer with the regular beaters to mix it very well. Then I switch the the whisks and mix it for another 30 seconds da to a minute. Then back to the regular beaters for a little bit more. I do t know why I do this, but it just seems right. 🤷🏼‍♂️"

I used half as much sugar (we don't like super sweet things) and I used three eggs but I used all the suggested amounts of everything else for one pie except we didn't have vanilla extract. Having said all of that, this was super easy to make once the potatoes were boiled, cooled and skinned. The filling took twice as long to set. I had to bake the pies for two hours. Final verdict: Delicious. Simply delicious. MUCH better than you can buy in the grocery store and more flavorful than a pumpkin pie. I also made whipped cream from scratch. This is my go-to recipe for Thanksgiving pie from now on. Five stars."

Cover edges with foil, bake up to 15 additional minutes. Let pie rest at least an hour before cutting. This is a really good basic sweet potato pie. You will need to make it your own with your tweeks. I use brown sugar, more cinnamon and 1/8 tsp allspice. My mom liked to add ginger. Make it your own!"

"reviewBody": "This was a really great recipe, but I did make quite a few alterations the second time around. To combat the thinnesses of the batter, I put 1.5lbs of sweet potato. I ran it through a strainer to get all the stingy bits out. Next I only put in 1/2 a cup of sugar as the potatoes added more than enough sweetness. I am a fan of bold flavors so I did double the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg, I also added 1/2 tsp of clove, and and a tsp of ginger. To thicken it up a bit more, I did add 1 more small egg or 1/2 an egg if you don’t have a small one, and a tablespoon of flour slowly sifted into the mix. I also added a dusting of sugar on the top to make a nice thin sugar shell on top."

The mix looked too thin so I added more sweet potato and it was a little too much for the pie crust. When I took it to my friend, he LOVED it. He ate the whole pie in two days! I have never made a pie before and if I can do it, anyone can!"

I \n halved them - had 3 and they were the \n very round kind. 1200 watt oven for 3 \n minutes x 3 times, but check for \n doneness after each increment. Peeled \n them when they cooled.\n3. Used a refrigerated pie crust - we \n weren't really going to eat it anyway.\n4. Used 1/4 cup almond milk and 1/4 cup \n heavy cream\n5. Used my food processor for the whole \n thing - SO EASY!\nThis recipe has always been so good, but I wasn't sure it would adapt to KETO -glad I tried it - it did not disappoint!"
