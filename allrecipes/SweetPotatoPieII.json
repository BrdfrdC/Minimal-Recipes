"reviewBody": "Other than the fact I pressure cooked the sweet potatoes, with just required liquid to cook. Used slotted silicone spoon to help drain and get out onto a plate. Then carefully tipping sideways to drain again. Changed the spices to short 2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice instead. Didnt have ginger powder. Used condensed milk instead of evaporated. The baking difference was longer cook time. 45 minutes longer over the last 30. But, I slowly decreased oven temp, within that 45, upon checking wasn't set yet. 15 mins. past lowered to 325. Checked again after 10 mins. then lowered to 300, due to nice carmelation on top. I googled how to jazz up store bought crust. Melt 4 Tblsp. butter. Cool and add 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. rum. I melted the butter before making pie. Since it cooled quickly. Stir together gently. Brush the entire crust, just before filling. I made 2 pies and still had small bit of extras of the butter mix. Yes, this is \"sweet\" potato pie. Not overly sweet. Just delicious! Today, having a slice, I even sprinkled powdered sugar on top after gently warmed in microwave. As others have said, this is better than pumpkin!!"

Guess I'll see how it tastes but as far as looks go it isn't good!!!!!"

I've baked pumpkin pies in a bakery before and when we took them out of the oven they were very jiggly in the middle, but still looked exactly the same as when I put them in the oven. This pie puffed up so much and it's starting to settle pretty well and the size has gone down but I'm not sure if its all the way set even though the top is golden brown and even cooked to the point of cracking...I'm making it for a friend so I just hope it doesn't turn out like an unedible soup. I did taste some of the batter before I baked it and to me it was a good amount of sweetness--not too much. Definitely add some vanilla though."

I do bake the sweet potatoes skin on and reserve any juice/syrup they produce for the pie mix. After skinning the potatoes I mash (and string if needed) and measure. For variations I’ve topped with nuts and butter/flour crumble mix. Thanks for such a great recipe! (Note:a tip from my Mom always select small tube shaped sweet potatoes to avoid stringiness or mealy consistency)."

Some say allspice should only be used in pumpkin pie but my family hasn’t complained! My advice is to definitely bake the potatoes to get them nice and soft and make sure your mixing blades are clean when you beat the egg whites. This pie is one of my best sellers at bake sales!"

"reviewBody": "Definitely my favorite sweet potato pie recipe ever! I make it with just a couple of modifications. If you're from the Deep South, you don't need to separate the eggs. It's even tastier when it's dense - instead of fluffy. You can also use 1/2 cup light brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar, instead of 1cp brown sugar to 1/4cp white sugar. As well, I squeeze in a half of real lemon (strained) to contrast the sweet taste. I also add alumuminum around the pie edges, before cooking, because I cook the pie for about 1.25 hours - to make sure it's cooked well and the color is burnt orange. Your pie should not look like it's golden. Next time, I'm gonna try it with half and half instead of evaporated milk. Regardless, this recipe will be your go to favorite."

This makes for a more concentrated flavor. 2) puree them in the food processor - don't just mash them (my family doesn't like the fibrous texture when they're just mashed). 3) reduce the amount of sugar - I used 3/4 cup this last time. 4) Grate your own whole nutmegs, and use fresh ginger rather than the powdered stuff for a spicier kick."

I cooked it at 400 degrees for 15 minutes and reduced to 350 for 30 minutes and it was not done. I had to add an additional 10 minutes of cooking time. The pie was okay, but the butter was too much and the pie tasted bland. I wouldn't make this recipe again."

The only thing I would do next time is scale back the sugar a little as it was a bit on the sweet side for me. It's not quite so sweet eating it room temp or cooler. It is decadent while it is warm. you don't even need a crust, it makes an incredible custard. It was made with Alan' Pie Crust another winner, recipe on All Recipes also.\n\nKudo's to the Chef!!!"

Since I wasn't at home and didn't have a mixer, I didn't bother with separating the eggs (none of the other recipes call for this). I used 1 1/8 cups of brown sugar and eliminated the white sugar. Finally, I used 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of allspice. We loved it so much, I'm making it again the very next day!!!"

I don't bother to separate the eggs. I just put everything together in the bowl and stir it up until smooth, which can be done by hand. I used whole milk, not evaporated and I baked at 350 degrees for about 55 minutes. I happened to have some pecans around so I decorated the top in a circular pattern just before putting the pie in the oven. YUM!"

Very light and fluffy and mmmmm good!\nOnly thing I did different is reduce the brown sugar to 1/2cup, and upped the spices from a 1/2 tsp to a full tsp. I also added allspice which gave it a wonderful flavor. I added 15 min to the baking time and it was perfect. Don't boil the potatoes, bake them. Boiling takes away from the flavor and will make your batter more mushy than firm."

Everyone loved it!\n\nNote: Folding in the egg whites makes for a fluffier/higher pie which I learned a few years into making these for the holidays. So it's worth the trouble.\n\nMy only complaint is how long it took to set. Needed 15 extra minutes of baking total. Picture perfect when done."

If you don't separate the eggs, it will have the consistency more like pumpkin pie. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla, juice of half a lemon and the zest. I only had pumpkin pie spice, so I used a teaspoon instead of separate spices. Also, I usually bake my crust first until golden brown before filling and baking."
