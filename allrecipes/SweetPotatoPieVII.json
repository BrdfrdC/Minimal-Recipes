"reviewBody": "This was an amazingly delicious and subtle sweet potato pie, one I have made over and over. Simple to make, I also enjoyed playing with the spices to produce the best pie for your family's tastes (which is an excellent reason to make multiple pies, testing each one ;-). The only caveat is to not do what I did the first time... it says to mash the sweet potatoes so I took a handy manual potato masher and went to town. Unfortunately, there is no way to get a super-smooth consistency that way and we weren't thrilled with the pieces of sweet potato we occasionally bit into. I've learned- mashing means using electric beaters in this case and it has always been highly successful in my following attempts. I love this, strongly recommend it, and thank the lovely cook who shared it!"

My potatos were really sweet. The second time I cut back on the sugar and used s mixture of potatos - some boiled some baked and this resolved the texture issue. I am making again today, have boiled, peeled potatos in advance. They are refrigerated now and I will drain off any excess liquid from the potatos before I mix. These potatos weren't as sweet so I have to decide about the sugar - we don't like it too sweet!"

"reviewBody": "Made this exactly as per recipe except substituted plain yogurt for buttermilk as one reviewer suggested. VERY dry. Needed more liquid from the start. Even putting it into the pie shell......it was basically spooning in dry mashed potatoes. I did bake my own sweet potatoes, perhaps it would be moister with canned. Pie was already \"set\" going into the oven, and then just proceeded to crack at that point. After reading some other recipes that use evap milk, I think I'll try one of those next time. I actually did add about 1/4 cup milk to this when I saw how dry it was, but it didn't help much. Disappointed as I was making it specially for a guest at Thanksgiving. Tasted ok I guess. Mild flavor, not too spicy which was nice. Served with plenty of whipped cream to offset dryness."

I used a bit more sweet potato than called for, as I like a deep pie. so I also added a couple of tablespoons of egg whites. and a little extra baking soda, and maybe a little extra buttermilk. I often play it by ear when cooking and baking! Otherwise, just follow the recipe."

I followed directions to the \"t\" other than that but after making would definitely do some things different. For example, only one cup of sugar in recipe but pie could have been sweeter. Next time will increase to 1 1/2 cups of sugar. Secondly I would add more vanilla and add cinnaman even though the recipe doesn't call for it. Buttermilk kept it moist. Great foundation but definitely season to taste."

I adjusted the recipe by using 1/2 c. sugar; 1/4 c. brown; 2TB molasses. Then I added a shot of bourbon and spiced it to my taste. It was amazing."

"reviewBody": "This was pretty great as is, but it made way more filling than my pie shell could hold? I guess maybe I should've used a deeper pie plate but I ended up making a couple of tarts too with what crust dough I had left -- I still had to pour some of the filling out! Man. I suspect this would probably fill two relatively shallow pies or like three full sized tart pans. So just maybe keep that in mind when you're making preparations for crust. Still, super delicious, especially with some vanilla ice cream. Great way to use up mashed sweet potato! (I suspect the sweet potato I used may have already had some butter or somesuch mashed into it, so maybe that contributed to my abundance of filling? Either way it baked up fine, we just had too much of it.)"

Just sweet enough, and the perfect consistency. I loved it. I did add one half teaspoon of cinnamon, which didn't overpower the sweet potato flavor at all. Tastes best after it's been cooled to room temp or slightly chillier, and settled for a day. Will definitely make this again."

After searching AR awhile I came across this recipe...\n\nOh. My. God. It was perfect. Mine cooled overnight, but it was set up when I pulled it out of the oven! \n\nFor the most part, I followed the directions. There's a couple minor tweaks I made though:\n1. To cook my sweet potatoes, I simply stabbed them and baked them in the microwave. Easiest, fastest, and to me best way to cook em up.\n2. I cut the bake time from 70 minutes to just 60 minutes. The top of my pie was a dark orange/brown.\n3. To spice the pie (since the recipe leaves that up to you) I used three spices (in order from most amount, to least amount): cinnamon, nutmeg, &amp; ginger. I only use approx. 1/4 teaspoon of ginger, and just went up from there. It all depends on your taste!\n\nI was super nervous making the pie, my 'mashed' sweet potatoes didn't look anything like they should, they were clumpy. But, it baked up very well and we like a little texture to our pie. If you want it smooth I'd recommend using a hand mixer with the buttermilk to smooth it out!\n\nVery, very good!"

It will give them a slightly sweeter taste, thus allowing you an option to reduce the added sugar. PurÃ©e potato mixture in food processor or blender for a lighter silkier texture. Add spices: cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger ( I used 1/4 t of each for a doubled recipe. Lastly, press a few broken pecan pices into the bottom of pie shell before filling."

I added one tsp of Pumpkin Pie Spice and put the chopped pecans on the floor of the pie crust before putting the filling in. I covered the entire edge of the pie crust so it didn't get burned during the 70 minute cooking time and substituted Splenda for the white sugar. Fantastic results and the best low fat sweet potato pie I have found. Thanks."
