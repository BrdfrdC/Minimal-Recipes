Instead of using long-grain white rice, I used Sweet rice (often used to make sticky rice). Looks like long-grain white rice and when cooked tastes like it too...just in a thicker consistency. Perfect for this recipe if you want a thicker overall consistency."

That made it taste just like my grandmas! Just a side note to everyone talking about the consistency, this is a Spanish version of rice pudding, it is not meant to be thick. It’s meant to be soupy. The consistency is exactly what it’s supposed to be!"

I also add the raisins earlier into the simmering rice to plump raisins up a bit (if you do this add a bit more water when boiling rice to account for raisins to swell). Like this reciepe a great deal, easy to make. Use whole milk and cream to make it very rich and pudding like."

I made it again the past weekend with leftover par boiled rice (I know I know, not the right rice but it still works) and it came out great. I usually add some cardamom and nutmeg because they add amazing flavour. Additionally I simmer it until it's slightly thick and then allow it to cool in a container with plastic wrap right on the surface to avoid the film. I use dried currants that plump up nicely in the pudding."

So, I'm thinking it could be that some people are following package directions for cooking the rice and then adding the water to the cooked rice? If that is not the problem, omit the 1 cup of milk added after the sweet rice is made, which will make it more custard-like. I hope this helps!"
