Was a little scared that the one egg wasnt enough, but the meatball still held and cooked pretty good. I didnt have a cider vinegar, so I started off with 1/3 cup of white vinegar and followed other instructions to follow the sauce. I just did a taste test of the sauce if it needed more vinegar, which I added a little bit of it each time until I liked the sauce taste. It was wonderful meal, will definitely use the recipe next time."

One modification I will make for next time is to moisten the bread crumbs with 1-2 TB warm water before adding into the other ingredients.

I used frozen meatballs -- I also put a can of chunk pineapple w/ juice , chopped onion red pepper, sliced carrots serve over jasmine rice --- I did use rice vinegar and only had 1/4 cup and rest cider - I think white vinegar be milder - I had to put some extra sugar -- just a tad w/ vinegar taste but don't leave out - you need it - I use only 1/4 c. ketchup but I will be making this sauce again - delicious homemade sweet and sour base sauce"

I used venison instead of beef, added 4 cloves of garlic minced, also a couple pinches of Chinese 5 spice seasoning for the meatballs. For the sauce I used garlic scape white vinegar instead of the vinegar listed. As for cooking I fried the meatballs in lard and after adding the sauce I cooked it til it was the thickness I liked - didn't time it at all. We had buttered noodles and applesauce to go with the meatballs and entire family was happy with meal."

However the 2nd time instead of brown sugar I used a small can of crushed pineapple and eyeballed in a couple tablespoons of old fashioned molasses. and I loved it the 2nd time. the deeper flavor of the molasses really added in another layer of flavor I think was missing."

"reviewBody": "Good basic sauce recipe. Add orange zest! It really makes a difference. I halved the sauce and it was plenty saucy for 6 servings with extra sauce to pour over rice. I used a quarter of the brown sugar (so if you make the full recipe, use half). If you use as much sugar as the recipe calls for, it'll taste like candy. I used apple cider vinegar and I quartered that as well (again, if you're making the full recipe, use half). You can always taste the sauce and add more sugar or vinegar but if it's too sweet or vinegary, you can't go back and the whole thing will be ruined. I made my own meatballs (just mixed half a pound of Italian sausage and half a pound of ground turkey) and lightly sauteed an onion, a red bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. Overall, a good dish."

Mix the meat with some onions, salt n pepper, maybe some breadcrumbs or even some celery for that crunch texture...however you make it the sauce is perfect. Keep in mind not to make the meatballs too fancy or the sauce may not pair well. I only use the amount called for the cider vinegar and if I don't have that I use regular vinegar but not as much. I mix the sauce to my taste then thicken it with corn starch and water after pouring the sauce over the cooked meatballs. Love this recipe its soo good!! Simple and delicious!"

So all in all it was a departure from the original recipe but I liked it better with the changes. My husband likes it with fries!"
