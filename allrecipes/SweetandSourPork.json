"reviewBody": "I give this TEN stars, to match the accolades my guests gave it. The flavors were spot on. I looked at several easier recipes, most of which called for brown sugar to sweeten. I loved that this used the juice from the pineapple which I think made the flavor lighter yet perfectly as sweet as necessary. Kudos to Gramma! I cubed cutlets because they were on sale and I'm cheap. I added a large carrot, cut into quartered slices, to give it more color. I halved pearl onions instead of one large one because I had them and they were the right size. I did everything in my wok, deep fried the pork cubes a few at a time, poured off excess oil then threw in the veggies. As others recommended, I kept the sauce, the pork and the veggies separated until ready to serve which kept everything at a delightful crunchiness. Though my methodology differed, I didn't change the intrinsic things that make this recipe the best I've ever made. Thanks for sharing it!!"

The powdered corn starch I think , is a large contributor to this bland color and flavor . I have made this dish in the past using corn Syrup for the actual sauce. And did use the powdered cornstarch on the meat. I will not make this recipe again. For me other recipes for this dish give better flavor and presentation."

The sauce can cool on the stove, keep the pork separate in a warming draw then combine for the last stage where you bring back to a boil and mix with the pork."

Ignore comments about sauce being too thin or too sweet... it was perfect qnd I don't really like sweet/sugary stuff. Those that got thin sauce was probably user error. Boiling the liquids and sugar helps to thicken the sauce, think simple syrup. If you cut out most of the sugar you just made your sauce watery. I did follow the advice from some of the comments and did not cook the veggies or meat in the sauce. Once it was all done I tossed everything together in the sauce and put in a serving bowl. The pork and the veggies both had great texture. Definitely making this again!"

Added extra apple cider vinegar as it was a bit sweet for our taste but this is a winning recipe and will 100% make it again. Once all the prep is done in advance it is really quick . Thanks for sharing."

It turned out way better than I was expecting and was honestly just as good, if not better than take out from any Chinese Food restaurant I've eaten at. Only thing I changed was I omitted the celery and added thinly sliced carrots, just because that's what I had on hand. It was perfect even without the celery. The sauce is the star of this show for sure. \nI made this recipe 4x the size because I had 4lbs of pork to use up, and I am so glad I did that. My entire family enjoyed this, even the little ones who I was pretty surprised about. \nThis recipe is 100% worth making again &amp; again."

"reviewBody": "I just made this recipe this evening and although it was a lot of prepping, it was well worth it! I cut up the pork into cubes, scallions, green peppers and onions, the day before and kept it for 24 hours in a big ziplock bag to marinate. This is what takes the longest so doing it beforehand will help especially if you have a busy schedule. I followed the recipe as stated and it was excellent! I served it with white rice from instant pot which was nice and fluffy. It was not overly sweet as another reviewer stated. For 3/4 cup of sugar itâ€™s blended in pretty well. Do not make any amendments to this recipe. It is amazing and tastes like authentic Asian takeout! I will be making this again."

The only criticism I have is that although the list of ingredients is in order of use, it would be easier to follow if broken down into headings for the marinade, meat, veges and seasoning, and sauce. This is absolutely delicious and is one recipe I will be making again soon."

I was forced to make several changes though, based on what ingredients I had in the house \nb/c grocery stores are understocked...I want to make that clear up front. I gave 5 stars for providing a great base knowledge. Used chicken not pork, stevia not sugar. b/c stevia reduced the volume, added 1/4c extra ketchup. I didn't weigh the meat, so it didn't look like 1/2c corn starch was enough so added 1/2c pillsbury gluten free fine flour and it was just enough to cover the meat. Only had a red pepper and added backyard wild onions. Added leftover cooked carrots that I didn't want to go to waste. I can only imagine how much better it will be when the recipe can be followed exactly. I'll give an update if I have a chance to make again."

I doubled the recipe , so I could have left overs . Highly recommend it to anyone ! Really a nice dish. Thanks again"

I doubled the sauce due to other reviewers comments, but now I know it wasn't necessary. I ended up with twice as much sauce as I needed and will now need to freeze it for a future use. My sauce needed more than double the cornstarch mixture to get it to thicken also. I added sliced carrots for additional vegetables and color and was glad I did. It needs more vegetables than what the recipe calls for. Honestly, my other recipe that doesn't require frying the meat is just as good (if not better), and is healthier."

I cooked them individually in a small amount of water until they were tender crisp and then used the water from the cooked vegetables to make my sauce. Less oil and more vitamins and flavor from the broth. I also substituted one carrot for one stalk of celery simply to give the dish a little more color since I didn't have any red or yellow peppers. Will definitely save this to do again."

I did not add the extra 1/4 cup of water at the end of end if the recipe because there was already plenty of liquid to work with. I also added red pepper flakes for extra flavor. I was pleasantly surprised as how yummy this is! I was afraid it would be too syrupy/liquidy, or just generally end up with a soggy mess, but none of that happened. I would have added fresh mushrooms too if I'd had any; I think the recipe as written is lacking in diversity and needs more veggies, which I did add some. I think baby corns would be great here too."

So I laid the meat out on a tray and sifted corn starch over them, turn repeated till they looked white. But next time I will try a larger bag. Everything else work perfectly. The meat was so tasty, tender, crunchy all in one, would not eat this too often only because of the sugar. But can't wait to try it out again. Thank you for sharing,."
