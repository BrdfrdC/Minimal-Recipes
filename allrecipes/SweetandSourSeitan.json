I use an electric wok, throw in any extra vegetables I have in the fridge, add the seitan then the cider vinegar, soy, pineapple juice, brown sugar and corn starch all at once. 5 minutes of stirring and it is ready to be devoured. We love it over sticky rice!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe tastes amazing! I am not sure why, my sweet-and-sour sauce was watery (I think I used too much pineapple juice). I had to add more corn starch and drain some of the liquid, even after I added the extra corn starch. I think it is really necessary to brown the seitan (or tofu, which is just as good to use with this recipe). If the seitan or tofu is a bit crispy, it will make all the difference for the better. Note to self: the whole can of pineapple chunks is not necessary for this recipe. Half the can would have sufficed."

"reviewBody": "Cooked this tonight and it was really good! Super simple and fast to make and I had most of the ingredients already. Few tweaks I did: I only had a 10oz can of seitan tidbits (you can find at a Natural Foods store or asian market) so I added 6oz of baby bella mushrooms. Also, I had to add more brown sugar because it was too vinegary as stated in the recipe. I also added about a tsp more cornstarch to make thicker. I also added about 1/4 cup of ketchup to make it like they do in the takeout restaurants (why you usually see this recipe with a red sauce). Thank you for the recipe!!! Delicious with white rice"

We served it over rice - though next time I may try to add some more veggies. But this was definitely great, my non-vegetarian husband gave me the ok to make it again (which is rare!)"

I also served with a organic brown and wild rice mix, flavored with tamari sauce. My husband and 19 yr old son loved it (altho neither knew it was vegetarian instead of chicken!) I will definitely make regularly now."

We added a lot more vegis than what the recipie indicated. Joel likes seitan - better than tofu, but not as well as chicken (of course). We will eat this again. Thanks!"
