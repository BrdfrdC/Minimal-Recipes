Same recipe, but instead of teriyaki sauce, I used 1/2cup of hickory BBQ sauce and also added 4 tablespoons of honey and also added 1 tablespoon of cayenne instead of hot pepper sauce and also added 2 tablespoons of seasoning salt. Once modified, it's some of the best jerky I have ever had. I dried to perfection and will use new recipe forever! Try it! You won't regret the modifications!"

"reviewBody": "Couple of things to note here. I had two pounds of meat so I doubled the recipe but there was way more marinade than needed. Make the recipe as is but add 2 pounds of meat instead of 1. That way you at least fill up a few of the trays in the dehydrator to make it worth you while. The other thing to note that if cut to the thickness as written, you will need to plan on 4-5 hours of drying time. My teeny tiny scraps needed 3 1/2 hours and the rest needed 4-5 hours. All venison and dehydrators are not created so just keep an eye out on it. Flavor was great!"

I did not have teriyaki sauce so I substituted that with soy sauce and a teaspoon of ginger powder. I also was unsure what hot pepper sauce was so I used 2 tablespoons of Sriracha sauce. It is so tasty! Already marinating a second batch. I did not have a dehydrator but I used the dehydrator function on my Instant Pot Omni Plus and it didn’t get too dry at all!"

"reviewBody": "Delicious jerky! We like everything extra spicy, so I added 3 tbsp of sriracha sauce and a good sprinkling of hot pepper flakes. Decided to reduce the teriyaki sauce and sugar by two.\n\nMy dehydrator manual instructs \"For food safety, to help insure any bacteria present is destroyed, post treatment of meat after dehydrating is required. Heat oven to 275 F. Line a large baking sheet with foil. Place jerky in a single layer, leaving a small space around each peace. Bake for 10 -12 minutes. Cool completely on wire rack. Pat jerky dry with paper towels to remove any surface fats before storing.\"\n\nI have never followed the step before today, because I worried that it would over dry the meat. I decided to take the extra precaution because I am pregnant. The jerky was wonderful. I will alway use this extra step now, just to be extra safe."

"reviewBody": "This was my first time making deer jerky and I'm glad I picked this recipe. It taste exactly how it sounds. I did make a couple adjustments, I used Louisiana Hot Sauce for the hot pepper sauce, ran out of paprika so I used 1/2tsp of paprika and 1/2tsp chili powder, and didn't use the teriyaki sauce. I also added honey and Tony Chachere's. I used venison hamburger meat since it was my first time and did not want to waste my steak or backstrap and the only problem with that stuff is getting it to stick together while coming out of the jerky gun. I only marinated it for about 12 hours before putting it in the dehydrator. I couldn't tell but my girlfriend doesn't eat venison very much and said she could taste the \"deer\" so you might want to add some milk to it if you dont eat venison very much. Highly recommend this one."
