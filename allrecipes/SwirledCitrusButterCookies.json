"reviewBody": "I wish they would have given the recipe as it made for the picture; my gut says they left out a bit. After reading the first review about crumbling dough, I made some revisions: double the butter (1 cup total),and increased sugar and flour to 3/4 cups sugar and 2 cups flour ( up from 1/2 cups and 1 1/2 cups flour). The first time with the changes, I followed the instructions for forming and baking the cookies, only for them to collapse. I tried again, same changes as above, but the cookies went back into the fridge for half an hour between being formed and baking. The cookie on the left is from the first batch; the cookie on the right is from the second batch. Flavor is great! You can't taste the matcha, so don't be afraid to add more for a deeper green."

"reviewBody": "I loved the flavor of these cookies, but way too little butter. Was impossible to keep from crumbling enough to keep together. I'd add either another 1/2 cup of butter or more egg whites. Ended up adding a little olive oil to just barely be able to handle enough to make some semblance of a cookie. They don't look very pretty, but do taste good."
