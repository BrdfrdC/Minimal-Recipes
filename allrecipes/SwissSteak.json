Very good recipe, everyone loved it, will make again. Served over rice infused with (better than bouillon) beef bouillon."

I did modify it for the taste of my wife as she likes things with sauce, I added a 14.5oz can of tomatoes and a 10oz can of tomatoes with green chilies and served it over white rice. It was delicious and my wife wants me to make it again."

At an hour into the cooking, the meat was still tough, so I cut it into smaller pieces, which may have helped the final product. I cooked it in a Dutch oven on top of the stove. Husband loved it. Cooked mushrooms and potato piroghies as sides along with salad."

"reviewBody": "Excellent recipe! This is my first time making Swiss Steak. I was, admittedly apprehensive about it. After reading lots of reviews, I decided to brown the meat with vegetable shortening (more shortening is needed than called for in the recipe) after mixing different seasonings (I did not measure) in flour in a ziplock bag. If spicy taste is wanted, add cayenne pepper (we like spicy foods). Shake meat in seasoned flour to coat, add to oil. Add browned meat to 9X13 casserole dish and top with bell pepper, onions and celery. Cover with aluminum foil and bake at 350 degrees for approximately 1 1/2 or until meat is tender. I served with white buttered rice and mixed vegetables. DELICIOUS!"

After a few minor changes it was just like hers!!!!! I used olive oil instead of shortening and a bit more then it called for, I put the flour and salt, pepper &amp; meat in Ziploc bag, then shook it off as I added to the oil browned the meat threw in veggies and canned diced tomatoes 14 oz. Instead of 8 a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce and a cup or so of tomato juice and salt and pepper and let'r simmer for about 2 hrs."

I rarely fry things (to mess up the stove) but it was worth the effort. My husband went back for seconds! Since my Swiss steak was 2 1/2 pounds, I used a 15 ounce can of petite diced tomatoes and a little extra water with a dissolved bouillon cube. I did put it in a 9x13 dish after browning (so I could go ahead and clean the kitchen) and baked covered with foil. Frozen chopped bell peppers worked fine. I will not wait so long to make this again. Very yummy and tender, was good served with rice."
