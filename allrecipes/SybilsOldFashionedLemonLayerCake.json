"reviewBody": "I made this for a birthday. The cake is good and lemony. I only had 2 round pans so cut the recipe down by 1/3 for 4 layers. My layers were 5 hours out of oven before I cut in half and it was easy. Distracted, I cooked the lemon curd longer than suggested, cooled it 5 hours, and ended up with nice consistency. This if first time I've folded meringue into batter but it worked although more reading makes me think I overdid the folding. The cake should have risen higher in the oven. I also read on another site, that you should use parchment paper instead of greasing the pan. I frosted with a thin layer of butter cream frosting on top and sides. I did not put lemon curd on top."

"reviewBody": "I really wanted to like this recipe but couldn't. As other reviewers have said, the glaze consistency is way off. I ended up tempering in an extra egg yolk and cooking (boiling) it for around 10-15 minutes to get it to thicken up. I should have just used my \"stand by\" lemon pie filling recipe. The cake itself came out somewhat dry, I don't think I overworked it, but I could have done so. They show frosting in the picture, but there is no frosting recipe with this cake. I ended up making a lemon cream cheese frosting. I like the idea of a six layer lemon cake with a curd filling, but this one isn't it."

I found the filling a bit tricky to get right, I was expecting it to be more of a curd than the syrup it ended up being. Very nice!"

In my family we frost the sides with Divinity Fudge. It is not a cake for beginners! Once mastered it is very good."

"reviewBody": "I was so excited when I found this recipe. I am not a baker at all and suddenly got the bug to start trying different recipes. I used this recipe for my mom's 70th birthday as a surprise. I thought I could adjust the recipe based on the suggestions of previous reviews but the cake was terrible, to hard to cut. The only thing that I improved was the lemon flavor but the cake itself was not moist and fluffy and just too stiff. Too much work for such a great disappointment! It took me 3 hours to complete. Unless you are a pretty confident baker and know how to adjust the recipe for your benefit, I suggest just using an entirely different recipe. I've had great success with other home made recipes that I've tried."

I followed the recipe as posted. May find a different lemon frosting next time. Gave it 4 stars because even though it was time consuming the flavor is very lemony!!"
