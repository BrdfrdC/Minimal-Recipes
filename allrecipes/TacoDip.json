If I make it again, I may add a bit more taco seasoning to the base, felt like it could have used a bit more flavor. Am taking it to a Super Bowl party tonight!"

I actually served this to 8 of my husband's hungry coworkers as a pre-BBQ appetizer and it disappeared FAST! While I was in the kitchen prepping the rest of our dinner I overheard several of the guys comment \"man, this is sooooo good!\" :) Made me super happy as I am a bit of a foodie, and I thought this might be too simple or maybe too old school for this mixed group of mostly executives. Glad I took a chance on it ! It was a total hit! Yayyy! AND Best of all, my cool little secret was I used full fat, Greek style yogurt instead of sour cream (because I didn't have time to run out to buy sour cream) Nobody noticed! Shows how versatile this recipe is. Will make this again when I need a quick, light appy for a dinner party."

I did what others suggested and beat the cream cheese before adding the other ingredients. I used two cups of Mexican cheese blend. I also had leftover ground beef on hand and mixed that into the cream cheese mixture. I think this dip would be great heated as well! I wonder if letting this dip sit overnight would help the flavors blend?"

Using low fat ingredients didnt change the taste at all (when compared to other taco dips I've had). I had a LOT of left overs so I ate it on some bagels I had and warmed them in the oven at 350 for about 5 mins. My new favorite snack!"

I did alter the ingredients slightly, which I think made it much better. I used half the amount of sour cream and used green onion instead of green pepper. I also spread some mild taco sauce on top of the cream cheese/sour cream layer (I would have preferred medium or hot) for extra flavor. I didn't measure anything, just eyeballed it. Be sure to beat the cream cheese well, or it will be clumpy."

If you're making it the night before, prep all your ingredients, but don't put the tomatoes and lettuce on until just before serving so the water doesn't escape the veggies. \n\nIt's really good, and people eat a ton of it at parties!"
