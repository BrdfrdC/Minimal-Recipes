"reviewBody": "as I was making it...Ibwas nervous about me and my family living it. Well thankfully there was nothing to worry about. EVERYONE....even my 6 yr old loved it (we had it for breakfast). I didn't make too many changes. I always season my meat with seasoning salt, seasoned pepper, and onions before I add my taco seasoning so I still did that. I did have to make some changes so my daughter could eat it which included only making half the lasagne without salsa, and instead using chopped tomatoes. I also omitted the cayenne pepper since it might have made it too spicy (for her). I also took the suggestion of using flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas. I used EVOO spray to grease the pan which made the bottom layer extremely difficult to cut through (but still edible)...I think I may try butter next time??. This is definitely a keeper!"

This more evenly distributes the sour cream and green onions. The leftovers taste even better the next day."

Perhaps it might taste different with flour tortillas in a single layer on the bottom and top? Worth trying. My three 18-23 year old sons said they would've preferred the Beef Nacho Casserole (on this site), which is far easier to make and has a much better texture."

An additional benefit is using multiple pans allows you to make some hot, medium or mild. To protect the non-stick coating on some pans line them first with a couple sheets of parchment paper."

Next time I will add some fresh cilantro."

I used diced fresh tomatoes on the middle layers and saved the little bit of salsa I had for the top and bottom layer. I did not use any onion. I used shredded mexican and cheddar cheese. And I added lettuce to my plate once I served it."

Only one small thing which is no reflection on the recipe is that the taco seasoning had too much Cumin in it, which I dislike with a passion, so next time I'm going to double check the spice content. I am definitely making this again, it's utterly delicious and downright scrumptious!"

The result was a yummy, protein packed meal with lots of leftovers for the freezer."

I modified this recipe by putting a thin layer of red enchilada sauce on the bottom of plan before placement of tortillas . I used small flour tortillas instead of corn. I also used restaurant style salsa which has a thinner more liquid make up. After last layer of tortillas I topped with the rest of the enchilada sauce then cheese."

The youngest said it was \"the best dinner she's ever had\". I used whole grain tortillas and added a layer of refried beans and used rotisserie chicken seasoned with the taco seasoning. So many variations of this can be made to your liking. Add or remove whatever you want...you can't lose. Thank you for a great way to change up our Taco Tuesday!"
