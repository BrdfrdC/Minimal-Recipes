I use only the meat, lettuce , cheddar or taco flavored shredded cheese, tomatoes and sliced black olives. Always taco flavored Doritos and Catalina dressing. If you have a way to keep the meat warm or reheat before serving then that is the easiest way to prepare. Cut up tomatoes and shred the lettuce (bagged shredded lettuce is easiest) crush up the Doritos, toss all together with the olives and meat, pour dressing over and walla! I like to keep some green onionss and sour cream on the side for those who want to add them in."

"reviewBody": "I have been making a very similar version of this dish for decades. It was my children's favorites, and now all three serve it to their families! The only difference is that I add a small can of drained pinto beans to the salad, we use Cool Ranch or Nacho Doritos (crushed), and I add some PicoPica or Taco Bell mild sauce to the french dressing. Really jazzes up the flavor! And no, you can't refrigerate this overnight with the chips. When I take this to a potluck or other type of shared-meal event, I always wait to add the chips until I arrive, just before we eat. I usually place the dressing on the side, too. This is still a family favorite, especially in the summer, and I only gave it four stars because I think the addition of the flavored chips and adding the hot sauce into the dressing really adds to this recipe."

"reviewBody": "Cook, drain, and chill the meat (we add a little hot sauce or picante sauce when cooking). You can also add some of the onions or peppers to the beef while cooking. We prefer mixed lettuce rather than iceberg. Although we've built the salad in a big common bowl, when enjoying at home, we don't assemble the salad in advance--put ingredients in different bowls and let each person create their salad with their preferences. Other great ingredients include rinsed beans (pinto, black, or kidney), chickpeas, olives, hot peppers, different cheeses (cheddar, Monterey jack, pepper jack, fresco, etc). Also different dressings for different tastes--I think Catalina is a classic with taco salad but others prefer Ranch or something else."

I went with the Taco Doritos as other suggested but I changed the rest up by adding some corn, black beans and cilantro. I thought the dressing would be too sweet but it wasn't. I still like my version of Ranch Dressing and Salsa mixed together much better. But I do like the idea of using the Fat Free Catalina and saving a ton of calories. 1/4 cup is way too small amount of dressing. More like 1 cup. And the suggested amount of chips are pretty whimpy too."

I know the salad dressing sounds really weird, but trust me it's awesome! I gave this only 4 stars because I changed it just a bit by using catalina french dressing instead of regular french and instead of the tortilla chips I've used fritos and also cool ranch doritos. I liked the Fritos best because it gave it a nice corn flavor, more like a taco shell. Regular tortilla chips are just too mild of a flavor for a taco salad in my opinion. I also like to add black beans and sometimes corn into the mix too!"

While the chicken was cooking, I preheated my oven to 350, scrunched up some tine foil into a ball, placed it into a tin pan and sprayed it with PAM. I placed a whole wheat wrap on top and let its sides ripple over each other. I baked it for about 7 minutes and placed the salad and chicken into it and poured the dressing on top - Very satisfying and delicious!"

My family loves ranch dressing so I used the No Mayo Ranch Dressing recipe to top the salad. Finally used a 10\" tortilla to make a taco bowl. Sprayed a small glass pyrex bowl with a cooking spray and draped the tortilla over it and baked at 375 for 9 minutes. Nice presentation!"

Both times it came out good. I used Romaine lettuce instead of Iceburg and didn't use any onions. I also used Catalina dressing instead of French and just plain Cheddar cheese instead of the cheese blend in the recipe. Also DO NOT refrigerate overnight, the chips would get way too soggy. I put all the toppings out buffet style and put what we each like in each individual bowl since we all like different toppings. Also, I mix the dressing in with the toppings in each bowl before adding the beef."

I kept all the vegetables seperate too so when its time to eat we can put as much as we like in our own plates. We also topped it all off with a little ranch dressing and it was VERY tasty."

Don't mix ahead of time...the best part of the salad is the 'CrUnCh' from the tortilla chips-so why you would want soggy lettuce and chips (from sitting overnight) is perplexng to me...and many other reviewers. Nonetheless, this salad is A+ :D"

I was trying to duplicate a recipe I had a party and ended up using parts of both Taco Salad I and Taco Salad II recipes off this site with great results! The great thing about this recipe is that you can add or subtract “toppings” to your personal taste and still come out with wonderful results. To this recipe I added 1 can of chili beans to the beef along with the taco seasoning, served the onion and green pepper on the side, used only 2 cups of cheddar, a couple of handfuls of crushed Doritos and enough Catalina dressing to coat (probably about half a bottle). DO NOT LET SIT OVERNIGHT, serve immediately after adding dressing."

Always remember, if you are bringingthis to a function, don't put the dressing on until right before you serve, or it will be a soggy mess."

I did chop all the veggies the night before which made it very easy to prepare right before the party. I used extra lean ground turkey (99% fat free) and fat free catalina dressing. I used red onions and substituted nacho flavor doritos. The dressing and the doritos definitely made it tasty. This recipe is a winner -- I will make it often."

The only changes that I made to this salad is that I used light/low fat Nacho Cheese Doritos and reduced fat cheese – you can’t tell the difference at all when it is all mixed together! I also used Western dressing, it tastes really good. The actual recipe states to refrigerate overnight – DO NOT do this because it will get soggy. Since I can’t eat the whole salad at once I chop up all the ingredients and keep in separate baggies and when you are ready to eat just throw everything into your salad dish (I usually heat up the taco meat in the microwave for a minute) and you are ready to eat. WONDERFUL!!!"
