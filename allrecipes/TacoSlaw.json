"reviewBody": "Great topping for Mexican food. Someone of \"the buzz\" was talking about slaw for Mexican food. I had never heard of such a thing. Well I looked and found this recipe. It is so good and I will probably make it every time I make Mexican food. This would also be good on hot dogs, smoked sausage, hamburgers and sloppy joes. I bought a package of pre-cut slaw and it had the carrots already included, but I added the rest of the ingredients. This was a wonderful topping for \"Mexican Beef Supreme\" on AR. The leftovers were a bit spicier the next day, due to the jalapeños, but it was still wonderful. Thanks mixingmedia for sharing this recipe. This is my 400th recipe made and posted in the year 2011. Happy New Year's eveyone!"
