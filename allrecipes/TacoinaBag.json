Those had chilli over the Fritos &amp; to this day when I serve chilli I put a Layer of Fritos in the bottom. At the fairs &amp; celebrations up north here there's always a stand selling tacos in a bag. Kids love them."

"reviewBody": "5 stars based solely on nostalgia, great memories &amp; convenience.... this \"recipe\" has been around forever (I think the cro-magnon originally used pterodactyl lol) but seriously ive been making so many variations of walking tacos since I was allowed to use the stove lol. I made a variation last night &amp; dint mind extra clean up since I had the cast iron skillet already dirtied so I crushed up an entire family sized bag of the original Doritos dumped them in the skillet after removing the meat (used ground pork AND\n ground beef, extra yummy) dumped the mixture on top &amp; added all imaginable toppings to that (I love adding black beans, kidney beans, avocado &amp; dirty rice) before slathering the entire thing with an entire jar of salsa con queso lol then I baked it in the oven @ 400 degrees till the exposed chips get browned &amp; crispy. Then I just plop the entire skillet on a folded dish towel in the center of the table &amp; devour it upon paper plates.... makes meeeeeee mouth water everytime lol.... my nephew loved it &amp; called it the magical taco mountain... I mean it hovered a good 3\"- 4\" above the skillet rim.... no left overs :-( makes me sad I have to wait a cpl weeks for this delicious concoction to hit my table again.... happy eatings everyone :-)"

Naturally I offered to keep my 7 year old great-niece for the week or so needed for moms recovery. My concern was that other than meeting once or twice for holidays, the child and I were pretty much strangers. Luckily I remembered this recipe and WE decided to put it together for our first lunch. By the time we were eating out of the bags we were great friends. This recipe will be remembered by both of as not only as very tasty in and of itself, but as a building block to a loving relationship."

WE take these on the road as a tailgate meal when driving to camp-platic utensils and napkins make it a great portable meal. When in camp we do much the same but use plates or bowls to serve. Try subbing ground chicken or turkey for a healthier option."
