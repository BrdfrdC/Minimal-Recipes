"reviewBody": "I used fresh Jamaica flowers this time, because they were available at a local Mexican supermarket. \n \nThe only change I made to the recipe, other than soaking the flowers overnight after boiling, was that I added chopped cilantro to the saute. \n\nSo easy to keep vegan or add a crumble of cotija or some crema de avocado.\n\nI served this to a large group, including Mexican nationals, vegans and meat eaters and EVERYONE LOVED IT!\n\nSo simple, so perfect and stunningly delicious."
