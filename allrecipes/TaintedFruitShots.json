This year I wanted to find something economical for our Superbowl party since we have so many guests. Tried this recipe with 1 oz shot cups with lids since that size was recommended by someone. The lids also make it easy to stack. I also halfed the recipe so that I can make many different flavors and used a cheap bottle of 1.75 liter of vodka. Very surprised because I still have a decent amount left to start a new batch! Thanks for sharing this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "always a hit at a party or tailgate. i would also recommend using flavored vodka and or rum. coconut rum is a good one to use. keep in mind that the ratios of water and alcohol can be altered depending on the percent of alcohol used. also, a bit of whipped cream on top can be a great addition. last tip, bathroom solo cups work great as well and are cheap and disposable."
