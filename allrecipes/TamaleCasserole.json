I used baked tortilla chips, and only about 3/4 c for an 8X8 dish. I chopped a small red onion and used 2% mexican blend cheese for the lower layers and about 1/4 c of regular cheese for the top, and then served with lettuce, chopped fresh tomato, avocado, and dollop of light sour cream.

I made \"Flatlander Chili\" from this site (BEST chili recipe, btw) a few days ago, and was looking for something to do with the leftovers when I stumbled upon this recipe. I think it came out very good! I made as directed, except I only used one bunch of green onions, added a small can of sliced black olives and used a Mexican blend of shredded cheese...and (of course) the Flatlander chili in lieu of the canned variety. Topped with a dollup of sour cream, and we ate it up! Thanks for the recipe!"

I will add a small (single serving size) can of whole kernel corn next time, think it will add to this excellent dish, may even add some sliced black olives also ..."

It's not something you'd want to serve for company unless you having a Super Bowl party:), but my kids and husband loved it. My son especially did and he doesn't like much. Try it!"

"reviewBody": "I followed this recipe as written but did not like the flavor of the canned tamales. Perhaps it was the brand. I will try it again but I will use frozen(thawed)tamales and the appropriate amount of a frozen chili brick (thawed) in place of the canned chili with beans. I am sure it will be tastier. This is quick and easy and that is a big plus!"
