Add chicken broth, 1/4 cup at a time, beating until masa has a smooth and workable consistency similar to cookie dough, about 3/4 cup total. Test if the masa is ready by dropping a small ball of masa into a glass of cold water; if it floats, it&#39;s ready, if not, beat the dough a little longer."

Add 1 tablespoon of the chicken filling in the center of the masa mixture. Fold sides of banana leaf together, one over the other. Fold the bottom of the banana leaf over the seam of the 2 folded sides and tie together with kitchen string. Repeat with remaining banana leaves."

Recado Rojo is the sauce and roasted red peppers, pimientos, green olives and capers are added to the center of the masa with the meat &amp; sauce. That’s what I love about tamales…you can make them the way you like!"
