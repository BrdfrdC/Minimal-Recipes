I looked everywhere but there was no creole seasoning so I used cajun. I rarely made the same recipe twice but this will be a repeat! Thanks for sharing\n#AllrecipesAllstarsCanada\n#Facelessnomore"

"reviewBody": "This recipe was no doubt quick and easy; however, it was simply disappointing (where is the orange coloring typical of etoufee recipes) and, if I had not edited the ingredients, would have been completely inedible (i.e., used 1/4 cup of garlic powder instead of the full 1 cup that the recipe indicated). Considering the expense of seafood, I would choose to use mine differently next time."
