I served the extra glaze on the side to drizzle over the ham slices. This was so easy to make with ingredients I already had on hand. The Dijon mustard really makes this glaze amazing! I did add the lemon juice at the end. I recommend going scant on the juices and tasting as you go depending on your taste for sweet vs tangy. This will be my go-to glaze for ham from now on!"

I cooked the ham with the broth for the first 2 hours, then I removed the rind, scored the ham and added the glaze and pineapple rings. Cooked it 45 more minutes basting with pan juices every 10 minutes. Came out moist and tender. A keeper for sure!"

We put in an additional 6 ounce can of pineapple juice to the bottom of the pan and tried to scrape the sauce in the pan to make it more usable to no avail. Would not recommend this recipe."

But the mustard as well as orange added another dimension to the traditional taste of the clove, sugar and acidity of the pineapple juice. I stuck 2 skewers through the spiral ham to hold the slices in place. Then baked it at 275%, at 12 minutes per pound, and covered the pan with aluminum foil. I basted the ham with the natural dripping every 30 minutes. But uncovered the ham and used the basting sauce from the recipe every 10 minutes in the last 30 minutes of baking. It was delicious served on Hawaiian rolls."

"reviewBody": "Excellent! Everyone loved it. So simple and so tasty. I scored the ham crosswise and inserted whole cloves into the ham which I removed before I put the pineapple on. I didn't have any oranges so I used apricot preserves, which were really good. Due to a guest's allergies I had to swap out the honey so I added some extra brown and white sugar and let the glazed boil a little longer. At the end I added a little cornstarch to get a thicker consistency. Covered the entire ham with pineapple slices with maraschino cherries in center held in place with toothpicks. I kept 1/4\"to 1/2\" water in the bottom of the pan. I served the drippings on the side. I couldn't have done this without this simple, easy, delicious and versatile wonderful recipe. Thank you Sue S!"

Made sauce and basted ham generously (I did not have orange so used 1/3 cup orange juice instead). Tented pan in foil and secured foil tightly and cooked for 2 hours and 15 minutes. Took out of oven and unsealed ham and let rest for 20-30 minutes. This was amazingly moist."
