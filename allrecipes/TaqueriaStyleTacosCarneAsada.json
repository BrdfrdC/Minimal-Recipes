I don’t know and don’t care because this was so delish! I did sauté a red pepper and thinly sliced jalapeño to top. Will absolutely make again. Thank YOU stanicks!!"

"reviewBody": "Great recipe for carna asada! Marinade made the texture of the flank steak perfect. It had great flavor too. Note to self, cut the chunks smaller - bite size or smaller. Next time, I would cook the jalapeno, onion, and garlic with some oil and use as a garnish and I would skip making it into the salsa. It was a lot of extra ingredients, steps, and the taste wasn't worth it. The cilantro, onion, lime mixture was great but we didn't need as much as was called for. Overall, the recipe is about the marinade and meat and that was awesome!"

"reviewBody": "Though these tacos were a huge hit, like many others have said, this wasn't really what I would think of as authentic carne asada. It was definitely a fabulous meal nonetheless and earns 5 stars however. I modified the salsa ingredients after mixing up the recipe ingredients however, as the salsa was quite bland to my taste, and too spicy. I added about 2 tablespoons of white wine vinegar, 1 tsp of salt, and a can of Italian style tomatoes. Brine time on the meat was about 4 hours. I also cooked the meat in a bit of canola oil on a cast iron griddle over a gas grill set to high, and searing hot. I used a hamburger press on each piece of meat to ensure thorough caramelization, and the flavor profile and depth, while not what I consider 'authentic', was nothing short of amazing. Once the meat was done, I heated up the tortillas on the same griddle for about 45-60 seconds per side. This recipe is definitely worth keeping, and I'll be making this dish many times."

I actually used a small sirloin steak as it was just for me. I had some left over refried beans and homemade salsa which I put on the tacos and added a slice of avocado. Without a doubt the best tacos I’ve made. Thanks so much for the recipe. I’m sure I’ll make it again."

We switched it out for green pepper, when it came time for the roasting process I just added some ciratcha to give it the needs spice. I left out the white pepper. My family also isn’t a fan of Cilantro so I swapped that out for parsley semi dried, I added red pepper flakes and roasted garlic spice. Mixed with the onions, We also did not have limes. 2 limes squeezed will get you about 4 table spoons of lime juice. Lime is more acidic so i added 8 tablespoons of lemon juice instead."

I only made the marinade (step 1) and then grilled over mesquite lump charcoal which gave it oh so much more flavor. There is a local Taqueria chain here in AZ that is known for amazing mesquite grilled foods and I'm proud to say that my carne asada blows theirs out of the water. I've never had so many compliments of how awesome the smoky mesquite flavor brings to the meat. Perfect recipe!"

I have never made this before so I can’t compare this to another recipe or flap meat to flank steak, but based on the results I probably never will try anything different. I cooked these up on a flat top griddle on high and then sliced thin across the grain. Incredibly tender and flavorful. Just one word of warning, recipe shows this making 16 servings (or 3 oz per serving) so I tripled the recipe. We had no leftovers so I would recommend estimating this serving 12 (or 4 oz per serving)."

"reviewBody": "This is my go-to recipe for carne asada, and everyone in my household loves it, especially the homemade salsa. I originally got this recipe from Genius Kitchen and was happy to see someone posted it on Allrecipes. I omit the cotija cheese and I can't stand raw onions, so I also skip making the onion relish. For more tender meat, top sirloin is also good. Using flank steak is good if you want to have leftovers for later in the week."

Ohhh Myyyy!!! These were the best tacos I have had in a long while and the best ever homemade! This recipe is definitely a keeper. (Now I'm trying it to flavor some chicken for my Arroz con pollo)."

It was just a little too salty, but didn't stop anyone from devouring it! Thanks for the recipe!"

However, in a pinch, one can make an excellent carne asada recipe in less than 20 minutes by simply grilling your steak (skirt steak is the best) with lots of soy sauce and olive oil along with generous splashes of lime juice and adobo and onion powder. I did not believe it would be as good as this but had steak in the fridge needing to be used and it was almost 100 degrees where we live in Oregon this past week (who wants to grill in 100 degree weather after a 10-hour day at the office?!). My shortcut was just as good, perhaps even better, and took me far less time. So, while this recipe is great, don't knock your shortcut methods as well!"

For the two limes juiced, I use one lime and one lemon both juiced and zested-add zest to marinade. I also add the juice of one orange (or a 1/4 juice). For the chili powder, I use Chipotle (Or Ancho for a milder heat, more smoky flavor) and I add 1 t. of granulated toasted onion powder (Penzey's). I also only use Flap Meat. I feel this is is a tad more rounded in flavor with the extra citrus notes. I only sometimes make the new mexico chili sauce but quite often I just use something store bought."
