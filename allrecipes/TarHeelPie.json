I used a thawed frozen pie crust that I quartered and arranged each piece into the pie plates, nothing fancy as long as it was in there. After reading some of the reviews, I cut the coconut in half. I baked it about 20 min for the mini plates, and I would try less for these the next time. This is very rich; a little goes a long way. Can't wait to try with ice cream or whipped cream. I'm going to wrap and freeze some for when I need a chocolate fix! It is a pie, but the crust could actually be eliminated. It would be like a brownie that way. Thanks - great recipe!"

But the pies are absolutely delicious!! I will definitely be making this again."

I made this for our 4th of July picnic and every member of my family agreed this would be super-fabulous if made with less coconut. Next time I will cut the amount to 1/4 cup. My daughter's favorite \"pie\" I make is the Tollhouse Pie which is very similar to a Kentucky Derby Pie and she said I could quit making that and make this Tar Heel Pie instead. We all loved it - with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side!"

I served it right out of the oven and it was way too hot, so let it cool slightly before serving. I didn't have any ice cream nor whipping cream when I first served it and it does need one or the other! i liked it cold the next day as well... great recipe, Thanks!"

One thing I would prefer is a little more solidity; it was runny even baked at 45 minutes. I think I will pop it in the fridge next time for a little bit, or even add 1-2 extra eggs so that it holds a bit of form while still remaining fudgy. However, my other brownie-loving friend said it was perfect as is, because it was like eating raw brownie dough. I served it with vanilla ice cream. It was fabulous! I will definitely make this again, and that says a lot as I have tried MANY recipes that were good, but just not good enough to remain in my recipe box. Props to the chef!"

It will be soft. DO NOT PRE BAKE THE CRUST. Double the ingredients for the filling. Pour it into the crust and bake it for 45 minutes at the 350 temp. This is so ooey gooey good."

"reviewBody": "I had to try this one... I love chocolate! Love every ingredient used to make this. The consistency was closest to a moist in the center brownie. I just thought that the recipe was missing something in the presentation aspect. I sprinkled some powdered sugar and cocoa powder and that helped quite a bit. It is different but it is also very good and very rich."

Since the filling completely covers the crust, I bake the crust about 15 minutes first. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and used sliced almonds instead of pecans. Lastly, I subtracted about 10 minutes from bake time. So easy and so delicious! You won't be disappointed."

I used a combination of milk and semisweet chocolate chips in the filling. At 40 minutes I thought it was way too gooey, but I didn't want to bake over the suggested time so I took it out against my better judgment. I didn't enjoy it at first, but by the next morning it had firmed up while still maintaining just the right amount of gooeyness. I microwave a sliver for 15 seconds and serve it with a scoop of ice cream--it's heavenly!"

I got rave reviews on it and served with good Vanilla Ice Cream is just a perfect combination. Next day I nuked the slice for a few seconds to heat it up and had with more ice cream and it was just as good! I am DEFINITELY making this again when I have choc-a-holics coming over. Its easy, looks nice, and tastes heavenly!"
