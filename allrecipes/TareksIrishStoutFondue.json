I ended up actually making this twice b/c I thought I did something wrong the first time, but it didn't work out the second time for me either. The cheese would not melt and I was very careful with measuring everything and the heat on the pot. This recipe has rave reviews, so maybe I'm just not meant to make fondue..."

My guests raved about it because it had more flavor than most fondue, but it did not overpower and the cheese taste still came through! Just make sure you use good cheese (we used aged extra sharp cheddar wheel cheese)...SO GOOD"
