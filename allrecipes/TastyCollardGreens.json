"reviewBody": "This is the first time I've made collard greens from scratch - fresh out of our garden - and I must say, this recipe is simply amazing! My only changes: I added 1 medium chopped onion, 2 cups of white wine, a bit more chicken broth (I just used 2 32-oz boxes), and 2 bay leaves to simmer the turkey leg. For those having issues with insufficient liquid, I would recommend bringing everything but the greens to a boil in a large pot, covering the pot tightly, and reducing the heat to the very lowest of simmers (just the few occasional bubbles). I simmered the leg that way for a good 4+ hours until the meat was falling off the bone. Remove the bones, skin, gristle, and shred the remaining leg meat. Then add the chopped collard greens, cover the pot tightly again, and simmer at the same low setting for 2+ hours or until they are tender. You will have plenty of savory juices to enjoy with the greens until they are gone. Serve with a nice pat of butter on top (and a little Lawrey's Seasoned Salt, if you so choose). We served ours with a steamed sweet potato with home made tahini sauce - lovely! I would make this recipe again in a heartbeat."

I also added about 6 large baby portabello mushrooms sliced and 2 small yellow onions sliced (they were added in the second half of the recipe where it tells you to add the collards. Onions placed in first on too if the already cooking Turkey legs, then the collards and the mushrooms on top. Then stir occasionally as directed). This was super tasty! Also I used better then bullion chicken broth, so no need to add any seasonings, it was perfect. You could easily make this into a soup as well."

"reviewBody": "this recipe is basically how i've made collards for years, but a couple of important changes will improve upon a pretty good recipe. first, i use smoked turkey wings because the legs have splinter bones in them that can be tough to fish out (and you definitely want to get all of them out because of the potential choking hazard). the wings have just as much flavor as the legs.\n\nan old southern trick from my mother &amp; grandmother is to wash the greens with baking soda and/or some dishwashing liquid. this will help get the grit and sand off the leaves better than just clear water. using a salad spinner helps too.\n\ncook the turkey until it's tender and falling off the bone then discard the skin and debone the wing. also, when you add the collards, make sure you stir them regularly so that you don't end up with some greens that are overcooked while others are under done. collards are tough and take a while to cook, longer than this recipe calls for, but don't leave them completely unattended for more than 10-15 minutes as you may have to add water (the broth may boil down and become salty, so taste it if it's reduced significantly)."

I had someone who doesn't even like greens eat them and love them. Also I had 4 people (3 of whom make awesome greens themselves) try them and they all said nothing needed to be added. I don't eat everyone's greens and have never really loved them, but I'm trying to eat healthier and I loved them too. Great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "OK! Now when your home cooking SOUTHERN mother ask you, how you make these greens BECAUSE they taste better than hers, you know you have a winning recipe. I changed NOTHING to this recipe, besides a huge SMILE! The 1st time I cooked these my oh so picky husband refused to be the taster (the one how taste things to see if it needs a little more or a little less) but he even enjoyed them. This 2016 Thanksgiving I was appointed to cook the entire dinner by my lonesome ??. These greens were the last things to be started. Mom even said \"the greens smell good\". NOW I'm sweating bullets, because I know she's going to talk about me if they didn't taste good ??. But you now know the outcome to that. If you don't have the turkey leg (I used a smoked one) it's okay the recipe is good with or with out and guess what no vinegar needed! ?? Thank You So Much for the recipe, you saved me from a year of shaming!"

Like someone suggested I used the precut greens from Walmart. I was nervous because usually I buy whole collards and cut the leaves off the stalk and then discard the stalk. The Walmart brand has stalk and all. But once I cooked it down, they were tender. While cooking, I did add some vinegar and sugar. Also I cooked on medium low for 3 hours uncovered to get a tender consistency with thorough flavor. This recipe really is as good as everyone else says!"

I make a big batch and then throw the leftovers in smaller portions in the freezer with plenty of the broth and it reheats perfectly!"

I did not add the peppers at the end because my family doesn't do spicey, but rather served pepper sauce on the table. I saved the liquid to use with leftovers, but there were no left overs!"

The end result was still fantastic. According to another reviewer's suggestion, I added about 2 tbsps of honey to offset the bitterness of the greens (1 would have been enough for collard greens, but mustard greens are naturally much more bitter). I also added 1 onion. I only made these changes because I used mustard greens, but other reviewer's did the same for their collard greens. I served this as soup and will certainly be making this again. Thanks for sharing :)"
