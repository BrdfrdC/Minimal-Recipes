The bags of oyster crackers at our grocery were 12 oz. bags so that made the seasoning go a little further as well. I also went the full 20 minutes to have a nice crispiness but were not too done."

"reviewBody": "Just okay for me. I accidentally bought twice as many crackers as needed for our chili at Christmas, so needed to use some crackers. I appreciate the recipe, but did hit a couple of bumps. Followed the recipe except that I omitted the lemon pepper and seasoned salt. My picture shows a 12 x 17 and 10 x 15 pan with not quite two boxes of crackers...so...no way two boxes of crackers can be spread in a single layer onto a jelly roll pan, which I think is 10 x 15? Also, I baked these for forty minutes. They were more browned than they look in my picture...not the greatest photographer...but not that brown."

I think we'll be making this again real soon."
