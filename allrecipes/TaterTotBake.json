We use only ground venison, I cook it with diced onions. Season to our taste, lots of garlic powder added, salt and pepper. Cream of mushroom soup with a little bit of milk. Green beans layered on bottom. Add some fresh sliced mushrooms or canned button mushrooms with the meat mix. Then layer of cheddar or mozarella, then the tater tots on top."

I was very reluctant to want to make it. As it turned out, however, both my mom and I absolutely loved it. I agree with everything Mare had to say. And made it my own by adding 4 cups of frozen peas and carrots, 1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes and topped the tater tots with 8 ounces of shredded cheddar jack cheese."

That way, after I drained the grease off, I was able to pop the whole thing in the oven and have one less dish to clean.\n\nMy parents enjoyed it. It was super easy to make and clean up"

First one kid won’t eat anything with onions so I skip them but if he’s not there I add onions with the cooking beef. I also don’t dilute the mushroom soup and I layer it all with tater tots on the bottom and end it with tater tots on the top. This makes the tater tots nice and. Risoy on the top. Try this recipe and your kids will thank you."

To that, I added half of a can of Del Monte whole kernel corn, drained. I blended cream of celery soup and 3/4 cup of milk in a saucepan and poured it over the meat mixture in an 8x8 casserole. Next, I added 4 handfuls of Mexican cheese blend, put the tots on next, and added a thin layer of shredded cheese. I topped it with 1/2 tsp. of smoked sweets paprika. 35 minutes at 350, then 20 minutes at 300.Good luck and happy eating"

Brown the beef , place in a baking dish, spread the soup on top and add the tater tots. Bake at 400 for 45 min. I've made it for years and only add some chopped onion to the beef, and changed the soup to Golden Mushroom for more flavor. You can easily increase the amount of beef...still tastes delicious and it's EASY ."

"reviewBody": "This is a good recipe. After reading some reviews I developed my plan. I sautéed my onion with some finely chopped carrots and celery, then browned my ground beef (about 1 and1/3 lb) along with the vegetables; seasoning that beef with salt, and garlic pepper and a tiny dash of cayenne. I had about 1/2 cup sour cream in the fridge and added that to the soup mixture and mixed it with the ground beef mixture; then threw in some frozen green peas and at least a cup of the cheddar. I let the tater tots thaw after I added them to the top, then sprinkled another 1/2 cup of the cheese over all, before baking. This was gobbled up by adults and little kids. We all agreed that the tots were probably best in the crispy state. So basically shepherds pie with tots instead of mash. Again, the pan was clea"

After reading other reviews first, I made similar changes to meat while browning it, adding worchestire, minced garlic, garlic powder, pepper, etc for added flavor. I started having second thoughts about this recipe while placing items in the baking dish. My family turned their noses up on it as well based on the appearance. It is basic. It is not even middle of the road acceptable. Squeeze ketchup on it, take a bite &amp; close your eyes &amp; sure you think you're eating a cheese burger &amp; fries but honestly, next time I'll choose to put the energy into firing up the grill for actual cheese burgers (without the mega sodium canned soup!!!)."
