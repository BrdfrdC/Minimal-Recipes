Then I put the cooked meat and soup mixture on top of the tots and bake it all, with grated cheddar cheese on top of that. That way the tots are crispy and they are more like nachos. You can even take out some of the tots and put them on top for extra crispiness. I find it easier to serve it this way also, as the filling is on top of the tots. I do also add onions to the meat and garlic powder to season. Sometimes I add a can of corn or serve corn on the side."

I looked through some reviews and came up with something I thought would work better for my family. I seasoned 2 pounds of ground beef with salt, pepper and onion powder and sautéed it with one chopped onion. Then, I added 2 cans of the soup, one 16 oz. bag of frozen mixed veggies and more of the onion powder and black pepper. I layered the bottom of the cake pan with half of the beef mixture and then 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese and then the other half of the beef mixture. I then layered on the tater tots. I added 2 more cups of the cheese on top of the tots. I baked it at 350 degrees for 60 minutes because of the frozen veggies. It turned out very good."

A can of Rotel may liven it up a bit. I think next time I may even add a dollop of sour cream on top. Over all though I will be making this again if I add to it or not because most people already have the ingredients at home, It's very easy to make, Very filling to eat and with us we have plenty left over for an entire other meal. Oh and don't forget EASY &amp; FAST clean up. This would be a great meal for a sick friends family, funeral, or a Church social."

Personally I rate this 3 star as I found it a bit basic and a bit salty, but I’ve bumped the rating up because my very fussy 11 year old loved it and kept asking for more. I will probably make it again, but next time won’t add any extra salt, will try to find a nice low sodium soup for the sauce, and may add in some extras like mushrooms and corn."

I also prefer to use 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, seasoned to my taste(add some Tony's more spice!) I cook in the oven til tater tots are browned and add my shredded cheese at the very end of the baking process so it's only in there long enough to melt the cheese but not make it crispy or browned. I love how simple it is to make (you don't need much experience in the kitchen for this one) and that there aren't a bunch of dishes to wash😁 great for a quick fix especially if you have kids!"

"reviewBody": "I have made this dish several times and always make it just a little different each time. My husband who doesn’t care for tator tots absolutely loves this. Tonight I made it with ground Turkey and I added sliced mushrooms, minced garlic, sautéed onions, green beans , a pinch of garlic salt, a pinch of pepper, a pinch sea salt and of course the cream of mushroom soup and the cheese and tator tots was fantastic and my husband went back for 2nds. This will definitely be a meal that’s added to our menu"

It still tastes wonderful and he doesn’t like veggies. Actually the first time I did the substitution I didn’t tell him and he told me it was better than the last time!"

"reviewBody": "My ex-wife served this to me one year more than 20yrs ago, I enjoyed it considerably so I got the recipe from her, I have since made some modifications. As far as seasoning the meat is concerned, I always add half of a large onion Diced of course, pepper to taste and a touch of salt, but I do also change up what I use to season the meat, sometimes I use Taco Seasoning, or Chili Powder, just whatever I'm feeling at the time. Then I mix the Cream of Mushroom to the beef and use that as my bottom layer, then I layer on a can of Cut Green Beans, a couple handfulls of Frozen Peas(I'd prefer Fresh but never have them and Frozen works much better than Canned), sometimes I also add just over a half can of Corn. Then I layer on some cheese(I usually use some sort of Chedder or Colby, type depending on mood), then I layer on the Tater Tot's. I cook it to the point that the Tot's are browning and crispy. Sometimes I'll sprinkle on some cheese to the top near the end of the cook and finish it in the oven slightly crisping the top cheese. I've always had great reviews of my \"adjustments\", having cooked this for family as well as visiting missionaries."

In addition hamburger was cooked with 1/2 GREEN bell pepper 1 whole white onion and 2 tablespoons of chopped garlic. Once that was cooked and drained. I drained a can of corn and a can of peas. Put the meat in a bowl, added the corn and peas, then poured the soup in. Mixed together gently. Poured into 9 x 13 dish added tator tots cooked at 375° FOR 40 MINS. Removed from oven then added the cheese and Italian seasoning to the top of that. 15 more mins in the oven to melt cheese. Delicious to me but my wife said it needed more salt. She always wants more salt. 😆"

I do add a splash of Worcestershire sauce to the hamburger meat while I’m cooking it and I put about half a cup of cheese over the mixture before I add the tater tot‘s. I leave the top cheese off until the tater tots are nice and crispy. Then I add a ridiculous amount of cheese to the top and cook it for five minutes or so until it’s all melted. Add a side of veggies and some crescent rolls and you have a complete meal that will serve a houseful of even picky eaters. I used half cheddar and half Colby Jack last night and it was delicious as well."
