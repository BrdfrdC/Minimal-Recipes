I used two pounds of ground beef, 32 ounces frozen green beans, onions, garlic powder and Worcestershire browned in, cheddar jack cheese in the mix, and a large can of cream of mushroom, and milk to texture. Then I put the goop in a standard sheetcake pan plus our Pyrex 8x8, and layered on more cheese, French's fried onions, and a 32ounce package of tater tots. We have a Mixed generation family of seven; I will note how it goes! TK said it was the stuff! Teenagers were not fans. I thought it had a nice buttery finish, but you could barely tell that I drained the beef and onions in the colander!"

"reviewBody": "I liked this recipe but found it a little salty. I have been eating/making tater tot casserole since I was a child and always loved it, but my mom made it with no seasonings and my husband found it bland when I started making it for him. I like that this recipe uses only 1/2 lb of hamburger. My mom's old recipe used a full pound and that is too much. The garlic salt adds great flavor, but next time I will use 1/2 the garlic salt and 1/2 garlic powder to cut the saltiness. I didn't see a need for the milk, I think it would make it too watery, so I left it out. I included a good handful of shredded cheddar cheese and about a tablespoon of sour cream for extra flavor. I also used only 1/2 can beans and I used yellow wax beans (chopped up) so the kids wouldn't notice the vegetables. The color blends right in and they didn't even know they were eating beans in their casserole. Thanks for the update to my old family recipe. Kids really like this and it's great for the meat and potatoes husband."

I used a whole pound of ground beef and added a tablespoon of Montreal steak seasoning. I also added about a cup of shredded Colby jack, cheddar cheese. I did not have that high expectations for it, but the kids ate it up and I enjoyed it too. There seemed to be some confusion about the 10 3/4 ounces milk. That is a soup can full which is what I added and it came out perfect."

"reviewBody": "This was a pretty good tater tot casserole, better then the last recipe I tried on here but still wasn't very memorable. I made mine a bit differently, this is what I did. I used 1 lb. of hamburger and while I browned it I used salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and some steak seasoning (Lawrys to be exact) I drained the meat, added the one can of mushroom soup and 1/2 cup of milk and that seemed to be the perfect consistency for 1 lb. of hamburger. I added one can of corn instead of green beans, and mixed about half a bag of shredded cheddar cheese to it, topped with tater tots, baked for a half hour, took it out and topped it with the rest of the bag of cheddar and then baked for about another 10 mins until the cheese was melted. It wasn't a bad casserole but it just needs a little more 'spunk' than the recipe lists. Over all, I'd say give it a try but add your own seasoning, and plenty of them. (:"

After cooking that up I added the soup and milk, stirred and put into a casserole dish. Topped it with frozen mixed veggies then cheese. At this point I put it in the fridge for the day - overnight would have been fine. Later I cooked it covered about 30 min then put on as many tater tots as looked right and cooked uncovered another 30 minutes until the potatoes were done. Very good and filling on a cold night and I really like make ahead stuff. Great dish Drew and thanks to \"something different again?!\" for posting the picture that made me think of mixed veggies and cheese."

Last night I made it a second time, and I still had problems with it being soupy, but I added one of Tastfully Simple's meat spices to the beef while I cooked it to give it flavor. I also topped the dish with cheese before I baked it. Overall, I think I will omit the milk the next time I make this dish, but it's definitely a keeper in my book!"

I added shredded cheese into the mixture until melted (I probably used about 1 cup of cheese). I also use a pound of ground beef. I like my tater tots crispier than this recipe makes them, so if I have time, I bake the tater tots by themselves for a bit before putting them on top of the meat mixture. Otherwise, it is an easy and excellent recipe!"

I did not add the green beans but made steamed broccoli, cauliflower and carrot dish on the side. I also added a half pound of ground turkey with the ground beef and seasoned it with garlic pepper and onion powder while it browned. In addition, I added about a half cup of shredded ched/jack cheese to the mix and then sprinkled a little more over top before placing the tots. I also prefer using Ore Ida Crispy Crowns as they are flatter and seem to crisp better."

I mixed everything for the sauce in the pan on the stovetop, got it warm quickly, microwaved the tator tots til warm. Added the tots on top and threw in a 450 degree oven until they got a little crunchy. A good recipe, but a little salty for me, but I like no salt. Will make again."

I add a dash of white cooking wine, about a 1/4 cup of sour cream, and shredded cheese right under the tots. Makes an excellent dish. Simple and quick, this is a great recipe that anyone will love!\n\nEdited to add: I also add a little Worcestershire sauce to the hamburger meat. It gives it a wonderful flavor when paired with the wine and sour cream. LOVE it!!"
