I use cream of chicken soup just because it's our preference. I mix the soup with the browned, seasoned ground beef and put that in the bottom of a baking dish. I put a can of French Cut green beans on top of that, a substantial layer of shredded cheddar cheese and then I line up the tater tots on top. The first time my DIL made it for my son he walked in, looked at it and said \"What's that?\" She announced it was tater tot casserole, she had just dumped the tater tots on top and it was unrecognizable to him. He informed her \"Mom always lines them up...\" She let him know he was spoiled! LOLOL!!! Gotta love tater tot casserole!!"

I usually make it for my family/coworkers so I double the batch and use a 50oz can of cream of mushroom instead of four smaller cans of cream of mushroom and cream of celery and it turns out perfect. I also don’t defrost the tater tots and just mix them in frozen. I like that this recipe doesn’t call for mixed vegetables because most of the people I cook for are picky and don’t like the taste/texture of mushy cooked vegetables in hot dish, besides the onion, of course. The crunchy fried onions really top it off nicely. I place foil over the pan for the first 45 minutes in the oven and then remove it for the last 15 minutes so the fried onions get crispy and browned but not burnt. This will definitely be a staple in my recipe box!"

Did use cream of mushroom. I added 1/2 C mild cheddar cheese to the soups, 1 T Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 can cut green beans, small can of corn. For prep, I left the tater tots frozen and place 1/2 the bag on the bottom of dish (sprayed with Pam), added the mixture of soups, meat, veggies, then topped with the rest of the tots. I sprinkled 1/2 C mild cheddar cheese on top. I left out the french fried onions only because I didn't have them. Next time I will use them but not the plain variety but the cheesy ones. My husband had seconds. A definite comfort food perfect for cooler weather. I also added minced garlic while cooking the meat and onions."

"reviewBody": "Preheated oven 400 and cooked tots on a baking sheet while working on meat gravy (~20min). Cooked 1 lb ground pork and part of an onion, added seasonings (½ tsp @: cayenne, garlic powder, paprika, pepper, thyme, Worcestershire; no salt), lowered heat and stirred in one can cr. of mushroom soup and one can milk, turned off after blending. Put several leftover tator tots (hard &amp; dry from fridge) in the bottom of a deep pie plate, poured meat gravy over them, and smoothed mixture w back of spoon. Reduced oven to 350, placed baked tots over meat gravy. Dish was really full so put on top shelf w baking sheet on bottom in case it bubbled over. Baked 30 min, let sit out 10. Served with fresh cooked green beans. This was a little too spicy for us; also, I don't each much processed food so still on the salty side, can't imagine using another can of soup. I'll make it the same way again, but omit cayenne (spicy) and Worcestershire (because adds salt) or reduce all my seasonings to 1/4 tsp. Hubby gave dish thumbs up, approved technique."

"reviewBody": "Being from Wisconsin, this is a hotdish that my family has done for years except for the fried onions. I tried it that way and is just as good. The way we make ours is 2 lbs hamburger, 3 cans cream of mushroom, 4 cans of french style green beans drained, 3 cans of mushrooms drained, 1 bag of tater tots, and seasoning with salt/pepper. Sometimes we replace one can of beans with whole kernel corn, and sometimes add garlic powder. Fry the burger, in a casserole dish dump the soup/veggies/shrooms/salt/pepper and some a little bit of milk is added too. After the burger is cooked, drain and add to the mixture, stir and add the tots on top, the extra tots in the bag we push down into the mixture. Into the oven 350 for about 45 mins till the tots on top are browned and done how you like.....and then enjoy!....you can add onion too if you don't have picky eaters at home."

Still used 2 cans of soup - cream of mushroom and cheddar cheese - both Healthy Choice, and it was great. Added 1 can of green beans and about 1 cup of cooked frozen corn on top of the hamburger. Also put about 8 oz of cheddar cheese between the hamburger and the veggie layer. The changes I would make if still using the same size casserole dish would be go ahead and use the full 1 1/2 lbs of hamburger and maybe just a few more veggies. halfway through baking I topped with crushed Lay's potato chips. Served with Louisiana Hot Sauce!"

Mix meat mixture into soup before putting into casserole dish. Put tators on top, but I think next time I will add them into the mixture. The crunchy onions on top provided the \"crunch\" that is needed. So So good!!! TY very much."

Also, someone in my family is lactose intolerant, so we followed the recipe and skipped the cheese. Don't worry, it does not need cheese, it's great as-is!"

"reviewBody": "This is an easy Tuesday meal that you can tailor to your tastebuds easily. Reminds me a little of shepherds pie. I mixed up ground beef and ground sausage. 1lb of each. Browned that with onion and garlic. Partially cooked frozen sweet corn and green beans in French onion soup. Mixed that up with the beef and 2 cans cream of mushroom (would have subbed one of the cans with cream of celery if I had it). Added a little bit of onion soup to mixture so it didn't dry out in the oven. Spread that in a 9x13 pan. Sprinkled with pepper. Covered in cheddar cheese. Topped that with Tator tots. Cooked at 425 20 min till the tots crisped up. Everybody loved and it wasn't too salty. :-) It's the next day and the pan is gone. I forgot the onion crisps but those will be used next time."

But we had some hamburger to cook up and when we cleaned out the pantry we must have had 20 cans of cream of mushroom soup so I looked up recipes and found this one. We were pleasantly surprised. We seasoned the beef with garlic salt, seasoning salt, cayenne pepper and black pepper. We used 2 cans of the mushroom soup instead of the celery and added a cup of colby cheese to the soup. We cooked for 30 minutes, sprinkled the french fried onions on top and then baked for another 15. I was worried that it wouldn't be hot enough as the tater tots were still pretty frozen when we put it in the oven. But it was nice and hot. It fed four of us with about 3/4 cup leftover. It was a hit for lunch!"

I mixed the cream of celery soup in with the meat and spread the mushroom over the top of the tater tots and topped it with cheddar cheese slices then added the french-fried onions on top. I only used a lb of beef, how ever many tots it took to cover the top, and used the full cans of soup undiluted. It seemed to come out a bit salty for some reason even though I cut back the salt to less than 1/2 tsp. Easy recipe. Very filling. Man hearty. Thanks!"

Here is the trick, put tots in frozen on bottom, make ground beef as instructed then add your soups and canned veggies and mix all that together, we do corn and green beans. Also I add some cheese too. After I mix that all together I put it on top of the tots, and stir it every 15 min to break up tots. They end up broken up into the casserole in the end. Finally we put the fried onions on the last 10 min of cooking. YUMMY! Best tot casserole ever!"

I followed the recipe with the exception of adding a little roasted garlic while browning the hamburger and onions and sprinkling a handful of shredded cheese between the hamburger and potato layers. I only cooked this for about 40 minutes. The French fried onions were beginning to burn at the point. I would suggest not adding them until halfway through cooking time. Next time I think I would add more shredded cheese and maybe an extra can of soup, but that's just a personal preference. My husband and two year old enjoyed it and the leftovers were good as well."

Mixed soups, and meat together, add 1 cup of frozen broccoli cuts, 1 cup of frozen sweet corn to soups/meat. Cover bottom of 9x13 casserole dish, only had 1/2 a bag of tater tots so placed them on top, and then sprinkled the fried onion rings over the entire dish. Popped it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes uncovered. Left the cheese out completely, and it was great. Thanks for a great base recipe, and a quick &amp; easy dinner for us."

My boyfriend doesn't like crispy onions, so for added crisp, having the tators on top made it a good medium.
