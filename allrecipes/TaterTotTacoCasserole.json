I didn’t have enough tater tots, so used potato pom poms instead - I think the tater tots would have been better as they would have provided more texture. Didn’t rate 5 stars as I felt it was lacking something - didn’t seem hearty enough as a meal. I think it has good potential though, and I might try it as a filling for burritos with salad."

It’s hard to get that guy to eat veggies.) I added it to the meat mixture. Then I split a some of the tots and threw them into the mixture as well. I put most of the tots on top with cheese under them and over them as well as some black olives. It’s nothing special but it’s good, filling comfort food. Works well as leftovers/ take to work for lunch kinda thing and like I said you can hide veggies in it if you have picky eaters!"

It was so delicious!"

I opted to build this like one of the most helpful reviews shared. \nI used an oven proof skillet to cook the beef, onion, corn, spice mixture and added 1/3 of the sauce. Then I’m sprinkled half of the cheese on top of that, followed by the tots. Drizzled the remaining sauce and cheese. Then baked for 30 minutes. The tots come out crisp and the bottom is cheesy and delicious. Served with sour cream and picked jalapeños. Great Party dish."

I thought it was a little spicy and next time will use 1/2 can of the chili peppers. Note....If you mix the tater tots will the meat as I did, the tots get absorbed into the casserole (which my family thought was good). If you put them on top to become crisp, they will taste more like tater tots. It all depends on your preference. I will be making this again."

"reviewBody": "This was very good! I did not add the onion and used a little dried minced onion as the beef was cooking instead as I don't care for a lot of onion. I also saw from the reviews that some people thought the tots got soggy and/or lost in the mix so I tossed some into the beef mixture but then layered the rest on top. That gave the tots the nice crispiness I think a lot of people were missing. This is something I'll add to my stock of \"things that should reheat well so I can make a batch and eat it for work lunches for a few days\" repertoire."

I’d also omit the taco seasoning and use plain cumin and chili powder to eliminate much of the salt. The only change I had made was to add a can of green chilies as so many suggested. I doubt I will give this another try though."

My youngest said he would eat it without the black beans:) \nI made recipe as is and the only think I would change next time around(making it again for sure) would be to layer the tater tots on top of the meat mixture. It will allow them to keep their shape and maybe get a crispy coating. \nMixed in with beef mixture, they fall apart. \nOverall, great recipe, Thank You!"

"reviewBody": "The taco seasoning with the enchilada sauce made too much red chili flavor, overpowering and not great. We added diced green chillis, which was good, and precooked the tots and baked with them only on top. I don't think you can overcook the tots in this dish. I would not do it as recommended. I think for this dish to have a better chance of success, I I would add sour cream to counter the chili, and absolutely cut some or all of the taco seasoning."

Amazing recipe and thanks to all the cooks before me, I made some 'tweeks' that I believe made this extra delicious. \n\nFollowing breakfast tater tot recipes to keep the tater tots crispy, I baked the tater tots for 10 minutes while browning the meat. I too added a can of mild diced chills and used my own taco seasoning mix to control the sodium. Onions and diced red peppers were sautéed with the meat to create additional flavor. And, just like a lasagna, I layered: Enchilada sauce (Hatch's green enchilada sauce), meat mixture, cheese and then the tater tots. I topped the tots with the remaining enchilada sauce and cheese. Family really enjoyed this comfort casserole! Thanks for the recipe."

"reviewBody": "COVID-19 5/10/2020 - I didn’t think we would like this recipe, but we did! I made this recipe almost as written since I had most of the ingredients on hand. Yes, I made some changes, but we’re in a Pandemic people and ya just gotta do what ya gotta do. I had frozen corn and diced up a red bell pepper, half of a jalapeño, and a little extra onion to try and add the flavors of a Mexican or Southwestern Style Corn. I grated cheddar cheese as I had a block of cheese and not a Mexican blend. My can of enchilada sauce was 15oz whereas the recipe calls for 12oz. I froze the remaining 3oz enchilada sauce. Your enchilada sauce used will make or break this dish, imho. So, make sure you’re using a sauce you like or doctor up whatever you’re using first to make your own enchilada sauce as Gina did. We loved the flavors of this easy casserole that yields plenty of leftovers, especially if you pair it up with a salad for a side. I felt the casserole could have used some extra sauce or tomatoes, but my husband thought it was fine. The tater tots are on the soft side with some crunch on top, but during reheating in microwave they get softer as expected, but nothing that deterred us from eating leftovers. Next time, I would not put enchilada sauce on top of the tater tots. To make it easier, I’ll use my cast iron to cook the meat and veggies, stir in the enchilada sauce, maybe add in some petite diced tomatoes or Rotel (unless using a medium/spicy enchilada sauce), place a layer of tater tot"

I have made tater tot casserole before and could not wrap my mind around mixing the tater tots INTO the casserole. I followed others and added green chiles in and had to put the tater tots on top. I made one for our family and then one for the quarantined family. I sent along a container of sour cream since others had said they eat it with sour cream. I enjoyed this recipe. I can't say I like it better than the other tater tot casserole but I can say I have 2 recipes that I will be making in the future. My friend asked for the recipe!"

I would recommend putting the tater tots in the baking dish and then pour the rest of the mixture over it. Combining everything before adding it to the dish and then pressing things down just creates a big pile of mush. Also, there's nothing green in the recipe, but the pictures appear to feature green onions. I'd definitely suggest adding those as a nice dash of color. And I'm not sure the enchilada sauce adds to this recipe all that much. I'd be interested in trying it without."
