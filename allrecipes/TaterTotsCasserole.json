I subbed a lot of things (ground turkey, cream of chicken, and lawery’s seasoning salt), but used the same measurements/amounts and did not find it soupy at all. Lastly, I added corn on top of the soup/milk mixture... and again, the addition did not make it soupy. I’m not sure what happened to those who did have a soupy casserole. Anyway, will continue to build my tater tot casserole like this and refer to this recipe- adjusting to taste/what I have on hand."

I appreciated the crunchy texture. I also used an 8x11 baking dish and glad I did. A 9x13 would have thinned out the dish too much."

I followed directions and ingredients as written.\n\n It is a bit one dimensional, on the savory side, probably great for the kids but I will probably add something to brighten it up just a bit and give it some texture, maybe some corn or chopped broccoli, perhaps even some chopped green olives, something to add just a bit of acidity to cut through the richness. However, this is a great base recipe and a wonderful starting point if you'd like to add your own touch."

I had some leftover pork roast that I ground up. I did add some chopped garlic to the sauted onion rather than garlic powder. Didn't have cream of mushroom but had cream of chicken soup. I increased the milk to 3/4 cup because we like things moist. Ended up baking for 50 minutes so that the top tots were golden. Wonderful comfort food. Next time I might add a layer of green beens or other veggie to make it a bit more healthy. Thanks"

Seeing how it had meat and potatoes I had to add a vegetable so it was an all in one complete meal. Definitely will be making again, was a hit."

Either way, this is an excellent dish as written and will take modifications like fresh mushrooms or green beans easily. I don't understand the negative reviews, at all. They either didn't follow the recipe (as many admitted, they used substitute seasoning) or they simply have a mouth full of faulty taste buds. Easy and delicious and the Mister went back for thirds! Thanks!"

I used an 8 oz block for the whole recipe. 1/2 cup in the meat mixture and the rest on top 15 minutes before the dish was done. The steak seasoning made it really tasty. This recipe is a keeper!"

"reviewBody": "20 smashed tater tots is insufficient amount to cover the bottom of the 13x9 dish called for in the recipe. As a result the 800 g bag of tater tots I purchased, was insufficient to cover the top of the casserole sufficiently. (In Canada food is sold in grams not ounces so I have no idea if the bags are the same size). Also, I would recommend heating the mushroom soup mixture slightly to make it easier to \"pour\" over the beef mixture. And, I added mixed vegetables to the beef mixture to make it a more rounded meal. \n\nI would make this again, making certain to buy enough tater tots to get the desired coverage."

I've also left out the onions (since they sometimes don't agree with me) and it still tasted great. I serve it on a plate with some mixed veggies and it's a great meal. The other thing I've done is substitute the ground beef with breakfast sausage and added sausage pan gravy instead of mushroom soup &amp; milk, which makes a great brunch casserole to serve with eggs."
