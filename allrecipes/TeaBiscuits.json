I also added 1/2 cup sugar and 1 cup golden raisins. Baked at 400Â° for 12 mins. The biscuits were still pale on top but golden on the bottom. I used baking spray on one cookie sheet, a silpat on the other, and the baking spray yielded a slightly darker bottom."

The biscuits turned out AMAZING. I also didn't roll them out; after kneading, I would grab small balls of dough, flatten it a bit with my hand, and then cut the shape out. I got 10 biscuits, each about 2 inches in diameter from this recipe."

I used an unflavored crisco, same as I typically use in my biscuits. I do believe it would have been improved with some bacon fat or butter flavored crisco.\nMy husband said he prefers my other recipe for biscuits - and I can't remember which one he's talking about! I've been trying out a few new ones lately! Ha!\n*I followed another reviewers suggestion to try using seran wrap on a slightly damp counter - worked great! Eliminated the mess completely! I didn't even add flour :)"

Phew!!! :) I only say that because I took a risk and doubled the recipe (needed double the amount that the original recipe makes) Of course I made some modifications ;) reduced the baking powder to half the amount, and I don't use shortening so I used butter instead (only had salted butter so I reduced the amount of salt to half of what is says originally). I have made biscuits many times and this is the recipe I like the most... So I highly recommend it! \nThank you for sharing this recipe, Debbie."

"reviewBody": "I have made these biscuits several times and I've always had excellent results. It is one of my go to recipes when I want a recipe I know is going to please. Today is different in that I used organic for all of the ingredients including organic coconut shortening. The results were just the same, wonderful. Next time I will try using my own organic milled flour and see what happens. I'm sure they will be heavy but I'm pretty sure they'll still be great. Thanks for a great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I was looking for a simple, basic biscuit recipe to make with my 6 year old grand-daughter - we changed two things. We used all butter and used the drop method rather than rolling out and cutting them. The recipe makes a good, basic tender biscuit. Someone else mentioned that too much handling makes them tough - that is exactly what I learned over the many years I have been making biscuits."

They mixed well and I dropped the dough rather than rolled it out. They turned out good. However in the future I am going to reduce the salt to 1/4 of a teaspoon and reduce the baking powder as well. With a little tweaking I am confident this will be a family favorite."

Tips for GREAT biscuits that I've learned from better bakers than me include:\n- Don't overmix or over-handle the dough. It should be craggy and rough, not smooth and stretchy like bread dough;\n- Press your biscuit cutter straight up-and-down, don't twist it;\n- Let the cut biscuits \"rest\" on the baking sheet for about 10 minutes before baking;\n- Brush the top of each biscuit with milk before baking for a lovely golden finish. \nTHANK YOU DEBBIE for this great recipe!!! It's as good as my grandmother's, and that's hard to beat."
