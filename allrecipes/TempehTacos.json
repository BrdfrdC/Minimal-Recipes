I used one of the taco seasoning recipes on this site, used regular tempeh (found that I can just sort of crumble it in the pan rather than shredding it). I also diced some Yukon Gold potatoes and sauteed them before adding the tempeh and seasonings."

Also used water instead of vegetable broth and chopped up a fresh jalapeño with the onion. I used a taco seasoning recipe from the website. I will make again for sure!"

"reviewBody": "Wonderful recipe! I used non-seasoned tempeh and thought that there was plenty of flavor. For the taco seasoning, I used two tablespoons of the Taco Seasoning I recipe on this website. I also threw in an extra clove of garlic, which is par for the course with me. Topped with avocado, pico de gallo, and olives. Thank you for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "I've made this a few times with several variations . I recommend steaming the tempeh for 10 minutes before cooking. This opens it up to absorb more favors. I add some tri color peppers and jalapeño and instead of taco season I do some chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper and may throw some fresh green onions on top. It's fun to play with the spices and add fresh veggies to make it a more balanced meal. I definitely recommend topping with salsa and guac or avocado. Thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Absolutely LOVE these as a meatless alternative to tacos! I didn't have any taco seasoning (although I scoured my cabinets) so I used some cumin and other spices for a homemade seasoning. My grocery store only had plain tempeh, but I thought the flavor was great as-is. We topped ours with avocado, salsa, lettuce, and sour cream and ate them on whole wheat tortillas. This is already in our weeknight rotation as a go-to dinner. Super quick, the husband loves it, AND it makes just enough for him to take the leftovers to lunch the next day. LOVE!"
