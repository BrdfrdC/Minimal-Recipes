I put them back in turning it up to 350 for another 1.5 hours and while they were good, still not done enough. I'm glad I checked on them otherwise we would have been foraging for leftovers at dinner time.\n\nEither 4 hours is not enough time, or 250f is not enough heat. I'm guessing 325 for 4 hours would do it. 250 might have worked on baby backs, but not spare ribs."

Made three racks and adjust amounts accordingly. Ran sauce and foil drippings through a soup separator to remove fat. Reduced all and poured it over the ribs for the time under the broiler. Very tasty."

Took them to a pot luck they where the first thing gone by half an hour.\n\n\nUsed only a 1/4 cup of dry fajita seasoning\nWiped off all excess rub, after 12 hour in fridge.\nused half the amount of beer and used plain bbq sauce for the other half.\nOnly cooked in Oven for 2.5 hours. More and they get too soft.\nchared on the bbq for 15 minutes.\n\nWife is super fussy about ribs, and these are here favourite"

"reviewBody": "Fantastic results! I only had taco seasoning for the rub so I used that, and smoked paprika. I used Redd's Wicked Apple Ale because it seemed like a good paring for the pork vs a darker beer. I let it sit overnight with the rub, then baked in the oven for three and a half hours at 250* like the recipe calls for. The drippings were pretty fatty, so like most everyone I tried to remove the fat and keep the juices. After simmering for ten maybe fifteen minutes, eventually I just poured whatever I was left with over the ribs. Back in the oven to broil....very tender, very good. Friends have requested the method of cooking and BF has asked for more to be made. Thank you so much for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "These were seriously so good, they literally fell off of the bone. I impressed myself that I was able to modify the recipe with what I had #1 but that my entire family devoured them. I followed the recipe somewhat exactly. I make my own taco seasoning and didn't have quite half a cup so I used what I did have. I also used regular paprika, and 1 rack of pork ribs versus two (I ended up throwing away a lot of the seasoning). We ran out of beer--HELLO it was New Years Day, so I substituted with A&amp;W rootbeer. Other subsititutions I made were regular mustard because I didn't have brown mustard, and I didn't have honey--well planned I know. It seriously turned out amazing. These pleased ages 2 and up to 56. You will not regret making them."

Doubled \"sauce\" to bake in and cooked 3 1/2 hours at 225 degrees, then last hour and half raised temp to 250 degrees (Total cooking time approx 5 hours-my ribs were smaller than the ones in the video). Followed recipe exactly other than those minor changes. Served with asparagus and rice pilaf. YUMMMY!!!"

Sealing the foil packet very well IS important and poor sealing could cause dry ribs. The meat was falling off the bones of mine, and the flavor was fantastic. I did mix BBQ sauce with the thickened braising juices before caramelizing (in video, not in recipe). Glad I did."

Only four hours in the fridge. Did the next steps per recipe. I kept the ribs in the oven for 4 hours but that was too long - next time will do maximum 3-1/2 or even 3 hours. Finished them off on the grill with a little Stubbs to char. They were falling apart on the grill, and they were awesome!!! Ironically, Stubbs spicy bbq sauce was on sale at the market and I had it in my fridge -- didn't even see this video until after I made these. It was a very nice addition."

I follow the recipe to the T, although this last time I substituted a ginger ale instead of beer and it was just fine. My tip: pay close attention to the meat at that 3:45-4:00 mark. In my 250F oven I have somewhat tough spare ribs at 3:30, but by 4:00 the meat won’t even hang on the bone. Perfect is somewhere just prior to fall-off-the-bone. Like it wants to be on the bone and you can cut the ribs apart, but a good knock on your plate and the meat will come loose."

Honestly I only use fajita season, paprika and light Brown sugar and let them soak over night in the fridge. Using the foil keeps them moist and tender and allows for even cooking. Sometimes when I have more time or my husband and I can eat later in the evening I just let them cook in he oven for about 6 hours and they’re great! Thanks for the recipe!"

The ribs were so tender, when I lifted them out of the foil with the tongs, they fell apart &amp; a rib bone came out! I tried to thicken the drippings but didn't have a way to separate the fat so it didn't work.

"reviewBody": "Update! I have to admit I'm not a fan of chili powder in anything, but with this recipe, it's not all that strong. However, I still wanted to try it without so this time I substituted McCormick's Smokey Applewood season mix for the fajita mix. I also substituted real maple syrup for the honey. Having done this enough times, I've made a couple other tweaks. I double the dry-rub ingredients and really slather each rack with the mixture. I see a few people have made comments about reducing the juices after the 3 hr. cook time - I find that if I spend some extra time skimming off the grease/fat from the juice, it seems to go significantly faster. That said, it still takes a good 15-20 min to reduce this to a glaze at medium heat. As I said, I've made these at least 6-7 times and they are a friend/family favorite! The down side is I no longer want to order ribs when I go out to eat, because nothing compares!\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nSTOP THE BUS! These were fantastic! As good or (dare I say) better than any ribs I've ever had at a restaurant. Thanks so much for sharing this. Definitely will be making again (SOON!)"
