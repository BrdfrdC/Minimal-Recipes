I experimented and substituted 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour with whole wheat for a little added nutrition and body. May add more next time. I found that getting the waffles to medium brown resulted in extremely internally tender waffles. If I went beyond that they could lose too much moisture and become tough. This will be a go-to recipe."

"reviewBody": "My family love these waffles! For a little bit of backstory: My parents love having Eggo waffles as part of their breakfast rotation. After having half a carton of buttermilk left and not knowing what to do with it, I looked for the easiest recipe with the pantry staples I had on hand. These waffles came into play. I made a batch of these and cooked them on my Dash mini waffle maker, then left them in the freezer and labeled them ‚Äúhomemade eggos‚Äù. My parents loved them, and immediately asked for more with different flavours! I‚Äôve made these using chocolate chips, dried blueberries, freeze dried strawberry powder, and cinnamon, and all have turned out amazing! They heat up incredibly quickly and well in the toaster oven also!"

But after that I spread them more around my very old fashioned rectangle waffle maker before I closed it and made sure to fully cook them and they were really delicious! Served them with sliced bananas and warm maple syrup. Look forward to toasting the leftovers"

Soft and fluffy inside, crisp outside, rich and sweet but not overly so. I like my waffles to be a base that can be topped with more sweets like whipped cream and berries OR savory stuff like meat, eggs, cheese. Of course, sweet and savory can be epic: one of these waffles with a slice of ham, covered in manchego and fresh raspberries or fruit preserves? Mmm.\n\nIf you need the most airy waffles ever, and don't mind the time and effort, then whip the egg whites. But if you want a very good waffle with plenty of air, make these as stated."

I would consider it a 5-star recipe as written because of how easy it is, how versatile it is, and (of course) how delicious the waffles are. It's fine as is, but you can kick up the flavor by doubling the amount of vanilla extract (or whatever extract you want), adding a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon, or doing both. I've used it in my Presto Flipside Waffle Maker for Belgian waffles. Each recipe makes 4 big fluffy Belgian waffles and takes about 4 minutes per waffle."

"reviewBody": "It was delicious and it was my first time making any waffles. I did premix in a third small mixing bowl the 2 large eggs with a fork along with the vanilla and I added a few shakes of cinmmon then I added it to my larger wet bowl mix. I also slowly poured the dry mix bowl into my wet ingredients bowl mixing it vigorously all with a fork. When it was done cooking in my waffle maker I garnished my cooked waffle on my serving plate with wild blueberries and whip cream and pure maple syrup."

These were the best waffles EVER even from what I can remember eating before I was diagnosed with celiac. They were a snap to whisk together &amp; they were so light &amp; airy yet crispy on the outside. Thank you for sharing this recipe!"

I recommend adding another cup of flower to the batter to get them to fluff. Taste is a little buttery if you like that. If not cut back on the butter. Kids ate it and didn't complain but they were very thin."

"reviewBody": "These were very nice. My batter was a little thick and lumpy so I added a splash of regular milk. Flour packs differently so it‚Äôs hard to judge by cup. They were crispy outside and tender inside as advertised. We always eat them hot off the waffle iron so no complaints about them getting soggy, which some of the extra ones did a bit on the plate. Should use a rack maybe. Delicious with sweetened sliced fresh peaches. Buttermilk really puffs up nicely so I was happy to find this recipe."

I edited the recipe a little based on previous reviews by adding 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp almond extract. I also used regular buttermilk and added the extract to the egg mixture before combining with the buttermilk instead of at the end. The batter will be lumpy but the waffles looked amazing and tasted great! I am bookmarking this recipe!"

These waffles held up very well under the toppings)) and everyone liked them."
