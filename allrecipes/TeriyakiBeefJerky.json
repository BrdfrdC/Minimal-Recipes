I made another recipe the same day and put it in the dehydrator and this recipe came out better. Not only from the smoky flavor from the wood chips but also the texture. I'm guessing this would work great with venison too."

Wife loved the taste but i did leave it on just a little too long or had the heat just a little too high. Also could have left the strips a little thicker than I did. Will defiantly try this one again to get it better. Still real happy with my first attempt at smokeing."
