My mom used to make this exact recipe growing up. My brothers and sister and I all loved it. And now I’m privileged to be able to have and make this myself! Thank you to whomever it may concern. Also, my husband loved it too, so it’s a winner. We will be making this one of our regulars."

Put all the ingredients with the chicken legs into a turkey bag(Plastic). Let it sit in the refrigerator for about two or three hours. When ready to cook put the bag inside Aluminum tray. When I felt it was good to take out the bag I did and let it continue baking till it was ready. My husband and boys loved it my young one loved it so much he started to pick some off my plate. ?? All in All I will be making it again soon. Was delicious. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe with myself and others."

Thirty minutes later I have fantastic teriyaki chicken. I don’t marinade but do cook it this long so it shreds and the flavor is throughout the meat. I double the recipe and triple the sauce so we can have some for dinner and I can put a few freezer meals away for lunches. Won’t ever buy teriyaki sauce again. Great for company too! Everyone LOVES it!!!"

"reviewBody": "Wow is this one of the next marinades that I have found on this site. I used a whole chicken and cut it up into the thigh leg wing etc. I put it all in a gallon size bag and let marinate all day. I cooked and basted for one hour and oh boy this chicken is moist, flavorful and has a beautiful brown glaze on it. I used the extra marinade as a dipping sauce. I let it boil down on the stove for about 10’ and added a rouge to thicken it up. It was a little salty but still good. This recipe was soooo delicious that I made it again that same week. Everyone loved it. The only thing I did was add a run consisting of garlic and onion powder, cumin, pepper and a tiny pinch of cayenne pepper. I mixed it together and lifted the skin and rubbed the dry ingredients all over the meat. Then laid the skin back on. It really kicks up the chicken a notch and gives it a little spicy sweet bite to your mouth. I also used brown sugar instead of white. Thanks for the recipe."

I let the chicken marinate in the teriyaki sauce for as long as I possibly can (the longer the better) so it marinates in the fridge for 2 days at least and what a difference it makes! I also use brown sugar. 100% recommend.. so yummy!"

Its defintely better than, what they serve in the bottle at the grocery stores."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was amazing! My family is pretty picky about their teriyaki sauce. I have not found a bottled version that we like. This is a definite keeper! I doubled the recipe, used low sodium soy sauce and used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I baked in a pan. When the chicken was done, I took it out of the pan. I stirred into the sauce 2 tablespoons of cornstarch which I had stirred in cold water first. I cranked up the heat to 400 degrees and let it boil till it thickened. It mad a fabulous sauce to put over the chicken and rice. So fantastic. Next time I'm going to try with pineapple and add some acid as suggested. But as is, it's delicious. I wonder how it would taste with a flank steak?"

"reviewBody": "Great recipe! Chicken turned out beautiful and tasted great too. I am diabetic so I made a change -- instead of the 3/4 cup of granulated sugar, I used the equivilent in powdered stevia. To those individuals wanting to do the same, it is easier to mix stevia in warm/hot vs. cold. Soooo, heat-up that soy sauce before adding the stevia powder!\r\nAlso, I let the chicken marinate for about 8 hours and basted it every 6 to 10 minutes while cooking."

I also used 1/2 cup of orange juice, as recommended by someone else's review and 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger instead of the fresh ginger. I found the orange juice gave it a slightly different taste, but I enjoyed it. I also added 1 cup of broccoli, 1 cup of carrots and 1 cup of celery to it."

Also, I used chicken breast rather than a whole chicken. I only needed about 42 minutes in a 13 by 9 inch dish at 350 uncovered, and it came out perfect! I also just dumped the contents (marinade and all) from my ziplock bag into the dish and spread it out. This is delicious restaurant quality!!"

It was so sodium-packed that my mom and I were not able to finish our chicken breast! I know I must have done something wrong because everyone else seems to love this recipe. Could someone please let me know what I may have done wrong? Should I have used \"low-sodium\" soya sauce?\r\n\r\nThis recipe just looks so good - I'd like to know how to make it right!\r\n\r\nThanks!"
