As it was pouring rain outside, I opted to broil for 5 minutes each side. It was perfectly medium rare and tender when thinly sliced. And yummy! The only change I will make next time will be to marinate longer (over night) for a deeper flavor. Love that marinade!"

I also found low sodium Teriaki sauce. It only came in a 10 ounce bottle so I just used that verses adding in the full 2 cups. One more thing that I did what to crush fresh garlic cloves into it. I used about 4 cloves. I love garlic so it really help to add to the flavor of this dish. I broiled it as it is too cold to use the barbq. VERY good and very easy to make. Thank you for sharing!"

Making sure I have a cool spot on the grill, I sear the meat until there are some char spots on it, then move it over to the cool spot, cover the grill, let it cook to the desired doneness (medium rare for us) and then slice it into wafer thin slices against the grain of the meat, and ooooo-la-la! Leftovers make incredible salads and sandwiches. Well, you already know that!Thanks for sharing your recipe and technique. Al"

I followed the suggestion of others who were short on marinading time by nicking the meat before marinading - half an hour does the trick.\n\nTo life the marinade further, I added a dash of sherry and a teaspoon of brown sugar. \n\nBy the way, grill some mushrooms in the extra marinade - they are delicious this way."
