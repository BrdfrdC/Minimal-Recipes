I have brought them to church and school, and they always get scarfed down in no time.\n\nMy change: Instead of plain chocolate, I mix milk chocolate and caramel chips. I let them sit for 5 minutes, and then I gently swirl them across the top. Finally, I sprinkle the cookies with sea salt and slivered almonds before cutting. I press the almonds gently into the melted topping to help them stick. A-bloody-mazing and absolutely addictive."

"reviewBody": "I doubled the shortbread recipe and pressed it into a buttered parchment lined cookie sheet. Then topped it with a simple caramel sauce that would harden when cooled. While the caramel was still warm, I sprinkled the top with good quality chocolate chips and popped it back into a warm, turned off oven for 4 minutes to soften the chocolate but not get it too warm. I spread the chocolate chips with an offset spreader, then pressed crushed pecan pieces into the top of the chocolate before cooling. \n\nAmazing! Chewy, cookie bottom but with yummy caramel, chocolate, and pecans. This is what toffee is!"

"reviewBody": "I couldn't find my mother's old recipe so decided to give this one a try. Very disappointing, not a lot of flavor. Crust was very sticky and hard to press into pan. I think more chocolate is needed and maybe dark chocolate would have given it more flavor. I pressed my nuts down as some reviewers indicated, but many still fell off. I think the nuts fell off because there just isn't enough chocolate to hold them on. I would try a different recipe, as it just doesn't have much for flavor."

Still yummy! I used unsalted butter and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. The dough seemed too dry at first, but was just right once I spread it into the baking dish. The bars came out slightly flaky and chewy, and tasted even better the next day!"

The bars were delicious and very rich :) I used pecans on top. The only advice I might give would be to press the nuts into the chocolate- mine kinda fell off some. Next time I might add a layer of actual toffee so there's more toffee flavor here, but they were still really good bars!"

It seems like that's a large pan for the amount of dough, but trust me it's not. It's perfect!! This recipe is delicious. Keep in mind it's not actually toffee, but instead it's like a toffee tasting, chewy, buttery cookie dough. I use toffee bits on the top but honestly I think you could put any nuts you like, too (betting almonds would be fabulous). Very easy to make and a huge favorite with everyone at Thanksgiving. They are best (chewier) when they're not refrigerated."
