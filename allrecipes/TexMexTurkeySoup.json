My family tends to like broth based soups, so I followed the recipe, doubling the spices, and leaving out the sour cream and cheese, and it was superb! I know it’s not exactly the soup recorded here, but the elements I used were wonderful, and I look forward to making it again with all the ingredients!"

"reviewBody": "A good recipe to use the Thanksgiving Turkey leftovers! And a nice change from the creamy kind of soup. I had about 3 Lb of cooked turkey with bones in my freezer that I thawed overnight, so I used the bones with little bit of the attached meat to make a turkey broth in lieu of water and bouillon cubes. The other change I made was to reduce the tomatoes. I don't like soups that are too \"tomatoey\", so I skipped the tomato soup ( I never buy canned soups anyway) and used less diced tomatoes. Next time I will use 2 cans of beans to make the soup heartier. I served this soup with some avocado toasts."

I used the \"Juicy Thanksgiving Turkey\" recipe on here submitted by Kirsten (thanks Kirsten) and then decided to try this soup recipe with my turkey leftovers and it is wonderful--the only change I made was to dump everything in my crockpot and cook for 2 hours on high and added 1 cup of my turkey stock that was leftover from cooking my turkey in lieu of 1 of the 4 cups of water for this recipe; add some cornbread and you have a great quick meal that is healthy and comforting! I did rinse my turkey leftovers before shredding and putting in the crockpot as there was some of the rub left on them and I didn't want that to interfere with the flavor of the soup. Thanks!"

The only thing I changed was using canned chilis (1 4oz can) and the same for the olives. It just wasnt worth going to store! It gave just the perfect amount of flavor and spice. I also added a little more chicken stock because I like a little more broth. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. I plan on making it again, again, and again!"

I used chicken broth instead of water, added a can of chopped green chiles, more chili powder, and garnished as recommended , plus some sliced black olives and a little hot sauce. We like it spicy! Served with a salad, this was a very filling meal. I'll be making it again."

I used rotel instead of plain tomatoes (I didn't have any) and I think that gave it a nice kick which worked for us. Good as written but adjust spices to your preference"

It is great as written but I usually sub out the canned tomato soup and replace with tomato sauce or watered down tomato paste. I also add a can of chopped green chilies which gives it just the right amount of kick- without that I find it a little bit bland. But overall a great hearty delicious soup that the whole family loves!"

I don't think I made any changes to the recipe, which I often do. So Good. I'm making it tonight!"

I added the packaged Sazon seasoning (1 red packet), 3 huge table spoons of goya sofrito (store bought) and I made my own tortilla chips by deep frying tortilla shells. This was way better than the normal tortilla soup I buy. It was much cheaper and I loved the fact I was able to control the salt and seasonings. Oh yeah I didn't add the salsa because I don't like it very hot. My family including my niece was was a vegan (until she saw this cheesy gooey stooppppp). LOL!"

This really hit the spot. The flavor was very, very good. Mildly spiced, so you could kick it up if you prefer. My only change is that I left out the cilantro, only because I don't like the taste. It didn't taste as if something was missing. My husband loved it."

The only change I made was using homemade turkey and chicken stock instead of the water and bullion cubes. As well, I had no black beans on hand so I used some chickpeas instead. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it's great! Because my hubby doesn't like the texture of diced tomatoes, I threw all the ingredients for the second step into a blender and had a nice smooth creamy consistency. For those worried about the salsa - don't, it works!! I also thought there would be too much corn and turkey but it's the perfect amount! Thank you, thank you, thank you for such a tasty way to use up leftover turkey!!"

Used chicken broth instead of water and chicken bouillan. Served with shredded Mexican blend cheese and tortilla chips....very tasty, indeed. Would make this again."

It takes longer in the crock pot, but if you're not in a hurry to cook it's okay. Since we didn't do onions I just added the spices straight to the soup. Ours came out really spicy because my boyfriend decided to get the Hot Mexican Chili Powder and Spicy Salsa. I also added a tablespoon of garlic, but you couldn't really taste it. I also used cream corn on accident and it was really good. I think it calls for too much diced tomatoes so I would do a smaller can next time. We loved it though and we're going to try it again with different meats!"
