I took away half a star because adding the onions, peppers and bacon to the same pan with oil, does not crisp up the bacon. We ended up putting the whole bacon, pepper, onion, garlic mixture on a sheet pan and baking it, to crisp up the bacon. But Delicious!!!"

"reviewBody": "OMG these baked beans were fantastic! There are a couple of things I did differently and a few I'll do differently the next time I make them. \n\nUsed canned pinto beans - 4 cans, rinsed, was perfect. \n\nWe have a Big Green Egg, so definitely wanted to smoke this. I have a cast iron pot and used it to fry up the veggies and bacon. Spooned off the extra oil/fat after frying. Didn't use an additional dish - added the beans and sauces to the veggies in the pot. Pot went from stove to smoker to oven.\n\nAlso don't like super sweet beans so halved the brown sugar. \n\nThe bacon took forever to brown so next time I'll start with frying the diced bacon and add the veggies later without having to add additional oil.\n\nOur guests raved at the results! Awesome recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Made this recipe to accompany a smoked beef brisket and served it to family and friends. It was a HUGE hit with all. It's got some good spice to it using 2 whole jalapeño's (did not deseed or devein) so some folks felt it had a little too much \"kick\".\n\nSome changes I made were that I used a 4 bean blend of pinto's, black, kidney and great northern since that is what I had on hand and it brought a great flavor to the dish as well as nice color diversity. I received many compliments on that feature alone. \n\nAlso, I chose to cook the bacon separately from all the vegetables and then incorporate all the ingredients at the end prior to baking. This allowed the bacon to crisp much easier and allows you to remove any additional bacon fat if you don''t want all of it in the final product. I chose to remove about 1/4 of the bacon drippings prior to adding the bacon to the beans and it was awesome!\n\nThis won't replace my usual KC style sweet baked beans that is generations old but it will be my go-to for a Texas spin on beans when doing traditional Texas style BBQ."

I left the bacon out, because I had some people that were vegetarians, that would be eating them; I could have substituted soy bacon, however, for the amount of beans, I was making, the cost would have been very high. They turned out good without the bacon."

Really enjoyed that!! But did have a little problem..... In the interest of time, I used canned pinto beans. Golly, I would have cooked those beans another hour or so! They just weren't as tender as we would have liked. Could still eat the beans, but we chewed awhile. Think this would be terrific with remains of a fresh cooked pot of home cooked beans, seasoned while cooking with ham."

I made my own beans (from dried) so I could control the salt; I used one pound, not sure how the translates to cups when cooked.\n\nFollowed the recipe exactly, with a few small exceptions... I added a bit of liquid smoke in lieu of smoking, and put a splash of bourbon in them for extra flavor. I also cooked the bacon first, and added the peppers/onions in the last 5 minutes or so. Why cook them in oil when you have all of that flavorful bacon grease to cook them in?"

Used 3 Serrano peppers instead of Jalapenos. Used canned pinto beans, 2-15 oz Kuners with jalapeno and 1-30 oz regular Kuners drained and rinsed. Also used 1-1/2 lbs bacon and a vidalia onion. All else as written except I also put these on my smoker for a couple hours to pick up some smoke flavor. Definitely one of the best baked beans recipes I've ever made. Great side dish with the smoked ribs I made. Yummy yummy in my tummy as my youngest daughter says."

These were super simple to make and the house smelled soooo good while these were baking. I always get baked beans from a local market that we always considered 'the best' baked beans, but these surpass those, and are waaaaay cheaper to make than those ones are to buy, so that's a bonus. I did measure all of the liquid ingredients and brown sugar, but I did eyeball the onions and red pepper, and I'm sure I used more of those than the recipe called for. If I could give these beans more stars, I would...these are wonderful~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)"
