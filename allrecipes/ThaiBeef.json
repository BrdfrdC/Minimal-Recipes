"reviewBody": "This recipe's a pretty good starting point, but needs changes.\n\nFirst of all, they don't mention that coriander seeds need to be roasted before crushing and using. If you're not getting any flavor out of them, that's likely why.\n\nSecond, 1/2 cp. of sugar is ridiculous. 1 tbsp. is plenty. I would also suggest that you crumble 1 or 2 dried red peppers and add them to the marinade (discard the seeds). It won't make the dish spicy, just give it a slight hint of spice as an aftertaste.\n\nI made the recipe this way, in a wok, and it's delicious. If you have to substitute lemon for lime or cumin for coriander, so be it. But, you'll miss the way lime and coriander work together which is really the highlight of this dish."

Might stir in a spoonful of cornstarch after marinating before brushing onto beef next time. Maybe make beef lil more sticky. Also I used Ground Corriander and it has bit of \"powdery\" mouth feel texture that was weird."

I've used pork, chicken and beans as the main protein, along with myriad vegetables. I modified the marinade recipe for my family's tastes: 1T each cumin and coriander seed, along with a good squirt of siracha and dollop of molasses. I make a quadruple batch, using half of it for the recipe and the remaining to store in the fridge for future stir-fry. I'm not sure how long this actually lasts in the fridge; we end up using it up within a week to ten days. Family favorite. Thanks, BadLittleChef."

Cooking in a wok makes juices steam the meat which tends to over cook the meat and it's not as tender . I dry toasted my coriander in a cast iron skillet for about 3 minutes on high, shaking constantly, then crushed them up. This added a really nice flavor. I really love the tasted of the seeds. Next time I will however crush them in my grinder."

I don't have a broiling pan but everything works fine on a reg pan in the broiler. I use sushi rice as a side since it sticks a lil better"

Also, Flank Steak was a whopping $8.99/LB. So, between the cost of the meat and the cost of the Coriander IT WASN'T WORTH IT!"

"reviewBody": "Another super easy recipe that is out of this world. I couldn't find flank steak anywhere and wasn't liking the alternatives. As London Broil was on sale, I opted for that. I followed all other directions to the letter, but used fresh ginger instead.I did have to pound the snot out of the steak, though, so it would be tender enough to properly absorb the marinade, and marinated it for about 4 hours in lieu of the recommended hour. Scrumptious!"

"reviewBody": "My family loves this! I did read the reviews and made a few changes. We don't like coriander so I used cumin, and I added 1 teaspoon of lime zest I also used a small eye of round roast because I didn't have flank. I then poured the sauce over the roast and slow cooked it in the oven on 275 for about 3 hours, checking it every 30 minutes and basted the roast each time. I sautéed peppers, onions, and mushrooms in butter, salt and pepper and served it over white rice! If you like Chinese food, YOU WILL LOVE THIS! It is so easy! Next time I am going to make it in my crockpot!"

I also cooked the steak in a wok and took it out after a few minutes. I then put in a variety of chopped vegetables and softened rice noodles into the wok with the remaining juices and a little soy sauce. Yum"

"reviewBody": "Very delicious! I didn't have corriander so I subbed cumin since it's the closest spice profile. I also added a 1/2 Tbsp of molasses because I only had light brown sugar. The steak marinated for a few hours in a glass Pyrex Then, we transfered it to a cookie sheet to get an even cook. Make sure the sheet has depth because the marinade gets absorbed into the steak and once cooked the juices come out. Add in your favorite veggies, steamed or stir fried, and serve over rice. \n\nNext time I will try this in the wok. The marinade and juices released when the steak is cooked are so good that you end up spooning it on your veggies anyway. we also added Sriracha for heat. YUMMMMY! Even my very fickle 2 year old loved it."

"reviewBody": "Loved this simple flavorful recipe. Our grocer did not have flank steak so I got inside round marinating steak. The flank would probably have been better, but this was good. Other than reducing the recipe by half (for two people) and stir frying on high (in vegetable oil and a little sesame oil), I followed the recipe as written. My husband and I both loved the flavor. I marinated for a couple of hours, and served as shown in the photo...with fresh green beans and basmati rice. We both would have it again."
