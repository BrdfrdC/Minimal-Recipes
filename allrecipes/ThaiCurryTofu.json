"reviewBody": "A very nice basic curry recipe. I make curry quite frequently, so I jazzed it up with extra spices to the mix...cumin, fresh minced ginger, cayenne pepper, cardamom and gram masala. I also added some frozen petite peas for some texture and a tad of sweetness. It is very important to get as much water out of your tofu as possible or else it turns to mush. I squeeze mine in a colander while it is whole and then after slicing, press with paper towels. I’m not a big fan of frying tofu since I think it absorbs too much oil, so next time I will try baking it. A good solid recipe that can offer a starting point for experimentation."

I added the spices to the onion and garlic for a few minutes before adding the liquid. Also did about 50/50 coconut milk and veg broth. Last, I also added some fresh pineapple chunks with the liquids. My wife and kids thought the dish was divine, as did I! Smoky, silky, deliciousness!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe was a good base, but too bland for my liking as is. I did use light coconut milk and it was a 13.5 oz. can. I fried my tofu in peanut oil (be sure to press out the water first!) and, instead of seasoned salt, splashed several shakes of fish sauce and then a few shakes of each of the following: onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, celery seeds, coriander, fresh ground black pepper and cayenne. Start light on the fish sauce and add to taste - I added a few more shakes later on to the sauce as it was simmering, but fish sauce is quite salty so go easy at first. After I added the coconut milk to the garlic and onion, I added two chopped, dried Thai chilies along with the cilantro and tofu. The chilies add a lot of spice and give a good amount of kick, but are probably too spicy for those who aren't into spicy food. Then I added 1 green and 1 red bell pepper and a mix of mushrooms. I tossed in a couple handfuls of roasted, unsalted cashews a minute or two before serving. Served over rice noodles and my husband and I loved it!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe is fantastic! I have made it several times, and had trouble getting a flavorful meal for a while. The key I have found is to use a GOOD CURRY. I buy mine bulk from the local natural foods store, but when I was using a generic brand curry I simply could not get a full flavorful dish. With the good curry I finally found, I use about 2 tbsp of it and I add a little spice to the dish as well, usually sriracha. I also add in frozen veggies like broccoli and peas when I add the coconut milk and spices, and that typically allows time for them to thaw and cook while it is simmering. I always use extra firm tofu and 'press' my tofu before cubing and cooking. This involves placing on a cuting board or other surface and stacking books or other heavy items on top. I additionally always cook my tofu on medium-high heat for a while to get nice crispy edges. All in all, this recipe will turn out great if you use a good curry spice!"

I have made this a couple times and I think that as the tofu slowly absorbs the curry, the flavors become much more complex and delicious.\n\nMy tweaks: I used EVOO instead of the canola oil and the butter/margarine. I added a bag of prewashed broccoli and cauliflower, a teaspoon of garlic chili sauce and a teaspoon of red chili flakes. Since there wasn't enough curry to cover the added veggies, I used 2 cans of light coconut milk and 4 teaspoons of curry powder. I also sprinkled a bit of curry powder on the tofu before frying it. Yum!"

I fried the tofu, poured off any excess vegetable oil and then added 4 chopped cloves of garlic, half an onion, mushrooms, broccoli, red pepper flakes and 2 tablespoons chopped ginger. After sauteing that until it was about half cooked I added 2 tablespoons of lemon pepper and the curry as well as salt and and 1 tsp of basil. I mixed that all together until the spices were fragrant (1-2 minutes) and then added the coconut milk and cooked for a few more minutes until the broccoli was tender. The cilantro I added just before removing the dish from the heat. The lemon pepper I think did the trick, as it was excellent."

That being said, like several reviewers noted, I found this recipe to be a bit bland. This might be good for an entry level into thai food and for those who can't handle spice, but if you are used to thai, it's going to underwhelm with the flavoring. \r\nI highly recommend doing as others suggested and adding vegetables of your choosing, I personally added diced red peppers, green peas, and dried red pepper."

"reviewBody": "Great flavour! My family loved this dish (my picky 2 yr old included!). Simple &amp; quick to make - I was able to use what I already had in the house. Changes I made were adding a large handful of chopped baby spinach just before adding the coconut milk, reducing sodium content by using 1/4 tsp sea salt instead of 1/2 tsp regular table salt, and substituted 1 Tbsp dried parsley flakes for the fresh cilantro because I didn't have it. Next time I'd like to try this with the fresh cilantro and reduce the high fat &amp; calorie content by using 1-1/2 tsp Extra Virgin Olive oil instead of butter and Light Coconut Milk.\nI served this over a Kashmiri rice inspired side dish made of what I had in the house (leftover trail mix of nuts, dried fruit and coconut shavings; 1 vegetable bouillon cube; 1 Tbsp dried chives; and 1 tsp olive oil - all added to boiling water when adding the brown rice). Make sure to use a low sodium bouillon cube and unsalted trail mix, or omit the salt from the Thai Curry Tofu recipe. I didn't do either and the combination of the 2 dishes was too salty."

Well, this is it! I made slight modifications: I added a green pepper (cubed), used about 10 green onions rather than one small regular onion, omitted the cilantro, used about 3 tsp red curry paste rather than powder, and added about 1 1/2 tbsp of soy sauce. (Also used reduced fat coconut milk, and then added a little corn starch/water to thicken it up a bit.) Served over jasmine rice, and I believe I may never have tofu any other way again!"

"reviewBody": "I was reading a lot of the comments about this recipe, and after making it myself I came to the conclusion that the coconut milk overpowers the rest of the spices, hence why it comes out bland. I'll also note to future tofu cookers; Tofu is a very picky substance. It sticks very easily, but it also absorbs flavors easily as well. So when cooking it for the first time, use oil (Olive oil I find tastes best in the end) or cooking spray and cook on low heat and turn regularly. Also factor in the type of range you're cooking on and the type of cookware you have (cheap, copper bottom, aluminum). The better quality your cookware (or the better it sustains even heat) the lower your cooking temp should be."
