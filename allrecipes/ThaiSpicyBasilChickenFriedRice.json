I used boneless thighs instead of breast and I added one tablespoon of soy sauce to the oyster/fish sauce mixture. I also added the mixture to the oil first to get a good flavor. You need to make the rice first (correctly for Jasmine rice collecting the steam in a towel and rinsing and soaking it first) and let it cook to not have an oily sticky mixture. We will make this often!"

But if you want it like my local Thai place serves it you need to double the oyster and fish sauce, replace the white sugar with a tablespoon of brown, replace the serrano with Thai hot peppers - they look like baby cayenne pepper - and make sure to bloom the peppers in oil before adding the rice. The flavor will be an improvement on an already tasty dish."

I follow the extra advise given by Carey and added soy sauce to the oil/pepper/garlic after frying a bit and I cut the fish/oyster sauce in 1/2. I also added mushrooms and green onion to mine. The only issue I had was with my rice. Jasmine rice takes longer to cook than regular white rice, so we had to wait an additional 30 mins before adding it to the chicken and veggies. My teenage kids LOVED it. I think I will try more Asian recipes from this site. Thanks Carey for the advise!"

"reviewBody": "We really loved this recipe! I had to make a lot of changes due to necessity/allergies but that just underscores how great a recipe this is - it is so fantastic because it holds up under heavy manipulation! I do not eat any fish/seafood (not a vegetarian, just don't like fish) so I was concerned that the fish &amp; oyster sauces would be instantly detectable and ruin the dish for me. As the \"Most Helpful Positive Review\" suggested, I halved the volume of both sauces and I added 2 Tbsp. of soy sauce (I used Rongway's Soy Sauce Substitute found on this site). No fish taste at all, but great flavor. I also used 1/3 cup of peanut oil instead of 1/2 based on other commenters' advice. I used long grain white rice and made a special trip to my local local Asian market but they did not sell Thai basil. They also did not have Thai bird's eye peppers (what kind of Asian market is this???) so I planned to use Sriracha but forgot. I almost didn't make the recipe because so many reviewers were adamant about using Thai basil, but I decided that since I love Italian basil I'd give it a go. I did some research on Thai basil and read that it has a black licorice taste to it, which is a big NOPE for me, so that further cemented my decision to use Italian. My rice was nice and cold, taken straight from the fridge and into the pot...I don't have a wok so I used a Teflon-coated 3-quart stock pot and it was fine. Like I said, many changes but still terrific!"

I substitute the white sugar for 2 tbsp brown, it gives it more of a Thai taste, and substitute the serrano peppers for 1-2 tbsp chili paste (Oelek) but you could use more or less depending on your taste for spice. I just use Minute Rice but make it the night before. It's VERY important that the rice is cold when it goes in. Thanks ErinInVegas, this is super good stuff."

Use enough oil to coat all the rice grains, which may be less than the recipe calls for if your add-ins are oily. Even if you mess it up, this is sure to be a hit in your home because you adjust to your local tastes and markets. Just watch the proportions and you're good."

I cook this in my giant, propane, outdoor wok that I bought from Bass Pro Outlets...cooking on it is quite a show for friends! I prep all the veggies in advance so when I'm ready, I just throw everything in (in specific order of course!) I've made the following changes to an already outstanding recipe: I add more sauce (9 tablespoons oyster sauce, 6 tablespoons fish sauce and 3 teaspoon white sugar). I add 2 chunks of finely chopped ginger with the garlic. I also add sliced carrots, mushrooms and diced scallions. I scramble 6 eggs in advance and add them at the end. I occasionally substitute scallops or tofu for chicken. WOW this is great!! Everyone I've made this for wants the recipe!! (I can't figure out how to give this 10 stars, so I'll have to give it only 5!)"

My only problem was that my grocery store didn't have serrano or thai chili peppers, so I bought dried arbol peppers from the mexi aisle. Used 10 that I had soaked in water and chopped up, but it wasn't spicy enough so I added a tsp of korean chili paste. Next time I will try soaking the peppers in the oil that I fry with so that I do not lose any of the heat of the pepper to the water. Also, to add some healthy stuff I added a bag of stir fry veggies from the produce aisle - Fantastic! Just a note, if you are like me and do not have a wok - do not try to increase amount of rice - my pan didn't really fry the rice like it should have so it was a little greasy feeling, I think that it would have been okay if I had a larger heat surface like the wok. That being said, I did reduce the amount of oil, 1/4 cup fine with the veggies since as they cook they add their own liquid."

Here are my recommended changes: 1) Use 4 to 8 Thai \"bird's eye\" chili peppers instead of serranos. 2) Add the bell pepper when the chicken and onion are nearly done cooking so it won't overcook. 3) You can change the flavor of this dish a lot depending on when you add the fish/oyster sauce. Add it before the chicken and it will lose most of its characteristic Thai flavor. Add it a couple minutes after the chicken and you will keep some of the fishy Thai flavor. Or, add it with the rice as instructed here and you retain a lot of the fishy flavor!"
