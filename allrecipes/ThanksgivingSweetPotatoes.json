Also, not knowing how much, if any, juice from the canned sweet potatoes should be used, I added the juice from just short of ONE can of the sweet potatoes (for fear the dish might dry out with little extra moisture). I needn't have worried, because it was a soppy, sodden mess and a total embarrassment."

In a large pot add 3 1/2 quarts water with one 1/4 of the brown sugar, stick of cinnamon and 1/2 stick of butter. Add the chunks of sweet potatoes and bring it to a boil until really soft. Drain the water and add the dry ingredients, then the liquids. I did melted the butter and whipped it with a handheld mixer, wow the rest is history!Note: I did not use the water that I boiled the sweet potatoes in nor did I use the syrup from the can. I did follow the rest of the cooking instructions.Bon appetite!"

Take out of oven and drain half the juice out. Sprinkle butterscotch chips and white chocolate chips throughout. Top with marshmallow over the whole thing.

I'd rather go with the sweet potato casserole II recipe on this site but that is personal preference."

Some where along the lines I lost the printed out recipe and i did not book mark it at the time. I spent forever looking for it. I am hosting a Christmas Eve dinner with my in-laws and thought for sure I would never find this in time. And \"wah lah\" here it is, I found it and book mark it this time, so I will never lose this!! Thanks so much for this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Thought this was way too sweet, and more like a dessert than a side dish with the crumb topping. It was very sweet and a little tangy, without any depth in flavor or spices. This would've passed more as a sweet potato pie or cobbler. It definitely needed more herbs or spices to make it a side dish. Candied yams have more depth of flavor, in my opinion, and the crumb topping just totally classified the dish as a dessert."

"reviewBody": "I like the baked sweet potatoes topped with marshmallows at this steak restaurant we go to, so I wanted to find something similar on a bigger scale for Thanksgiving. This recipe was what I was looking for. I used fresh potatoes--I've never cooked with sweet potatoes before so this was different. I used this new \"brownulated\" brown sugar instead of regular brown sugar--bad idea. I ended up not serving this with the meal because the potatoes were still not done. The next day I added more orange juice (maybe 1-1.5 Cups) and covered with foil and baked for another hour and a half--after all of THAT, the potatoes were done! The \"brownulated\" sugar was still grainy and the marshmallows melted in and disappeared but overall, it is a wonderful recipe that I hope to try again and hopefully it'll come out perfect."

They seemed to like it (I don't like sweet potatoes myself.) My husband said the sweet potatoes could have been a little more \"mushy\" but my father in law had two helpings. He liked the topping and couldn't quite put his finger on what was in there - that always makes a good recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Perfect sweet potatoes! Definitely do not drain the potatoes. I used an 8X8 pan, and I needed 3 15oz cans of sweet potatoes (and half again as much of the other ingredients, too.) Also be prepared when cutting in the butter that there is about as much butter as there is dry ingredients, and it turns into a very soft wet paste instead of a dry coarse texture like with pastry. It turns ot perfect, but it surprised me when I was making it and I was worried I had done something wrong. Nope - it turned out just great! I'll make it every year from now on!"

I did leave out the oj because I forgot it at the grocery store in my hurriedness... So i drained the sweet potatoes into a bowl and then measured out the same amount in the syrup from the canned sweet potatoes.. thank you so much for this recipe!!!! This is our new thanksgiving recipe"
