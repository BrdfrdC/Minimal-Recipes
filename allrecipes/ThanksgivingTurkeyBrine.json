I kept min covered until the last 15 min to brown it up. Even those who dont' care for turkey because they find it too dry - LOVED this! Juicy and so much flavor!"

The turkey was very moist not to mention gorgeous when it came out of the oven. I've added this to my Thanksgiving recipes folder as it will be used for each and every Thanksgiving from now on."

I simmered just enough water (4-6 cups) to dissolve the salt and to release the flavors of the spices, allowed to cool for about an hour then added ice to quick chill the brine, immersed the turkey into the brine adding more water and covered with more ice. Put it in the garage for 24 hours, keeping an eye on how quickly the ice was melting and adding more as needed. WOW.....the best."

In a quart of the water, I dissolved the salt and added the spices and brought it to a boil then simmered for 5 minutes to open up the flavors more. Then in a large brining container, poured the cooled spices over half of a 7.5 pound bag of ice (approximately a gallon of water). Adding the bird, I then mixed in more ice to keep it cool."

The turkey only sat in the brine in a freezer bag for 4 1/2 hours in the fridge, and when I put it in the oven for just a little less than 2 hours at 350 degrees, I didn't do a single thing to the meat. It turned out just great! I froze the bones from this and will do one more at least before Thanksgiving because I think this will give me the very best turkey stock for gravy on the Big T-Day! I highly suggest that people try this because it was extremely tasty. Thanks so very much, Henry! Excellent!"
