I was surprised that I did like it but I feel it would be great if it was made different. First the Ginger snaps I feel made no difference in taste. Brown sugar would have worked just as well. I also feel that it should have been layered in a casserole dish and then baked to give the marshmallows a nice brown on top. I liked the recipe as a base but needs improvement."

"reviewBody": "This year I decided to take a shortcut from my regular sweet potato casserole that I usually make, to try this quick and easy recipe - ugh! I wish I hadn't! It was sticky &amp; pasty, too sweet, and the color is orang-ish brown once the ginger snaps are crushed in; not appetizing to look at. However, the most telling of all was that NOBODY ate it. It was the only dish left on the table that was nearly untouched. Thanksgiving is tonight, I'm home now, and went first thing to the computer to write a review on this recipe. Lesson learned: 1. Don't take short cuts from a tried and true recipe. 2. Put in the labor for a made-from-scratch dish. \n3. Canned yams suck"

I love that I didn't need to put in oven since everything else needed to go in the oven. However, next time I think I will put in oven for just a bit to brown the marshmallows since I did miss that taste of the marshmallows on it. Highly recommend! Couldn't stop eating them! Impressed how much fattier they could be but with the small amount of butter it was just right and didn't feel overly bad eating them."

I made these for my in-laws for Thanksgiving this year and they were a hit! I drained one can of the sweet potatoes and used the juice from the other (otherwise it seemed too thick). VERY VERY GOOD!!!"

"reviewBody": "These are really really tasty, and so darn fast! I was pretty skeptical, but the gingersnaps add just the perfect flavor. I had baked sweet potatoes on hand (1 hr 40 min @ 350 degrees), so I substituted an equal measure for the canned; I too put the warm sweet potato mixture in a serving container and then browned the (small sized) marshmallows with a quick zap under the broiler. I noticed the first time I made these that they hold their shape upon serving, which gave me the idea to use this as a super-quick easy cheater version of sweet potato pie - just put the mixture into a graham cracker crust, top with marshmallows brown. Really yummy! If you won't be serving the whole pie the same day, I suggest washing it with egg white baking (to seal out the moisture from the filling). Definitely a must-try."

I thought they were a bit too sweet and would cut back on the cookies when making them again. I also put them into a baking dish and browned the marshmallows in the oven. These are very easy to make and a nice change from the traditional."

The gingersnap cookies are the secret weapon that makes this dish kick! So different from traditional yam recipes, yet so deliciously new! I highly suggest you make these for your next holiday gathering. I recipe note though....instead of putting marshmallows in pot I transfer mixture to a baking dish, then add marshmallows and bake at 375 until mallows are melted and golden brown. Enjoy!"
