The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 was because some baked goods aren’t complete without adding the beautiful combo of vanilla essence, fresh grated nutmeg and ground cinnamon powder - I think that’s what makes it the best, better than all the shop bought stuff. So, while I followed the how-to of the recipe I knew I had to add the extra flavour, which the recipe did not consider."

"reviewBody": "After reading a few of the reviews, I knew I had to try it. So, I bought some bananas and made sure they were extra ripe. I also made sure to follow the exact recipe and instructions. I made sure to do EVERYTHING the recipe said because if you’re telling me that this is the “Best Banana Bread,” I’ll ever have the pleasure of eating. It better be all that and then some, LOL. BTW, the recipe was super easy to follow, and it’s probably one of the easiest recipes I've tried in a long time. So thumbs up for that! Now, onto the real tea. Let’s get into this recipe. I gotta say…..I wouldn't say it's “The Best,” but it's definitely not the worst. I may even try it again…I'm still on the fence. BUT if I do I’ll need to add a little more flavor. Some cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla extract. You get the idea. Overall I’ll give this recipe a 4 out of 5 stars."

I added the 1/2 cup chocolate chips as the video suggested, but I also added 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 cup chopped pecans. The outcome was a tender cake with a crunchy top. I really like to eat it warm, slathered in butter."

My mashed bananas equalled 1 cup so I mashed up 1/2 cup of canned peaches (2 snack cups). I was also a tad short of margarine and made up the difference (about 1/8 cup) of apple sauce. I threw in 1/2 teaspoon of baking spice and another 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon plus 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I baked the bread on the lowest rack for one hour. Well, I thought this bread was going to be a disaster. It turned out perfectly. It is moist and dense. The banana and peaches really compliment each other. Great recipe. I can't believe how so many substitutions can result in such a wonderful bread."

I sought out a new banana bread recipe because I was tired of my old oily recipe. I followed this recipe with minor changes purely for personal preference. I subbed the margarine out for a half cup of unsweetened apple sauce. I used half white &amp; half brown sugar just because I was running low on white sugar. I added one tablespoon of Rum just out of curiosity because someone else tried it. I honestly didn't taste the rum in the final product. I also omitted the nuts. Overall it's a very nice fragrant, moist, dense, small crumb, banana bread and the recipe is quite forgiving. My husband thoroughly enjoyed it."
