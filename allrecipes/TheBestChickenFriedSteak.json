"reviewBody": "I made this recipe but with a few tweaks. First, I double dipped the steaks in the batter. Also, i don't recall if you mentioned it, but when you are placing the steaks in the flour mixture, you have to press hard so that the flour really sticks. After the steaks were breaded, I put them in the freezer for about 30 minutes. This helped the breading to really stick and they came out beautifully. When they were done frying, I transferred them to an air frier set on the lowest temp (180¬∞) and not only did they stay warm, the air frier added a crisp to the breading that was just marvelous. Loved the recipe."

"reviewBody": "This wasn't bad. My son had been asking for a CFS dish. I found this and decided to try it. I had to use thin cut chicken breasts as I could find no cube steaks at the store. I used the flour/batter measurements (which were too much for 4-6 thin breasts) and fried in veg oil as it was what I had. I added a dash of taco sauce instead of tabasco. I re-seasoned the drippings and made a gravy.\nThe taste of the chicken was good. The batter did stay on and was crispy rather than the sort of sogginess you can get with breadcrumbs. The gravy was bland though. It needed something so after thinking a minute we added a dash of nutmeg to it and that worked well enough.\nIf I make it again, I will have to tweak it further, but it is not a bad starting point."

"reviewBody": "I make this often. It's as good as any chicken fried steak I've ever had in a Texas restaurant or diner. Outstanding! For my stove and cast iron skillet, 2.5 minutes per side with only one flip works perfectly. (Hard to imagine 5 minutes per side without burning, but I guess everyone's stove is different.) My only criticism of the recipe is that when making the gravy, \"remaining flour\" is a little vague because it varies a bit. (Sometimes I make 4 steaks at a time, sometimes 6, sometimes they dredge easily, sometimes not, etc.) I've found that measuring 1/4 C of flour with the 1/4 C of remaining shortening works great. Great recipe. It has permanently replaced the three other chicken fried steak recipes I tried before discovering this one."

I made exactly as written and it went very well until I tasted the gravy, just before serving. It just tasted like flour. I added about 10 cranks of salt and 20 cranks of black pepper, a dash of cayenne, a teaspoon of paprika and a teaspoon of parsley. These minor additions made all the difference. I didn‚Äôt have any shortening so fried in canola oil and it came out nice and crispy."

First off, the covering on the meat was so thick that the meat did not cook within 5 minutes and some of the batter was still wet. The next thing I noticed was that I need to use 3 cups of oil for my gravy!! Yeah, not gonna happen. I am not going to ingest 3 cups of oil, or even 3/4 cup of oil into my body. That is extremely unhealthy and I don't intend to die young thank you! My gravy made for 4 persons has less than 1/2 cup of oil and includes more actual drippings that just straight up lard."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was a big waste of time. The steak itself turned out very bland, which surprised me. The gravy was the worst part though. For the gravy, the roux to liquid ratio looked off to me when I read the recipe, but against my instincts, I made it as written. It just would not thicken to be a truly creamy gravy. I had to add a slurry of flour and milk to get it to thicken, which of course diluted the taste. Although a relatively inexpensive meal to make, it requires a lot of dishes, time and cleanup. That‚Äôs a real bummer when the food doesn‚Äôt even taste great. I mean we ate it and won‚Äôt go to bed hungry tonight. That‚Äôs the best thing I can say about this recipe."

The coating was fantastic, and I will be using this same recipe with fish, pork...anything. It was really the best I have found, and I am nearly 60 years old."
