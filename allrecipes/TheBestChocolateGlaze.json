One thing I have learned, though, is that the water you add by teaspoonful must be VERY hot. I put the water in the microwave and heat it before adding it to the chocolate. And you should stir the mixture like mad until it appears kind of shiny. My cakes with this glaze are always a big hit."

I used a microwave ( a large measuring cup, doubled as a mixing bowl) rather than a double boiler on stove; I couldnâ€™t tell that it made any difference, in taste. I also used dutched cocoa, yum! The only dirty dishes were the large measuring cup and a whisk. You can make it as thick or thin as you wish by varying the hot water. The directions to add judiciously 1 tsp. at a time are exactly right. \n\nThis oneâ€™s going into my permanent file."

I do add 1/8 tsp of kosher salt and itâ€™s amazing how that little bit of salt elevates the chocolate flavor! Also I am a stickler for following directions so in this recipe donâ€™t skip cooking the butter and cocoa for the full five minutes. This helps when you are adding that cup of powdered sugar. I also find I need a bit more hot water. Donâ€™t be afraid to keep adding until itâ€™s the consistency you want. I use this glaze on the Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe on this site. Delicious!!!"

"reviewBody": "I looked at many chocolate glaze recipes. I chose this one because I had all of the ingredients on hand. It is simple to make, tastes wonderful, to me, using the exact ingredients called for in the recipe. I made a 1/2 recipe of an old family-favorite scratch chocolate cake (a recipe my mom got from a friend back in the mid-1960â€™s), in a 9X9 pan. The glaze was exactly enough to generously cover the top of the cake. I tasted the glaze before putting it on my cake, and I just loved the flavor. Great recipe. Thank you!"
