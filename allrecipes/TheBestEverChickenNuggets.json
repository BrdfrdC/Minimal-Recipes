Plus, these came out unexpectedly greasy, and sticky with flour that never crusted up. BAKED tenders are the best way I've ever found. Into the oven to cook, no standing around frying in heavy oil. I much prefer to use panko crumbs to coat the pieces after I dip them in an egg wash that uses mayo and flour mixed together rather than as a separate step in the breading mixture. There are much better ways to make tenders that actually hold the crispy, crunchy texture without using oil. I won't ever make these again."

"reviewBody": "I've made these 3 times now, the first time exactly as it is written here. My family loved them and they were devoured almost as soon as they were done. But I am keeping a close eye on our fat intake so the second time I baked them. Good, but there was quite a bit of flour remaining on each strip. It didn't affect the taste but since everyone eats with their eyes first, I knew I had to find a healthier, more eye-appealing way to serve these up. So, most recently I dredged each tender in the flour first, then moistened in the egg, and dredged with the flour again, and the excess shaken off. I cooked them in our air fryer and they were perfection. Homemade honey mustard on the side with a mixed green salad and it was one of our favorite, easy-to-do lunches."

Will have to experiment myself. I cut the pepper down to 1tbsp. Tried boneless skinless chicken thighs the second time but breast is more successful. Thighs have a lot of fat and it’s almost impossible to cut it all off. I used canola oil. The first time a lot of extra flour mixture ended up in the oil so it browned by the time I got the last batch in. Need to be careful to shake excess off as recipe states. Going from egg to flour to oil worked fine for me."

Well worth the prep time and fun to have my kids help with. The coating worked great and turned out nice and golden and crispy. The inside was delicious and juicy. DEFINITELY the BEST EVER!"

"reviewBody": "Was looking for a chicken nugget recipe. As always, read the reviews before making. Just two of us, so cut up 2 very large chicken breasts and cut the flour mixture in half. Used 3 TBS of garlic powder, black pepper, several grinds of sea salt, and probably 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. Did the flour - egg- flour dip per other reviews and let it sit for 20 minutes. Deep fryer at 375 for 5-6 minutes and it was outstanding!! \n\nWife found them pretty zippy from the cayenne, and I could taste the garlic powder.\n\nNo doubt will make again. Loved the breading.... nice and crispy."

I cooked the chicken in 2 tablespoons of oil (per 1 lb. of chicken)...which was just enough to cut down on the fat but keep the chicken from drying out. This is my go to recipe now for chicken nuggets. It's so easy and I always have the ingredients on hand."
