"reviewBody": "So for anyone that is accustomed to store-bought jar salsa only, it’s good for you to know that the salsa will not taste like that. This is a fresh authentic type salsa similar to what you would eat in Mexico… Which is much different than what you will taste out of the jar from the store. This may taste a little underwhelming to some for that reason. That said, this was delicious and will become my go to salsa recipe. I love Mexican food! The green pepper was a surprise and I suspect really adds to the flavour. I chopped it super small as not everyone in my house is keen on green pepper, and I think this allowed for it to subtly shine. Only subs I made was some cayenne instead of jalepeno for a bit of heat as I didn’t have any jalepenos on hand. I put only a pinch. Thanks for the recipe!"

Heat can be adjusted for those who prefer a milder taste, and salt could be added for some. Very fresh tasting, and even with all the chopping, easy. Maybe next time I will do as others did and use food processer."

I like that you can control the heat by how much jalapeño you use. Also by how many seeds you add, or you can decide not to add seeds at all, since they hold most of the heat. My friends love it and request it when they know the tomatoes are coming in. I serve it with the \"dippers\" style tortilla chips so you get all the good stuff."

"reviewBody": "I rated this 5 stars but it was absolutely the wrong recipe for salsa. I tried to make it better by adding garlic and some chili powder but I think I may of just ruined it. The recipe I liked started with only using three tomatoes not 3 cups of tomatoes chopped. I either rated the wrong recipe or the lady switched her ingredients around. This salsa was not good and there was too much of something and not enough of something else. It was missing something big time."

"reviewBody": "Most definitely will make again. Made as directed. Very yummy! Nice spiciness...and we like spicy. Of course, it's going to depend upon the jalapeno. Used fresh picked tomatoes, peeled (cut x in bottom, 30 sec in boiling water then immediately dunk in ice water) and squeezed out seeds. Think next time will be a little more aggressive in squeezing out seeds/liquid. Froze some to see how it does with that."

My friends and boyfriend loved it. So healthy."
