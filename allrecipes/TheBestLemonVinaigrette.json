"reviewBody": "The vinaigrette came out pretty good. I added a little extra lemon juice, oregano, salt and pepper to the recipe though. I felt it just needed slightly more seasoning. I also was forced to use a strange Dijon from Trader Joe's that was very grainy like an unfiltered mustard or something. It came out pretty good, but I think it would be better with a normal Dijon. I'm also wondering why the recipe doesn't call for \"WHITE Wine Vinegar\" vs. \"RED Wine Vinegar\", seems kinda weird, but again it was pretty good. I think I will try WHITE wine vinegar next time instead though."

Also I did not have Dijon mustard on hand so I used about a teaspoon of yellow mustard along with a heaping tablespoon of low fat mayonnaise. I also added 1 tsp. of sugar recommended by another reviewer. (Thumbs up!) The next time that I make I will use the exact ingredients in the recipe. I am giving this 5 stars, because it would not be fair not to since I deviated from the original recipe."

On my second try, I cut the vinegar in 1/2, used basil instead of oregano and used lemon pepper. I increased the oil to 3/4 cup and after combining added lemon juice to taste. Very satisfied with the result."

I didn't even need to put it in a jar and shake it - I gave it a good whisking and it emulsified perfectly. I also love that there is no added sugar. This dressing works best on baby spinach or field greens - I wouldn't use it for an iceberg or romaine. Just my opinion!"

I mythis exactly as written and yes it is tart but it's a lemon vinaigrette, add a tad more mustard if you prefer a less tart dressing. Served it with a mixed salad green salad with quinoa, strawberries, walnuts and feta. The sweetness from the strawberries paired well with the tartness of the lemon. Delicious!"

Wow, this is going to become our staple base dressing for everything. I think it would be great in a pasta salad, drizzled over red potatoes, pizza, salmon, or any fish. It can be modified to add anything from capers to lemon zest. The possibilities are endless. Go on...make it!"

This dressing is wonderful, and I'll definitely put it in my rotation, the smell alone is heavenly!"
