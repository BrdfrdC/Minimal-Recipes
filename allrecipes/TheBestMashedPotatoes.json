Next time, I'll add the cream cheese just to see what kinda flavor it gives."

Not sure why I thought they were not as good as the other reviewers, but my family thought they tasted like \"good instant potatoes\" and that wasn't a real compliment. The potatoes were pasty and the parm cheese was overpowering, way too much. Won't make these again."

The aroma is heavenly and i did cut down on the amount of parmesan and cream cheese and then added some milk for creaminess. Skipped the chives and salt and peppered well. Used a hand mixer and combined well ( a little chunky) and transferred to a greased foil pan to be reheated next day for Thanksgiving dinner. Garnished with some finely chopped parsley. Excellent!"

I would not make this particular recipe again."

I heated the combined mixture in a saucepan, based on recommendations. While the result was tasty, it was also very rich and so it cannot be eaten in large heapings. Also, I took the butter and garlic, used it to sautee onions, and mixed the drippings into the potatoes, and then served the onions on the side. Overall, it came out pretty well."

My modifications came about once I first tasted them even after already cutting the parmesan cheese and cream cheese in half. I would definitely recommend cutting back on both of those cheeses, adding sour cream and whole milk. Otherwise, these potatoes have too strong of a cheese flavor and are way too thick if milk is not used. I also added extra butter."
