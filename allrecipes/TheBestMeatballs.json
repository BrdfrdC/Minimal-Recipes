I also air fry them on high for 12 minutes. Makes a nice crust on the outside and pink in the middle. I finish cooking the inside in the sauce. I double it up and give a few batches to family. Big day for them! They love it!!! There's enough leftover for meatball samiches a few days later too. Another big day for us haha. My tip - you need to be heavy handed with the seasoning. There's a lot of meat in that bowl so hit it generously! Under seasoned = bland."

"reviewBody": "Rating this recipe was hard. If I was to go by the actual recipe, I would give it a 1 at best. Frying the meatballs was a huge mistake. The cheese melts and makes a big gooey mess in the pan. If you make your meatballs too big, they are not going to get all way way done. With all the moisture in them, they are going to have a nasty tendency to fall apart. And worst of all is they come out looking and tasting very greasy. Luckily I did half the batch in the oven at 400 and those turned out way better. The ones in the oven warrant a 4 or 5. They were really good. So I split the difference and gave the recipe a 3. So do yourself a huge favor and dont try to fry them. You will regret it."

"reviewBody": "I like the oven rack idea, here! The art + science of meatballs. Too dry and they are hard. Too wet/mushy and they break up. But two things are for sure: stale bread is for purists, yes. But the step-up in flavor from Progresso Italian breadcrumbs is unmistakeable. Wouldn't do without...and all 3 meats for best taste. Secondly: not cheap, dear reader, but: Locatelli Romano cheese, fresh grated. THIS, is the jewelry! Along with fresh garlic and parsley, your meatballs will completely level up with these two additions. Italian GOLD!!"

Use Foil lined sheets for golf sized meatballs . 20 mins at 350. Easier to pull meatballs off sheet if you place cookie sheets cooled down into freezer for 10 mins . Pop them off and place extra meatballs in freezer bag with sauce. Quick dinner in the future with pasta or sandwich."

It is ridiculous to add a \"salt and pepper to taste\" measurement in a raw food item... can't taste until you cook it creating waste. for those curious I did a teaspoon Kosher salt and 1/2 a teaspoon fine ground black pepper. What's with the water at all? I've never used it in any of my meat balls... I'm lost there. And don't deep fry ground meats they with fall apart. I used a 1/2 table spoon of olive oil in a 12 inch cast iron skillet and they turned out beautifully. Also optional I added a small spring of fresh thyme and a teaspoon of crushed red pepper. While a prefer to back them, pan frying worked pretty well as long as your not submerging the poor meat in oil. I cooked to 140 then added to a marinara sauce and was perfection. the first batch I cooked to 155 (health code standard in co for ground meats but over done in my opinion) and they fell apart and melted"

"reviewBody": "I have been making this recipe for over 52 years and everyone, everyone says I make the best meatballs in the world.I cook them in the oven on baking sheets with olive oil, because I usually make more than 100 at a time for family gatherings. The only difference is I soak stale bread in milk and add it to the mixture instead of using bread crumbs as the bread crumbs made the meat a too dense. One trick I use is to take a thumb nail sized piece of mixture and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds to taste for enough Romano and or salt. Great recipe!"

When I made them, they were very wet but I kept going. Well, of course, when I browned them, most fell apart. I put them all in sauce &amp; the meal was saved. It wasn't meatballs any longer when done, just a meat sauce which, BTW, was very good but there were no more meatballs. Don't do it. I learned my lesson."

Not crazy about the salt and pepper to taste in any recipe, since you can’t taste until you cook one, but that minor. I used all the water and fried them. Although I do sometimes bake my meatballs My mom always fried them and they were always a hit. I fried them this time to get a nice “crust” and they are finishing in the sauce. They are moist and tasty. Will make again."

I subbed fresh parsley for dried and used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I wanted spicy meatballs so I added red pepper flakes to the mixture. I put canola oil a 12in frying pan on the highest heat and coated my meatballs in flour. I browned them all the way around. They turned out moist, crispy, and perfect. I let them rest and added them to my sauce an hour before serving."

I do agree that if you have an amazing Italian bread, it would make for a nice crumb addition. I do add Luke warm water or even some milk. Obviously you can play around with the amount of garlic, salt n pepper to your taste, but I’m adamant on the fresh parsley. I’d even say you can adds little more than that. Add raisins or even pieces of fresh good quality mozzarella to the inside for a nice surprise. These are basically how my mom and most Italian people make them. It’s a great recipe."

I find that this really makes a meatball, I have had others and they are good, but cooking the way Grandma did all day in the sauce no question! also I use a 90% lean ground beef so you dont have much in the way of grease. final notes if you dont have bread crumbs and dont want to wait pull apart the ends on Italian sandwich bread and let sit while you get everything ready, works good too. I dont use water, add either sauce or milk. I use sauce and it brings out the flavor even more!!"
