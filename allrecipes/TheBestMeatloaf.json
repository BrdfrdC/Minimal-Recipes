"reviewBody": "I make some similar changes. I’ve used this as my base meatloaf for years now. I have had to soak a piece of toasted bread in the milk once because I didn’t have stuffing mix or bread crumbs. I prefer a ketchup and balsamic vinegarette mixture as my “sauce” a little on top and in the meat mixture. I do add onions (never bell pepper), dry sage &amp; parsley, garlic powder (or minced garlic), onion powder, a dash of Worcestershire, a 1/3 cube of beef bullion or a tap of beef bullion powder and salt &amp; pepper. The balsamic/ketchup mixture is always a hit for us. I have never been asked for a recipe more. Also, I periodically drain the hot fat out of my pan while cooking. It tends to cook faster and not be as moist."

I was out of milk but had sour cream so I subbed that for the milk &amp; un-toasted sourdough bread for the soft breadcrumbs. Finally I didn't have steak sauce but did have a can of HUNTS seasoned sauce for meatloaf in it's place. everything else was followed and This is the best meatloaf I have ever had!

I have tried brushing the top of the meatloaf with a little bit extra steak sauce, but just very lightly brushed. It really is a great recipe and super delicious. It's super easy to make. The prep time doesn't take long either."

A favorite Go-To. \nSorry to cherry pick your recipe but I did make a few alterations. \nFirst my kids don't care for crunchy vegs so i sauteed them on low heat w butter and olive oil(salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, garlic and onion powders) to soften them before adding to the mix.\nSecond, I leave out all other seasoning and add one pack of McCormick Meatloaf Seasoning.\nThird and finally, I make this in the morning and put it, covered, in the fridge. I take it out 1 hour before placing in the oven. Putting it in the fridge seem to allow all the flavors to mead.\nThe added A-1 steak sauce on top is a crowd pleaser and a must! Don't overcook! Thank you"

I ended up having to put some onion soup seasoning in ketchup to dip it in while I ate it. If I made it again. I would add a packet of onion soup, and about a 1/4 cup of ketchup to the mixture before cooking. I think it would be perfect then."

I will keep making this recipe with whatever variations of ingredients I feel like adding. Experiment with it and make it your own.\n\nWe really enjoy this recipe. (Even with alterations.)"

If I don't have a bell pepper in the house, I substitute sweet peppers as I always have them. It turns out moist and delicious every time. The cook time is perfect for those of us at sea level. Leftovers are always just as yummy. My husband threw out his old recipe since he can't beat this one for taste and texture. It's a keeper."
