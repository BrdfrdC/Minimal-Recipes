My croutons turned out a little too crunchy for my liking so I would consider adding a little of the chicken pan drippings on top to moisten them up. I would also serve with some noodles due to the husband's insistence that \"it is just the way chicken parmesan is done\". My bad. It took a good hour to cook through which was a great set-it and forget-it meal. Thanks, Chef John!"

I'm used to recipes that call for chicken breasts - but I think I've been using halves all along since that's how they are sold. The croutons came out a little soggy since they were touching the sauce, so watch out for that, but otherwise the flavor and texture was excellent."

I used homemade marinara. Otherwise, I followed the directions and baked until done. I really like the flavor and ease of cooking. Served with a simple salad, it was an excellent meal. My croutons didn't retain a lot of crunch, so I might just leave them off next time and serve with a nice crusty bread."

I’m not saying it’s my Food Wish, but I made a tempeh-turnip-tater version (using what’s at hand, you know how it is.) This recipe is perfectly suited for tempeh, I think, and it’s great with rutabagas and potatoes as well. 45 mins in the oven. Thanks Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "Where has this recipe been all my life? Even my critical husband raved about this dish. I had 1 cup of Wegman's Smooth Marinara left over and 1 T. garlic infused olive oil to use so made this. To save money and insure even cooking, I cut large boneless breasts horizontally and pound each half in a Ziploc so used 2 pounded halves for one half recipe. IMPORTANT: I reduced the baking time to 25 min. -- perfect. I plated it with a cauliflower, broccoli, cherry tomato side. Practically no carbs and didn't miss them. I crumbled garlic herb bruschetta crackers over the sauce instead of croutons, some from a holiday gift basket. I didn't season the chicken since all the rest of the ingredients packed flavor. Fresh basil from my plants. Best Chicken Parm ever. This goes into my Judie's Best notebook. Thanks Chef John."

"reviewBody": "Because I recently had to go gluten free, the fact that there was no breading appealed to me. Needless to say I also did not use the croutons. For me this recipe worked. I used skinless, boneless chicken legs because that's what I had and lightly browned them. Topped with Prego Chunky Garden style sauce, sprinkled with Italian seasoning, garlic and onion powder and topped with lots of Mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. I chose to top with aluminum foil that was pierced and will not do that again. It became too watery from the steam even though I had lots of large holes. Instead I will cook uncovered and top with cheese later in the cooking cycle. All in all this was a quick dinner that fit my new dietary needs and is easily adaptable to ingredients on hand."

I think the key is to use the brand of spaghetti sauce that your family loves. I cut the chicken breasts into strips so it would cook faster and I didn't bother layering precisely...just chicken, whole jar of spag sauce, moz cheese, bread crumbs (didn't have croutons), parm cheese. Bake. I also baked it at a higher temp so the cheese browned. Awesome! My kids asked me to put it into the regular rotation...lucky me!"

This step will reduce your baking time, mine cooked in 35 mins. Also, a small baking dish makes more sense, since 2 cups of sauce is really not enough to make a \"casserole\" style dish in a 13\" x 9\"."

Definitely will make again, just with a few personal changes."

I seared the thighs before putting in the casserole, but won't bother with that step next time as it wasn't necessary. It took about an hour to bake. I did as other suggested &amp; covered the dish half-way through baking to avoid burning the croutons."

It's only the two of us, so most of the recipes I make end up with leftovers, which we love and depend on for other meals during the week. This recipe however was terrible as a leftover...the croutons were very soggy and had soaked up the sauce so the rest of the dish was very dry. Because of this I won't make this again as half the dish is eaten as a leftover &amp; we didn't enjoy it at all. My hubby couldn't even eat his as a leftover, it was that bad."

A few changes I made:\n- Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces before covering with sauce and cheese and baking\n- Sprinkled Italian seasoning over cheese for extra flavor\n- Used panko breadcrumbs instead of croutons and sprayed them with olive oil\n- Added ingredients in this order: olive oil, red pepper flakes, garlic, chicken, sauce, mozzarella cheese. Covered tightly with foil and baked for 30 minutes. Uncovered, added Parmesan and panko, sprayed with olive oil, and baked on a higher rack for an additional 15 minutes to brown.\nI used too much sauce and it turned watery, but still worth making. Will use less sauce next time."

"reviewBody": "Very good. Excellent idea to use croutons. I'm reviewing mostly to capture my personal notes, for myself. Made my own sauce, added the garlic, basil, and pepper flakes to the sauce, then coated the baking dish with a thin layer of sauce before adding the chicken. I had four BSCB, an average eight ounces each. The chicken needs to be seasoned! Even with the sauce, cheese, and croutons, the chicken itself was bland. I used Rothbury Seasoned Croutons, which I keep on hand and use not only for salads, but as crackers in different kinds of soups. (I like them because the cubes are small, but I did crush them a bit before adding to the casserole.) I didn't have/use Parmesan. I baked four BSCB in a 9X13 baking dish with the cheese and croutons. Then, put a bit of sauce on cooked rigatoni, put the rigatoni in two 9X9 baking dishes. When the chicken was done, I put half on top of the rigatoni in each of the smaller baking dishes. I read one review that cut the chicken into cubes before baking and will try that next time. Overall, the dish was good. The biggest drawback to me was the bland chicken, which is an easy fix. I will make this again."

The croutons at the top reinforce that and add a breading-like component without the breading and frying. Also bakes quickly! I have used dried basil in a pinch and it works, just takes away that freshness. Really a terrific recipe for weeknights!"

"reviewBody": "I liked this recipe. My only adjustment would be to rectify salt and freshly ground pepper. Try to find the best mozzarella you can also not just the Parmesan to make for a very good bake. The cheese is what makes this recipe. Also, adjust the baking time because the chicken breast without a pre-searing will not cook as fast. This recipe in my opinion can also substitute the marinara for any other store bought tomato sauces available to vary the flavor. Will make it again. You may also be able to prepare ahead and just bake the next day."

These two issues were the result of following the directions to the letter. I'm going to make my adjustments and present the recipe under a new title...maybe even #2 or #3, it's just that I have so many changes I might as well rather than incur the wrath of those who say \"why make the changes if you're not going to call it your own, and my gosh....we've all heard the complaints!"
