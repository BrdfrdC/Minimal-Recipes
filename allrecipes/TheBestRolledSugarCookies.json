They hold their shape tremendously as well, which is helpful."

"reviewBody": "These cookies are perfect if you're going to ice them! If you ask me these should be called shortbread cookies in order to better explain what the texture will be like for others who may be expecting chewy snickerdoodles. I replaced half the butter with margarine, which has a higher melting point than butter, and my cookies retained their shape beautifully with absolutely no spreading. I used minimal mixing of the dough in order to prevent them becoming tough, and added my flour a little at a time. This way I was able to avoid the dough becoming too dry. If the edges of this dough crack and split too much while rolling out, warm it in your hands just a little before rolling out the next batch, it CAN be too chilled! These cook very quickly! You really have to watch them, especially if your chosen cutout shapes have small or thin pieces. I pull them out of the oven at the first tiniest hint of browning and they are perfect with just a little bit of soft bite. I do recommend the extra vanilla for flavor, especially if you are replacing any butter with margarine. If you're not gonna frost these, sprinkle with coarse sugar before baking to make them prettier and sweeter."

People on here are saying it tastes bad or is not sweet enough but personally for me it is, and I also tend to add cinnamon sugar on top to make it have a bit more flavour. I don't add any icing."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is fabulous! I‚Äôve been making sugar cookies for 20 years and this one is a favorite for cut out cookies. It is NOT very sweet. If you follow the recipe you will get a cookie that holds its shape for decorating and has a delicious flavor. It is very important to chill the dough or you will get a cookie that spreads and puffs out. Also, do NOT melt the butter. I softened each stick of butter for 10 seconds but checked it 5 seconds into microwaving them. I chose not to add any extra sugar to this recipe because I plan on decorating them with icing. If you are getting a dry biscuit tasting sugar cookie, you did something wrong. If the cookie was any sweeter, it would be too overpowering to ice. I have recipes that are sweeter and more buttery and I don‚Äôt ice those. I eat these with or without icing."

I probably would have been happier without the changes, but I‚Äôll just go back to my sour cream sugar cookie recipe."

You should look at the yield on this serving. I had to halve, or even third the recipe. I don't know anyone who would have enough ovens in their home to bake 60 cookies. It is just overboard! The taste was good though, so I gave it a 3*. If you will halve it, the amounts are: flour- 2 1/2 cup, butter- 3/4 cup, sugar- 1 cup, 2 eggs, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, 1 tsp baking powder. Overall a good recipe though."

Rolled out nicely and dough kept the shape of the cutouts no problem. I did use powdered sugar instead of flour when dusting the counter and rolling pin though. Helps to keep the taste nice and bright instead of bogging it down with extra flour. A new favourite!"

For those saying the dough is sticky - Make sure there is flour ON TOP and underneath of the dough your rolling, the first roll for me was sticky but then I put flour on top of the dough and it worked beautifully! They cut well, however they did spread slightly though it did not matter since I was making basic shapes. (triangle, circle, and square) However, that may have been because I forgot the baking powder AND salt because I was too focused on the flour. üòÑ Overall, wonderful and delicious cookie!"

"reviewBody": "I've made these sugar cookies at least a dozen times. It is a versatile dough for rolling out and making festive shapes. I have used different extracts besides vanilla including lemon, almond and maple is great for Thanksgiving leaf cookie cutters. Adding citrus zest also enhances the flavor of these cookies. I have used royal icing on baked cold cookies to decorate or a baste of egg white and sugar crystals before baking. One thing I have learned that is crucial in baking anything is measuring accurately. In order to be positive you're being accurate I have found a scale to be invaluable. This recipe assumes you are cutting out 2 inch shapes therefore the time in the oven is accurate. If you are using four inch cookie cutters extend that time to 12 to 13 minutes."

"reviewBody": "So perfect making a second batch today. These cookies turned out beautifully and tasted delicious, if your cookies did not turn out great using this recipe it is most likely due to you measuring something wrong like baking soda instead of BAKING POWDER because these taste great and baked perfect. I refrigerate my dough for a few hours before I roll it out and then refrigerate it again after they are cut out, I also put my cooking sheet and silicone mat into the freezer between batches, and only roll out 1/4 of the dough at a time. If yours are too hard you may have baked them to long. Every oven is different and have hot spots, if you have convection setting on yours drop the temp by 25 degrees and use that. Ours were soft and chewy but still held a beautiful shape and didn't fall apart when you picked them up to eat them, and if you are having a problem with your dough being crumbly when you go to roll it out work it with your hands until its not crumbly, cut them out and stick them back in the fridge and go directly from the fridge to the oven."

They kept their shape (such as a horse or duck shape), and they taste good. I would probably add more sugar or vanilla as they lack some flavour, but they‚Äôd be perfect with icing. I‚Äôd recommend halving and giving it a try before using five cups of flour when it might not work for you. And try them with milk!"

These were too airy and not at all sweat. Sugar cookies are suppose to be dense, a little chewy and keep the shape of the cut out especially when wanting to use them for a party. I wouldn't have even given this a star. The only thing that I could think of that caused these cookies to not come out would be the amount of eggs she had us put in. I've never put four eggs in a cookie recipe. I would not recommend at all."

I felt like it was too salty and didn't have much taste in it. When I was putting the salt in I felt like it would be too salty because it was way too much. I did use Himalayan salt though, so that could be the reason why. When I took the dough out of the refrigerator it was rock hard and I couldn't get it to roll out. At the end I got my sister(who is much stronger then me) to help me. I smeared it in chocolate icing and added some sprinkles and it did taste much better. But the cookie itself just tasted fine."

I frost them with a not too sweet butter cream frosting and a little dusting sugar in different colors. They are always a big hit.

Easy to roll. Easy to cut. We baked for 8 min and that was the perfect amount of time. We added some pink sprinkles and had no issues. TASTE AWESOME!Literally these remind me of the store bought lofthouse sugar cookies everyone loves lol. Seriously just try them and follow instructions ‚ô° We made buttercream frosting for the top, added a little sprinkles and confetti chips. Just try them they're great!

The flavor I could care less because I do live in a household where people don't really like overly sweet things, so this was fine for them. I did try to save the dough just because I only wanted to use my epic cookie cutters but alas, not matter what I did the dough just couldn't be saved. Cookies ended up fine and the family enjoyed it.
