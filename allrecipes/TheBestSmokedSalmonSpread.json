"reviewBody": "I was looking for an easy appetizer for Christmas Eve “feast of the 7 fishes” and decided upon smoked salmon spread with crackers and crudités. It was my first time making smoked salmon spread, and I picked this one just because it looked good and doesn’t contain horseradish (as a lot of other recipes do). I don’t care for horseradish. I did use less capers. I also followed the advice of another reviewer, who suggested blending in half the salmon, and folding in the remaining chopped salmon at the end. Otherwise, I followed the recipe fairly closely. I let it sit for a few hours in the fridge before serving. It was a HUGE hit with my family! I will definitely make this one again...great way to stretch pricey smoked salmon. Also, one of the crudités that I served was Belgian endive, using the leaves as little “scoops” for the spread. I highly recommend this...the flavors went together spectacularly. Thanks, Jay, for sharing this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This was was pretty good. Minor changes made: I added some of Chef John's homemade creme fraiche and a little less heavy whipping cream. This didn't make much of an impact on taste, however. Also, since I was really hoping for the color in the cover picture, I mixed about 1/4 of the smoked salmon in the food processer with the other ingredients, then chopped the rest and stirred it in. It didn't add the pretty salmon color I was looking for, but it still tasted good. Would probably make again. I feel like there's a showstopper addition out there that would up my stars to 5, but I'm not sure what it is."

I double the Worcester sauce and hot sauce, use dried dill (rather than buy fresh just for this) and have subbed yoghurt or sour cream for the cream. I put half or more of the salmon in the food processor then rough chop the remainder to mix in by hand at the end. For us, it just isn’t as tasty without the green onion. Also, if possible I make it the day before serving for better flavor and consistency."

The recipe definitely needs to sit for at least 5 hours prior to serving (to merry the flavors) or it'll taste more like cream cheese."

I also thought it needed a bit more lemon, Worcestershire, and hot sauce for flavor. Definitely make a day ahead. It was geat the next day. Also great with bagels/toast !"

And, I had some leftover baked salmon I used instead of smoked salmon. I really like it, so I'll definitely keep this recipe for future events. I do feel like it's missing something in the flavor, so I'll probably use smoked salmon or add some liquid smoke the next time I make it."

People that don't usually like smoked salmon even ate it.\n\nDo not look any further for a smoked salmon spread !!"
