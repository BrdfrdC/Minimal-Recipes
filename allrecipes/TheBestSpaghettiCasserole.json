I also instead of pasta sauce. I am using tomato sauce. AGAIN tasting good so far. Can't wait to put it in the oven after it is put together and for the finished product. Also for the cheese i am using a colby jack mix and that works good as well."

I’m not sure what additional baking would do to the noodles since they are made of konjac flour. But, as one reviewer said of using spaghetti, she just tossed it all back into the pot and finished there. Anyone willing to try? Also, Miracle Noodles would make this a keto dish. Interesting!"

I added 1 full onion and I could barely taste anything, so for those that like onion, I would probably suggest 2 or even 3 onions. I also added lots of onion powder, Garlic powder, Italian seasoning, Oregano, and a good bit of salt and pepper and a lot more cheese. \n\nWithout this, I agree with others that its going to turn out pretty bland. With the additions, I liked the recipe a lot. Way better than regular spaghetti. Next time, I will also substitute at least half of the hamburger, or even all of it, for some Italian sausage."

The only thing I will omit next time is the sour cream, it gave it more of a taco taste rather than spaghetti. It makes a lot!! So if you’re feeding less than 4 people, I would half the meat and sauce."

I used full fat sour cream and organic marinara sauce.\nI decided to bake it for the first 20 minutes covered in tin foil so the noodles don’t get so dry. I folded the tin foil into a tent shape so the cheese does not stick to it. I finished by baking for another 10 minutes uncovered (or until the cheese begins to brown.)"

I minced up about 5 pieces of garlic and added no Parmesan cheese because I have cooking way to much oven fried chicken which has Parmesan in it. Instead I used mozzarella and mild cheddar already shredded cause I’m lazy during the week. I did however simmer my sauce for about an hour before mixing everything and I layered it like you would with lasagna. Fantastic is all I will say!"

I almost gave it 4 stars only because I did find it better to add one 8 oz. can of tomato sauce - otherwise, was a tad dry out of the oven. But, giving it a 5-star because to me the sour cream addition really gives it a great taste! Would make this again!"

I also added 4 oz of cream cheese, 1/2 cup shredded parmesan, and 1/4 cup of cubed butter to the hot pasta before combining it with the meat mixture which was 50/50 ground beef and ground Italian sausage."

"reviewBody": "This was so good. I made it as directed except I dropped the only package of spaghetti I had on the floor and had to use Penne Rigate. When I told my family about the spaghetti fiasco they both told me not to use spaghetti that they liked it exactly the way it was prepared. I think this recipe would be good with any pasta. Also, I made 2 small casseroles instead of one large and placed one in the freezer for another day. Oh, I also had to bake it longer than 30 minutes. After 30 minutes I took the foil off and it was not bubbly so I put it back in the oven without the foil for another 20 minutes. Thank you for a great recipe."

I’ll also add more onion (1/4 cup/2 lbs. meat - why bother!). I like the idea of a spaghetti casserole for a pot luck (people recognize wht it is and most like spaghetti) and the servings are ample although a bit hard to dish out. I did make a mistake and got Cheddar instead of mozzarella. Instead of using the Cheddar I tried using the mozzarella snack sticks which, even though I “shredded” them did not work out at all."

It's not 55 minutes. as you look down further in the directions towards the middle or bottom it says 30 minutes! O also put my own twist on it! rather than putting and making a spaghetti mixture. I put the sauce, meat, sour cream etc. into its own mixture. And then I did a sauce layer, noodles, cheese and layered it like lasagna. It turned out great!"

I used 1 lb chopped meat and one pound Italian sausage, sautéed them with onion and 2 cloves garlic and added them to my own sauce (2 lg cans crushed tomatoes, oregano, parsley, basil, salt, pepper and a small bit of sugar) and let it simmer for a couple of hours. Otherwise followed recipe exactly and everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe. I'm only giving 4 stars since I made some alterations to make it more flavorful - but with changes, definite five. Thanks!"

Great dish for week night cooking for the whole family to enjoy."

And I seasoned the turkey with salt, pepper, crushed red pepper and garlic powder. Also, I used minced onions by McCormick. I drained the spaghetti and then put it back in its pot where I combined everything. This makes A LOT and it would have been too much to combine everything in the skillet I browned the meat in. I totally overlooked the bit about covering with foil to bake. But I'm glad I did because it allowed the top to crisp up a little, which we all really liked. This is going in the meal rotation!"

Heed those who point out the HUGE amount the recipe creates; I used what I would normally use to make spaghetti at home, and it would have filled a 9x13 and a 9x9. My son and my BF and his dad LOVED this. They ate huge amounts. So I will make it again, but for a 9x13, I'd make half the box of farfalle to mix with 1 lb ground beef (or Italian sausage), one jar Newman's Sock-A-Rooni, 8 oz sour cream, and about a cup of parmesan, 1-2 C mozzarella. I added herbs, but I'd add wine and cayenne and/or red pepper flakes next time."

My changes were minimal and based on what I had on hand, I topped it with fresh mozzarella (yumm) and halved the sour cream in which I had the full fat on hand. I also layered it instead of mixing it all together (sauce, noodles, cheese, repeat, end with sauce, topped with mozz). In the end it was too much to fit into my 9x13 so I mixed what was left and also made an 8x8. Both were very good."

Some reviewers said it was too bland, so I added some garlic powder and oregano to the beef and onions while browning (but I do that for most italian dishes anyway). Other than that, I made the recipe as written. I split it into two 9x13 casserole dishes (gave one to a family friend) and just one of them was more than enough for my family of 4 with plenty of leftovers. My toddlers both loved it! I think this would be a great option for a big potluck or church function. You could probably fit it all into a big disposable foil lasagna pan (the 9x13 ones are deeper than your average 9x13 pyrex). We will definitely be making this recipe again."
