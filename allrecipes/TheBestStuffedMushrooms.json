I chopped the stems and added them to the sausage while I was cooking it, and I covered the inside and outsides of the mushrooms in garlic butter and baked them for 10 minutes before stuffing. I added a mixture of Parmesan and oat flour the last 5 minutes of baking. Yummy!!! One day I'll make them as written, because those look delicious, too! :)"

This recipe only produces enough filling to stuff 1/2 pound of mushrooms, unless you're just using a little tiny dab in each of them.\n\nOther than that, these are AMAZING! The only thing I changed was: I sprinkled more parmesan over the top when they were almost done cooking. They were a big hit and I'll be making them a go-to when I want to \"wow\" people!"

I took these to a covered dish dinner and the double batch I made was the first to go. I have so many requests for the recipe. I did make one mistake. Somehow I read one 8oz cream cheese instead of a half bar. It just made it creamier and gave me enough filling for 18-20 well filled mushrooms. I also stuffed portabella mushroom caps and it made a great side dish for a dinner. Love this recipe."

Now I'm wondering if I should have used some breadcrumbs in the filling to give it some more body?\n\nEager to hear from others especially if this happened to them."
