I also double the entire recipe when making it as part of a family BBQ or other gathering. I also lowered the jalapeño amount by half this time. As with any recipe those who thought it was too spicy should just reduce the hot ingredients. Thanks Jim"

No-salt beans, regular canned green chilis, Quorn crumbles, and fresh or frozen everything else for a sodium total of 985 mg for a 1/2 recipe, probably serves 6 (?).

"reviewBody": "Great recipe and, though I see at least one person found this too spicy (I can't help think that the person who wrote that used another kind of pepper. See my note at the bottom). I found the heat just right. Overall, the recipe has loads of flavor, texture and looks pretty too! I did use a bit less salt than called for (using 2 teaspoons rather than 1T). I like salty food, and this reduction did not leave me wanting to add more. I also used sweet peppers of different colors (red and yellow) which added more color. The prep time @ 15 minutes is, I believe, a bit optimistic for the first time you make this - there is a lot to chop. But, it's well worth it. *Warning, if you substitute serrano peppers for jalapenos, know they pack MUCH more heat! Use 1/9th the quantity of serrano than jalapeno, and wear gloves! I caught the proportion issue in the nick of time. But, unfortunately, didn't think to use gloves and my hands still sting the next morning!"

I used 2 cans of kidney beans, 1 can of black beans and I omitted the corn just because my idea of chili doesn’t have corn. As it came together I was excited. The chili was fragrant and my boyfriend said it was perfect!"

I followed the recipe making these changes: I doubled the garlic and cumin, used 2 tsp (not TBLSP) oregano, 2 big rounded Tblsp chili powder, only 1 12 oz pkg of veggie burgers, 1 14.5 oz can fire roasted diced tomatoes (I don't like chili too tomato-y), and ONE seeded jalepeno. This made a normal-sized amount and was still very hot. If you want it less hot, use 1/2 jalepeno without seeds. I also needed to add about 1/2 cup water as it was so thick. I put a blop of sour cream on top with chopped fresh cilantro. It was delicious! A little grated cheese, avocado, and a few crushed tortilla chips on top would be nice too. This is a wonderful recipe to tweek to your or your family's tastes."

I have no trouble with it once I add cornbread, sour cream, and cheese, but my three year old absolutely could not manage it. This last round I cut all spicy items except the chili seasoning and the green chilies. Gave him a glass of milk to cover what was left of that bite. \n\nThis past batch also I threw on the smoker for a lovely addition, which begs me to note that paprika could make a nice addition - haven't tried it.

I followed the recipe pretty closely - I only had one jalapeño so it wasn't too spicy like it was for others, and I skipped the vegan ground beef because there was plenty of protein from all the beans.\n\nI think the issues for us were the full TABLESPOON of salt, which I was very wary of but decided to trust the recipe and added it anyway. The other issue was the THREE 28oz cans of tomatoes. I've never seen that much canned tomato in a chili recipe before but again, decided to trust it and added them all anyway. The resulting flavor (for us) was just way too tangy/sweet tomato-y flavor from too much tomatoes, plus much too much saltiness from the whole TABLESPOON of salt. The beans I used were unsalted too, and I'm glad I didn't add any frozen veggie grounds because the net saltiness would have made it completely inedible. \n\nI'm trying to figure out how to fix this so it's not a misery to eat for the rest of the week, as I'm not going to throw it out. I think I will basically just greatly increase the servings by adding a lot of water and much more beans with their bean juice to keep it thick enough.\n\nIt was a super pretty bowl of chili, but I this is not a good chili recipe, much less the \"Best\" in the world. Sorry."

My instinct told me to do that, but I followed the recipe to the t and those leaves do *not* soften, even when crumbled and simmered for hours.\n\nAs with all chili, this definitely benefitted from simmering for longer, which helped flavor, consistency and texture for me. (Ended up simmering on low heat for about 2 hours.)\n\nMy last note is on spice level - I see a few reviews that claim this is mind blowingly spicy, but mine turned out really tame (great for kids who aren't ready to have their tastebuds blown to bits yet, but a tad underwhelming for me). Spice level is definitely going to depend on your jalapeños, and next time, I'll be adding more."
