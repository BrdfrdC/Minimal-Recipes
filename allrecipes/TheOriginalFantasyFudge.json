"reviewBody": "I have been making this recipe for years, but I always use a candy thermometer. Bring to a boil from medium heat to reduce chances of burning the sugar. Bring sugar to the point just before soft ball stage (237-239 degrees F). I use actual chocolate instead of chips, just a preference. To prevent the fats from separating I let the chocolate/ marshmallow mixture cool to 120 degrees F before stirring in the vanilla and nuts. Otherwise my chocolate wants to seize up and all the fat from the milk and butter separates out and it looks like chocolate with butter poured on top. This can be fixed by putting in the stand mixer with the paddle attachment and beating until the fats incorporate again."

I followed the instructions exactly, I melted the butter, sugar and evaporated milk together and then brought it to a rolling boil for five minutes stirring constantly then took it off the heat to add the chocolate etc. and it seized up! If only I had read other recipes before I started I would’ve known not to cook it at a rolling boil for five minutes but rather until it reached 234 degrees or approximately 4 minutes, although I believe temperature is key! Oh, and the actual original Kraft recipe said you can use margarine or butter."

"reviewBody": "This is a very good, easy recipe. You must follow the cooking instructions closely though. You can make it with less sugar and butter via the stovetop recipe. You can’t if you microwave it, though- at least not cutting back on the butter. I only use 1/2 cup of butter on the stove and about 2 cups of sugar. I tried this in the microwave and I got a dry, crumbly mess. I quickly added in the other 1/4 cup of butter, melted it and stirred like a maniac, and it came out… passable. I made a peanut butter version prior to this, by using 1 cup of crunchy peanut butter and not altering the butter, and it it was just fine. But then- I just made 2 batches of the normal chocolate chip kind, following the instructions exactly, and it was a dry crumbly mess, which turned into dry topped, crackled baked brownie looking stuff, with butter pooling on top when I put it into the pans. No more microwave cooking. I’m going back to the original stove top method that I e used for 38 yrs, since I was in middle school. And- making it in a 13x 9 pan makes thin, less appetizing fudge anyway. The thick fudge shown in the picture was either a double recipe, or made in an 8-9” square pan."

I can foresee creating more flavors by changing the nuts, extract, addition of fruits, liqueurs, etc. I will be making this again and testing new flavors. Such a quick and easy recipe to give as a gift. Who doesn't love fudge?"

It’s funny so many people saying to boil to 234F as 5 minutes won’t work as mine reached 234 in a little UNDER 5 minutes of boiling. So I’d say some may be making too much of just going by temperature, seems either will work."

It takes less time to get to the boiling point this way, but constant stirring is a must at all times."

The microwave recipe did not mention the power of the microwave used ( 1000 watt, 1500 watt?). It also didn't say it it should be stirred at intervals during the 5 1/2 minute cooking time. It seems these are the only 2 areas that could have gone gwrong. Silly me for following this recipe! Next time I'll pick a recipe that's complete with all pertinent information on a different site."
