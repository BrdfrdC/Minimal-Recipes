So I cold smoked this recipes for 30 minutes (15 per side as I keep the meat real close to the ice tray) and then did a reverse sear to bring the meat up to 115-120 deg on a 225 temp grill then seared them a minute on each side in the cast iron skillet. While this may not be a basic cook, it is a great recipe that is super yummy when done!"

Use only the egg yolk, and it will hold together with add ins (diced jalapenos and shredded cheese for me). Some people are puritans about making a burger with only beef, but these always come out tender and tasty, while the pure beef ones shrink like crazy and are often plain and dont hold together if you like to add things. I also add a bit of worchestershire to the mix."

I did not find the burger bland but as others have mentioned you can build your flavor with condiments etc. I plated the burgers and set out a mini burger bar of condiments and add ons such as lettuce, pickle tomato, onion and spicy ketchup. Everyone gets to build their own burger. Even though I’ve been cooking burgers for years my husband was wowed by this burger. I will use this recipe going forward for burger nights. I did cook it stove top due to inclement weather."

The only change I made was to add 2 tsp of A1 steak sauce for a little extra flavor after mixing all the ingredients to grass-fed angus beef. Those who complained that the burgers tasted bland might have bought cheap meat or didn't cook them correctly. Making thin patties and then melting cheese on top with sauteed mushrooms is my favorite way to have burgers at home."

Don't squish them between your hands. You want to preserve the spaces between the bits of ground meat because that is where the juice ends up. If you mix the meat into a smooth homogeneous mass, the juice will run out into the fire."

"reviewBody": "Great basic burger. I've done two tricks in addition to this recipe. I've added 1/4 cup of water to plain ground beef which helps with the dryness and omits the bread crumb/egg and have also asked the meat guy at the market to grind chuck for me. GOOD quality beef is what makes this recipe a winner along with NOT overmixing/\noverhandling. I've also asked the meat guy to grind flap meat ONCE, added 2 Tablespoons of melted butter and formed patties that way. All good. Thanks for the recipe. Not all of us like \"gourmet\" for a quick meal."

I add a little worcestershire sauce and garlic powder and it gives it a little more flavor, but not enough to confuse or overstimulate your mouth like other burger recipes. This recipe works best with real beef, not Walmart , and is perfect for those that appreciate the natural flavor of good meat in a burger. If you're looking for a quick, easy and tasty burger recipe, this is a great pick- I make it once a week and know it by heart now :) thanks for sharing!"

When making this stir in the bread crumbs last, I made the mistake of mixing them in prior to mixing the meat, and it was too thick (but I also live in a dry climate, so if that happens to you, add a little water after mixing in the meat, like a teaspoon, and that should fix everything)! \n\nGreat recipe! :D"

It's the way I make burgers. \n\nThe burger is meant to be a blank slate and all the rest of the weird, trendy stuff people eat now is reserved for topping it. I have a refrigerator full of condiments and cheeses family and friends can choose from for burger toppings (you'd be surprised at the wide, eclectic selection and varying heat levels), but none of these will ever be mixed in with the burger meat itself. Obviously this must work because I haven't gotten any complaints yet, and I've been making burgers this way since high school."

We like our burgers with lettuce, tomato, ketchup and mustard and those toppings just don't work when you are making gourmet patties. We LOVED this. It will be my go to burger. The burgers stuck together REALLY nicely, easy to make. Hands down, this recipe is exactly as claimed in the title."
