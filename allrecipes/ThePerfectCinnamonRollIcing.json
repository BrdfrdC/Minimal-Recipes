"reviewBody": "I made this almost exactly as it was written. I waited until the end to see if I needed to add the milk and I did not.(I also didn't sift.) I used a small hand held mixer to blend it together. If I had tried to do it by hand (as I usually do with frosting), I may have needed the milk, but this way I didn't need it, so I didn't add it. My family loves this icing. It tastes so much like the cream cheese icing that comes with the packaged rolls. (In fact, I blended that in, too.) Definitely will be our \"go to\" because the kids always want more icing than comes with the rolls."

I hate buttercream so it's always good to find other icings that work, and I don't really care for too much sweet stuff but I can eat this icing by the spoonful."

"reviewBody": "I used heavy cream instead of milk. Added a bit more vanilla extract. I had accidentally bought crescent rolls and family requested cinnamon rolls. I baked the rolls, but instead of twisting them into crescents, I left them flat so we could use the cream cheese icing. The rolls were a HUGE hit with the family! Every single roll was eaten! We had plenty of icing left over. I’m figuring out now how to use it and not waste that deliciousness! Very easy to make. I would have added more powdered sugar if I felt the icing was too thin, but it wasn’t. It came out perfectly. Easy to spread on the roll. Will melt some on hot rolls, but so will commercial icing. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks you for providing this easy and delicious recipe."
