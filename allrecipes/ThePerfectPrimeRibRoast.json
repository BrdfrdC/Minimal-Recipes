Was slightly overcooked despite using meat thermometer that did not require opening the door and shortening last cook time from 30 minutes to 20 minutes. Had 4.1 pound roast. Will not cook this way again."

I found the cooking times per pound for this slow roasting method on the Internet. it was delicious and I’ll never cook my prime rib any other way! I highly recommended it."

With that being said, my adult daughter said it melted in her mouth and was the best she ever had! Not sure how I will approach it the next time. I cooked. 6lb Prime rib roast from Costco."

"reviewBody": "I liked this recipe up until it got the second cooking. After the three hours, it was tender and juicy. It had created its own sauce. Albeit, the roast was still very soft and not completely cooked, it looked appetizing. After the second time, the roast crisped up on the outside but almost all the juice evaporated. The flavor is very good, though. Thank you for the recipe."
