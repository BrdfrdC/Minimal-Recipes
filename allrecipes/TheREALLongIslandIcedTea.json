I don't consume sugar or carbs so I modified it to my diet so instead of simple syrup I used a squirt of lemon stevia drops and lime juice and Zevia cola. Only other modification was to double the serving. 2 of these and you're in good shape."

That is the recipe, and I feel there may have been a few times I took it intravenously as well. \n\nSuch a simple concoction if mixed in the right proportions tastes like the nectar of the Gods, but one spirit out of proportion can have disasterous results. \n\nGet the alcohol proportions right in the first two, and all is good. after that, you won't care. \n\nIf the first tastes off balance, I usually have them add a shot of Roses Lime Juice as the most effective first aid(don't waste it), and watch the second being poured and accurately measured. \n\nA word of caution: DO NOT TREAT THESE AS SHOTS. Bad things will happen."

Still, you can't wrong w/this mix as stated and for the bartender that gives it 3 stars? Just remember, most bar prepared long island teas taste awful in comparison to this recipe. (Cheap sweet &amp; sour mix? ) Not for certain why the bars usually aren't as good as I use well brands to make and so much better."

Everyone talked about this slamming drink and wondered what were the ingredients. Yes this is the REAL thing! My grandmother wouldn't tell me the recipe except in excerpts; I finally got the recipe out of her over the years!\nI say enjoy but be careful because the smoothness can cause you to forget there is alcohol until you go to move of your seat. LOL!"

And I know it's not \"authentic,\" but the first time I made this, we actually didn't have cola on hand, so I subbed with ginger ale, and it was pretty dang good that way too!"
