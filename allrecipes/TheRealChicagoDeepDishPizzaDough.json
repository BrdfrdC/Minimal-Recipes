"reviewBody": "This is REALLY A GREAT RECIPE! It does come out very good; and yes, it's quite close to the \"authentic experts\". It's also well written, so the tips in here can help to modify and adjust towards your own goal! Make sure you add the softened butter by crumbling it in by hand. I ONLY gave it four stars because it doesn't EXACTLY avoid the very last bit of \"an edge of hard, or mealy texture\" to it --- which is the defining fluffy goal! But this has come the CLOSEST of any of the dozens of other recipes I've tried! I've made this three times; and I'll make it again, and post a photo! Great job! (I make a Vegan deep dish more than once a month; and it's nutritious.) Keep it up!"

The second time I tried it was in a bowl by hand with a spatula (I don't have a dough hook) and it was far more workable (and easier - don't bother with the breadmaker) and produced a crust that was almost biscuity but crisped up nicely due to the copious amount of oil. I made no modifications to the recipe either time. The flavor was decent, nice and yeasty but I am not a fan of biscuity pizza crust. I really wish the recipe came with cooking instructions also."

I made it the first time in a large cast iron skillet. The second time I used a large pizza pan from when I worked at a pizza place in the 90's. I did pre bake the crust 10 minutes both times. The first pizza I made it the night before and let it rise in the fridge for 18 hours, the second pizza I let rise on the counter for about 8 hours. I followed the recipe as to the layers of the toppings. Cheese first then pepperoni then the sauce and I used muir glen fire roasted crushed tomatoes and only added kosher salt to them, I did not cook it or anything (I was able to stretch one can on to the two pizzas) I Sprinkled a little bit of oregano on that then a little bit of parmesan cheese then baked 25 minutes. The cheese, first pizza I used slices of provolone and mozzarella and then the second pizza I used provolone slices and shredded mozzarella (I ran out of mozzarella slices. This recipe is gonna be my go to deep dish pizza, it was so good."

I didn’t follow the pizza filling recipe, but instead customized my own fillings with pizza sauce, spinach, mushrooms, ground sausage, fresh basil, oregano and mozzarella cheese all filled to the capacity of the crust (no top crust). I baked it in my well seasoned cast iron skillet on 450 for 15 minutes, which was plenty of time for a perfect deep dish pizza. My family loved this pizza and so did I. I will be making it again!"

I made a tomato sauce using Cento brand, canned tomatoes, olive oil, chopped garlic, finely diced onions, italian seasoning, crushed red pepper, tomato paste, a touch of sugar. 16 mozzarella cheese slices were layered on the dough as the 1st layer. I did pre bake the dough for 10 minutes as was suggested. Total baking time with toppings, 35 minutes."

Made this twice so far. \nUsed olive oil for the dough, made in food processor. \nUsed the boiling pan of water in the oven for a quick rise 1-2 hours. Par baked 10 min 450 convection with oil on bottom of deep dish pan. Took crust out and brushed top with more olive oil. Put sauce (San Marizano 28 oz whole tomatoes, 1 tsp dried basil, 1 tsp dried oregano, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, pinch sugar; simmer for 20 min+) mozzerella cheese, parm cheese, oregano, olive oil on top. Baked 425 convection 20 min. Made carmelized onions and sauted mushrooms for each person to add to their slice after it is done."

"reviewBody": "This is a truly delicious crust, authentic Chicago style or not (I don't know, as I've never been to Chicago). My experience with the recipe was a little odd, though. I'll explain (just so you know, I double-and-a-halfed the recipe, to get two large and one medium sized pizza, I used bread flour rather than regular, and I used vegetable oil rather than corn oil.): like another person mentioned, my dough came out really, really wet and sticky-- nearly pourable, in fact. Unsure what to do, I mixed in about another cup of flour (which still left a very wet dough) and then covered and let it rise. When ready to use the dough, I liberally floured the work surface to keep it from sticking, rolled it out, and then cooked it on a pizza stone, as I don't have a deep dish pan. Somehow it all worked out beautifully and the crust was scrumptious, even cold the next morning. I just wish I knew what I did wrong to make such a sloppy dough. Anyway, taste-wise this is a five star recipe and I'll certainly be using it again, just with more flour than called for."

I made a large 14 inch in a pizza pan and small 8 inch in my spring form pan. I might try it a little thicker next time, using all the dough in the 14 inch pan. I thought the dough needed more salt, I will increase it a bit for sure next time. Otherwise, it was pretty good. I pre-baked the crusts for 10 minutes in a 450 degree oven, added toppings, then baked again for about 15 minutes, took out of the pans and put on hot pizza stone for 1 minute, 30 seconds."

I made the dough as directed, with my addition of garlic and herbs, and let it rise for about 3 hrs. I did not do a deep dish one, but divided the dough into quarters. (i like a thin crust). i bagged and froze 3 portions. i rolled out the fourth quarter tonight and had a wonderful fresh pizza enough for 2 people. i will be using this pizza dough often."

I think it needs a little. Ore sugar for. Eat time but now I'm knit picking!! I let mine sit overnight and I think my issue was I didn't butter the bowl, I olive oiled the bowl instead. The bread didn't rise a crazy amount. Twice as much max. I made hammered down the dough and let sit for 15 minutes. After that I used 1/2 the dough in a cast iron. I pre-heated the oven to 425 and cooked it for 12 mins. I believe at 425 I would precook for 10 min. Afterwords I used the homemade sauce, pepperoni, onions, bell peppers and jalapeños mozz cheese. Then I took the other 1/2 of dough and capped it for a \"pie!!\" I then cooked it on 375 for about 23 mins and removed it to put sauce and cheese on top. Cooked for another 5-7 until cheese was melted! Turned out great! Cast iron skillet was the key ! Worked a lot better than a traditional deep dish pan.!!"

I've been eating the real stuff my whole life. There are slight characteristics to it, where that could possibly reign through, but not 100%. I used canola oil for the dough itself &amp; used olive oil to brush on it for extra browning. My timing was off in prepping but I saw a reviewer had let hers rest for 4 hrs, that was definitely ample time to let it rest. I cut it up into 6 pieces, kneaded them for like 15 seconds on a floured surface, formed little balls &amp; let them rest on a lightly floured sheet pan for 15 minutes. I then stuffed them in a big muffin pan and let them par bake for 15 m @350, with weights (aluminum covered limes &amp; garlic work). Took em out, let them cool a bit, filled with toppings, oiled &amp; baked for another 15. The dough was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. So good!! I can't wait to make more!!"

I followed the directions to a T, and used a cast iron pan following another reviewers time tip. 35 minutes did the trick. The pizza ( I should have prebaked the crust 10 minutes) it came out great … the crust was perfect on the bottom and the middle could have used the extra minutes in the prebake …but it was GOOD! I did not have corn oil, so used canola, and used instant yeast but still let it sit in warm water and sugar (mostly because one 8 year old boy thought it was interesting) The only thing I took note of … the pizza looked great with my sauce, cheese and pepperoni on it, but the crust seemed to lack a flavor profile somehow … not sure what, but it needed something. I will try again and keep thinking what I might be missing! Give this one a go, it is fool proof!"

I did use olive oil, added 2tsp of both garlic powder and italion seasoning to the crust mixture. put it in my 12'' LODGE (USA)cast iron skillet , pre baked 15 then added toppings for 400 and 25 minutes perfect crispy and chewy!! my wife said the best ever ever ever!! absolutely will be making it over and over."

But after six hours the dough was tremendously over-risen making it very difficult to handle - full of bubbles, and the dough kept slipping down the sides as I pressed it into the pan. The end result was more doughy than I'd prefer but tasted good enough. In the Eighties I worked in a pizza joint for a couple of years run by two guys from Chicago. They knew their deep dish pie and taught me what real pizza crust is like. Sorry, but this ain't it."

I always put the dough in the oven with a pot of boiling water for an hour (as suggested by another review), and it rises beautifully. Bake it for 10 minutes on 425. Layer cheese, then toppings (I do a thick layer of pepperoni), and then sauce. Cook for another 20 minutes and YUM! Enjoy! Almost as good as Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, and Gino's...almost!

When I went to mix all together, it was just a soupy mess. It never formed a ball. I eventually became frustrated and just added a bunch more flour until it became something that resembled a ball. The water was 114 degrees, yeast sat in it with sugar for 9 minutes......I'm lost. Using a different flour and oil type shouldn't result in a bowl of soup instead of a ball should it? It's proofing now so who know's how it will turn out. I looked at Emiral Lagasse's recipe and it was very similar but had it's differences. So why did mine resemble and alien blob instead of a dough ball?"

I let the dough sit for about 4 1/2 hours before punching it down and it turned out just fine. Since I doubled it, I was able to make two full size pizzas (1 circular and 1 square cookie sheet). I buttered the pans and sprinkled cornmeal on them before I pressed the dough in and pre-baked it for 10 minutes without toppings, then 20 more with toppings. So good and filling :) This will be my new go-to pizza crust."

"reviewBody": "I tried this it was my first time making any pizza dough. I have eaten chicago style pizza in chicago so I know what it was supposed to taste like. I followed the directions everything went fine until I tried to put it in the pan to make the pizza, the dough would not stay up the sides of my pan, I had a 8x2 inch cakepan. The dough kept sliding down the the pan sides so I could not get it to the top of the pan sides. So I cooked it for a very longtime it seems, I may not have put enough cheese on the bottom before making the pizza. The crust didn't seem to rise at all in the oven it didn't get puffed sides it sort of just sank and turned dense. I was worried it would not get browned on the bottom after about an hour in the oven I removed it and let it cool a while and cut into it, not very oozy due to not enough cheese, the grease from the italian sausage and pepperoni seemed to soak into the bottom crust too and the crust was golden brown and crispy but too hard almost to hard to cut thru and to eat. The rest of the pizza was pretty good but the crust just didn't turn out like I would have liked or expected, if anyone knows anything I might have done wrong please let me know, I want to keep trying until I can make an excellent deep dish pizza. All the videos I watched making pizzas mine didn't look anything like those. The crust pretty much deflated when I cooked it instead of puffing up more. It rose fine during proofing so I know the yeast was working."

I've always made the crust from the recipe that came with it, and it was as bland as it could be. This has the texture and flavor that you want with a deep dish pizza. Amazingly, the prep is FAR easier than what I used to make. Out of necessity, I only let it rise for 2.5 hours and it still came out great."

I lived in Chicago for 20 years and ordered from Lou's two or three times a month. Trust me, I know Chicago pizza. Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza is vastly different from other pizzas, so much so that not even the dough is the same. This dough recipe is similar to other hand tossed recipes. Chicago Deep Dish crust is more similar to a buscuit than to bread. However, I agree that Chicago Sytle does not have corn meal in it, but I doubt if corn oil instead of olive oil could make that much of a difference. They're both vegatable oils. I did make this recipe and it is very good, especailly if you add some seasoning like garlic powder but it is not authentic Chicago Style. The Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza is constructed in the order described, just not on this dough."

I think it might have been too much dough. I will use less of the dough next time, but I will definitely be using this recipe again. It was nice and crispy on the outside. Great recipe."

First I layered with sliced mozzarella cheese. Then added pepperoni, Italian sausage, black olives and thinly sliced onions. Lastly the sauce went on and some fresh grated parmesan cheese on top. I cooked mine for 40 minutes because it had so many toppings. It was the best pizza I have ever made and I have made a bunch. It rivaled the great pizzas I tried in Chicago. It is thick and rich though, so one decent size slice will fill you up. I cooked mine for 40 minutes because it had so many toppings. Next time I will try prebaking the crust for a few minutes. The crust was great and thoroughly cooked, but I would like to try prebaking it to see if the bottom gets a bit crisper."

"reviewBody": "I made this for dinner last week and my fiance, who is from Chicago and has very high standards for Chicago-style pizza, loved it! I'm making it again tonight.\nI would definitely recommend pre-baking the crust, but only for about 5-10 minutes. I also added another 15 minutes to the baking time so the cheese melts nicely."

"reviewBody": "Handsdown BEST pizza dough I've tried yet. I'm so glad I didnt go my normal route and find a recipe with a million reviews. I doubled the recipe when I made this and was able to make a calzone and two medium sized pizza's. I wasnt able to let it rise for 6 hours I only had 2 hours but it still turned out perfect! Thanks for the recipe owensjo, my journey to find the perfect pizza dough has come to its end!!"

"reviewBody": "I wasn't sure if I wanted to make this since I usually stick to recipes with a lot of ratings/reviews. I am SO GLAD I did. I followed the recipe exactly, made it last weekend, and put it in a freezer ziplock and froze it without letting it rise first. Today (Friday night pizza night), I took it out this morning, and put it in an oiled bowl with a towel over it on the counter. By the time I got home from work, 12 hours later, it was thawed, risen, and ready to go! I put it in a 12 inch springform pan (the only \"deep dish\" pan I have). I should've made two--it was SUPER thick--like 3 inches (I prebaked it 10 mins, as suggested, added toppings and baked for 20 mins more--perfect!)! Even with the super thickness, my hubby said it's one of the top 5 pizzas he's ever eaten! Totally agree! This is amazing! One of the best cheap, easy dinners I've made!"

"reviewBody": "I know I changed a little bit in this recipe (oil type and how I made it rise) but I thought others might benefit from what I found out since there are only 2 other reviews. I really wanted to try this crust but I didn't have the 6 hours to wait so I put it in the oven with a pan of boiling water so it would double in size in the time I had (about 3 hours) and it did work. I am sure the slower 6 hour rise would only make a better crust but I did not have the time. I also used canola oil since that is all I had and using corn oil may improve it as well. I plan to try that next time.\n I didn't have a deep dish pizza pan so I used a pizza stone and a stone with edges so I had a little more of a deep dish and a more normal type crust (I doubled the recipe so I had enough for 2 pizzas). I pre-baked the crust. This made for a crust that was a little crispy on the bottom. If you want a softer crust I imagine you wouldn't want to pre-bake it. I did find that my cheese got really brown though so you might want to add the cheese a little later, especially if you are not pre-baking and want the cheese on top for a more traditional pizza. I added basil and garlic to our crust before baking. We enjoyed this crust and we will make it again."
