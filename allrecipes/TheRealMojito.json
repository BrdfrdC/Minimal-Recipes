I used 1oz rum because I don‚Äôt really like the taste of alcohol too much, since it‚Äôs a new taste for me. But after guzzling one drink and making another, well...we‚Äôll see how I react, lol. It‚Äôs just so good! It‚Äôs sweet, but I like sweet. I also used a lemon for my 2nd drink due to no more lime, and it tastes good that way too. Also, I‚Äôve learned to stir the mixture before adding ice, just so the sugar dissolves a little more. But there‚Äôs so much sugar that not all of it dissolving is okay."

I went a little adventurous and rather than sugar I do stevia and I got an AHA lime+ watermelon seltzer rather than club soda. So good mom doesn‚Äôt drink and she said it was good. Little known fact you can substitute club soda for any seltzer so to make it really boozy one can simply add a Truly hard seltzer or a Bud Lifht seltzer I myself like the kiwi mango truly hard seltzer‚Äôs with this mojito :) thanks so much for the recipe"

It came out perfectly, to my taste - but I can see how someone with more of a sweet tooth might prefer more.\n\nI also garnished mine with an extra sprig of mint. Love this, will be making it a lot this summer!"

IN the first batch, I put exactly 10 mint leaves per glass. In the 2nd batch, I upped the ante to 14 mint leaves per glass - and that is now my favorite version. Many thanks for this fantastic recipe!"

I preferred it because I do not like things to be quite so sweet. (Although I believe that 3 packs of Splenda would be equivalent to 2 tablespoons of sugar in sweetening power.) Lastly, I used a flavored rum (mine was Gator Bite satsuma rum) which added an extra dimension. I‚Äôm looking forward to trying it with the other flavor rums though it would be really amazing with just regular plain white rum."

The husman (too old for \"boyfriend,\" but not married) and I are doing a weekly \"cocktail night\" and this was the featured cocktail we experimented with for Cocktail Night #2. Solid recipe for this drink. I've had way worse at actual restaurants. \noh, we used: Puerto Angel white rum, 12 mint leaves per drink, and muddled the heck out of the first 3 ingredients! \n\nCheers!"
