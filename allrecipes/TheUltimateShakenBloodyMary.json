This is not overly spicy as when made with V8 juice. I have always preferred a Bloody Mary with plain tomato juice. We made a pitcher and enjoyed another glass! Tastes like MORE!!!"

This sound really good and I want to try it but actually this is a question - I am snowed in with 16 inches of snow in Washington, DC - all I have is V-8. Any opinions if this will work our not. Thanks."
