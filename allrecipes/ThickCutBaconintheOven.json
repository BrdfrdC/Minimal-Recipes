I used a rimmed cookie sheet lined with foil for ez cleanup and a sheet of parchment over the foil so the bacon doesn't stick. 405F in my gas oven, 20 min thick cut bacon is perfect every time. (Every oven is different so your cooking times may vary depending how accurate your oven holds temp.)"

"reviewBody": "I really wanted to love it but... I have tried this about 4 times now and I can't get the bacon to cook in 20 minutes. I would bake it 30 minutes then put it in my skillet which was totally the opposite of my goal. I finally just kept baking it for another 5 and another 5 until it got done and I'm not a real crispy bacon lover. I've tried with the rack and without. I had more luck without the rack. But I got a lot more fat splashing. But I'm going to try it again. When I got it baked I loved the uniform shape and the consistency in the cooking. So wish me luck... here I go again. Delicious but it took me 35 minutes to cook it then it came out perfect. So much easier than frying but I don't leave the stove after 20 minutes and check on it every 5 minutes."
