Needed 12 minutes in the oven due to its thickness, but turned out tasty. Kind of like Domino's New York Crust. I didn't prebake my dough. Simply added topping to the raw dough and popped it into the oven. The bottom of the crust still looked amazing."

For some reason my dough was very wet and I had to add another cup or so of flour, maybe I messed the ratio up however the crust was perfect with our pizza tonight. Garlic, cilantro, basil and dill from the garden ground in the molcajete. Large slices of pepperoni, fresh sliced tomatoes, and kalamata olives. Seriously perfect. Also! I substituted some mexican corn flour, it was good."

In the past when making pizza from scratch, i always found the base was soggy (i don’t have any fancy pizza tray) so I put the pizza base in with some olive oil on a baking tray at 500 degrees for about 4 minutes before adding the toppings, then bake for another 6-8 minutes directly on the oven rack."

I par-bake them for about 3 min and then let them cool. We top them and then cook them in our egg on a pizza stone (450F). I have also just par-baked them and froze them after cooling.

Also, the oven temp will vary with the oven you have. 500 degrees was too much for my oven and I did it at 400. So., next time, I'm halving the dough and I added garlic powder per some commentors."

This dough was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, it reminded me so much of the pizza hut crust. The flavor isn't as good as Pizza Hut but it's pretty darn good. I will continue to try new pizza dough recipes because I feel there has to be a better one out there but I will make this one along with the new recipe in case the new one tanks, at least I'll have this one to fall back on. I think I'll try baking this dough with some garlic, butter, and cheese. Definitely worth a try if you want a decent-tasting dough with a nice crispy crust."

If you rolled it did you thaw it before topping and cooking? Has anyone used this dough to prep a whole pizza then freeze the pizzas? If so did you straight bake or thaw first? Next time we make this im going to brush with garlic butter before topping."

I baked it at 450 the first time and 425 the second, and both worked fine. 500 is definitely overkill. I also recommend pre-baking your crust with just spices and a thin coat of olive oil for about 5 minutes before adding your toppings, if you want it a little crispier."

Going to be our make it your own Mondays pizza night, thank you for sharing your recipe!\n\nI really utilized my KitchenAid to knead the Dough slowly for 3 minutes...add flour as needed so it is easier to handle. Pizza stones preheated in the oven, a little bit of corn meal on the slides/stones, top it the way you like bake at 500 for 8 minutes. Rotate if desired for an even bake.

I didn't add all of the flour leaving out 3/4 c. which I used to knead the dough with. Also I did let the dough rise in a warmed oven for about 2 hours. As one reviewer recommended before putting the dough in the oven put a cast iron pan on the dough (used parchment paper in-between) and bake in a 450 degree oven for 5 minutes. Take the pies out of the oven , remove the cast iron pan then add your toppings. Bake another 20 minutes at 450 degrees. This made two 12\" pies."

"reviewBody": "Well, I don’t know what I did wrong, but the dough didn’t turn out crusty at all. Stuck to the pizza stone so we essentially just ate the toppings without dough. I followed instructions and put the crust in on a pre-heated pizza stone for 1 min before adding toppings and tried to cook for 8 mins. per recipe. Took out, the dough was soft &amp; stuck to stone. Reheated at 500 for another 5-8 mins and covered toppings with foil to prevent burning the top. When I removed from the oven 2nd time, the dough still stuck &amp; was almost impossible to pull off stone. Very disappointing."

I made mine in the morning, put it in the frig &amp; used later for dinner. The dough did rise while in the frig . I added some fresh chopped rosemary, garlic salt &amp; a small amount of olive oil to the dough before forming the crusts.\nI put cornmeal on the pan before adding the crust. Then baked the crusts in 500 degree ovens for 10 minutes. \nRemoved the crusts from the ovens and added our toppings. Popped them back into the ovens for another 10-12 minutes. Great thin crust pizzas!\nThis recipe will probably be used weekly."

"reviewBody": "I made this pizza dough mainly because I had a lot of old yeast in the house, and I wanted to proof it. I put most of the dead yeast in the compost, but I found a strip - no expiration date - but the packet I proofed actually produced a foamy cap. I mixed it with the flour and salt. It was very easy to knead on a flouted surface and rolled out pretty well. I had to keep pushing and pulling to make it stretch to the round metal pizza baking pan I own but have seldom used. The dough stretched and filled pan without ripping. I put some spaghetti sauce on top with scrambled hamburger and onion, thinly sliced zucchini, sliced mushrooms, and shredded cheese. It was surprisingly delicious."

"reviewBody": "So, if you make this and bake it immediately... It will be okay. Hence the 3 stars. TO MAKE IT BETTER: At a minimum, let is rise for an hour, punch it down, then let it rise another hour. If you have the foresight to make it a day ahead and rise in the fridge for 24 hours, then even better. Get it out 2 hours before baking. \n\nAlso, shape with your hands instead of a rolling pin. I press it out on my counter a bit into a thick disc, then spray both sides with a little oil. Now you can press it out into the thin shape you are looking for. Try to leave a little edge as a crust. Not much, but it helps."

I made this again last night but I mixed the dough in the afternoon and refrigerated it for 3 hours to allow it to develop some flavor. Didn't change a thing in the recipe. It was extra tasty and rolled out super thin after it warmed up. Mid point of baking I brushed garlic butter on the exposed edges. Over the top fabulous. Thanks for the recipe."
