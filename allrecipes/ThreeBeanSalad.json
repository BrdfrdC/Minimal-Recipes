I had fresh green beans on hand which I wanted to use so I steamed them, unfortunately they lose the bright green colour after marinating overnight. Perhaps this is why people use canned? I only had a bean blend, not kidney so another substitute. Unfortunately no waxed beans so the overall size was less. I reduced the sugar due to personal taste. It was excellent and I'll be making it again soon! Thx"

The marinade is spectacular, but obviously only if you enjoy a sweet salad. I did use Splenda in place of sugar and will probably reduce it to 1/4 to 1/2 next time; it was plenty sweet. I prefer diced onions to rings, so that's how I rolled on this recipe, but I loved it and will make this a staple for future healthy eating. Beans, beans, beans!"

Probably could eat in 3 days but 5 days were good. In 5 days you are going to need a vegetable or salad anyway and this salad will be ready."

Just a little something else would help. Still, it's great for a barbeque when 60 people are coming over."

Added 1 tsp brown and yellow mustard seed, and a dash of ground cinnamon. I believe this salad is more like bread and butter pickles, therefore meant to be sweeter. I'll follow the original recipe next time, but will always use cider vinegar; less acidic."

I use 1/4 c honey, 1/2 c vegetable oil and 1 1/4 c apple cider vinegar. Increase the celery seed to 1 teaspoon, the same for the salt. I use red onion, milder than white or yellow. Makes about 3 quarts.\n\nAs I use up the salad solids, I reserve the liquid in a quart canning jar. I partially drain a can of sliced beets and put those into the leftover liquid. After soaking for two days, the beets are nicely pickled and ready to be used in salads or on their own."

I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup. Other than adding the garbanzo and decreasing the sugar, I followed the recipe. You could omit the onions, which I have done and it is great with or without. Can’t go wrong with this recipe."

Actually, I think I lost my original recipe, so was happy to see this on the AR site. I did make a few changes. I used Orange Muscat Champagne Vinegar (I know, sounds pretty fancy for a bean salad and I sure didn’t use that when first married!) instead of the milder white viinegar, used Splenda® instead of sugar (cut that back to 1/2 cup), and reduced the oil to 1/4 cup. This was like a blast-from-the past, and I found myself eating it out of the mixing bowl, but eventually, I did put it in the fridge overnight for the flavors to meld. This was so tasty, and I’ve saved this in my Favorites, so it won’t be lost again."

Another suggestion from my own experience for a different twist: we used to occasionally add shoestring cut cooked beets to this bean mix, let it marinate overnight, drain it and add a spoonful of plain yogurt."
