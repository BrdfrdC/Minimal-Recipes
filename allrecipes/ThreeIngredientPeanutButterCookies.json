Then I added a tsp of salt, two pinches of baking soda, and about 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and baked at 350¬∞F for 12 minutes. I added a few chopped PB cups to the last few and they turned out great! I removed them directly from to plan to a coming rack immediately after removing them from the oven so they would stay extra soft and chewy. It wound up making about 2 dozen cookies."

But I much prefer the more traditional flour and butter and brown sugar and vanilla, etc., etc., peanut butter cookie. I followed this 3-ingredient recipe and method exactly but they were just ok, albeit satisfied a craving. Also, I did large walnut sized balls of dough that I flattened with a fork. I have no idea where y‚Äôall came up with ‚Äúbake 6-8 minutes‚Äù. Mine took 13 minutes. They do taste best when the bottom and edges are just slightly browned and crisp."
