Followed exactly but using Jimmy Deans mild Italian sausage links, chopped /sliced - because I already had it “out” thawing for another recipe but nixed. The rest? Followed exactly as written. This was WONDERFUL! We loved it and imagine so would many others! I’m not on tik tok but loved this recipe!! Great spin on spaghetti! Thanks Ali!!"
