I added a little yellow bell pepper and used bottled lime juice. Not as awesome as some restaurant ceviche, but better than some others. I will definitely make this again. Very easy, too, and DON'T cook the fish!"

I only chilled an hour and it was delicious, and leftovers even better the next day."

Can't have it without that kick, it's a must. Serve it with crab meat on a tostada and it is now called a Mixta and it is always a hit at parties. I also, cook it with shrimp or add boiled octopus to add some flavor and texture. By the way, if you pre-boil the fish, some, including myself, would no longer it ceviche."

Also, add some cooked 'salad' shrimp, and a 1/4 cup of good salsa but forget the (Pace)use hernandez (hot)salsa, Fish Ceviche is one of the best,rate right up there with Sashimi, Sushi an rice hot cakes with Green sauce.\nGySgt,USMC Ret."

It is obvious that the texture changes from raw meat to not raw. This is not sashimi. I added a jalapeño too. We ate it with tortilla chips. Yummy!"

As for how long it sits, that's a personal preference. But another important thing is to use a glass bowl. We eat ours with Lime flavor tortilla chips. Great summer meal &amp; packed with protein &amp; very low calories! Enjoy!"

Although I did not use the cucumber, and I like white onion."

After resting for only an hour and twenty minutes as called for, still tasted VERY raw. Tried tasting again the next day and was much better (about 24 hrs after making) so only 3 stars in my book."
