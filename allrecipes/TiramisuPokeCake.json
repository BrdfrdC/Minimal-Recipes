"reviewBody": "This is fantastic! Brought it to a friend's for dinner and everyone loved it! I've made it twice in three days as it was gobbled up at the dinner and after I told my neighbor/friend about it, I decided to make it again so 1) some for me again and 2) so she and my other neighbor could try it. Best of the two used the french vanilla box cake vs white cake mix! On the second cake, I creamed the sugar with the cream cheese before adding the other ingredients for the topping and it prevented the lumps as happened on the first try. The Kahlua is a bit spendy but this cake is worth it and one bottle will make many cakes. Thank you for this recipe! It will be made again... and again!"

I've made it three times now, first two times used white cake mix and strong coffee and instant coffee powder respectively, as I couldn't find the Espresso Powder. This cake always turns out well, but by far my best result has been this third time, when I used a Betty Crocker Supermoist French Vanilla cake mix, and finally, the Espresso powder, which gives it an unsurpassed depth of flavour. I recommend to follow this recipe as written, and to not substitute any of the ingredients."
