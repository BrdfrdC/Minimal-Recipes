"reviewBody": "After I made what looked like a good quick and easy recipe I decided to give it a try. After my first batch of jumbo muffins was in the oven I started to read the reviews. All the people that kept saying the muffins dropped and the muffins were a soggy buttery mess. So I got a little nervous I followed the recipe to a T except for baking time due to making them jumbo muffins. As I checked on the muffins in the oven I saw the tops were sinking in as the out sides where rising but I bake to the touch not toothpicks. When making cake, muffins, bread when you gently push on the top and it springs back it is done. That is when I took them out of the oven. And they are beautiful! They are actually the best muffin recipe I've found! I'm going to make more and next time try peaches! I may not always do the topping just to cut back on a little sugar but I will definitely not try to make this recipe better because it is beautiful and delicious just as it is!"

"reviewBody": "I'd give then a 3/5. They aren't bad but they contain an excessive amount of sugar both in the muffins themselves and the toppings. They also tend to fall apart as they are quite crumbly. I myself am not overly fond of overly sweet things and was a bit shocked at the having a 380+ calorie muffin when I checked the nutrient facts. Compare that with a 183 cal / oatmeal muffin batch I baked (which is also quite yummy and sweet enough). So yeah these blueberry muffins here are more dessert muffins not breakfast or meal muffins. Does the sugar serve a practical purpise or could it be scaled down or subbed with something else I wonder?"

I am keeping this recipe and it will be my GO TO for breakfast and extra blueberries left in the fridge."

They amounts for the topping far exceeded how much I needed for my muffins, maybe my tray is small, but I could've made due with 1/4 flour for sure. Still, they were quite delicious, not sure why some people had trouble with the topping sinking into the batter, no issues here."

I did that questioning it as I did it, but, did it anyways and now everything overfilled out of the cups and the streusel sunk to the center. This is by far the worst recipe for muffins I’ve ever made. I’ve been baking for many, many years and never had this result. I reread the recipe to make sure I didn’t do something wrong and I did exactly what the recipe called for. I’m very disappointed. With the cost of food being so expensive this was really upsetting. I will not make these again. Not to mention the flavor was bland, extremely bland. I tried one just to see if it even tasted edible, and it’s just overload of sugar. The blueberry flavor is even lost in all of that sugar, way too much topping!"

I filled mine 3/4’s of the way and then topped with strudel. The Muffins didn’t rise very much, but even filling them 3/4’s of the way, left me using a butter knife to circle every muffin cup to get the muffin/strudel loose from the pan so that could actually be removed from the pan. Depending on the toppings of your strudel mix, that is the flavoring of the muffin. The muffins themselves don’t offer a lot of flavor, but they are moist."

We added extra milk (almost doubled what recipe says), upped Blueberries to 1 - 3/4 cups, added teaspoon of vanilla and zest from half lemon. We made 6 jumbo muffins. Baked for 28 minutes - these were the best yet so we'll probably stick with this version. For the topping, I only used half from the batch we made a couple weeks ago so I saved the leftover. I added some extra butter and chopped pecans. Also sprinkled with turbo sugar."

I need a bit more flavor in the muffin. I'll add vanilla, or maple syrup next time."

Served for brunch, and my guests really enjoyed them."

The bake time was too short, but before the toothpick came out clean, the edges were darker than I would have liked. Perhaps 400 is a little too high in our oven. The batter was very thick and hard to manage, but it filled 8 standard size muffin cups almost exactly to the top. I used foil muffin cups and they came out fine, even though I didn't grease the top of the pan. I had way too much crumb topping and had to throw quite a bit away. The recipe is a keeper in our family. Easy and quick."

The only other tweak I made was using half white sugar and half brown sugar, instead of all white sugar for the amount listed (I did this for both the muffins and the crumble). These turned out fluffy, moist, and delicious. I’ll definitely make them again. Also, thanks for the tip about using a splash of water in the empty/unused muffin cups so the muffins don’t burn - I think that helped a lot!"

I don't even know if it was a Blueberry muffin recipe, I can't find it. 🙃 The kitchen has 3 desserts going on this weekend and I'm an old lady😂 I doubled the recipe as suggested. The crumb was far too much for 16 muffins. 🤨 I have 3 cups left that I'll use in an apple crumble. 😋 So I somehow combined two recipes. First time using a phone instead of printing things out.🤳 Turned out fine &amp; tasty despite my weird errors. Fluffy &amp; light. 🫐 A little too crumbly (and crumby) but worthy of a bake sale or a fast breakfast. I'll update if I make the recipe as written. I'll also post the crumble if i remember😁"
