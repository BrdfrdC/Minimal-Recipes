Mostly doubled all the ingredients listed &amp; based on what I had, used a mild olive oil, both fresh &amp; jarred minced garlic at 2:1 ratio &amp; did use shredded mozzarella. The recipe is SO good I'll use this it every time I make garlic bread, even without cheese. Thanks for sharing!"

Also, it was really easy to make. While we waited for the bread to be done in the broiler, we took the ends of the loaf and dipped it in the small amount of spread that was left, and there is nothing in the bowl. NOTHING. It was good even without it being toasted, so you can put it on anything. Toast, sandwich’s, etc. it took 15 minutes and it was amazing with the tomato soup we had. I would and will make this again. 10 out of 10. Bravo. Amazing. Thank you to the creator of this recipe."

"reviewBody": "This was ok for a garlic bread. I scaled down the recipe to what I needed to make for me using a gluten free ciabatta bread/roll I wanted to use up and followed the package directions for baking it. Appreciated the use of fresh garlic instead of garlic powder in this recipe, but something just seemed to be missing flavor wise...maybe more butter and roasting the garlic first would have worked...not sure. I also used parmesan cheese as that's what I had on hand and followed Bookie's recommendation on this recipe to lightly cover with foil. Decent recipe, but again, something was just off/missing to me."

I added a little fresh dried parsley to the mixture, topped with parmesan cheese and baked open-faced at 425degF for 10 min. Came out excellent! UPDATE 3/7/19: To make this even quicker, I sliced a large roll in half, spread each side with butter and spritzed with garlic olive oil, topped with pieces of minced garlic, dried oregano, parsley and grated romano cheese. It came out SO good and had nice crunch. Just have to make sure you don't keep in oven too long or you may burn the garlic."

"reviewBody": "This was wonderful! I didn't have any cheese on hand so made it without. Even my kids who don't like the store bought garlic bread had seconds of this. I ran out of the first batch &amp; had to make more. I only used a few pieces of thickly cut bread &amp; put the extra butter in the fridge for more another time. Watch while broiling, though. My first batch scorched after 1 1/2 minutes when it was on high. I lowered the broiler temp for the second batch &amp; that one was about 5 minutes."

Also some leftover garlic/Rosemary/salt rub from the steaks we grilled for dinner. Skipped the mozzarella and oregano. We grilled this on the BBQ open because we ran out of foil. Let me tell you BEST GARLIC BREAD EVER!"

Tonight i used a french loaf sliced end to end and wrapped in foil, baked it at 450 for 20 minutes. Perfection both times. I also made the butter mixture during the day with jarred minced garlic so the flavors melded. And this morning i made my scrambled eggs with the garlic butter. Yum!"

"reviewBody": "Roasted a whole garlic head (not cloves) in the oven 350 for about 20 min. Just chopped the top off a little so can see the garlic cloves and drizzled with small amount of olive oil. Once done, peeled off the garlic skin, minced and mixed with the rest of the ingredients. Right before putting in the oven, also lightly drizzled some more olive oil on the bread-covered with foil and baked in the oven for about 10 minutes at 350 degrees. Checked mid way just in case so it didn't burn. The bread came out nicely crisp on the outside and edges, but still chewy and moist on the inside. Family LOVED it and it was not overpowering. Will absolutely make again with this same prep."

I used some \"french bread loaf\" I had in the refrigerator and honestly this transformed the bread into a tasty toasted garlic flavored piece...will make it again....since I had a small piece of bread I have left overs for spreading on other breads and toasting. My only suggestion would be always keep an eye on the broiler...it can be tricky as it can burn anything quite quickly!"
