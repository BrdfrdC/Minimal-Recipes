"reviewBody": "I had tons of seeds so I tripled this recipe. Perhaps it's not agreeable to that. \nI agree with many other reviewers that the amount of sugar seems off. \"Sprinkle remaining sugar\" is deceiving...there's way too much for a sprinkle. And it didn't budge in 45 seconds. I had to keep stirring as it smoked and the seeds browned... It never fully desolved and the seeds started getting into huge chunks (another reviewer said it's like peanut brittle...I agree). I had to finally take it off the heat because I didn't want the seeds to burn. Then I dumped it into MORE sugar...it was just insane. Wish it had more pumpkin spice too. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give it lower stars is because the flavor is decent...it's just that they are clumped together with huge amounts of unmelted sugar coating them...not at all the texture I was expecting. (After posting this I went back and looked at the pictures...would have helped to do that ahead of time as most recipes looked like mine did. I guess the granulated sugar coating is the desired outcome.)"

In the frying pan, I used 1 T olive oil and sprinkled about 1-2 T sugar on it, stirring for about 2-3 minutes until the sugar melted. Then I tossed it into the coating mix. It was definitely sweet enough and the seeds are amazingly addictive!"

I don't buy pumpkin pie spice, so I used 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp ginger, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, and a pinch of cloves. I may have been a bit generous in my spice measurements since we like it spicy. As I was mixing, the ginger vapors were pretty strong. If you are sensitive, you may not want to inhale over the bowl until it cools."

I mixed all ingredients together and baked them as other reviewer had and although the baking time was a little longer I achieved the same results. I suggest using parchment paper though, as I lost one pan of seeds which stuck to the cookie sheet."

One adjustment, as recommended in some reviews, we cut down on the amount of sugar during the cooking. For a double batch, we cooked in oil with 5T sugar (not 8). Still plenty sweet. We will definitely make these again!"

"reviewBody": "Although I will eat roasted pumpkin seeds, I am not usually a big enough fan that I go to the effort of making them as easy as they are (especially when my chickens enjoy them as they are). Well, I decided to try these with my family and then make them with them with the preschoolers I teach if they turned out well. I am glad I did; these were terrific! They reminded me of kettle corn with pumpkin spice and it worked very well! I am now a big fan of toasted pumpkin seeds and I know several others that now are too. I will make these each year when making my pie pumpkins and/or when carving pumpkins. I too used less sugar (cut down by 2 TBLS.) and it was plenty. Thank you for a great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "My previous attempt at roasted pumpkin seeds didn't go over nearly as well as this recipe. Even my eight-year-old gobbled them up. I think one key is to toast them until they are light and crispy. You can tell a difference when you are stirring them in the pan. Took about an hour for our batch. Only problem I encountered was that the plain sugar did not really \"melt\" in the skillet to coat the seeds the way I imagined. But they still took on enough flavor from the spiced sugar to be considered a success."

I also melted the butter/sugar before adding in the seeds...stirred them enough to make sure they were coated, then put them in the dry sugar mixture. And for that, doubled the pumpkin pie spice as well as the salt. I love savory pumpkin seeds, but this might be the family's new fave!"
