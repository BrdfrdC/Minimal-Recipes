"reviewBody": "This recipe made the FLUFFIEST pancakes Iâ€™ve ever had. It made gorgeous fluffy restaurant-quality pancakes. I only tweaked three things:\n\n1. Used fresh (not frozen) blueberries \n2. Added a splash of vanilla extract to the batter, plus a pinch of salt \n3. Used evaporated milk rather than whole milk (only because I ran out of milk and evaporated milk was all I had at hand). \n\nI think the hour long wait is truly worth it. Without the wait, I donâ€™t think youâ€™ll get as fluffy pancakes. And adding in vanilla added incredible flavor. Served these with strawberry syrup and it was a hit! I took off one star because I think the recipe should include vanilla extract, otherwise pancakes may taste bland."

Iâ€™ve never even really been a pancake girl, but these are the exception! I do prefer to wait with the batter and now mix it the night before to make it a bit easier in the morning . The only thing I do different is add a little bit of pure vanilla extract. I slab some butter on my griddle and that creates a nice crisp outside with a fluffy light inside. Delicious!"

"reviewBody": "I made the recipe with only one minor change, adding the blueberries to the batter on the griddle, rather than mixing them in. These were firm, ripe fresh blueberries and I probably could have mixed them in, but the batter was so heavy and thick I didn't want to take the chance of mashing them. I think I would have liked them better mixed in, rather than all on the bottom. The batter is so thick after setting for an hour that my first instinct was to add more milk, but I did not. When the batter was placed on the hot griddle it did spread out. However, these are not traditional pancakes. They are about an inch thick, light and fluffy, but really don't have any flavor. We did not care for them much. They were just ok and we will not make this recipe again."

No bleed, much better than frozen, but if frozen is all you have don't hesitate to make anyway. I added the fresh berries immediately after ladling the batter on, not at the initial mix. This recipe made eight roughly 4 - 5\" pancakes, so at two pancakes per serving (I could've eaten more) this served four for us. Great recipe, thanks."

"reviewBody": "Iâ€™ve made this recipe multiple times but I add one extra step. Preheat your oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit and store the cooked pancakes in the oven on a piece of foil on the middle rack while cooking the rest. Keeps them perfectly hot and doesnâ€™t dry them out.\n\nI agree that fresh blueberries are best. I wash the whole pint when I get them so theyâ€™re dry enough by the time I use them. I add the blueberries after I pour the batter into the pan. This allows you to standardize the blueberry count per pancake and ensure you donâ€™t run out or low on the last one. You can also just throw a few more on if you do run low on the last pancake."

Didn't really tweak the recipe because it was actually my first time making pancakes. I used about 2/3 cup of blueberries (instead of 1/2 cup), and used about 1tsp of sugar (instead of 1.25tsp). In any case, this was SO delicious and simple. Will definitely make it again!"
