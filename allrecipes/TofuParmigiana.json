"reviewBody": "This recipe is delicious, but as with many tofu recipes it falls very short of what is required to get your tofu to really perform. Here are my steps to getting tofu to really seem like chicken:\n\n- Freeze it then use it. The resulting texture change is great.\n- You want to get the moisture out of the tofu not add it in. If the tofu is a little dry it will absorb the liquids (and their flavours). To accomplish this press the block of tofu between too flat surfaces to squeeze out as much moisture as you can. Be careful not to press too hard or you'll crush it. Next lay the slices out on a lightly oiled sheet and put them on broil (10-15 min a side). (I love my toaster oven for this). They will get a slight gold colour and become a just a little crunchy. Don't worry the crunchiness goes away when it re-absorbs moisture."

Unfortunately, I had bought medium firm tofu instead of extra firm, so the slices were a pain to handle (turn while frying, transferring to the baking dish, serving, etc.). Also, while the sauce and cheese was tasty the tofu was rather bland so next time I think I'll marinate the tofu overnight in a chicken broth or something like that to give it a bit more flavor. Not withstanding the above criticisms, the dish turned out really well, so we enjoyed it. Thanks so much for sharing!"

I tried to stick to the original recipe, but I only had an 8x6 pan, so the 14 slices of tofu I ended up with had to be arranged in two layers, which meant that I had to use more sauce, herbs, and cheese. In essence, I only increased the amount of some of the ingredients. I don't see a need to change anything, unless you want a medium-firm tofu for a slightly creamier texture. If I have shaved Parmesan on hand next time, I'll try that over the grated Parmesan. I would recommend this recipe to others."

"reviewBody": "Made this for dinner tonight, the eve of Thanksgiving. I selected the recipe because tofu is always a good low-calorie, high protein alternative! I used one reviewer's suggestion to bake the tofu prior to coating it and frying it. I was skeptical as I thought it might make the tofu rubbery. But it was a very smart step to use as the tofu was mosdef firmer. Overall the dish was delicious. While I couldn't fool my husband into thinking the tofu was anything else, he actually commented on how much meatier it was, more like a portobello in texture. Will use this recipe again. I'd've rated it 4.5 but couldn't figure out how to do that!"

I substituted Romano and it was delish. I also added an egg so that the bread crumbs would stick to the tofu, because I drained it too well. Probably my own fault. I'll try it again and see."

"reviewBody": "Half of my family is vegetarian and half is not. This is a great basic recipe to make both ways. I double the recipe and use half of the bread coating for the tofu and half for chicken. If you work with the tofu first, you'll be able to use only one fry pan. However, most vegetarians would prefer you bake the tofu and chicken in separate pans. The only change I've made is that I press the water out of the tofu and dip the slices in a beaten egg to before coating it with the bread crumbs. After the tofu is in the pan and ready for the oven, I repeat the process with two chicken breasts (cut in two thinner slices each). Both can go in the oven at the same time. Adding pasta marinara on the side makes this a meal the entire family can eat without TWICE the work of two separate meals. Thanks for a great recipe."

I dipped the tofu slices in whole wheat flour, then egg, then almond meal prior to baking them for 15 min per side at 350 degrees (olive oil on cookie sheet). \n\nAfter baking, I layered sauce (jarred red sauce), tofu then shredded mozzarella cheese (very minimal amount) repeating the layers a second time and topping with parmesan cheese.\n\nThis dish was excellent even as leftovers - thank you for sharing the recipe!!!"

I froze slices for 30 min, then used cooking spray to help the breading stick. I went the baking route rather than frying, and the texture was just amazing. Love the cheeses on it, but will probably up the sauce amount a bit next time. Absolutely fantastic recipe; would never know this was tofu!"
