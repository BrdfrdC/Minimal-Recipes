If I were making it again, I'd add more of both lime juice and soy sauce, and I'd either use full-fat coconut milk or drain some of the watery part off of the low-fat kind. As many of the photos show, the dish is quite runny for a stir-fry (not necessarily bad for it to be like that, but it's different that you might expect based on the name)."

The tofu held together better and had a nice crust even after I added it to the sauce and veggies."

It turned out pretty good then. I also baked my tofu and added it at the last minute, and for the stir fry I used the veggies I had on hand."

"reviewBody": "My daughter is vegan and this is a great dish for the whole family. I have made it over and over again. Draining the tofu has been my challenge. I did freeze it and thaw it out but it took some work to drain it. The last time I let it sit for over a day and then stuck it in the fridge wrapped in paper towel. This was the only time I was able to get it nice and crispy in the pan. Mind you, the family likes it no matter how I cook it. The flavours blend well and it's really a tasty dish"

"reviewBody": "This was delicious! I used date sugar instead of brown sugar to make it a little healthier. I also used 4 carrots instead of 2, and substituted kale for spinach because we didn't have any spinach. Lastly, I used sesame oil instead of olive oil to give it more of an Asian flavor. It was so good! I will say, the pepper (we used cayenne) was a bit strong for the kids. I would probably leave that out next time and only add it to my own."
