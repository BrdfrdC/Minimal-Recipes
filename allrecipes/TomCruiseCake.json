"reviewBody": "Man, this cake was good. Sweet, but not too sweet, with a nice coconut flavor that contrasted perfectly with the cream cheese frosting. It was moist and had a nice crumb too. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used white chocolate chips in place of the chopped white chocolate. This didn't effect flavor at all--but the chips did turn a sort of caramel color when baked, so it didn't look quite as uniform as the picture. Perhaps that's the difference with using chips vs real white chocolate. Everyone who tried this cake enjoyed it immensely. It's already been requested as a future birthday cake as well!"
