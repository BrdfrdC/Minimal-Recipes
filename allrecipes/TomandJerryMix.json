Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl, continuing to beat until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. Mix the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture. Stir in the rum, salt, mace, allspice, cloves, nutmeg, and cardamom."

My husband and I decided to try this recipe and we will never go back to store-bought again! It just doesn't compare to this. We had couldn't find the ground mace at the store we were at, so we grounded our own from whole nutmeg. Delicious!"

I made this recipe for the first time today, and it is fantastic! Only note I'll make is that the directions mention adding rum, but the ingredients don't list any rum. I make my Tom &amp; Jerry with 1/2 to 1 ounce each brandy and rum, about 2 1/2 tablespoons mix and about one cup of near boiling water. Mmmmmm. Sure to warn you up from the inside out!"
