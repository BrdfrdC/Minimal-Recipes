I did tinker with it a little though, but more just to personalize it to our tastes. I left out the \"hot\" stuff which Hubs doesn't tolerate well. I backed off on the onion a little so it wouldn't overwhelm, added minced garlic, a finely chopped jalapeno pepper, a small amount of fresh cilantro, and about 3/4 tsp. of cumin, all flavors I typically enjoy in traditional guacamole. I also chose to leave the avocados a little chunky rather than completely mashing them. It took a fair amount of chopping for this recipe, but it was worth it. I served it for a dinner get-together and everyone had at it. A real winner."

I used more crushed red pepper than what this recipe called for and more tabasco sause, I like it spicy, but it really wasn't too spicy. My mom could still eat it. This recipe probally would be a little better with some cilantro in it. My favorite guacamole from this website is LuvAnn's Guacamole, you should check that one out."

"reviewBody": "yummy. this was delicious. great call on both the cilantro and limiting the red onion. i only put half the onion in there and still woke up w/heinous breath. yikes! plus, i couldn't find roma tomatoes, so i just used plum. one thing i laid off of was the red pepper b/c my husband doesn't like spicy as much as i do, but i did put way more than 3 drops of tobassco in there. i also thought this would be a great thing for the food processor, but since no one else tried it, i did it the old fashioned way. chunky is nice, but i think i may try beating it to a pulp next time. tho my husband says he liked it chunky."

I brought some in to work for a pot luck, and ended up giving copies of the recipe to several people! I even grew tomatillos in my garden after trying this, and I had NEVER tried a tomatillo before! Wow!! Great recipe!!"

Depending on where you live, you might find them in the specialty produce section of the grocery store, or at a Mexican market. Sometimes you can buy them canned, but for this recipe, I would advise the fresh ones. Good luck!"
