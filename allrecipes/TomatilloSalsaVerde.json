If you follow this recipe, you may waste your first batch because it's tomatillo soup instead of tomatillo sauce. The oregano is just weird, too. I didn't like the flavor of this recipe. My wife kept asking me why I was putting in Oregano, and I took some out. I didn't remove enough. I give it two stars. If I didn't strain the water out, it would have been a 1 star \"couldn't eat it\"."

Jalapenos or hot hatch green chilies will also work in place of the serrano pepper. I've tried both in separate batches and found no flavor issues.\n\nThis is the secret sauce in my chicken enchiladas. Instead of simmer, I cook on medium and add in 2 - 8 oz. packages of cream cheese. Stir the mix until it's bubbly and smooth. Add some in your enchiladas and pour the rest over the top. Since discovering this sauce, my family demands chicken enchiladas weekly. I've negotiated a compromise for every other week. LOL!"

So I roughly chopped the tomatillos and sauteed all the ingredients in a little olive oil without adding any water. For the last 10 minutes, I covered the pot and just let them simmer gently. Then I ran them through the blender. The result was perfect. \n\nI also adjusted the seasonings based on what I had: 1/2 tsp ground coriander since I didn't have cilantro, 2 tsp dried oregano instead of the fresh, and 2 pinches red pepper flakes plus a sprinkle of black pepper in place of the whole pepper. It was quite tasty!"

For my approx. 5 pounds of tomatillos (photo is about 2/3 of tomatillos), the roasting removed a quart of liquid. I added 3 Hungarian yellow peppers (look like poblanos) and 3 serannos. I also added 3/4 C vinegar and about 1/4 C lime juice. Yielded 7 pints once canned (water bath for 15 min)."

I didn't add the water until after blending, and I used one cup instead of two. I will definitely make this again. Next time I might add the oregano; I simply didn't have fresh oregano on hand. It was flavorful with a subtle kick."

And used 2 habaneros. It was a bit watery so I added some chia seeds to each bottle while they were still cooling. My friend, who loves habanero anything, just texted me to say it is really good. (I just finished it before she left my house and it was still warm.) I moved to Mexico from US a year ago and developing my pallet for hotter peppers. I do like the flavor and will continue to make this with some of the modifications suggested by others."

This is perfection! I bought some jalapenos that I needed to use up and found this recipe, but they didn't have any zip at all, so I added a serrano pepper. This wasn't at all spicy, but the flavor is yummy. I made some enchiladas and used this. I think that tomorrow I'll make some eggs for breakfast and use up the last of the salsa.

I washed &amp; quartered all the tomatillos (about 3ish lbs) then added them directly to the saucepan. Then I rough chopped a whole white onion, 2 large garlic cloves, 2 jalapeños (seeds &amp; membranes &amp; all), a handful of fresh cilantro &amp; oregano. Then I added 2 heaping teaspoons of cumin &amp; a tablespoon of my favorite Tastefully Simple season salt. Brought the whole pot to a boil, then simmered until everything was soft &amp; reduced.

Kept the drained liquid and added it to a homemade tomato sauce."

So this turned out to be a great Mexican sauce for a dinner, but not a great sals.\n\nHere are the changes I made: I did not have the serrano chili, but I did have dried New Mexico chilis, so I reconstituted one of those in a half cup hot water. I then substituted that 1/2 cup of chili flavored water for a 1/2 cup of the plain water called for in the ingredients. Lastly, I used dried oregano rather than fresh because that's what I had on hand.\n\nLike I said, it's great flavor, but watery so it makes a sauce, not a salsa. To make a salsa, I'd reduce the water to 1/2 cup to start, only adding more water as it cooks if it appears too thick."
