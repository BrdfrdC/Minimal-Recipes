HOWEVER, in the future I will have the cheese on the side because the balsamic makes it look gross after just a short while. Still tasty just not as pretty as I would like. AND if you have leftovers (I made this for two people so we had a couple days to nosh through it) the cheese becomes overpowering in the salad. Other than my own pickiness, lol. I give it two thumbs up. My favorite way to eat the leftovers is over a bed of spinach. Swoon."

"reviewBody": "Admittedly I changed this recipe, but came up with something that we really liked. I just eyeballed the ingredients, using tomatoes, no cucumber, green onions, fresh basil, Italian salad dressing, feta and toasted almonds. The second time I made it the same way, only subbing toasted pine nuts for the almonds. I'm sure the olive oil and balsamic vinegar called for in the recipe would be wonderful as well and I may do that next time. I like this best when served at room temperature. We'll be making this a lot this summer with fresh tomatoes from the garden. UPDATE 7/12/15 -I made this again last night, but followed the recipe more closely than before. This time I layered the tomatoes and cucumbers and then sprinkled them with green onions, basil and feta. Just before serving, I drizzled it with the dressing indicated in the recipe. I did use vegetable oil instead of olive oil, as I often think EVOO is too strong and predominant in a salad dressing. This had great flavor and I will certainly do this one again. Although I do love balsamic vinegar, in a recipe like this, the dark balsamic can make the appearance of your salad rather unappealing. A possibility would be to try white balsamic vinegar."

"reviewBody": "This could easily become a summertime habit! Roma tomatoes have been particularly red and ripe lately in our groceries, and with a plentiful supply of basil in my garden I could eat this healthy, light, flavorful salad every day. I didn't peel the cucumbers, but to prevent excess liquid as the salad sat I seeded both the cucumbers and the tomatoes. I think with the extra green of the cucumber peel, and getting rid of that not particularly attractive \"guts,\" that it made this salad especially pretty. The green onion provided just the slightest bit of bite, but not as much as regular onion would, which I appreciated. This really is a a more delicately flavored salad. In keeping with that, I used fresh lemon juice rather than balsamic vinegar, which I prefer when I want a lighter dressing. At the last minute I tossed in some chopped ripe avocado when I remembered I had one and it really added so much creamy contrast in texture. I loved it. And I loved this salad."

"reviewBody": "Fantastic refreshing salad that is easy and quick to prepare. We took this to our neighbor's house and the French wife and Dutch husband adored it and had thirds. I made it without the cuke as mine had gone off and threw in an extra tomato. I also only put in 2 T olive oil as I was worried about the dressing being too much without cuke. I put in some white onion as I didn't have purple or green on hand. I've gotta make this again!"

I served with whole wheat salad pockets and hummus and we all stuffed our own salad pockets. I also had corn on the cob on the side and everyone (especially my husband) loved it. It was a nice change from the normal dinners I make. It was healthy, light and filling. Thank you VANCGIRL2. I will be making this again and again for sure."
