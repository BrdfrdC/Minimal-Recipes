I added some canned, petite diced tomatoes that had basil and garlic in them and for color sake I used 1/2 each of a orange and a yellow pepper . I skipped the onion and was out of fresh basil (that would have made it even better), I was liberal with the cheese. I served this with wine as an appetizer instead of having rolls and salad with dinner. My neighbor guests raved. Oh...did I mention I made my own baguettes? It was my first time making them. Anywho, I will make this again and again all the same way except I'll be sure to have basil in the garden!!!"

Cut the loaf down the middle and brush the olive oil on each half, place right on grill for only a minute to toast. Remove the bread and cut into smaller slices and place on a foil lined metal cookie sheet, top with the tomato mixture and cheese. Cook over indirect heat at 400° until the cheese melts. Took about 12 minutes. I just drizzled the oil and vinegar over my tomato mixture, but doubt it was anywhere near 1/4 cup each, still very refreshing flavor after sitting for an hour."

We really enjoyed this, but you do need to let the flavor meld for about 30 minutes. I was out of sweet red bell pepper, but I did have yellow on hand. Served this with 'Pepper Jelly Glazed Chicken' from AR and a tossed salad. We really enjoyed this version of bruschetta, and I know I will use this recipe again.

I followed the recipe using all the ingredients; but, because I wanted a cold appetizer, I used the mozzarella as a garnish rather than melting it in the oven. I only used the flesh of the tomato not the seeds or juice. When it first got done, I was very disappointed in the taste. I just didn't like the pepper, it was too strong. (Perhaps my fault) After refrigeration of a few hours, it was \"knock your socks off\" good! All the flavors blended and it was totally delicious! I served the bruschetta separate, as I didn't want the bread to get soggy. I will be using this recipe often, infact I'll be making it again tomorrow. Thank you Joy for sharing!"
