"reviewBody": "I know the vast majority of reviews are 5 stars. But I don’t get it. If all you do to the chicken is put it in egg and Italian bread crumbs, where is the flavor going to come from? It needs spices or at least salt and pepper. Also, if you sauté your chicken for 8-10 minutes per side and then bake it for anywhere near 20 minutes, it will be over cooked. This wasn’t bad but it had very little flavor and the meat was too done."

I sautéed the chicken as described, then baked it, but I just put a thin layer of sauce under the chicken because I was worried it would get too soggy. I added a thin layer of sauce on top of the chicken. Baked uncovered for 10 minutes, then added shredded mozzarella (all I had on hand) and baked 10 more minutes. Served with spaghetti and the remaining sauce. Chicken was moist, coating was crispy. I used Parmesan herb panko bread crumbs. Delicious!"

In trying to come up with new ways to dress up chicken dinners I happily came across this one. Used a combination of Colby jack and 3 pepper jack for the topping since I didn't have the Monterey Jack called for. I used 2 breasts sliced to make them less thick and used extra sauce as 12 oz. didn't seem to be enough. I didn't need the full 20 min. in the oven, I just waited until the sauce started boiling."

After putting the sauce on the bottom of the dish, I saved some to put on the top of the chicken too. I used mozzarella because that's what I had, and put in on the last 10 min not the full 20 min. The breading did not fall off during frying, and I did not refrigerate it as some suggested, so don't bother. Will make again soon."

Instead of transferring everything to a different pan to bake, I cooked the chicken on the stove top in an oven-safe pan. After the chicken was cooked, I took out the excess oil left from frying, then added the sauce to the pan, and put it in the oven. I agree with other reviewers not to add the cheese until 5 minutes before removing it from the oven, and also you probably only need 1 egg. I used half of a jar of store bought pasta sauce in the chicken and heated the remaining sauce to serve over spaghetti as a side dish."

"reviewBody": "This Chicken Parm recipe is admirably no-frills. The sort of simple classic that aims to warm the soul rather than seeking to impress. I point this out with respect to the origins of this dish, because what I’m about to suggest may shock future readers. My love of cottage cheese is no secret. I find the combination of its silky rubber texture and mildly salty notes a truly divine expression of human ingenuity. That “melt-in-your-mouth” quality can elevate ANY dish and that’s NOT hyperbole. All this is to say, a 1:1 ratio of Parmesan and cottage cheese takes this recipe to another level. Want to impress the new young neighbors? Influence the mayor to allow for that shed extension despite city zoning codes? Take first place in the Hawthorne middle school Fall Function? Yes to all of the above and more? Then follow my advice and make the chicken coup a cottage."

"reviewBody": "Because I am from Baton Rouge, La. and we like seasoning and spices I seasoned my chicken breast before coating them with the egg &amp; bread crumbs. I also added Italian seasoning to the filleted chicken breast and the bread crumbs. I took the advice of a previous user and baked my cheese (shredded mozzarella, shredded Parmesan, and sliced Colby Jack) only for the last 5 minutes of the 20 minute bake time and it was perfectly melted. I prepared for an 8 serving size and I thought I should’ve used 1 lb &amp; 1/2 of pasta sauce as I paired the meal with fettuccini noodles. More sauce would add a little moisture to the noodles."

"reviewBody": "Delicious; my picky family all loved it! For an even quicker version, you can use frozen breaded chicken filets, and skip all the breading &amp; frying time. If you are going to make it from scratch though, the other reviewers are definitely correct about reducint the breadcrumbs &amp; grated parmesan by half; there's simply too much to stick on the chicken.\n\nPS: I always season my spaghetti with a little olive oil &amp; butter, salt and garlic."

And will not make the same mistake twice: I breaded the chicken, then put all breasts into the baking dish and covered them with cheese, forgetting to first cook them in the frying pan!! Aaaahhh!! So, I removed the chicken from the dish, gently lifted the cheese off (best I could), and cooked the breasts. They blackened! The tomato sauce, etc., not pretty. STILL, they turned out delicious! Can't wait to try again. :)"

Scrumptious - my husband loved it. \nI used my homemade sauce with mushrooms.Reviewers were right - refrigerate breaded chicken breast for 30 minutes to keep breading PERFECT when sauteing. Used extra cheese - mozzarella and provolone. Yum!! Thanks so much."

"reviewBody": "Loved it! Used Rao’s Marinara (the best in my opinion) and used about 20oz. I shop at Krogers and used Private Selection brand of their herb Parmesan panko bread crumbs. Didn’t need to add Parmesan or any other seasonings. I pounded 3 breasts and then shook in flour, then egg wash, then bread crumbs. Fried for only a couple of minutes on each side and then baked in sauce for about 15 min, added sliced fresh mozzarella for a couple more minutes. Hubs loved it! You could also slice the breasts in half horizontally instead of pounding."
