I used hothouse cucumbers which already taste good by themselves, I planned on just dressing them with nothing else. it was yummy right away...but then I said to myself, you know what I'll add tomatoes that sounds so good. Then I said, you know what, let me add a white onion (didn't have red) that sounds so good. So I accidentally made the whole recipe and it was good each step of the way. Its tangy and balanced. I don't really enjoy raw tomatoes but I found myself fixing the perfect bite, 2 slices of cuke, one slice tomato and a slice of onion. After letting it sit for 15 minutes it was even better. I even offered some to my teenager that I don't even like talking to because it was so good I had to share. Thank you for this recipe!"

This is my new favorite (and healthy!) side dish/salad! *EDIT*: Be careful if you make this in advance and let it sit in the fridge overnight, the oil clumps up and goes to the top of the salad (which any kind of fat does).. Take it out of the fridge an hour or so before serving so the oil reincorporates itself with the rest of the salad."

"reviewBody": "8.24.2016-Quick and easy to make, but felt there was too much dressing. I would either reduce the olive oil and vinegar to 1/4 cup each or add an additional cucumber and tomato. Also, I thought the dressing could use some herbs in it, such as a little basil/oregano. Overall, the taste was good and I would make it again with some alterations. 10.9.2017-Made this again w/alterations in my original review and it was perfect for us! Steal Bookie's idea to toss it with some salad greens, which I'll be doing with the leftovers for lunch tomorrow."

Used half the amount of EVOO and less than half the vinegar (because it was a bit acidic), so basically halved the amount of liquid in the dressing and it was still plenty. Also halved the amount of red onion and reduced the amount of salt a bit. Added a generous heap of parsley flakes for color and flavor. Served it alongside barbecue at a big party I was hosting and it was a hit!"

Oh and to SpikeRox...I did use white balsamic vinegar because that's what I had (and I love on everything) and it was great. Thank you for recipe!"

Instead of chopping, I sliced the onions and cukes paper thin. I sliced the onion about an eighth of an inch thick. Like the other folks, I reduced the oil by half and added some sugar. Also, I mixed the dressing, onions and cukes together first and then added the tomatoes, so they wouldn't get all beat up. Delicious!"
