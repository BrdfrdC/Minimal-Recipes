After reading other reviews, I added 1 T. each of garlic infused olive oil as well as Tuscan Herb olive oil, and 1/2 tsp dried Italian seasoning. Unfortunately, my lemon was far beyond any possible use and I resorted to using bottled lemon juice. The recipe was very forgiving and still tasted absolutely wonderful. I added the salt and pepper needed just prior to serving so as to give the other flavors a chance to blend first."

Also, despite decreasing the onions to only a third, they were still too pungent. It was light and refreshing, but I was even bothered by the amount of juices that the salt pulled out of the veggies (and I even \"gutted\" all of the cukes and tomatoes.) Looking for something to use up the abundance of veggies from my garden right now, but sadly this won't be a recipe I try again."

I say that even though I changed it for his Italian taste. Balsamic instead of lemon juice, added a dash of olive oil, 1/4 C of Feta, red onions will be great next time. A great summer recipe that begs for modifications (in a good way!)"

Also used chopped banana peppers and Italian dressing and not just any tomoato will do it must be plum tomatoes. Had it as a side dish served on chilled pasta to accompany grilled chicken, I learned it taste GREAT on top of the chicken as well. It was a great starter recipie I majorly tweekd."

The second time I made it I added the whole amount of onion and added lime juice instead of lemon juice and I have to say it was a lot better. This is a great recipe and I will definately make it more often."

I eyeballed the lemon juice and added a splash of garlic infused olive oil, a dash of dried italian seasoning and pepper as stated. I used 1/2 of a green onion (I prefer a lighter onion flavor). I let it sit overnight and ended up eating the ENTIRE thing for breakfast because I couldn't get enough of it. This will be made often--OUTSTANDING!"

This is also a recipe that people will modify to fit their own taste. For me, I added olive oil, fresh mozzarella and fresh basil. Next time, I might throw in some peppers. It is really all about what you are in the mood for. However, when you start with good tomatoes, cucumbers and onions you are off to a great start. \n\nOne more thing - use kosher salt."

The only things I would change in this recipe is to add a 12 oz can(pitted) whole black olives - medium size. I keep them whole. Drain and rinse olives before adding to mix. I actually use the juice from 2 lemons and use about 1/2 cup or more of olive oil. For those who think the salad is bland... I'm guessing that you did not add enough salt &amp; pepper - please try it again - you will surprise yourself! It is fresh tasting and everyone goes nuts over it every time I make it. I usually chill it 30 minutes so the juices can marinate the veggies. I cannot wait to make this again!"
