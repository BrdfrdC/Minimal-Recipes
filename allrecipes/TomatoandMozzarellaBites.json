I did change a few things though...I added a teaspoon of diced garlic and substituted cilantro for the basil as I was fresh out of basil, whisked it together with olive oil and traditional balsamic reduction and it was soooo yummy! I liked it better than the original version actually. I also mixed the cherry tomatoes (uncut) together with the mozzarella balls in a bowl and poured the marinade over everything and refrigerated it for about an hour letting the mozzarella soak up the marinade. Served as a side dish. Delicious!!!"

I've made them a few times since then, with a few changes that really made the flavors explode in your mouth. Grilling or roasting the tomatoes brings out a sweet, savory taste, and marinating the mozzarella (or buying it already marinated) adds more flavor."

I put half a tomato &amp; half a mozzarella ball with a small basil &amp; the bacon on a tooth pick. Made a great small bite!"

After letting it sit for at least ten minutes I grind sea salt over it. Soooo good."

So much better than the traditional tomato and mozzarella which must be eaten with a fork and knife.

Try it and see - you won't be disappointed!"

"reviewBody": "Love this recipe! Made only a few minor changes: instead of toothpicks I had my husband cut some wooden skewers into approx 4\" lengths. Skewer a small mozzarella ball (or a piece of a cut-up larger ball) first. Follow with a small leaf of basil (or a piece of a larger leaf. Finish with a half a cherry tomato with the cut side down. Instead of the O&amp;V, I use balsamic glaze (Sophia's comes in a squirt top plastic bottle). I drizzle the glaze back and forth over a large white china platter and stand the skewers on it, evenly spaced. The cut tomatoes provide a stable base. You can sprinkle with a little sea salt and fresh cracked pepper then cover with some plastic wrap to keep from drying out. Using half a tomato and small ball of mozz makes this a one bite app - easier to manage and less messy than a longer skewer with multiple tomatoes, cheese etc. The colors pop and it all looks a bit more gourmet - a huge hit whenever I make it - and a healthy alternative to chips and dip etc."

Then I drizzled the dipping sauce over the entire plate. These are so delish! I'm making them again this weekend for a baby shower. Don't skimp on the good mozarella! It's worth it! Thanks for the great recipe."

"reviewBody": "My book club group loved this.\n\nHere are my modifications:\n1. I marinated the cheese balls in the olive oil (my grocery store carries a combo of olive oil, grape seed oil and canola oil) along with some citrus/basil garlic spice (from Pampered Chef) for a couple of hours.\n2. Then afterward I put the rest together on the skewers. I did cut a couple of the cheese balls in half so I had enough to go with the tomatoes.\n3. Poured some more olive oil and the spice over the top of the skewers when I served them.\n\nServed for my book club meeting and everyone loved this."

I made around 70 of these &amp; they did not dry out or turn brown. I did marinate them over night &amp; left out an hour or so before serving so the olive oil would not be so thick. Everyone loved them. I will be making again. Thanks for a great recipe."

Everyone said it tasted much better than the way they made them and wanted to know how or what brand I used."

Very simple and very pretty. If the cherry or grape tomatoes are too large, which some of mine were, just cut them in half and put the cut side against the basil."

"reviewBody": "I don' like to change a recipe and then rate it but all I changed was the technique and not the ingredients. I wanted to use this as more of a salad so I cut the tomatoes in half and then in very thin slices and then threw in some bocconccini balls that I cut in half. I didn't have fresh basil so I just used my freeze dried stuff and sprinkled it on top of the tomatoes and cheese. I mixed up the dressing and poured some of it over and gently mixed it just a few minutes before serving it. Yummy. The dressing and basil are what make this delicious. I would use grape or cherry tomatoes if I had them next time. I love how versatile this recipe is. It can be an appetizer or a salad."
