I put about 3/4 cup ketchup instead of the full cup, added chopped fresh spinach at the end, and added some basil stir in paste. Otherwise I think it's perfect! It's so good on a cold day when all you want is a bowl of hearty and hot soup."

"reviewBody": "This is a really great \"base\" recipe! I've made this several times. I agree with a previous reviewer that using tomato paste instead of ketchup cuts the sweetness a bit. My Family tends to load up on the tortellini, and since this recipe doesn't specify a type; cheese, spinach, or sausage, I've found that any pasta tossed in and cook with any remaining broth also makes for great \"left overs.\" This a good go to for a pasta soup!"

Great way to use up veggies and eat off of it for several meals. It makes a huge pot!"
