I took advice of several other posters and used Italian dressing instead of making the olive oil/vinegar/seasoning blend and it turned out so delicious! I omitted the artichoke and instead did cherry tomatoes. I also cut back the cheese to about 4 oz. and did a mix of mozzarella and sharp cheddar. Topped it off with some fresh chopped Italian parsley. It was a smashing hit at our family party. Thanks!"

This would be a good lunch to take to the beach when the weather gets warmer. Nice recipe!"

My only changes were to use 4 oz. of Goat Cheese (as I was out of Mozzarella), and use about 1/8th cup of Dried Minced Onion (I cheat with this often as I hate working with fresh onions.) I also added slivered red and green peppers to punch up the color and veggie content. It's marinating in the fridge as I type and Hubby's already trying to smuggle some out -- I think we have a winner! ;p"

"reviewBody": "This salad was just so-so for me. (And though I usually get rave reviews for my recipes at family parties, I only got one compliment on this one.) I loved the ingredients in it-- pretty much all things I like. But somehow the final product was kind of bland. It must have been the dressing. I think I will make this again because I really like the parts, but I will use kalamata olives for more flavor, maybe throw in some parmesan for depth, and I might use a bottled Greek or Italian dressing rather than just the oil/vinegar/Italian herbs. I think this salad has potential, but it needs some tweaking to be up to my standards."

I didn't have artichoke hearts, but for some \"deep flavor\" I add dun dried tomatoes; both dried and marinated in olive oil taste great. Salami works great too if you don't have pepperoni."

I think you have to start with great tortellini which I got at Sam's Club. I also used garlic and herb Lipton soup mix (about half an envelope) instead of the Italian seasoning because we were out of it. Still came out so yummy. We will definitely be making this often."

This is a simple, great tasting salad and just a little different from regular pasta salad...Always a hit! Thanks for sharing. :)"

"reviewBody": "Big hit at our house! Took some reviewers advice and used a variety of olives, marinated artichokes, and marinated mozzarella balls from the \"Mediterranean Bar\" (next to the salad bar) at the grocery store. Added slivered red &amp; green peppers, halved cherry tomatoes, and hard salami. Used tri-colored cheese tortellini - and after cooking, tossed it in a little bit of the marinade from the container of olives, artichokes, and mozzarella so it wouldn't stick together before I added in all the other ingredients. When finished, to help with marinating - I put the whole salad in a gallon size ziploc bag and laid it flat in the fridge. Every so often, I flipped it over to mix it up a little bit. Great space saver, too! Needed to make several salads at the same time and marinated them this way, stacked on top of each other!"

"reviewBody": "I personally thought this was just ok, but my guests thought this was incredible. I invited about 30 people over and almost all of them complemented me on this salad. So I am giving this a 5 star. I added more ingredients to make more salad. I included asparagus(Cooked in boiling water for 1 min the in icebath) fresh cut cherry tomatoes, parmasan cheese and a green pepper. Used the same amount of dressing and it worked fine. I do not think you need to add more dressing unless you plan on eating this the next day when the noodles soak up the sauce. I suggest other reviewers to wait to add the sauce until right before you serve it. This was good but I also think it depends on what kind of tortellini you buy. Some are better than others...Thanks for the recipe."

Next time I make it with the right quantity of tortellini I will increase the amount of dressing I make. I used shredded mozzarella cheese and next time I will make sure to get a block of cheese and dice it like the recipe instructed to do."
