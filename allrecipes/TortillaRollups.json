But the biggest (and best) change I make is, after chilling for several hours, I slice no more than 1/2” thick, lay them flat on a cookie sheet, and bake at 350 for 10-15 minutes. SO much better than just cold!"

Served as an appetizer at Christmas, people gobbled them up within the first half an hour, and everyone wanted the recipe!"

I added a can of rinsed and dried black beans spread between 6 super large spinach wraps after spreading the cheese mixture on them. Made these about 3 hrs before serving and when I went to cut, decided to freeze 10 minutes to help firm up prior to cutting. They cut cleanly after the brief time in the freezer. Very easy to customize and they've already been asked for again."

I added diced red pepper for some crunch. The only thing I did wrong was spread too much on the tortillas, it was too much filling per piece. I tried to spread it thinly but I guess not thinly enough and will do it more sparingly next time. This time I used 5 12 inch tortillas, next time I will spread it out to 7 or 8 I think!"

Once I couldn't find the spicy Ranch dressing mix so I used the regular. It came out just fine. One thing to watch out for: It makes more filling than can be used on 10 tortillas. So, maybe have a few extra tortillas on hand, or some crackers to eat the rest of the filing on. YUM!"

At the end of the night when I asked what everyone thought of the recipe, we actually had a conversation about how bad it was....ranch mix was overpowering although I only added half the packet, it was better as a dip, people actually wanted to get rid of the flavor in their mouth after eating it etc. I do not recommend this recipe.

I read the other review about it being too salty and added seasoning a tablespoon at a time until it tasted right. The recipe really made a lot of filling. I only used about half for 10 tortillas. The rest of the filling we just used as dip for wheat thins and that was pretty good!"

"reviewBody": "Very good recipe, and one of the best features of this recipe is its flexibility. I agree with the others that you'd best back way off on the ranch dressing mix or taco seasoning. You don't need it at all, so add it sparingly, or taste as you go. You can add any or all of the following with great results: small can of chopped olives (or perhaps half a can), small can of diced green chiles, a tablespoon or so diced jalapenos, 2-4 green onions. A few reviewers seem to have missed the step about chilling in the refrigerator before serving. You have to do this in order to firm up the rolls, as well as allowing the flavors to marry. Give them several hours at least, but not too long or the tortillas can get soggy. It's a critical step. Don't mess with the low fat versions, especially if taking it to a party. People trying to lose weight aren't going to be scarfing these down and do you really want to run around the party telling people how the dish you brought is \"low fat and healthy\"?"

I ended up bringing it to the party as a dip with pretzels which was also amazing. It tasted awesome with the tortillas, but I couldn't get them to roll and cut. I think you have to prepare them, let them sit for a few hours to soften the shells, and then cut them. Will Make again! Very addicting."

I still ended up with leftover filling so I put it on a bagel :) I also didn't have fiests ranch as my commissary doesn't carry it so I used mostly taco seasoning with some regular ranch seasoning instead. Still great taste."

"reviewBody": "Very tasty recipe! I decided to trim it down a bit by using fat free cream cheese, light sour cream, fat free shredded cheddar cheese and low carb small mission flour tortillas. The turned out very good! I didn't have the seasonings called for so I used 1/2 a Lowry's Chicken Taco seasoning packet and it turned out great. Finally, I sauted a few hamburger patties until crumbly with a tsp of the seasoning salt. I added this to the spread. Yum! It made 12 tortillas and each one has 7 grams of fat, 23 carbs and 17 grams of protein! They are a meal all by themselves and great with a simple salad on the side! I also put them in the freezer until verrry firm before trying to cut them into pinwheel slices. Worked Great!"

"reviewBody": "These were absolutely outstanding. I made them for a tailgating party and they were completely gone before the game even started. I was unable to find the fiesta dip mix that the recipe calls for so I just used taco seasoning and it was just fine. In addition I like things a bit on the spicy side so I used HOT salsa and it gave the rollups a lot of kick. Finally I think even more flavor was added by using the jalapeno cheddar tortillas. As many have mentioned, make sure you refrigerate these overnight so that they are easy to cut the next day. I left mine in for 12 hours and using a sharp knife I had no problems and they didn't become disfigured when sliced. I'm already planning to make these again for a work party tomorrow."

We used HOT salsa to give it a little kick but it was not too hot. Made 1/2 with turkey and 1/2 without. It is very soft when you spread it and my first thought was oh . But it firmed up nicely. Didn't drain the salsa butdid chill it for 10 hours before slicing (I think you would be better with a chunkier less \"saucy\" salsa). You might want to think about using a lower-sodium taco seasoning (maybe even a pure chili powder??) as it was a little salty for my tastes. But they wiped up the entire platter so I think it was quite the hit. Will make again."

I used taco seasoning (also from this site) instead of the ranch dressing and drained the salsa before mixing it with the cheese. I added oven roasted turkey on some of the wraps. I did refrigerate the wraps all day before cutting them; I did not have problems slicing them as others did. So maybe they did not chill them long enough? I also did not have any problems with soggy wraps; maybe the draining of the salsa took care of that. This definitely will be saved as a good party recipe. Thanks!"
