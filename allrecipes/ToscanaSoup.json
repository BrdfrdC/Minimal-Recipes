I usually use whole milk (it's what I always have on hand), mild browned ground sausage instead of spicy (so the kids will eat it), and add some crushed red pepper flakes to the adults bowls when it's finished. Amazing. My favorite soup. Very forgiving with mixing things up as needed. Perfect as written, but easy to make kid friendly."

I also used all chicken broth without water the first time and used both chicken broth and water the second time. They both tasted exactly the same. You can really play around with this dish using different ingredients. It's a new staple in our house for those cold nights."

I read the reviews and I added 2 extra potatoes, then I took about 1/4 to 1/3 of the finished product and puréed it in the blender, then returned it to the pot. This helped to thicken it. I added the spinach last (I substituted spinach for the kale; not a big kale fan). Will definitely be making this again!!!"

I used bulk hot Italian sausage, browned it in my cast iron Dutch oven (it's fairly small), scooted it over, cooked the onions, moved them over, cooked the garlic for a minute, stirred it all together, added 4 cups of chicken broth, then the rest as in the recipe - added the potatoes, simmered for 15 minutes, then LOTS of kale. I don't add the cream until serving so I can reheat easily. Plus, it's so good I skip the cream half the time."

Followed some of the suggestions from other reviewers...like cooking the onion in bacon grease instead of vegetable oil and I added sliced mushrooms and red pepper flakes. I was going to use cornstarch to thicken it up when I realized I didn't have any. So I decided to mash some of the potatoes. That did the trick. I also added grated Parmesan at the end. This is a keeper. Even the hubby loved it. Delicious!"

"reviewBody": "Good base recipe but I took a few shortcuts: used a box of dried scalloped potatoes and half a bag table-ready chopped kale salad mix, added white beans and used milk instead of cream to lower fat content. Removed casing from one large link sweet Italian sausage, broke link up into small bits before frying in pot used for the soup. Soaked 1 tsp fennel seeds in some boiling water and added just the water to the soup to boost the sausage flavor. The sauce mix from the scalloped potatoes gave the soup the creamy texture needed; finished it with a little white wine. I'll make it again."

I added the sausage at the same time with all the other ingredients and boiled until potatoes were soft. Did the taste test, added more seasoning and crushed red pepper, then finished it off with the cream and kale. I think this helped it with flavor putting it all in at the same time to simmer. I'll have this for a winter meal quite a few times. thanks"

These are my changes that I made a long time ago! I use 3 leeks (white parts only, sliced &amp; cut into 2\" segments &amp; rinsed of sand) &amp; some chopped onion too! I use 1/2 hot Italian sausages &amp; 1/2 sweet or all sweet, then add pinches of crushed red pepper! (I find it is better to take casings off of the sausages first then crumble &amp; pan sauté, easier to chew &amp; chunks not so large!) I make sure I pack plenty of potatoes &amp; all other ingredients into the soup because I take a 1/3 out and puree them, then put it back into the soup which thickens the broth. Oh yes, I use chicken broth only &amp; salt/fresh ground black pepper to taste too! The cream is important, don't skip!enjoy!"
