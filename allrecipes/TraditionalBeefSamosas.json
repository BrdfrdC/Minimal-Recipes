Omg, you would never notice there was pork in it. \n\nMy first bite I thought the flavour a bit mild but a couple spoonfuls later I discovered it is spot on. Just enough spice to make your mouth warm but not so much that you're running for the milk lol. I will definitely be making this again soon!"

"reviewBody": "Iâ€™ve always wanted to try Samosas and what better way to try them than to make them! These definitely did not disappoint. The only change that I made was using a 1/2 tbsp instead of the full tablespoon, because the won tons were breaking from being too full. Either that or use egg roll wrappers instead of the won tons."
