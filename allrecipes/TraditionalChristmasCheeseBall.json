I used a food processor to chop everything up and then used it to blend everything together. My cheese ball came out very loose; wouldn't even mold into a ball after it sat in the refrigerator all night. So, don't use the processor on the cream cheese! I saw another person used green onions which I think I may try to use next."

She didn't use walnuts and layered sliced green olives all around it -- but I am chopping up the olives and rolling it in walnuts which is easier, just as pretty and adds a nice crunch :) She served it with Ritz crackers and Chicken in a Biscuit crackers so I'll probably do the same, maybe a whole grain cracker also. It's definitely delicious and presents well on a nice cheese platter or plate."

I think the second time around will be a winner!"
