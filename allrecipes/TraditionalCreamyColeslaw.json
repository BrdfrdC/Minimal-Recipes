"reviewBody": "This is a great recipe! I did halve the recipe and it made a lot. The one thing I had to substitute was creamy horseradish for prepared horseradish because I didn't have any actual horseradish on hand. The horseradish flavor was not overwhelming and really added depth to the flavor of the coleslaw. I also chose to use Stevia instead of sugar since it's far healthier. I used Duke's mayo because it doesn't have any added sugar. I did let mine sit for about 4 hours before serving. My dad, who is not a huge fan of coleslaw, proclaimed it was the best coleslaw he'd ever tasted. I will make this again but will use actual horseradish next time."

The dressing is divine and my kids noticed it right away, asking if I had made the dressing. It is worth the few minutes it takes to put it together."

I was a little hesitant about adding horseradish to the mixture but that is what made it so special. Infact, when I make it again, I will add a little more than the 1T. The only change I made to the recipe was to leave out the onion powder. Just don't care for the flavor it adds to a recipe. This is a keeper to use over and over again"

"reviewBody": "As a coleslaw lover, I was extremely pleased with this recipe - - so much so, that I made another batch the day after the first was eaten. I shred a small head of cabbage, omit the horseradish, use a few shakes of celery flakes, sub Lawry's instead of celery salt and use more rice wine vinegar than called for. I also shred a couple medium-sized carrots, as coleslaw isn't coleslaw without them, IMO. To me, it tastes pretty close to a certain famous chain's coleslaw, and that's a good thing! This will be my coleslaw recipe going forward."

I halved everything (just in case we didn't like it ;-) ), I had extra hot horseradish and cut that back just a bit for dh since he's not a fan of it, added 1/8 tsp ground celery seed and 2 dashes of tabasco with everything else as written. I also added some diced onion to the slaw mix. Next time I will cut back a wee bit on the sugar for our liking. Served this on pulled pork sandwiches and had one serving left over that I finished off the next day with a steak. I will definantly be using this for all my slaw! Thank you!"

In my opinion you can't beat the creaminess in that one but I do love trying new recipes. I will have to make that next week to redeem myself since I did get comments that this was not as creamy as usual."

"reviewBody": "Yummy! I just made this, and it is very good as it is, so it will probably only get better as it sits until dinner time. Luckily I read a few reviews before I tried it, or I might have made too much dressing, as my bag of coleslaw mix, like another reviewer's, was 16oz, not 28 as the original recipe specifies. I did the math, and cutting the ingredients by half was just shy of what I needed. Since I have found that sometimes coleslaw tends to \"weep\" and get a little soggy over time, what came out a smidge drier than I might have liked will probably be perfect in a few hours. I plan to make this dressing to keep on hand for regular green salads or maybe potato salads, too. It's that good. I've really been trying to cook with fewer bottle dressings and sauces, and I was able to make this with what I had on hand. Thanks for sharing! Update: I was correct in that you can start this salad with less dressing than you might think. When I went to put the leftovers away after our dinner portions, I poured probably a half a cup of watery liquid down the drain, and there was still a little of the liquid in the bottom of the container. Any more dressing, and it would have been positively soupy."

If I'd had the other ingredients onhand, except for the mayo, I would have made it just as the recipe reads. What a tasty dressing. Serving it with chicken made with our Big Green Egg. Can't wait!"

I have made it exactly as it is written, and I have also made it as it is written +1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and one teaspoon of poppyseeds. It is great both ways, but I think I prefer it with the extra heat and seeds. Either way, you cannot go wrong! Let it sit for a couple of hours before you eat it."

Halving the dressing didn't make enough dressing for my taste so I upped it all a bit to make more and it was yummy! I like it with lots of creamy dressing, and the adjustments for tastes were easy to fiddle with and still great flavor. Don't think you can miss even if the proportions are off!"
