They even said it tasted better than the meat one. Just a tip, better tasting food is always vegan. Impossible Foods has a vegan beef and a vegan pork crumble and so does Beyond Foods. I personally like Impossible better, but Beyond is just as good. You can find these in any supermarket, like Shoprite and Stop and Shop. These came out so well so i recommend that you try it veganized (it is better for yourself and it frankly just tastes better that meat!)."

I usually buy them already prepared and Frozen. But Sorry I need to correct that this is not \"Traditional\" because in the Philippines you cannot easily buy Cilantro in many Public market where many regular Filipino folks buy. And sometimes limited if available. And many Filipino dish does not use Cilantro. And Cilantro can really alter the flavor / smell of any dish."

I got 20 lumpia instead of 30, maybe doubling the vegetables would allow you to reach 30 lumpia, as well as improving the texture and flavor. There’s also an error in the directions: there is no way to get 30 lumpia if you use three heaping tablespoons of filling in each, lol. I used one heaping tablespoon each and got 20 lumpia. My family loved them though!"

Only difference was that I used the food processor to chop all the vegetables so they’d be the same consistency. Except the garlic for which I used pre-minced out of a jar - 2 tsps. This is super easy and tasty!! My husband and son said now we have no reason to go out to eat. I think I might have inadvertently caused myself to have to cook more."

My family loved it, and said it’s better than any other lumpish that they had tasted before. I don’t have any experience cooking Filipino food but it’s easy enough for a beginner to cook. Using food processor to mince everything really helps since it’s a labor intensive dish:)"

It takes a bit to get the rolling down, but after the first couple, it was easy. Be sure to keep a damp towel over the wrappers while you are working with them to keep them from drying out. I also placed a damp paper towel over the rolled lumpia. I ended up freezing about half of them to fry at a later time. My package of wrappers contained 25 wrappers. Using 1-1/2 times the recipe, I did have a little bit of filling left after making the 25 rolls. Will make these again! Thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I jumped at this recipe as it immediately reminded me of the huge Lumpia wrapped in a lettuce leaf I used to get from Lien's restaurant in Guam as a young Lieutenant. On the eating side, this recipe has great flavor...the whole family liked them. Only down side was in production. I gained a new appreciate for the folks who wrap these things for a living. I was only able to find \"Spring Roll\" paper...so perhaps that was part of the problem??? But I really struggled with getting them wrapped well, so they wouldn't fall apart in the oil and stick to everything. It got better towards the end of the batch, so recommend you try a batch to experiment with before you try to impress anyone with a meal. Soaking the wrappers for a shorter period and turning up the oil heat to medium high seamed to help. The final product still ended up much greasier than I expected or would have liked. I'm not going to give up on this one. Suggestions?"

I looked online and found keeping a damp napkin on the lumpia sheets as you rolled kept the sheets from drying/hardening on the edges through out."

I believe when recipe says to put three heaping tablespoons of the mixture They really mean three heaping TEASPOONS.. I did not have lumpia wrappers, and elsewhere on the Internet I was shown that Spring roll wrappers would work. However, the spring roll wrappers i used did not do very well. I should've known after rolling and being out of mixture at a count of 13 that I had put too much in these. They exploded in the grease and made a horrible mess. I'll try again another time, after my wounds have been licked, and make sure I have authentic lumpier wrappers. I will definitely only put a generous tablespoon next time and use common sense. The filling was tasty, though. Good luck to you!"
