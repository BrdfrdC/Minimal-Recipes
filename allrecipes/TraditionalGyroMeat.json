I like the techniques - removing the onion juice, and using a water bath, though I'm not sure what effect that has, other than even heat distribution and moisture (that sounds really dumb that I actually typed that). But, the result is firm meat, not overly moist or fatty."

I also added garlic and onion powder. I wrapped a brick in aluminum foil and put it in the oven while preheating, and place it on top of the mixture while cooking. It removed all the air pockets and made it very compressed and super easy to slice. I also placed the slices on a griddle for a few minutes to get a little char, which really makes a difference. With the price of things in restaurants, it's definitely a money saver if you love gyros!..."

We selected this recipe for its simplicity to perform, availability of ingredients, and of accuracy of recipe to restaurant prepared dish. We gave this recipe üëçüèª with a few tips: increase both salt &amp; pepper to 1 1/2 tsp. If you like garlic, use 3 tbsp. The 50/50 lamb/beef is best ratio. Biggest tip‚Ä¶grind all spices well and mix with meat the night before. It takes that long for spices to imbed their flavor. In restaurants, meats are prepped the day before."

"reviewBody": "This recipe is just about perfect, and very satisfying. I do not have a food processor, so I mixed the meat + ingredients with a potato masher and it worked well. The meatloaf needed over an hour at 325 F degrees in my convection oven, and recipe can easily double the salt (increase to 1/2 tsp of salt) without peril. Recommend resting the loaf for 15 minutes before slicing. Then, suggest hitting the slices on a med-hot griddle/frying pan for 30 sec to a minute per side - it browns up just like at restaurants and food trucks. Have seen and eaten identical texture at gyro places in NY, so I'm happy with a slightly grainier texture. Definitely better and richer tasting the second day. Best served with pita, tomatoes, onion, and tzatziki - I eliminated the pita as I'm gluten allergic - also, great for breakfast!"

First time didn‚Äôt have all the ground spices, still good. Yes it needs way more salt, figure out your preference and still good. Two hacks. Save the juices that cook off for a beef/lamb great stock. And strain off that fat, save then slice loaf and fry in it for that irresistible straight from the broiler crispness. Homemade authentic gyros, life is great!"

"reviewBody": "I had a craving for gyros, but could not find the meat at our local groceries. I turned to the internet for a recipe and, after many variations, settled on trying this version. And I am so glad I did! \nI read many of the reviews and adjusted my recipe based on the feedback - 2 tablespoons garlic, close to 2-1/2 tablespoons salt, and heaping teaspoons of all the others (with the exception of marjoram, which I did not have. I just added extra oregano.) I did not squeeze the juice out the processed onions and I added all the spices to the onions in the food processor for a good mix before working it into the meat. I used a more standard size bread loaf pan (9x6) and it took about 1-1/2 hours to cook. I did not find the recipe difficult or time consuming as some others have mentioned. I would simply suggest planning ahead if you want this for dinner - it does take awhile to sit in the refrigerator after mixing. Served on warm pita with tzatziki sauce, feta cheese, tomatoes, olives, and red onions. Plenty leftover to eat the next day, with some to freeze."

"reviewBody": "Worked very well for us, made it today and will make it again shortly. [As with any recipe, we take a recipe's spice quantities as a starting point, and subsequently adjusted it to the way I thought we'd like it - worked well for us by roughly doubling the recipe's suggested amounts (put salt up to almost a full tsp). Used a 9x9\" pan because we prefer the meat mixture to be thinner, akin to what we feel we get when ordering Gyros. Used 50/50 sirloin / trimmed pork butt - ground the meats ourselves. After mixing in the spices, we immediately used the food processor - we broke the mixture into thirds and pulsed each for about 30 secs or so. Only needed to bake our thinner loaf for 40-45 min. Let the mixture cool, pored off juices to cool &amp; defatted them. Prior to serving, we sliced some of the loaf thinly, and cooked each side over medium heat with a bit of olive oil for about 2 minutes a side / until browned. Great recipe, thanks for posting it!"

"reviewBody": "Bland! Tastes like boiled meat with the faintest floral hint of spices. Needs significantly more salt. I know some people can be sensitive to garlic, but no one can be this sensitive to garlic. From what I've experienced, it doesn't need the water and roasting pan method. I'll try it again, but I'm definitely adding about 2 to 3 times the amount of garlic and maybe doubling up on all the other spices and possibly adding onion powder, white pepper, and a few other spices. Even if you do like the recipe as is, I would definitely recommend pan frying the slices of meat in some oil or butter to add a little bit of char and flavor."

Otherwise I followed the recipe pretty much as written. Did not overcook - checked with a digital thermometer. I found it hard to do the food processor steps with a consumer grade Cuisinart food processor. The suggestions to up the garlic and grill the slices might have helped."

I followed the recipe as stated except for marjoram, because I did not have it. Do not skip putting the meat in the food processor, it makes a difference. Served the meat with homade Naan and tzatziki also found on this site. Everyone was happy happy happy!"

You can buy a brick at home depot for under 50 cents if you need to. I recommend washin it prior to use as I did find some cold fat under the foil when I removed it and was happy I had washed the brick first.\nI used the tzatziki recipe from here as well.\nIt does need the extra salt added.\nI found it easier to slice it thin by turning it on it's side while cold and using a sharp carving knife to cut the slices.\nIt made quite a few slices and will make a several sandwiches.\nMy husband was rolling his eyes when I was prepping it as he thought I was wasting my time and his money.\nHe said it was 'okay'. He has taken it 2 days in a row for lunch and had it for dinner twice, the second night was he's suggestion! I guess he really does think it's 'okay'!!!\nI have tried it fried in different ways from butter to coconut oil, olive oil and kraft zesty italian salad dressing. I can't say which is a favourite as they were all good. We did prefer Naan over pita or tortilla for the wrap.\nI may try lamb next time as I checked the grocery store and they carry ground lamb, but I've never cooked with lamb before.\nTry it, I think you will like it!"

This is not a traditional \"Greek\" gyro recipe, it is a Lebanese/Middle Eastern recipe for ground meat served in slices like a meatloaf, called doner. You can't call this gyro.\n\nSo if you like ground meat the way they do in the Middle East, then yes, use ground lamb and/or beef with these spices to make what is called a doner.\n\nIf you like the classic gyro you got to enjoy in Greece which is slabs of pork and/or lamb, then use a REAL gyro recipe, a Greek recipe.. \n\nSadly, not many in North America know the history of food when it comes to the difference between gyro and doner. The term \"gyro\" has been watered down to mean any type of Greek sandwich with meat. Nothing could be further from the truth."

Instead of using a food processor, I used the tenderizing side of a meat mallet and pound it out the meat mixture for a couple minutes on one side then scooped it up, flips it over and pounded it out for a couple more minutes on the other side. I then put it into the loaf pan and cooked it as directed to 165 degrees Fahrenheit internal temperature. I saved the loaf pan juices and put it to the side. I then let the meat rest for 10 minutes before cutting it. I then sliced the meat about a quarter inch thin and pan-fried it in just a little bit of olive oil to slightly crisp up the edges. I then served it up on a lightly pan fried pita bread with homemade tzatziki sauce, tomato and onion. \nIt turned out to be very good."

Let meat cool and refrigerate several hours. Slice into strips, using a thin knife blade.. That is the secret. The raw meat looks awful but, tastes delicious."

I used nearly 1 tsp based on reviews and found it still needed a very light sprinkling after slicing. Will mix more into the meat next time. Also, saving the drippings from the loaf pan and using them to fry the slices prior to serving is what made the final result a real success. The loaf comes out compact and dry (as expected) which makes for easy slicing but not a texture that is lovely on the palate. Browning slices in the drippings is the finishing touch. Save drippings in the fridge to brown the leftovers also. Thanks for sharing this recipe!"

It turned out great and looked just like the gyro meat on the stick at the local Greek deli. The reason I cooked for 20 minutes in the oven was the keep the ground meat together for the skewers."

After MONTHS of using this recipe and perfecting for my family's needs, I have only made two minor modifications. The first is to use a teaspoon of onion powder instead of actual onion. Makes it a bit thicker because of less liquid, I find it gives it a better texture, and my husband never gets indigestion like he does with fresh onion. Second, as with most the other reviewers, is to up the amount of salt- generously. I've found 1 teaspoon to be a decent amount, but I've gone up to 1.5 teaspoons before and had it turn out well. Otherwise it's a perfect recipe. Thank you for keeping my husband (and surprisingly, my kids!) happy."

"reviewBody": "This is such an Awesome recipe, we enjoy this once a month, either as a sandwich, lettuce wrap, in a salad, even as a breakfast roll cant believe how good this IS with just about everything. We enjoy slicing, then reheating on a grated pan with its juices mixed with sage infused olive oil. I too also increased the salt to a tbsp and 2 tsp each of cumin and oregano. Let it meld together overnight then process in the morning, once cooked let cool cover with foil and do use the brick, finally slice reheat and enjoy."

"reviewBody": "Hello!!! I used this recipe a number of times. I recently made a change. I place a fire brick wraped in heavy duty tin foil that fits my loaf pan on the meat. It gives the baked meat a denser texture. Thanks for being out there!! Semper Fi! Godspeed!!"

"reviewBody": "We end up with several pounds of ground venison this time of year, and it works great in this recipe. I use an egg, but maybe two would be even better, otherwise the lean venison doesn't bind together very well and it falls apart when you cut it. I've also used bison in this recipe and it's really good, too. The trick is definitely in the slamming the meat on the counter or in a large bowl. I use this recipe 3-4 times a year and my family loves it. Thanks!"
