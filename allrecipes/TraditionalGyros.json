I didn't have the individual spices like marjoram, oregano and thyme so I used an Italian spice blend which contains all three. There are a lot of flavors going on with this recipe which I liked very much. If I acquire some lamb, I will do it again."

I put it in a meatloaf pan.\n\nHow long did you wait before cutting it? I hope it turns out! Okay here it is...Turned out and the family raved about it. I used 2lbs of Lamb and one lb of Italian sausage, mild. Followed recipe other than that. Thank you so much."

So I am assuming that the texture is different. That said I am very pleased with the spiciness and flavor of this recipe. So exciting to be able to make this at home. Will have to get a regular loaf pan to follow it exactly."

The meat in the gyro \"kits\" that I usually buy is SO greasy, that I would only buy them on a rare occasion. I really enjoyed making these, and knowing what was going into it. I did need to bake it for close to an hour and a half to get to 165 degrees. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I made Tzatziki Sauce I (also from this site), and they turned out really good. Thanks for sharing BetterCookingForSingleFathers!"
