I got out the mini-muffin tray, and pressed 1\" balls of dough into them and added a teaspoon of filling. The mini-muffins turned out really cute and tasty with just the right proportion of dough to filling. Much easier than rolling out the dough, so I think next time I will just do the mini-muffins."

Keeping all crust ingredients chilled and handling the dough as little as possible is key. Mini pies like this are much better, in my opinion, then a large slab of pie. Too much filling in those, which can be overwhelming. Thanks for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Perfect for the mince filling I made! I used cold orange juice instead of water as other people suggested, and added 1/4 tsp cloves. I forgot to buy oranges, though, so I only had one to zest and had to share it with the filling, so the orange flavor wasn't as strong as it probably should have been. Still very good and easy dough to handle. It baked up perfectly. I made mine with star-shaped top crusts as in the photo (some with one large star and others with three small stars) and the result is a delicious, festive treat. I didn't roll out as thin as I should have so I only got twelve tarts."
