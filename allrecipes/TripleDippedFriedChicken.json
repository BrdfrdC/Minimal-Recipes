So I added some spice to the mixtures based on the reviews saying it was bland. \nI used 2 CS flour for the dry portion and along with the spices listed I added 1 tsp each onion powder, garlic powder and cayenne. This was more than enough for a 2 pound bag of tenders. \nTo the wet mixture I used a lager ( was worried about the beer taste- but it was worth it) a TBS of cholula and 1 tsp of poultry seasoning. \nThis was spicy and so flavorful! \nI made this outside on a flat top griddle. I place a cast iron Dutch oven right on top of the griddle- high heat and let it heat up. Took about 10 minutes. I used the wooden spoon hack notes by a top review. Worked great. I will make this again."

I added 2 tablespoons of Lawry's because I'm a salt fiend. Still playing around with it but a great recipe. I think I did something wrong with the wet mix, I had to add a lot more beer than the recipe called for. It made my husband sad that he couldn't drink the rest. Lol"

Was looking for crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.\nIt was just ok"

Did not have paprika, need to try next time. I also did not use beer, but will definitely do so on the next batch. Any negative remarks on this recipe must be seriously crazy in the cabeza because not even KFC has anything on my fried chicken. Thanks a mil for sharing this fabulous, true to what fried chicken should taste like recipe."

"reviewBody": "So delicious!\n\nI do think the flour and batter mixtures were a bit much. I had a ton left over!\n\nI used Pabst Blue Ribbon for the beer batter. Was the only beer I could find in a single can, and it worked well!\n\nI would definitely add about 2 tbsp of cayenne instead of 1.\n\nI recommend keeping the chicken out until it's close to room temperature. It's helps prevent the crust from burning and will cook at a more even rate. Do the larger cuts first like the breast and thighs--then about halfway in, toss in the drumsticks and wings. If you put all of it in at once, cooking will not be even because the meat will cool the oil down. Or you could do the larger cuts as the first batch, then the smaller cuts as a second batch. The larger cuts will still be pretty hot when the smaller cuts finish.\n\nI would also use less beer/water than is suggested so you can get a creamier/thicker batter instead of runny."
