I almost doubled the ingredients (really 1.5) only moderation I added was a 1/2 tspn of old bay seasoning. I then refrigerated for an hour after I mixed it up and then spooned them into a pan with 2 of tablespoons of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter and sautéed until golden brown. Great flavor. Will definitely make these again."

"reviewBody": "I was fortunate enough to have married a beautiful girl from Maryland almost 46 years ago. It was by her at Hausner's Restaurant on Eastern Avenue in Baltimore that I was introduced to my first “Maryland Crab Cake.” It was at Hausner’s that I fell in love again from the first bite, of the crab cake that is! From that eventful moment on, I have had many, many crab cakes at many many fine restaurants, in many, many cities. Even in Maryland, every restaurant you visit says, \"Maryland Crab Cake\" yet they are as diverse as the Caesar salad is in Tijuana Mexico, and Southern California...or even Maryland, if it comes to that! Now, almost every crab cake I've eaten is very good, as is this one, even though they are all very different. The only thing they have in common is they all start off with crabmeat. A recipe is really only a single moment in time, and no recipe can ever be prepared the exact way every time! I just don't believe in taking perfectly good \"backfin\" crab meat, and “flaking it!”"

With the understanding that these are *not* what you're going to find in a Baltimore restaurant, they are nevertheless super tasty and a cinch to make. Another reviewer has condemned the pancake mix as altering the flavor and texture one would expect from a crabcake. That is true, but I think the crab still stands out, and I'm looking forward to making this recipe a lot. I've also prepared this recipe as crab bites, to good effect."

Flavor wise it was very bland, even using a slightly stronger polish mustard, a touch of Worcestershire, a good shake of Nature's Seasonings and an extra tablespoon of freshly chopped parsley. Rather than frying, I baked the cakes at 375 for about 25 minutes. They were good, but not outstanding."

I did not fry the cakes, though; I sauteed them in a little olive oil. I wanted a crispy texture, so I patted some panko crumbs on the outside before I put them in the pan. I had no yellow mustard, but Dijon worked fine. I added about a teaspoon of Sriracha and served them with a spicy remoulade. I'll be making these again!"

"reviewBody": "I was simply disappointed with this recipe. My heart just broke. I've had many a crab cake. And this one had less breading to the recipe that I was tickled pink about. While mixing the ingredients prior to frying, the flavor was rather descent. 1st off...3 cups of oil to fry in?? I couldn't believe that. It was way too much, I tried with 1 cup and when I put in the 1st one...it spread and broke apart all over the pan. It wouldn't hold it's shape at all in that much oil. So I cleaned up the mess and tried again by cutting the oil down to 1/2 cup in my frying pan and used an ice cream scooper to portion out each patty...it worked better as I didn't spread each all the way until I saw I was getting a nice color on the bottom and they were staying together better. While they looked beautiful...they ended up loosing the flavors all together. Totally and utterly flavorless. I'm still totally shocked. The only way my family would eat them was to whip up some Garlic Dill Aioli and spread over the top to add flavor. As is, I won't be making these again. Sorry, and to think I don't ever remember Maryland Crab cakes like this. Somethings a miss here."
