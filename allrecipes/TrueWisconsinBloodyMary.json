I live in Milwaukee and to anyone who lives here- you can't visit the city without going to Cafe Benelux in the third ward area and try their \"Stinkin Rose\" bloody Mary. Mix is made from scratch. Uses fermented vodka, garnished with beef stick (made in Wisconsin of course), shrimp, pickled green beans, cheese, olives. I do however like how simple this recipe is if you don't have a lot of time to make your mix from fresh tomatoes."

Will definately try olive juice though. Maybe it is a Wisconsin thing, but I always love Clamato the best. :o) If you like a very thick V8 style bloody mary, this is probably not for you though. I added slightly less hot sauce the second time, because I found it to be a bit spicey for my taste. If you do not like them very spicey add the hot sauce to taste. We are having bloody marys this weekend, so my husband wanted me to make pitchers of this recipe for everyone! I will use this recipe over and over! Enjoy!"
