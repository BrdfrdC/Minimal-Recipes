I read every review, every \"tweak\" and first time followed the real written directions. If you have enough cooking history: you know that tuna is much more dense, would follow the mixing directions and then add the can of peas. The recipe is perfect except we need to remember this came from our ancestors/WWII so they used real mayonnaise and then added salt. Made recipe spot on...tweaked mayo to 1/2 cup and salt to taste.

"reviewBody": "My can of tuna was only 5 oz, so I scaled down the amounts of the ingredients to my preference. I used frozen peas, and it seems many reviewers also preferred those. I just microwaved them for 20-30 seconds to soften a bit. I gave it a few shakes of lemon juice; it seems to freshen certain fish dishes. I also added a little chopped red onion, which others did. I wanted this for lunch, so mine was not cold. It will be much better after it is chilled. Thanks for this very easy, different and delicious recipe!"

Mine had a lot of peas in it - like the picture. Also threw in some real bacon bits that I had on hand and plenty of onion and garlic powder. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this, especially on whole grain toast. Thanks for the tuna salad breakthrough!"

This is a great recipe/idea though. The peas really add something nice and a good change of pace from the standard celery in tuna salad! :)"

"reviewBody": "I did enjoy this, but, I would think a can of peas to one can of tuna would be too much. I used about 1/2 C of frozen peas instead. It's a great way to add a veggie in. If I had added a tsp of black pepper I would never have been able to eat this. I am not a black pepper fan. I did put a few shakes in, though. I was almost leary of adding a whole teaspoon of garlic powder, but, I did add it. I really like garlic/garlic powder and use it quite a bit. I didn't really taste it all that much while I ate it but there was a bad aftertaste. I'll only add 1/2 tsp next time. I will make this again. P.S. I just noticed this recipe is for 6 people!?!? LOL! I ate the whole thing!"
