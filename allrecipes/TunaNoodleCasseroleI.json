I Also did half milk and the other half was half &amp; half. lol I tasted the sauce before adding it to the other ingredients and found it to be bland, so I added a few good shakes of oNion powder, some pepper, and a little Italian seasoning. After putting it into casserole dish, I topped it with about 1/3c Italian fine breadcrumbs, it was pretty good! I chose this recipe bc my hubby hates mushroom soup which many recipes call for."

Makes a WORLD of difference. \n- 2 tsp. minced garlic\n- maybe a tsp of cayenne pepper. or a can of diced green chiles. \n\nI followed the instructions otherwise, beside doubling everything for the sauce. Used frozen peas - stuck to the prescribed amount. Doubled the tuna., and it turned out awesome. Thanks for recipe!"

I roasted a head of broccoli, half red onion, &amp; 5 cloves of garlic, w olive oil, garlic powder, s&amp;p. I also used a couple lil dashes offer pepper flakes. After roasting I put all of it in the mix too. I used a bag of frozen organic peas. &amp; a mix of Noddles I had on hand. I used a big can of albacore tuna. Did it all in the same cast iron skillet. Doing it this way does take much longer to prep. But it makes a lot. It was delish! The whole familiar loved it! This was my first attempt to do this dairy free &amp; it was just as good as the original. I will defiantly make it often."

I did not have many of the ingredients so I subbed penne for noodles, Monterey jack for cheddar, frozen peas for canned &amp; seasoned bread crumbs for chips. Based on others' reviews, I increased butter &amp; flour to 3T each and used 1-1/2 c of milk. I added 1 t. oregano and a hefty sprinkle of garlic powder. I also sauteed 1 chopped celery rib, 1/4 c. red onion and 2 chopped mushroom and added those. So I basically transformed the recipe but it was very good and would be tasty with cooked chicken instead if tuna and any cooked veggies mixed in."

The second time however, I couldn't find the mix, so I used french onion soup instead of the milk. I added a bit of thyme and red wine, doubled the sauce mixture and the tuna. I also used more cheese because my DH and I both are cheese lovers:) it comes out delicious every time!!"

I personally like more flavor, so I added 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp of ground mustard, 1/4 tsp ground black pepper, a dash of cayenne, and 1 tsp of dried chopped onion. I put panko on top as well, and as another reviewer said, I thinned out the sauce a bit with some reserved pasta water. Thanks :)"

Also, I add shredded cheddar and mozzarella along with breadcrumbs (seasoned with pepper and onion powder) to the top before I bake, to give it a nice, crispy crust. \n\nI also tried this second time with homemade noodles (feeling frisky, I guess) -- YUMMMM!!!\n\nOverall, though, very good and easy recipe."

I also added some pepper, celery seed, and oregano because the sauce was bland and threw in a bag of frozen carrots, celery, and onion. It was delicious! Leftovers were yummy too, and I liked that were was no crumb topping to get soggy. Will definitely be making again!"

Instead of plain milk, I first mixed it with a vegetable dip mix (like Simply Organic's Creamy Dill, Ranch or French Onion) before adding to the sauce pan. I omitted salt since the dip and cheese had plenty of sodium. I also doubled this sauce mixture to prevent the drying out of the tuna casserole when it is baking in the oven. In addition, I doubled the tuna and also added chopped onion and celery. It was fabulous!"

To keep it creamy I added a big scoop of plain greek yogurt. Wheat noodles added some fiber, and since people were complaining of dryness I added some vegetable broth to the sauce. \n\nI also sprinkled crushed Saltines to the top to give a little crunch.

I also added some lightly steamed broccoli. In place of the egg noodles, I used whole wheat bow-tie pasta. I covered it in the oven for the first 10 minutes, than added Panko bread crumbs tossed with a little butter and left it uncovered for the rest. I used the broiler at the end to deepen the top crust. The husband loved it, and I'm happy that there was plenty for leftovers later in this busy week. This recipe is a good base, and I'm looking forward to varying the spices and vegetables in the future."

"reviewBody": "Four stars! This recipe is a good starting point, something to tinker with different ingredients like veggies and seasonings. The sauce is very much like what you would use in a from-scratch mac and cheese, and worked well. I used some cooked elbow macaroni I had on hand instead of the egg noodles so mine was very much like a mac-n-cheese dish, but the egg noodles would be great. Honestly, I just eyeballed how much cooked noodles to use for how much sauce I made so I can't really comment on the noodle-to-sauce ratio in the recipe. I doubled the sauce as others suggested, but for the small can of tuna I use that was excessive. The sauce was bland, so I had to kick it up a notch with some spices. May fave was hot sauce. I aso used cooked frozen carrots and peas instead of the can. My kids were so hungry I didn't put mine in the oven, but it reheated great in the oven for lunch the next day so the step isn't totally useless. Overall, a keeper. Thanks Cat!"
