"reviewBody": "My mom made tuna noodle casserole when I was growing up in the 1960’s &amp; 1970’s, but never baked it in the oven. She would prepare it all in a large saucepan.\n\nI cook now for just my husband &amp; I since our 3 sons are adults, married &amp; with children. So I cut the recipe in half. \n\nTo avoid using 3 pans, I boiled the noodles (I use No Yolks brand), drained then mixed in soup, tuna, milk, black pepper, onion powder &amp; garlic powder. I used some shredded cheddar cheese between the two layer of noodle mixture. Instead of using potato chips, I melted butter &amp; stirred in panko bread crumbs &amp; sprinkled over casserole. \n\nCovered with aluminum foil &amp; baked for 15 minutes, uncovered &amp; baked for another 15 minutes. The casserole was somewhat bland. Next time I’ll use 2 - 5 oz. cans of tuna, 1-1/2 to 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, more milk, a bit of salt, more black pepper, onion &amp; garlic powder.\n\nMy husband does not like cream of celery soup &amp; I don’t care for vegetables in this casserole.\n\nThank you Chris for the recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This is the recipe for tuna noodle casserole that I made 50 years ago with my mom and that I make for my daughter and her family. Usually will switch out sliced cheese for shredded cheddar and if I ever have some other kind of shredded cheese from another recipe--I'll throw that in as a bonus--last night had about 2 Tblsp of fresh shredded Parmesan, and a little bit or Mexican Blend and they went in, as well as a bit of extra Cheddar. occasionally will get government cheese from friends who visit food bank and that cheese cubed also works well. Only thing I don't do nor did my mom. . .is to heat the soups, milk, and tuna together--I just add 5 minutes to bake time. So glad I found this one. \n You have heard of dump cakes cause I call this my Tuna Noodle Dump recipe--If I find dribs and drabs of cottage cheese, I'll add the rest of that. . . sour cream. . .same thing. If I'm out of potato chips I'll crush some Doritos. . . crushed though only a handful. . .I added Tabasco sauce once for my son-in-law and granddaughter who favor spicier things. Sometimes I add a tsp of ground mustard, sometimes garlic--this recipe should be viewed by the creative cook as a jumping off place. But don't forget that recipes rely on ratios so if you add sour cream, mushroom juice from canned mushrooms, cottage cheese. plain yogurt, real cream etc. that you need to make adjustments in other fluid added (milk). Once used same recipe for a quick Chicken casserole by substituting about 1.5"

I use a box of kraft mac and cheese, cream of mushroom, salt, pepper, (for my family that loves left over casserole) I use two large cans of tuna and two large cans of soup. Plus I add a cup of shredded cheese; whatever kind you like, we like it cheesy, and a can of peas drained and add last so they don't get mashed, then 10 minutes before its done add the crushed potatoe chips or what ever you have on hand. I have used crushed croutons, saltine crackers, ritz crackers,etc. Play with it and you will find the flavor you like. Just remember that when using potatoe chips be easy with the salt because like someone else said you can always add not take it out.\nGood luck and have fun with this. This is also a good recipe to start out teaching you kids to cook. I learned this in high school during Home Economics class."

It was pretty bland, and I think without those additions it would have been even worse. If you think you'll have leftovers, add the potato chips to the portions that you'll eat now - as someone else mentioned, they get soggy and gross in the fridge."

Also it would taste a lot better if you added cooked onion, mushrooms, broccoli or peas, and some more spices. The cheese should be doubled as well. The chips on top are nice though."

I am so glad I used this recipe!\nI did add an extra can of cream of mushroom soup because I read a few of the reviews first that suggested that. I'm glad I added it because it might have been too dry had I not. I used an 8 ounce package of shredded sharp cheddar instead of the cheese slices. And since I didn't have any garlic I used garlic powder. \nIt turned out great! I also didn't have potato chips so we didn't do that part of the recipe but I would like to try that next time because I'm sure it adds to it. \nWill definitely be making this again!"
