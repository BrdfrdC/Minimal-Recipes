I added some dried dill and a dash of Worcestershire sauce to the bechamel. When I saw a review that indicated it was dry, I decided to include the water from each can of tuna. There’s a lot of flavour in that liquid so no sense discarding it. This was plenty moist and flavourful. Great comfort food recipe. Thanks to the original poster for sharing it."

I would consider a more flavorful way would be to make the egg noodles the night before, use fresh garden peas and try a small 6 to 8 oz (sized according to portions) fresh tuna steak. That's what I would call from scratch. :-)The flavors really pop with the freshest ingredients."

I add a few diced carrots in with the other veggies and saute them together, mushrooms, I use shallots and celery and English peas. I also add at least a cup of sour cream and blend it after I make a surry with mile and flour. I just love tuna casserole and thought it might be nice with some Gulf Shrimp added in too. Just a thought!"

"reviewBody": "I have to use 2 frying pans plus a microwave safe dish and a casserole dish and a saucepan for the noodles? That's a lot of pan washing afterward. I can eliminate one frying pan and make the sauce on top of the sauteed onions etc. and if the pan is deep enough and oven safe, dump the cooked noodles in and bake the whole thing. I only make half a recipe anyway for the 2 of us. I use a Pyrex measuring cup to melt the butter and stir the crumbs right into it after melting. And the video shows draining the tuna in a sieve. Uh-uh - I just squeeze the top of the can down on top after opening it, over the sink of course, and drain out most of the juice that way. I'm all for the less cleanup, the better."

And I used fake cheese (Parmela Creamery plant-based mozzarella). It was quite good if a bit dry; next time I'll use a lot more soy milk and switch to olive oil."

I first did the sauce as for 8 Servings, instead of 6 (this, to me, gave the creaminess that I wanted) and all other ingredients, I used the measurements for 6 Servings. I added about 1/4 tsp of Nutmeg, sprinkled Herbes de Provence, added lightly premixed dried, garlic, onion, black pepper &amp; salt (I did have to add extra salt, I tasted the sauce as I was putting this in because I didn't want it too salty). I also added peas &amp; carrorts (I had a frozed bag of the mix but I didn't put a lot of it...just enough to give it some beautiful colors to the dish). After putting the dish together, I topped it with the bread crumbs, but added panko crumbs for a little crunch. And as for the cheese, I also added a sprinkle of sharp &amp; also mozzarella.\nThis came out: UH-MAZING!!! My Husband &amp; I loved it &amp; it's DEFINITELY a Keeper!! Thank u for the recipe!!"

I added a can of chopped green chilies, reduced the cheese and skipped the mushrooms for two kid eaters. Everyone devoured second helpings. Thanks for this delicious dish. I'll be making again very soon."

It came out very well, and my wife and I both love it.\n\nMy only problem was that the recipe underestimated by asking for a \"medium baking dish\"... by the time I got through putting everything together, the onion/veggie mix, the mushrooms, the tuna, and the noodles, I had enough stuff to fill a 13x9 pyrex dish. That's not a complaint; we've gotten 3 dinners for 2 out of this recipe. I also think it's a bit under seasoned, so I'll be increasing the salt/pepper, maybe a little cajun seasoning. Great recipe; we're keeping this one."

I chopped up the mushrooms versus slicing them and added a pinch of onion powder and parsley to the mushroom mixture. Instead of breadcrumbs I crumbled potato chips on top (I just prefer them over the breadcrumbs) adds a little more crunch. My husband loved it and said it was the best he had ever had. I will totally make this again and again. Thank you for an awesome recipe."

Halfway through he asked what the green things were. He figured it out that they were peas (and he doesn’t like peas) but he continued to eat them. I had orecchiette pasta on hand that I used.

I double the tuna and I add chicken bouillon for salt. I added bread crumbs then shredded Italian three cheese blend. When it’s close to done I add Trader Joe’s fried onions ( french’s onions tend to be too salty) I agree with another person I am tired of canned soup this and canned soup that recipes. Oh for those with kids who “hate” mushrooms I use a stick blender to make it creamier."

I also used home made type noodles but I weighed them out so that turned out to be the right amount. ALso when I combined the sauce with the vegies I added about 1/3 of an 8 oz. package of cream cheese and let it melt and combined it with the sauce. When I put the noodles and peas in and covered it with cheese I just let it sit covered on a very low heat while I got the rest of dinner ready. It was perfect."

If you purchase precut onions, use about 1/2 a cup. \n\nI made my own breadcrumbs by adding 2 slices of sourdough bread to a food processor and grinding them up to get course crumbs. Toss that with the melted butter, and it gives you a nice crunchy topping. What I did do different was sprinkle the cheese on top first, and then add the breadcrumbs."
