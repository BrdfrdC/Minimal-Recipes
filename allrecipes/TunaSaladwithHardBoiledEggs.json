"reviewBody": "This turned out pretty good. The yolks of the eggs getting stirred in and broken down make this a very creamy tuna salad. I did make one substitution out of personal preference and that was with the Miracle Whip. I grew up on it and didn't have real mayo until I was adult. I never went back. It's just too sweet for me. This recipe will work great for whichever you prefer."
