"reviewBody": "I was very excited to try this recipe as pork sausage and I don’t agree all that well. I’m pleased to say, it was a great experience and the sausage was so tasty and aromatic! I left it mixed together in the fridge overnight to let the flavors permeate and it really added to it. I adjusted the salt and pepper amounts per another user’s suggestions, reducing them by 1/2 a teaspoon. I don’t like to change up recipes the first time I make them so I can enjoy them as they are. They cooked up great, had good texture, and were delicious. My only complaint is the salt content. Even after reducing the salt amount by 1/2 a teaspoon, I couldn’t eat much. This is not to say that the recipe was badly directed with the salt content! I think there are lots of people who would be very happy with it. My household and I are just particularly sensitive to salt content, which is why I’m not detracting from the rating at all. It’s simply personal taste at play. I’m excited to make this again, but with a bit less salt! :)"

Otherwise, quite good, especially when served crumbled and mixed with eggs or in a tortilla served like a wrap with lettuce, tomatoes, green pepper, guacamole and sour cream - a well stuffed wrap!"

I gave up beef and (sadly) pork, but there are things I really miss like breakfast sausage. This does it for me. I didn’t have marjoram, so made do without, but I can only imagine how much better it’ll be next time when I add it. A few reviewers said it was little dry, so I added a dose of Olive oil, and I took the advice of another reviewer and did not buy lean turkey. I will definitely be making this again."

The results were outstanding and we now have a very easy and affordable recipe to create organic breakfast sausage!! It saved my sausage and cornbread stuffing recipe for Thanksgiving and the whole family wanted the recipe to make their own from now on as well!! So excited to have found this. The fresh herbs made the sausage absolutely delicious. Added just a little bit more (i.e. 2 teaspoons instead of 1-1/2, or 1 teaspoon instead of 1/2)."

It takes away the dryness, adds some great flavor, and still works for a Paleo or Whole 30 diet (minus the sugar). Yum!"

I double up the seasoning , except the sage, I add only 1 tbs. I make large patties and put them in parchement paper in the freezer, take out just few as needed. Thanks so much for sharing this one, my family and friends love it. AND I eat it for breakfast everyday...slice of garden tomato and large green leaf lettuce, perfect low carb high protien breakfast!"

I have thrown so much money at the store bought turkey sausages. No more! I made it from five pounds of turkey and doubled the spices. Still had to up them a bit as I like more spices. After that I could taste the store bought taste that I like.I am good for a month now.One question though, I froze the patties and when reheated they are a bit on the dry side.Is there anything I can add to combat dryness. Bye bye to buying turkey sausages. I will make my own now, Great Recipe."

I will never buy store brought again. Thank you for submitting this recipe.\n\nFor those who mentione dry patties, check to see if your turkey is 85/15. If you buy ground turkey any leaner than that it may fry up on the dry side, because there is less fat (96/4). Hope this helps."

I make sausage sandwiches for a weekend breakfast and we both think they are just as good as any naughty, fatty pork sausage you could have. Better since we don't have to feel guilty! I usually don't have marjoram on hand bot make them without and never miss it. I do go slightly heavy on the other seasonings but not much. I just usually add a tad more sage &amp; thyme. We LOVE these. Start with naturally low fat ground turkey and still feel like you're really splurging."

I wanted to make it so badly but didn't have any sage; used poultry season instead, left out the salt altogether and added Truvia Baking Blend brown sugar. What the brown sugar adds is not only a tiny bit of sweetness but the nice crispy brown that you get when you fry it. I'm going to let it sit overnight, but I fried up a little one and it was delicious. I'm so glad you posted this."
