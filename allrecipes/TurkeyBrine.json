"reviewBody": "I brined for 36 hours using a 20 Lb farm raised turkey. It made a perfect turkey and prevented it from being too dry even after the white meat reached around 190 degrees. (Even at 325, the turkey cooked half an hour faster than it was supposed to.) I followed the brine recipe as closely as I could. I used a mix of broths, because that's what I had. Adding half a cup of brown sugar didn't change the brine much. However, I had to make my own savory, and savory recipes vary. This particular savory recipe had cloves and allspice and not enough garlic. The leftovers and the soup had a hint of clove and allspice flavor, as a result. However, everyone loved the turkey, and they absolutely raved about the gravy, so I give this recipe a five star rating."

I follow exactly as posted but have found that putting the turkey in a turkey bag (there is always 2 in a box- use the second one for cooking the bird) with the brine and squeeze out the air and close with the tie works really well. Placing the bag in the deep turkey pan also makes it easy to store in the fridge. For baking the turkey, pat dry turkey lightly and rub with butter. In the second bag, put 1/4 c flour and shake bag, place turkey breast side down. Put several stocks of celery chopped and one large onion, peeled and sliced in bag. Close up and seal with tie. Put a few cuts in the bag and a meat thermometer. An 18 pound turkey took 2h30min at 350 degrees."

I’m back for a second year with high hopes for the same results. I could not find Savory last year, but I’m on the hunt for it this year. I use a brining bag in a cooler and leave it on my deck overnight, 12+ hours. I do not stuff the bird. Last year I had a 17lb bird - cooked at 350, placed tin foil over the breast for the first 2 hrs and I did not baste at all. It reached 165 degrees in 2.5 hours."

I freaked thinking I overcooked it! Took it out, and the cavity had 2 cups of pink fluid in the cavity (Thank God I didn't stuff it!). I sucked out the fluid and put it back in for an hour. Still, whatever liquid was left never dried out and it was still pink. And yes, it was completely thawed! \n\nI ended up taking it out and carving it in the kitchen, leaving the cavity untouched as best I could. The meat was OK, but definitely not as moist as it could have been."

"reviewBody": "Roasted my first turkey this year and this simple brine helped make it a huge hit for my quarantine Friendsgiving! So much flavor and easy enough that I'll definitely be doing it again for future occasions. For a 12.5lb bird, I used about half as much vegetable broth and water but kept the herb measurements the same. Also, because I used a frozen butterball (they're injected with a saline solution that I hadn't known about before purchasing) only 1/2 cup of salt and low sodium broth was used which kept it from getting too salty. I did add some bay leaves and minced garlic since we didn't have any savory on hand which rounded out the flavor nicely. If you're using freezer bags for the actual brining process, I would recommend double bagging it. Our turkey + brine was able to fit in an extra large (2.5 gallon) ziplock but the first bag sprung a leak that could have been a disaster if it hadn't been discovered early on. Double bagging it and putting it in a baking pan kept it safely in place as it sat in the fridge overnight."

I doubled the recipe and used 1 gallon of vegetable juice and 1 gallon of apple juice. I didn’t have the savory because I couldn’t find it. I let it brine for almost 24 hours. When I took it out I dried it then put it in the fridge. My son decided to try something he saw on TikTok and put butter under the skin. These two things made for the juiciest and most flavorful turkey, EVER!! To top it all off, my 20 lb turkey was fully cooked in 2 hours!!! I will never go back to the old way of roasting a turkey!"

I may be missing out on something but even with that omitted it makes the most tender juicy bird I’ve ever had! I didn’t have a large refrigerator so I opted for using a cooler. I put my turkey in a turkey roasting bag, placed it in the cooler, added the brine, tied up the bag tight add ice all around and close the lid for at least 24 hours. After rinsing, slather the bird with cold butter and pepper. Add some onion, celery, half of an orange and half an apple inside the bird and the magic starts. Definitely check temps because of it cooking faster than your average turkey. Yummy!"

"reviewBody": "This was my first time EVER making a turkey. I scoured the internet for brining recipes and most of called for either brown sugar or apple juice. I don’t care for sweet meat, I prefer savory, so I was super excited to find this recipe. I read the reviews and followed several tips. \n\nFirst off, my turkey was 23 lbs. I used fresh herbs (excluding savory as I had no idea what that was). I used the entire gallon of veggie broth, but cut the salt back to 3/4 cup. I added in 2 largely chopped sweet onions, peppercorns, 9 cloves of garlic, and the gallon of ice water. I let the turkey marinate in a large bucket I’m the fridge for 24 hours.\n\nTo cook it, I preheated the oven to 325 degrees, started the turkey off breast down. After two hours, I flipped the turkey and cooked for another hour. By then it had reached an internal temp of 180 degrees (it only needs to be 165, but the turkey was still super juicy even with slightly over cooking). I then cranked up the heat to 400 degrees, basted the turkey with butter, and cooked another 15 minutes. It turned out perfectly Golden. The turkey was so flavorful and moist!! I’m not a turkey fan, but this was delicious!! My entire family loved it, including my super picky eaters!! \n\nThis recipe is an absolute repeat!!! I might even try it on chicken for regular weeknight dinners. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"

Most Helpful hint: For the salt, 1 cup of sea salt (or table salt) is equal to 1 1/4 cups of Morten's Kosher OR 3/4 cup of Diamond Crystal Kosher. In addition to the stated herbs, I add a T of Whole Peppercorns and a T of Allspice Berries. Sometimes I swap out 3 times the herbs fresh instead of dried. 2019 version also had some leek tops and parsley stems. Basically, use up those trimmed vege bits and throw them into the brine pot too :)"

Even after rinsing the brine prior to cooking, the meat was quite salty, although delicious and juicy. Will try again for the actual holiday using either no salt, or getting low-sodium broth. The comment about cooking faster held true: I used a baking bag for the turkey, and rubbed the skin with butter prior to placing in the bag. The turkey registered 300 degrees after 2.5 hours, so my guess is a 12-pound, brined turkey actually takes about 2 hours when using a bag to cook."
