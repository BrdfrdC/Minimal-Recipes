I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed so I cooked it a little longer. After it had simmered for 20 minutes it was looking too thick so I added another 14 oz of tomatoes and 1/2 cup of sauce. I cooked 16 oz of pasta but I only used 1/2 , I'll made pasta salad with the other half. After tasting it I decided to omit the sugar as it was already sweet enough.

I doubled the amount of diced tomatoes to 28 ounces (1 large can) and added mushrooms and black olives. Even better the next day!"

Swap out the ground turkey with ground beef and I'm ten years old again, eating my Mom's goulash in our country kitchen. NOTE: I doubled the recipe but left the amount of pasta the same--if using the recipe as written, halve the pasta or the dish will be wayyyy too dry. Also, slightly undercook the pasta and let it simmer in the dish for fifteen or twenty minutes, so it absorbs some of the tasty liquid."

So I made it like the recipe said, then I doubled the tomato sauce because it looked like it was too much pasta. Still added a 3rd can of tomato sauce and another can of Diced tomatoes. After I did that, the dish looked amazing and tasted great!! So I ended up using 3 cups of tomato sauce (24 ounces) and 28 ounces of Stewed diced tomatoes with seasonings of Basil, garlic and oregano. This is a must try recipe."

I cooked a small onion and a half with the garlic called for and then added 1.28 lbs. of lean ground turkey and browned it. I then added a can of 28 oz. of diced tomatoes (which had garlic, basil and oregano added to it), 3 cups of tomato sauce, a good pinch or two of oregano, a dash of chili powder, salt, a touch more basil than called for in recipe, a sprinkle of red pepper and a good pinch of emeril's all purpose (essence..i think) spice. By accident I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar rather than 2 teaspoons. I then simmered it on cooktop for at least 45 minutes (hubby was late) and served it over a full 16 oz. package of bow tie pasta. Thanks so much for a great recipe. We all loved it."

I used whole grain rotini pasta which really captures the sauce and it tasted great. I also added a little bit of tomato paste and more spices (oregano, paprika, and salt and pepper to taste). My two-year-old liked this so I think it is well worth tweaking to suit our own tastes. Thanks for the recipe!"

I used a full 15 oz. can of tomato sauce, a full 28 oz. can of stewed, diced tomatoes and less pasta than called for (a 13oz. box of higher fiber rotini pasta) and it was still too much. I futzed around with additional garlic, some dried oregano, more basil, no sugar but next time will try adding an extra can of tomato sauce, frozen corn, olives, etc. It's a great way to stretch a pound of ground turkey. I'll make it again."

I use half the pasta and top with a dolop of sour cream. ////This was good but I agree with other reviews, there is was too much pasta. I left out about a 1/4 of my pasta but I wish had left out 1/2. I added additional Italian seasoning. It's pretty basic but good. A good dish for kids, too!"

I hate spaghetti sauce so I made a white sauce and added 1 cup of spaghetti sauce to it. It made the sauce lighter in taste. I also browned the garlic and cooked it with the ground turkey. I also added some Italian seasoning, salt pepper to it. The kids love it. I also double the recipe and put half of it in the freezer for a quick meal when it is needed."
