I am an absolute cheese lover, and even though there is not a lot of cheese in this recipe; I love it more than any nachos I have ever had. All the fresh ingredients come together so well. This dish is highly recommended. It tastes BETTER than any Mexican Restaurant dish I've ever had!!"

The first time i made this it turned out okay but a little dry because of the chips at the bottom, so the second time I made it as a nacho dip and it was delicious. Great recipe!"

To the meat mixture, I also sautéed 1/2 diced white onion, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, cumin, kosher salt, 1 diced Serrano pepper, &amp; 1 chopped green bell pepper. To the nachos, I added 1/2 diced white onion &amp; 1 diced jalapeño pepper. We also did the beans on the side (which were great - used green onions instead of chives) along with a side bowl of salsa. I omitted the olives &amp; green onions on the nachos. Thanks!"

Without warning my husband invites a friend over for dinner that night. I had no time to switch meals. I was a little nervous about serving something I had never tasted to a guest but all the worry melted away when I pulled it out of the oven. The guys had seconds and thirds! Whew! We loved it and I will definately make this again. Sour cream and salsa really add too."

"reviewBody": "This is so good in a not-quite-so-bad for you comfort food way. I didn't have any chives, green onions or fresh tomatoes, so instead I mixed around a 1/2 cup of medium salsa in with the fat-free refried beans when I microwaved them and then left out the hot sauce. Instead of pkgd. taco seasoning, I used the Taco Seasoning I recipe on this site which is a 1000x better. However, I did not add the ingredients to the seasoning that were already called for in this recipe (like chili flakes and pepper). I left out the olives because I don't like them. Not having to chop anything up saved about 10 minutes on the total time, and I even grated my own cheese while the beans were heating up. I will definitely make this again."
