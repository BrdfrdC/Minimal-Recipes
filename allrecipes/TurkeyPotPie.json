"reviewBody": "Thank you Linda for a great recipe. I love it when people put themselves out there and share a recipe and we get to read how others interpreted it. What a great resource.\nI did some 'adjusting' if you will. First off, how can you mince onions and not add a couple of cloves of garlic! I went for the 6 minute pre-cook of the bottom shell and was quickly reminded of pastry 101, it shrinks! So if you do pre-cook the shell, don't trim off all the edges until you fill it with the goodies.\nThere were a few comments on it being bland. Once again, cooking 101, taste for seasoning throughout the process! I increased the oregano and pepper and snuck in a generous 'sprinkle' of poultry seasoning. To up the saltiness I used Costco's Better than Bouillon and sprinkled a little grated Parmesan cheese on top before adding the top shell. To get a good thick sauce I used my flour shaker over the veggie mix as it was softening. That with the flour in the turkey (at least 2 cups worth!) did the trick. Next time I might use a bit more milk.\nIt was great yesterday and I have to imagine it will be even better the day after"

The secret is to make the final mixture thick enough before adding it to the pie crust. You want it so it takes a few seconds to ooze through a slotted spoon. This will ensure that you don't have a pie that is too runny."

Will definitely be making this again! Will be my go to after every turkey dinner. The only thing I regret is not saving the turkey gravy to serve with it."

It was delicious, my guests raved over it. I actually tripled the recipe because there was so much meat and froze the extra uncooked pies - they cooked perfect at a later time"

The peas were added along with the turkey mixture to the vegetable mixture. Also, the pie crust started to brown after 5 minutes in the oven, so I topped it with foil. Overall, this pot pie was delicious and worth saving."
