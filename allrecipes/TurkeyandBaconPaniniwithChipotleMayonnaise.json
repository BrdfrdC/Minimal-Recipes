"reviewBody": "Bought a panini grill today, and was looking for a recipe that used what I already had on hand. This fit the bill! I didn't want to dirty up two pans. Instead of cooking the bacon in one pan and the veg in another, I cooked the veg in the bacon grease (well, some of it) after the bacon was done. I didn't have chipotle in adobo, so I made the sauce with mayo, sambal oelek and chipotle powder. Pretty good substitute. Also, cutting the onions in slices makes it tough to eat, always pulling out strings when taking a bite. I'll dice the onion next time. Alas I didn't have focaccia, had to make due with plain old rye bread. All in all, this was a great combination of flavors and a nice way to break in the panini grill."

I thought the red onion was a little too strong but my husband liked it. Also to make it easier and because my kids don't like spicy, I added some chipotle hot sauce to the mayo instead of the chipotle in adobo for my husband and I and the kids just got plain mayo. This saves me from buying a whole can of chipotle in adobo and only using a small portion of it. Just used regular bread that I had on hand too."

My hubby and I both LOVED the sandwiches. But last night, I opened up the new package of turkey only to find that it was spoiled from being improperly sealed. So, hubby suggested using tomato slices instead. I built the sandwiches the same way, and added one extra slice of cheese before topping it with the bread, then grilled. They were fantastic, and just as tasty! Just goes to show how versatile these sandwiches can be. Thanks so much for sharing this!! P.S. I use the \"Fantastic Focacia Bread\" recipe on this site for the bread - you can't go wrong."

I used a brick double covered in aluminum foil, got that from Rachel Ray... Since i was making this for 1 person.. myself.. so I cut the ingrediants.. Also since I am on a low fat diet I had to change some of the ingredients. I made my spread from lite mayo , spicy mustard , and mixed sundried tomatoes in with it..mmmmmmmmmmmm delicious.. I use jack cheese .. And since I had just loaf bread.. I used my whole wheat bread ... This sandwich was so good.. Much better than having a plain turkey sandwich."

Deli turkey, leftover rotisserie chicken, provolone or mozzarella...the ingredients can actually be determined by what you have on hand. It's pretty hard to mess this one up!"

I honestly didn't think I was going to like it because of the spinach, but that was one of the best parts. I will definitely make again for the family. One more thing...I don't have a panini grill. I didn't even grill it. I know I made changes and I hate when people rate things based on their changes, but this sandwich could only be a hundred times better if it was grilled and made exactly as written."

I couldn't find any focaccia bread at my bakery so I made my own using Michael's Foccacia Bread (on this site) it was great. I did add more mayo to the chipotle mayo since it was a bit spicy for my tastes. Also I don't have a panini press so I heated up a non stick pan and a cast iron pan, put the sandwich in the non stick pan then placed the hot cast iron pan down on the top and pressed down slightly, using a hot pad. It worked really great. Thanks for the recipe!"
