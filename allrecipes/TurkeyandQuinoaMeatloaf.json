I am not a big vegetable eater however, I used my chopper to chop some carrots and string beans up fine, added them to the onions and garlic before adding them to the turkey. Added them to the turkey and baked. They didn’t change the flavor but an easy way for me to get my veggies. I used about a 1/2 cup of each."

"reviewBody": "I made this with some hesitancy, but we absolutely loved the final result. I had to make some changes based on what we had on hand. I didn't have garlic or onions, so it was essentially turkey, quinoa, cheese (1/2C (60g) - I wanted some, not a lot) and spices. In addition to the recipe, I added quite a bit of onion and garlic powder, a touch of cumin, used one tablespoon of barbecue sauce in place of the hot pepper sauce, and since I didn't have tomato paste, I used one tablespoon of pasta sauce. I also rubbed a thin layer of barbecue sauce on the outside instead of the rub. I was worried the barbecue sauce (Montgomery Inn) would overwhelm, but it didn't. I also cooked the quinoa in water with a chicken bouillon cube, and the one egg was plenty. Shaped it as suggested, plopped it into the center of a 9x13 dish, and 50 minutes later we had an extremely tasty, yet healthy, meatloaf! Thanks so much for the recipe, the quinoa really makes it!"

I have made this exactly according to the recipe with success. This time I couldn't believe I ran out of tomato paste so I had to substitute with tomato sauce (3TBSP) which seemed to work well. I added an extra egg since I felt it might need extra binding. Also, left off the topping and made the mushroom gravy from this website. I used cornstarch to thicken to make it gluten free. My husband was over the moon about this meal!"

"reviewBody": "I have been making this recipe for about one year now. It’s my new go-to. My husband was highly skeptical about the deliciousness of any meatloaf, particularly of the turkey or chicken kind, and laughed at me when I read aloud to him the reviews of other husbands begging for more. He is now a believer and requests this often. He slices and makes it into meatloaf paninis, which he pushes on all of his friends and coworkers. The only changes I make is to use 1 pound of ground white chicken breast, extra garlic, and the following topping: 1/4 cup ketchup, 3 Tbls brown sugar, 1 heaping teaspoon ground mustard, and 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg. This is my grandmother’s piquant sauce recipe and is delicious. I am making this today, and have used date sugar instead of brown sugar. I’m sure it will be as tasty."

"reviewBody": "Delicious! The quinoa gave this a nice hearty texture. I took some liberties with the recipe. Because I only had 1 lb. 85% lean ground turkey, I used a little bit more quinoa and added 3/4 cup chopped sautéed portobello mushrooms. I used red quinoa cooked with with 1/2 beef bone broth and 1/2 water. I subbed ketchup for tomato paste. I cut the salt by about 1/2 since the broth has salt, and omitted the brown sugar and hot sauce. I added chopped fresh rosemary and oregano. I mixed all ingredients together- nothing on top of the meatloaf. The mix was a bit too squishy, so I ended up adding a couple TBS breadcrumbs. I took others’ suggestions and baked them in a muffin tin (I oiled them first and filled 9 spots ), baked for 28 min one side, turned them out onto a cookie sheet, and baked for 3 more minutes. I will definitely make this again!"

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe using ground chicken. I reduced the hot sauce and black pepper. Also, because I made into 5 individual meat loaves, I reduced the cooking time to 40 minutes.\nThese meatloaves had alot of flavor, but did come little bit dry. Also, my family missed the traditional ketchup topping we usually have on a meatloaf."

If you think it's flavorless, I'd look for a different brand of quinoa. \nBone broth or chicken broth adds flavor for cooking the quinoa. \nI did it in muffin tins, and they turned out perfectly with consistency. \nDo the hot sauce as optional, or pay attention to the brand. Different brands have different levels of spice. I personally only to 1/2 the amount of it listed."

I do use it a lot but it takes quite a bit of extra help sometimes. This recipe really hit it! Very flavorful and held together. I didn't even cook it as meatloaf, but used a spoon to dollop into a pan for meatloaf burgers! Just spray your pan down well. As per the tips, I used 2 eggs and added some shredded cheese, but didn't have any quinoa. I used lentils that I softened in vegetable broth. So still got the nutty flavor, plus more protein and fiber. I just had some as a cold sandwich for lunch. Yum! Thank you"

I followed the recipe mostly as written, taking a tip from other reviewers and adding the extra egg. I also made a spur of the moment decision to mince and add a jalapeño for a spicy surprise.
