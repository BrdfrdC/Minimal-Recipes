The flavours were unreal and it was so good to try something new. I made the parsley oil as well but I didn‚Äôt have any green chilli on hand so I used a tiny clove of garlic instead. Definitely worthwhile. Awesome dish. Thanks for sharing."

Absolutely wonderful and a new addition to a short list of all time favorites."

I've found that the secret to a good fool proof poached egg, is to rapidly stir the water into a vortex, then dump the eggs in the middle of the funnel. The spinning motion will keep the egg together while it solidifies, instead of spreading all over the pan."

I improvised as follows: since I didn‚Äôt have fresh dill or Aleppo pepper,? I ground up dill seeds with sea salt, crushed red pepper flakes and tarragon.?? For my flavored butter, I cooked up some Chorizo sausage then added butter, cumin, smoked paprika and fresh asparagus spears to the chorizo drippings. I didn‚Äôt have fresh jalape√±os, so I ground up a little fresh pablamo pepper with the salt and olive oil instead. I put the chorizo around the yogurt. Mmmmm! Chef John was not lying...you need plenty of toastbto get every last drop! The sweet red pepper made a very pleasing contrast to the spicy bites. I can‚Äôt handle a lot of spice, so the avocado also helped calm down the heat for me. I paired it with a lovely glass of white wine."

My only note would be to leave plating until the eggs are cooked and draining on paper towel--otherwise the yogurt and oils kind of coalesce into one circular blob on the plate. Having everything at room temp is pretty crucial to get the flavors to meld, and lines up with how this dish would likely be served traditionally."
