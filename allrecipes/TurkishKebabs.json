"reviewBody": "This recipe turned out great. The marinade gave the beef such good flavor, and the process of cooking under the broiler did a great job of crisping the edges of meat just like you’d get from a real döner vendor. The garlic sauce was also terrific and would be good with other meats and vegetables. We served this on warm flatbread with red cabbage, sliced cucumber, lettuce, tomato, onions, and banana peppers. I do suggest a sprinkle of sumac when serving. This spice gives it a little citrusy flavor and they used it as a topping at our favorite shop in Kaiserslautern. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!"

Made it for myself and a friend and he absolutely loved it and can't wait for me to make it again! Very very delicious! (We filled the pita bread and then nuked it in the microwave for about 15 seconds just to melt the cheese a bit and it honestly was a game changer!"

"reviewBody": "I tried this recipe to break away from the usual and we're absolutely thrilled with it. The flavour of the meat was divine. Pretty easy, too! I hesitated before throwing out the marinade, added a bit more olive oil, then put it in a pot and boiled it for a good 15 or 20 minutes to make it safe to eat, then added about a tsp of sugar and cooked until the onions caramelized. I smeared this on the pita before adding the other ingredients. Wow, just wow. The tzatziki sauce was yummy too, except I only had dried dill weed so I used 1/3 of the amount called for. I will use smaller pitas next time, I think the ones I had were just a bit too big. Thanks for the great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I promise to take a photo next time, because they turned out pretty as well as delicious. Everyone loved these, and that includes a picky-about-trying-new-stuff kid. I sliced the flank steak when it was still partially frozen so I coulld get it very thin (~1/8\" slice), and dried with paper towels right before broiling to get a nice sear. The tzatziki sauce was very good as well. This is a simple meal and results may vary if the ingredients are not high quality. I used Kronoz brand pitas from the regular grocery store and they were very good. I did change one thing, which is I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. You can do this with every recipe so long as it is not going to be cooked. Sour cream is not likely to separate the way yogurt can when heated."

This is a great recipe for tzatziki sauce too, I prepared as written and added a little onion and garlic powders, too. Definitely make ahead to let those flavors meld. Really enjoyed trying your recipe, RACHEY638!"

Our western kebabs are what the first comment describes but that's not the Turkish recipes. I also add tomato, red onion slices, and lettuce with the meat in the pita. Thanks RACHEY for this recipe!"
