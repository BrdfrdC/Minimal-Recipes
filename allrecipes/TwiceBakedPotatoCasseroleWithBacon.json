I think baking the potatoes gives them a fuller/richer flavor, than boiling potatoes or using the hash browns like I have done in the past. This is definitely added to the \"must have for Christmas\" meal list ( I doubled the recipe)"

"reviewBody": "Outstanding! One of the best potato casseroles I've made in years- and easy. To save yourself even more time, you can use pre-cooked bacon and microwave it until it is very crunchy (also gets rid of some of the fat). The combination of flavors was great and can be adjusted to your preferences as far as actual baked potatoes. I mixed fresh chives in mine as opposed to the dry, which I didn't have. The chives came out still retaining some crunch and the taste was wonderful. I really don't understand why this isn't a SIX star recipe!"

"reviewBody": "The ingredients all go very well together, however, I feel there is too much bacon and cheese. I make a similar recipe using leftover mashed potatoes. When I make mashed potatoes for another meal, I double the recipe and save half for \"loaded baked potatoe casserole\". I add a little extra salt and pepper, a heaping tbsp of greek yogurt (sour cream if that's what you have on hand) and place in an 8×8 baking dish, cover with 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese, top with 3 slices of chopped bacon and chives or green part of scallions. I cover with foil and place in a 350 oven until cheese is melted. I then uncover and bake for 5 minutes. This recipe is always a hit and can be put together rather quickly since I'm using leftover potatoes. Even quicker if you have cooked bacon in the fridge as I always have"

Hubby loves onion and real garlic so only change I made was to saute a little chopped onion and about half a teaspoon in the butter as it melted then added them to the potatoes. Can't imagine usint a 9 x 13 pan. I used my largest pyrex casserole from my 24 piece set and had plenty of room. Baked for about 15 minutes while I grilled the ham steak and we had a really great Easter meal. For a lot less than a restaurant. Thanks for such a great recipe. We'll use it often."

I also added a can of diced mild green chilis and some sliced jalapenos on the top layer of cheese, and both of those additions worked well. I think it's better if you mash up the potatoes pretty thoroughly, rather than leaving them chunky. I will make it again."

First, I make sautéed caramelized onions and layer them in the bottom of the 9\"x13\" casserole dish. I also double the bacon and mix half of the bacon into the potato mixture (the other half I put on top of the cheese top as the recipe calls for. Last change is that I also mix green onions into the potato mix. The sautéed onions on the bottom of the dish really adds to the flavor of this great dish. I get regular requests to make this for family gatherings and most people have two helpings."

I used a 5lb bag of russets and scaled the other ingredients up though not in equal proportion as with cheese, bacon and whole milk it's already fat and calorie heavy. Also used additional seasoning as others suggested. Russets didn't whip smoothly no matter what I did. For all the work and cost of cheese and bacon, this was just a potato dish. I have other potato recipes that are more impressive and take less work. The only highlight is I did flash freeze the potato skins for use another day and I'm looking forward to fixing those later."
