I used white lily self rising flour and I'm not sure if that contributed to the taste being more biscuit like. Would make again."

"reviewBody": "These bagels are pretty easy to make. Mine didn't rise like the ones in the other reviews, I may have worked the dough too much. The first batch I did at 280 degrees per the recipe, but I thought the color was too light. I increased the temp to 290 for the next batch and they were lightly browned, could have maybe gone up to 300 degrees. They turned out pretty good with the everything bagel seasoning."

"reviewBody": "These may not taste exactly like bagels, but they do make a delicious breakfast. I was thinking the interior would be soft and crumbly (like a biscuit), but it wasn’t. These delivered a firm “bagel” but weren’t dry at all. I wanted to try the two different methods of shaping. I rolled the first two in a ball and poked my thumb through the middle to get the bagel shape. The last two were made from ropes and shaped in a circle. I should have made my rope shorter so that the hole in the middle would be smaller. This method is actually easiest. I expected the shaping to be labor intensive, but it wasn’t. I would definitely make these again."

"reviewBody": "I really like how easy these were to make! I ended up letting my dough rest for 15 minutes while cleaning the kitchen, then formed my bagels and let them rest again while the air fryer preheated. When I pulled out the bagels from the initial baking they seemed pale and bit underdone, but once they rested and were sliced and toasted they were great! My husband said the final bagels were a bit too salty so I might ease up on the everything bagel seasoning next time, but obviously that can be adjusted to each baker's preference. I definitely could taste a tangy flavor from the greek yogurt but it gave almost a sourdough taste which I think works well. would definitely make these again!"
