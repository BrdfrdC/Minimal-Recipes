Since I was out of MY pre-made crusts, I wanted to try this recipe. I read other reviews and added a few things to the crust; basil, oregano and garlic powder. I also replaced some of the greek yogurt with mayonnaise, which I like to think made the crust less biscuity!"

Most important is use a pizza stone in your oven -heat it at the same time you‚Äôre heating the oven. Once you‚Äôve rolled and formed the pizza dough to the size you want, grab some yellow cornmeal, sprinkle it on your pizza peel. Place your dough on top of the pizza peel, and the dough will easily slide onto your hot pizza stone to parbake. I made a pesto margarita pizza -so delicious!"

One thing to note, I do NOT keep self rising flour on hand so I simply added baking soda and salt to my all purpose flour and viola, instant self rising flour. Will definitely be adding this easy week-night pizza dough into my dinner rotation."

"reviewBody": "I doubled the recipe. I had to add 1/4 cup more of 5% Greek Yogurt to get the dough to come together. I also had to add a bit more flour. I'm guessing a couple of T. of self rising flour. I let the dough rest for about 30 min. covered with a tea towel. I baked the crust for the suggested 7 min. at 500 degrees on a 15 inch pizza stone. I added the sauce, pepperoni, Italian sausage and onion. I then baked the pizza for about 11 more min. The crust was thick. So, if you like thick crust, this pizza dough is for you. I think next time, I will bake the crust for 10 min. Then, I will probably have to babysit the pizza and bake for 7 or more minutes. You can tell the pizza is done when the cheese starts to melt and the pepperoni starts to curl. I might even make 2 pizzas out of the dough."

Another suggestion is to let the dough relax for about 5 minutes before you roll it. I would say that this dough is good for two small pizzas or one 14\" pie. The dough was chewy/dense but really nice. I also see a good calzone or two."

It will seem like too much even with the right amount until it's incorporated, but start with less. The dough had me thinking I was dealing with biscuit dough, but - well - it wasn't. Dough that hadn't risen would be more accurate. I am glad I tried, but have no reason to repeat."

Yeast isn't on the shelves and the yogurt goes quickly, as does butter, milk, cottage cheese. Lots of singles don't have lots of ingredients but oil isn't out if the way as is a big box of baking powder, I may use once a year. Self rising flour, which calls for no baking powder, is the way to go. So is pizza dough made with no yogurt."

And, I had AP flour, so I added baking powder as others have recommended.\n\nDoubled the batch, and kept having to add flour - close to another full \"double\" on just that. Ended up about right. My KA did the initial mixing and then I did the \"why isn't this working?\" troubleshooting on my own muscle.\n\nI took others' suggestions and added Parmesan and garlic powder in the dough. I liked that a lot. My ratios were off in the end, but it was still nice. \n\nI thought I'd have spare dough for breadsticks, but I ended up with two pizzas. And, I figured out why pizza chains (etc) don't add toppings to the very ends - the mozzarella melted and land-slid the pepperonis all over the place (NOT off the pan, thankfully). \n\nWith ALL of that going on, I threw my fates to the winds and just hoped - and when it was all done, my husband said that was my best pizza dough so far. (I dooo have a checkered history with pizza dough, TBH.) The housemate who doesn't like pizza went back for seconds."

"reviewBody": "We have two gluten-free daughters, so I had them make one pizza with GF flour, and one for me and their Dad with regular flour. LOVED THEM, all four of us!! Super simple. The twins were especially impressed because they normally pay big bucks for GF pizza, while this was quick, easy, delicious...and cheap! Anyway, would suggest less sauce and not more, cheese first and veggies or meat on top - both of these suggestions may help the finished pizza be a bit less \"soggy\". However, the girls dressed the pizzas, and they put the mountain of fresh veggies and meat down first, and cheese last. The reverse works better, so that might be the cause of our slightly soggy crust. Will have to try again! Also, though we didn't want to cook them on the bare oven rack, since the dough was fresh, not frozen or \"stiff\", we used a regular cookie sheet ...and I think it would be worth trying with a pizza pan with some holes in it. Or maybe we could have put a layer of cornmeal down on the cookie sheet and that would have helped? That might have given the crust a bit more \"authentic\" a crust. Would also suggest flavoring the crust with a bit of salt, and then adding olive oil and some garlic powder and Italian seasoning after adding the sauce, but before adding the cheese and veggies and meat. A little more flavor to the crust would probably be delicious! I'll try to update this review when we make this again. Thanks for the recipe though - it's def going to be used again and again!"
