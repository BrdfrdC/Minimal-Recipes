Will be interesting to see which way works better."

"reviewBody": "Rating this 5 stars as this is THE good basic Holubchi/cabbage roll recipe that all the personal and family versions and variations start from or build upon. I have been making cabbage rolls most of my life as taught by my Baba and Aunties. Their recipes sometimes added the ground meat or smoked ham or bacon, to the rice, whatever was handy. Now that I am the Baba myself, over the years I have tweaked recipes to suit myself, the kids and my husbands family. Hubby likes this plainer filling version made with sour cabbage leaves, which you can buy at some grocery stores, usually in the fall and winter, or make yourself, and no tomato sauce, just melted butter and water. Most often I just make with the regular (sweet) Green Cabbage. I now always buy heads of cabbage when in season (cheaper and better) and double wrap in plastic and just throw into freezer. When I plan to make a batch of cabbage rolls, I take the heads out and let them thaw in a big bowl or tub for 24 hrs. , then place them in the fridge (keep in bowl or tub as they will leak juices) until ready to use. No need to boil them this way, softer easier to roll leaves, and they bake up more tender and quicker.\nMost often we add finely diced cooked bacon and onions to the rice with some butter and salt and white pepper to taste.\nThe one thing I learned from all the ukrainian and polish women in my family and friends circle is make sure you use the correct rice!! Use a plain short grain rice, unscented unflavored, an"

"reviewBody": "I used this recipe for my second attempt at making cabbage rolls. I prefer small rolls and primarily rice, although I did add a little bacon and some dill to this recipe. The method of cooking the cabbage rolls was brilliant! The weekend before a friend showed me how she made her cabbage rolls and she boiled the whole head in a big pot of water. The cabbage was soggy and too cooked. This method was so easy. I'd just peel off some leaves and carry on rolling while the next leaves were gently steaming. I learned that if you chill the rice it rolls much better, particularly if you have bacon in the mixture. This will be my go to recipe for cabbage rolls from now on."

The key is to keep the filling simple. Not too much ground beef - no more than 50/50 ratio meat to rice. The cabbage and tomatoe sauce (instead of tomotoe juice) provides plenty of flavor without going overboard with the filling. Then, of couse, you must serve with sour cream. YUMMMMM!"

This lacked flavor, and while I did add some things to try and fix this, it didn't do much to correct the problem. Sorry, I just don't think Eastern European food is my thing."
