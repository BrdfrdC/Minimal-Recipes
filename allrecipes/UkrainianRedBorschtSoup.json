I cooked the onion along with the carrots rather than separately in a skillet, and I cooked the cabbage until thoroughly done. It took me twice as long to prep and cook as the recipe indicates."

"reviewBody": "This was the first time I've had borscht and now I see why so many people love it. I can't believe how good it is. I followed this recipe exactly with the following exceptions. One, because the russet potatoes I had were on the small side, I used six of them instead of three. Two, instead of using 8 ounces of tomatoes, I used an entire 14.5 ounce can and I didn't drain it. I dumped the entire can into the pot, liquid and all. I don't think doing this changed the flavor of the borscht very much, if at all. Finally, instead of using 8 cups of water I used 4 cups of water, 2 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of vegetable broth. I highly recommend not skipping the sour cream or the fresh parsley or dill. They add a great deal to the flavor. Also, the recipe says to add salt and pepper to taste. I used 1 teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon of pepper and that worked well for me. I'm going to add this recipe to my list of keepers. This is one of the tastiest dishes I've ever had."

My mom’s handed down to me is different than all those I reviewed at by this or that but the base is beets. Of course my moms is my favorite but I’ll give each of the different recipes a try to see if there’s any tweaking I might do to my own. Enjoy all the creativity. Thank God for our differences otherwise we’d be bland and so would our recipes."

"reviewBody": "This is pretty good. My husband I love this (we met in a Russian history class in Graduate school - hee hee) and we have tried a variety of internet based recipes. Borscht is a peasant soup and it should be easy, so I do cheat and use 1 15 oz can of unsalted sliced beets. (I halved the recipe). I am really lazy about boiling and peeling and grating. I add one stick of celery for flavor and only add about one to two tbs of tomato paste. I add the parsley, brown sugar, salt and pepper about five minutes before finishing and let it summer a bit. Most importantly, in our limited experience, is to make it in the morning of the day you want to eat itand let it sit for a few hours. Get a hearty bread to eat it with. My husband has heart issues so the pork allows me to get away with about 1 tbs of salt for half a stock pot worth of soup."

The addition of an acidic ingredient (tomato) still allowed the beets to shine but removed the heavy, sometimes too earthy taste common to borscht. I have never made borscht with meat before as this soup is generally a vegetarian dish served on December 24. The added sausage raised the notch even higher. My husband, who hates beets (and especially borscht) ate this soup. 'Nuff said."

"reviewBody": "First off, thank you for sharing this recipe. I’ve always wanted to try “real” Ukrainian borscht. I had cooked beets but hadn’t drained them when I cam across this recipe so I used the water that I’d cooked the beets in and added water to make about 7 cups. I peeled and shredded the beets (might've been about 2 cups worth) to add later. I peeled the sausage and chopped it to fry it in the pan. Cooked the onions separately the n added the tomato paste/water combination. I didn’t drain my diced tomatoes but that’s because I can my own with tomato juice and didn’t want to waste that good juice. I added chopped potatoes and shredded carrots to cook and when they were almost cooked I added the already cooked shredded beets and the cabbage. I didn’t have a head of cabbage so I used about 1/2 bag of shredded coleslaw mix. I didn’t add sugar but mostly because I overlooked it and I’m not sure it was needed. Each to their own I suppose. The only ingredient I thought was missing was fresh dill and because I had just bought a bag of super fresh wonderful smelling dill I chopped about a handful of dill. This will be one of my favourite soups ever. It looks so pretty when the sour cream is mixed in. UPDATE: I had a bowlful frozen and just tried it. Put this under the Freezes Beautifully column."

It tasted too much like tomatoes. I made it again without the paste, and shredded only the beets to bring out the color and left the paste out. I liked it much better. I also made it from homemade chicken stock, and added a Tb or 2 of chicken soup base."

Fry the beets then add. add carrots and potatoes, chicken cubed, and chicken broth. You may need to add more chicken broth;then the ketchup. i'll double check the recipe i wrote it down, but its very simple, and its delicious. frying the beets gives them a beautiful shine and adds flavor. very simple Yep that's it. Everyone makes it different."

Two tablespoons of heavy cream when it called for none (highly recommended for extra body/flavor). I added A LOT more sugar than what it called for until it tasted right. Didn't have any parsley so I used a bit of dried basil and FRESH DILL (super good). And I didn't have any quality pork sausage so I fried bacon and crumbled it over the top along with the sour cream as a garnish at the end. I would actually recommend all these changes because the soup turned out to be fantastic. However, in the future, I'd probably increase the carrots a bit and only use 3 beets :)"

"reviewBody": "The only reason to cook the Pork is for the flavour of the frond (meat caramelized) why not do it in the heavy bottomed soup pot? The instructions above throw it away by leaving it in the pan? Seasoned meat, liberally salted and peppered, gives more flavour. De glaze the soup pot with a little red wine, beer or any spirits, or meat or vegetable stock, or diced onion, garlic (celery, fennel bulb, bell pepper, shredded horse or other radish) tomato paste (for Umami) and any of the above liquids. Cook for a few minutes till softened then add your liquid (water or stock).\nParboiling or blanching the cabbage will reduce the flatulent gaseousness of this veg. Don't peel the beets if you're going to shred them especially, you throw away the flavor, color and all the best food value. All the Ukrainians I've known, do not use tomatoes they use a splash of vinegar. The acidity of the tomatoes should hold the rich color of the beets, you can also add some vinegar here to set color and give the soup a little kick. I add a splash of dill pickle juice. Dill fiends will also lace the soup with copious amounts of Dill weed when adding the tomatoes or the last 10-20 minutes of cooking. IMHO"

I also chopped the beets into cubes rather than grating them, since I didn't feel like cleaning up the hot pink kitchen crime scene. As I've never had Borscht before, I cannot comment on authenticity, but this recipe makes a subtle-tasting, delicious, velvety-rich stew. The jewel-toned red color adds a visual that elevates the dish. It's a new favorite. I'll definitely make this again when I have sausage on hand."
