Varied the recipe for 4 servings as follows: 4 oz of fresh squeezed lime juice with pulp instead of the lime concentrate; 4 oz of tequila (used Alacran tequila - tequila blanco, 100% agave and 40% alcohol; any tequila blanco or white tequila will work) instead of 6 oz; increased triple sec Cointreanu from 2 oz to 4 oz; increased unsweetened frozen strawberries from 8 oz to 10 oz; added about 2-3 tablespoons of azucar morena to taste; placed all ingredients in the blender and added crushed ice until it was filled. Thanks for sharing the recipe and reviews!\nvgomezquita"

The only thing I changed was to use fresh strawberries - 3 cups to 1/4 cup sugar - semi froze them and added ALL of them into the blender - which did cut down a bit on the ice...maybe 4+ cups of ice. My Favorite Five (the girls I work with) LOVED them!!! They were so impressed - especially since they know that I have never mixed a drink before in my life....and that has been a long time ;) I mix everything together (except Ice) and freeze. When ready to use I thaw and blend with ice."

The people who did not rate them well need to learn that this is the kind of recipe you tweek to your liking. If you think it has too much alcohol or not enough, change the amount! For my preferences, this margharita was perfect. Also, none of us thought it was too sweet. There's enough techila to tone down the sweetness in the other ingredients. Just play with it. If you are worried about the frozen strawberries with syrup being too sweet, use only 4 oz of them and add either plain frozen or fresh berries. It's not hard people. Don't lower the rating of the recipe by several stars just because all of us have different taste buds."

Because the drink is so fruity, we make a batch w/o tequila for the kids, or pour them some before adding a little less tequila for our drinks. Also, a good orange liqueur will work as a substitute for triple sec."

We crushed up a blender full of ice, poured 1/3 of the mixture in, stirred it and then spooned it into our glasses. Repeated twice throughout the night! HUGE hit! Can't wait to experiment with other flavor combos all summer long!"
