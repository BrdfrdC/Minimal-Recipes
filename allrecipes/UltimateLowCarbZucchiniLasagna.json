It was still delicious but lacked the depth that makes it look so great in the video ;). 2nd time, I used a 7x9 pan but that was deeper and I think the size was perfect. I used a vegetarian\"Beyond Beef\" style beef. Both times the dish was a bit wet at the bottom, but I didn't mind this. And it reheats beautifully--it's even better the 2nd day."

I skipped adding the olive oil, and used only a light coating of cooking spray to the beef skillet. I added about a teaspoon of garlic powder to the meat mixture and a bit of sauce to the baking dish before the first layer of zucchini. To top it off, I added a bit more shredded Parmesan than what is called for. I will definitely make it again. Warning: It’s so good don’t count on six servings. Four is about right."

A bit too cheesy and there was a lot of water in the pan and the zucchini was laid out on paper towels for hours with frequent changing of the towels. Might try substituting some riced and dried cauliflower for some of the cheese."

"reviewBody": "Here's a zucchini trick that's a bit time-consuming but I've decided, after making this delicious recipe a few times, it's worth it. After you slice the zucchini (I use a mandolin), sear the slices on both sides on a hot skillet or griddle. You can see the steam rising and the moisture coming out. It solves the one problem of this recipe which is that it can be watery. The zucchini is much drier after coming off the griddle -- you still might want to pat it with paper towels -- but it makes the lasagne hold up better ."

Do it! I will cook this one again and again.... lovely dish!!!"

However, I make it with a few variations: (1) 93% lean ground turkey instead of beef (2) Classico Tomato &amp; Basil sauce, or their fire-roasted garlic sauce, both fairly low carb but more flavorful (3) the original Recipe is too salty for me. I recommend cutting salt in half, or even no salt in the ricotta mixture (brings out the nutmeg flavors!)"

Some changes I made:\n - use a larger baking pan\n- Chinese zucchini (Jade melon) cause less moisture in the dish than zucchinis \n- add 2 cloves of garlic\n- I used omipork in place of beef to make this vegetarian\n- Substitute ricotta cheese for soft tofu (a healthier and delicious option) \n- add thawed chopped spinach to the \"ricotta\" mixture\n- used 1 tsp dried oregano, 1 tsp basil, 1 tsp parsley"

Also, made sure to use a low carb pasta sauce and more than listed. Husband loved it. Said it is better than regular lasagna."

That was my family's only complaint - a little weepy. Otherwise it was a hit."

"reviewBody": "Pretty much doubled the recipe (used four zukes) so I could use my usual 9\" x 13\" lasagna pan. Also added a tablespoon or so of garlic and some basil and oregano to the sauce, along with a splash of red wine. Carefully used a mandoline to uniformly slice the zukes, which I salted to help release some of their water. The finished dish was absolutely delicious — I think I actually prefer zucchini to lasagna noodles. Definitely will make this again; the only change from what I did this time will be to drain the beef after browning it (and before adding the sauce)."

"reviewBody": "This review is based on the recipe as written. I tried two different slicing methods for the zucchini and settled on the mandolin slicer. This made the noodles a little thicker than I wanted, but they turned out fine. I patted them dry with a paper towel but did not salt them or attempt to cook them prior to use. I did double the recipe so I could feed several people and have leftovers. The overall flavor was excellent. Everyone agreed that the nutmeg has to go. It overpowered the ricotta layer and no one cared for the flavor.\nThis recipe needed to cook much longer than written. I cooked it as written and it wasn't even bubbling. I added 15 minutes covered before it began to bubble. I removed the cover and cooked as written but the cheese didn't brown so I turned the oven to broil to really get the top layer of cheese burnt like we like it.\nI read several reviews that talked about too much water so I cooked the pans of lasagna on a cookie sheet. I only had a slight amount of \"boil over\" and it appears that liquid was grease from the cheese.\nWe allowed the lasagna to rest about 15 minutes prior to cutting and it held its shape when served. This will be added to our recipes with a few minor changes."

Also, did 15 ounces of ricotta, two eggs and Parmesan for that yummy, creamy layer. And rather than jarred sauce I made my own - olive oil in a heated pan, salt, red pepper flakes, 3-4 cloves garlic (sauté for just a minute) then add a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes and simmer. Add the beef/sausage mixture to the sauce and a handful of chopped parsley. Be sure to use a mandolin to slice the zucchini about 3/8” think. Layer it up, bake and enjoy!"

I also used 3 whole zucchinis, did not have any nutmeg, and I used a whole jar of marinara sauce (didn't measure it). Just make it however you normally make lasagna and you will like it!"

"reviewBody": "There were some issues with this recipe from the beginning. When it said to spray an 8-inch baking dish, I realized that there were too many ingredients in the recipe for such a small dish. I used an 11 x 7 inch baking dish, and even that was too small. I should have used my 9 X 13 inch baking dish. The second major fault in this recipe is that the zucchini should have been pre-cooked. The whole dish was full of liquid even after baking for 90 minutes, it overflowed while baking, and what a mess in the oven! I'm sure the liquid came out of the raw zucchinis. I used three small zucchinis rather than 1 1/2 large ones, and I used Italian-seasoned ground turkey instead of ground beef. I had fresh basil, so I added some of that and dried Italian seasoning to the sauce. As I typed this review I just noticed another issue . The \"Cook\" information under the recipe title says to cook the lasagna for 60 minutes. In direction #6 of the recipe it says \"Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and bake until golden, about 15 minutes more.\" Mine baked for an hour before I removed the aluminum foil, and even after 30 more minutes, the cheese on the top had melted, but never became golden. In spite of all the issues, the lasagna tasted great. I will use this recipe again, with the changes I noted, especially pre-cooking the zucchini slices. Some other recipes recommend roasting them in the oven. I will try that next time."
