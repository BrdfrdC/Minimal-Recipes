I doubled the amount of green onions because I know the people eating love them, and I used more of the veggie soup seasoning because the package I bought had more and I couldn’t measure it correctly. I had never made spinach dip before, but I will make it again because everyone raved. I think any future invites to events will be conditional of me agreeing to bring this."

I first tried preparing it with one cup mayo and the quoted amount of sour cream (and no water chestnuts - blecch) but agreed with other reviewers who said it was too mayonnaise-y so I doubled the sour cream and left it at one cup mayo. Through continued experimentation and taste testing, I ended up using a full packet of both dip dry mixes, a heaping handful of fresh bagged spinach, and most of a bunch of green onions (diced, not stalks)."

I put my entire packet in, which is 2oz. I also followed some of the reviews that stated there was too much mayo. But I didn't measure at all. My sour cream was a big 16oz. So I scooped half out and added an extra spoon full, then put 2 large spoon fulls of mayo. I thought it was a perfect consistancy. I also chopped up the water chestnuts to about \"minced\" size. This was absolutely amazing."

I had never made spinach dip before, but made it for a family gathering recently and the entire dip was GONE before dinner even started! Everyone loved the fresh spinach (except my younger sister; she claimed that she liked the consistency of the frozen spinach better.) The only thing I did differently is that I omitted the onion dip. I thought it tasted just as amazing without it. I'm making this again for my daughter's birthday party tomorrow!"
