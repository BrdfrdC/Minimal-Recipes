I did want to add more color so I used a sweet potato diced into small cubes instead of the potato. I love hot sauce but I wanted to try out some chili garlic sauce and it took this recipe next level! Even better, the calories turned out lower than this recipe. This was a awesome idea that I was able to easily turn into my own."

The 1st time I made this, I jumped for joy as this hit the spot and kept me satiated till lunch time. \n\nI make a double batch so I don’t have to cook for a few days and vary it by adding some boiled plantain or air fried sweet potatoes or serve it as a burrito in a tortilla. Since going vegan I always make mango salsa and that goes great with this dish also. \n\nTry this recipe, you will love it."

Because I tried this dish in the winter, ripe, edible tomatoes are not available. I used a 15 oz can of diced seasoned tomatoes. I took a lazy route and purchased pre-made guacamole. I would have used sliced avocado but didn’t know when I’d make the dish and did not want overripe fruit that I would have thrown out. We sprinkled with non-dairy cheddar sprinkles and guacamole. It was fantastic! I plan to make again even without my vegan son home to eat!"

This is the first time I’ve ever been able to get my son to eat ‘eggs’. Before we were vegan he wouldn’t touch’em and I absolutely loved them!! This definitely takes care of any void I miss from eggs; they taste exactly like them. The seasonings you chose were perfect!! If I were you I’d follow the recipe exact first then maybe next time tweak it a bit....everything was spot on for me I just decrease the tomatoes a bit since I don’t care for them but you need a little bit of that juice in the dish, for sure."

If I had really read the instructions b4 making it I would've cooked the garbanzo beans according to the recipe and it would've been even more tasty. A tip for cooking with tofu is extra firm cut through the middle so you have two flat thin pieces salting and peppering and leaving it cut side down in a colander to strain while u prep everything else. This will cut down on the cook time as well as a lot of the moisture will drain off before you even cook it. This is what I do whenever I want a firmer tofu. You can also put something on top to weigh it down."
