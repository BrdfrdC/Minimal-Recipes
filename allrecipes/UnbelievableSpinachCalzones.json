"reviewBody": "Just remember that a calzone is similar to just taking a pizza and folding it in half to eat. Visualizing it that way, I modified this the second time I made it. First time was the exact recipe, but the second time I made these modifications:\n\n- added artichokes, onions, garlic, and mushrooms. \n- added asiago cheese to the mix.\n- used THIN pizza crust dough from the grocery instead of the frozen bread dough as recommended in the recipe. Made two large calzones instead of small serving sized versions.\n\nKeep the cheeses and if you want to use marinara sauce, do not put that in the calzone otherwise you risk the dough being too soaked coming out of the oven and it will easily fall apart. If you have leftover filling, this easily freezes in the freezer for use later on!"

It was took much trouble to make this dish, and then finding out it, that this dish wasn't even that good. I forced myself to eat this dish so that my mom didn't get up about wasting good. I was begging for dish to be finished already. My mom even tried putting ham in it and it still wasn't very tasty. I'm kinda of a vegetable lover and I do like spinach, but this meal was nasty and hard to make."

Next I mixed the ricotta, mozzarella and parmesan with a wooden spoon in a bowl, next added the eggs. I mixed this well and added half of a head of fresh spinach. I found the frozen to be too watery.\nOnce the sausage was cool I spread it to the bottom of the calzone then covered it with the cheese mixture. Next I sealed the calzone and proceeded with the cooking instructions, I covered it with Chef John's tomato sauce and it was delicious!"

"reviewBody": "I had a couple friends over for dinner and I decided to use this as a base recipe (with the exception of using pizza dough). I ended up adding some onion and garlic powder in with the mixture as well as chicken and bacon. I also brushed the tops with egg whites when it was close to being done and sprinkled garlic salt on top. And because I'm not the biggest fan of marinara sauce, I provided the choice of marinara or alfredo sauce to dip it in. It was AMAZING! My only complaint was after I added the bacon and chicken, there was far too much. My 2 friends and I each had a large calzone and then I ended up bringing the left overs to my sisters house for a dinner party the next night and we made mini calzones for appetizers. I would say we made at least 20 three inch calzones before running out of pizza dough and I still had quite a bit of filling left. I don't usually cook so I didn't realize how much 3 chicken breasts and some bacon would add to the total amount of filling."

Two things I would do differently next time is make sure I had some red sauce/marinara for dipping and I would definitely add mushrooms and onions to the mixture. I will also stick to the recipe about making 8 as no one could finish the jumbo versions. This recipe could easily be altered to anyones preference."

I would probably stick with the 1 TBS seasoning as any more might have been too much. Great way to sneak little spinach in their diet! We added pepperoni to half of them and we sprayed the tops with a little butter spray about 10 min before they were done. Next time will try with sausage and mushrooms."

I put in one package of softened cream cheese instead of ricotta, which I know is no proper substitution, but it made the mix creamy like it needed to be, and it turned out yummy! Also, I used powdered parmesan, which works if you don't have the grate-able stuff on hand. And then I added the garlic salt and onion powder as well as cooked, cubed chicken. I brushed the outside with butter and sprinkled with parmesan, as someone else said. My husband told me we need to make these again really soon!"

I rolled each piece out as thin as I could get it. I brushed the edges with an egg wash (added salt &amp; pepper) and filled as per the directions. I placed them on my cookie sheet and brushed each calzone with more egg wash. It turned out great!!! I will definitely make this again, but I will have to decide if I should make the same mistake twice."

Instead of buying different cheeses, I skipped the ricotta and just used a 2 cup package of shredded Italian cheeses. I also added some sauteed onions, garlic, and red pepper to the spinach mixture. I used way less of the Italian seasoning. Finally, I bought Pillsbury's thin crust pizza dough instead of bread dough. I realized that if I unrolled the dough and held it by the edges, it would stretch out on its own. Then I cut it into rectangles, filled half the rectangle, and folded over. My calzones weren't in the traditional form, but no one cared. I brushed the top with olive oil and added a bit of parmesan. Be careful with the baking time. My calzones only took about 15 minutes."

Instead, brush some pesto onto the inside of the dough before you roll it up (store bought Progresso works- cheap and easy). 2) Instead of frozen bread dough, you can buy fresh pizza dough in the cheese or deli section of most grocery stores. Tastes amazing. 3) Ricotta is optional. Just the spinach and mozzarella combo with the spinach works great as long as you serve it warm."

Salt? Gouda? Colby-Jack? Meats? buttered garlic? Add just about anything you wanna add into the mix to add an edge to it (The cheeses are mild aka bland) would be my recommendation for other people cooking it."
