I'm not vegetarian, so I use ground turkey. My method is a little different, too; I brown the onion, then the meat, then add the cabbage.By the time the cabbage is slightly cooked, it's ready to serve. We love it!"

I suppose we prefer onion, garlic, and salt type seasonings with the cabbage/tomato combination over the brown sugar, allspice and dill which was called for in this recipe. I do like the idea of shredding the cabbage instead of the more labor intensive wrapping of a meat-type mixture in individual cabbage leaves."

(about 3/4 tsp); third, only add 1 can Italian stewed tomatoes but also add 1 small fresh tomato (seeded &amp; diced) with several sprinkles of Italian seasoning. Otherwise I followed the directions, served it over instant brown rice made with veggie broth, and topped with a dollop of fat free sour cream. My husband wouldn't eat it because he is for some reason adverse to slightly sweet entree dishes. I did not mind though because I got the leftovers!"

I used some extra tomato sauce and a bit of water to make it more liquidy. I wasn't sure what sort of cabbage was called for, so I used half a head of fresh green cabbage and sliced it to half-inch strips. It took a lot longer than 4 minutes to wilt. I served it over rice and it was terrific!"

"reviewBody": "This was a pretty good recipe. Even my toddler ate a few bites. However, be sure that you like allspice before you add it because it is quite overpowering. Next time I will use half as much allspice and twice as much dill. I added an extra cup of cabbage (bagged cole slaw mix) and a can of tomato paste to try to cover some of the allspice but it didn't help much. I left out the sugar since the tomatoes make it sweet enough unless you are a big fan of candy and have skewwed your sweet tooth. It was especially good with a little shredded sharp cheddar on top."
