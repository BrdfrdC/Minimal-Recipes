My husband said it was just okay and my mother in law said basically the same as the other reviewers and I agree. It's ok/ good, not great. Too thick for me, needs more cheese/sauce, more flavor and I did put a sharp cheddar on top. When I make up my own concoctions, I use a few different cheeses and no flour. Anyway, if you make this, you may want to have some of your own twists to make this really good. When I reheat this as leftovers it will need some doctoring."

The oven just dried everything out and is a completely stupid step (unless you like really tacky and dry Mac and cheese)."

But it was very plain tasting and dry and that was right after coming out of the oven. I would guess that using less flour and more milk would help this recipe."

I had to use 5 TB of butter, might even could've used 6 to smooth out the roux, but once I got it going and added the milk it started thickening up really quick. If you are new to cooking, have ALL of your ingredients ready before you start this sauce. I am an experienced cook and this sauce came up real quick. Had to add a little more milk after the velveeta to smooth it out. Like others added some onion powder, garlic powder, salt/ pepper. I used plain breadcrumbs instead of crackers (2Tb to 2/3 c roughly). But over all, fantastic base recipe."

"reviewBody": "I used leek sautéed with Vietnamese spicy chili garlic sauce. Used Country Crock plant butter instead made with avocado oil, and it turned out fine. I had some Sargento reduced fat cheese sticks to use up. Didn’t like them straight out of the package but the cheddar ones were great on top, just that as a topping it was more curds in place than shredded evenness. Used extra sharp cheddar Velveeta in the bechemel. Would love to make this again. This is a fantastic recipe. The macaroni and cheese was gooey, but not too gooey, creamy but not too creamy, packed with flavor. Pro tip: remember to take your pan toasted cracker crumbs off heat and don’t taste them straight off the pan. Burned my tongue."

I toped with crackers and baked 25 minutes on 350. Perfect!"

I used cracker and jalapeno fried onions topper. Cooked in a 9 x 13 casserole dish. Perfectly creamy. Amount of milk may seem excessive but trust me, if you like a creamy Mac and cheese you need it.
