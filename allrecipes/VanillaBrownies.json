But with unsalted butter and only 1/2 teaspoon of salt in the recipe, I knew it needed more salt to combat the sweet and to make it more savory. So I sprinkled kosher salt lightly over the top of the batter before I baked it. Let me tell you, those pockets of salt that hits you and compliments the sweet and gives it a punch of flavor is amazing."

I used only 2 eggs. I used Chipits Salted Caramel Chips. The batter was very dry and crumbly, so I added about 1/4 cup milk until the batter looked right and pressed it into a 15x17 pan and baked for 25 minutes. I checked at 20 minutes and it looked good but I added 5 more to be safe. Replace the chips with White Chocolate and add craisins, and you've got an amazing dupe for Starbucks Cranberry Bliss Bars. Soooo good!"

Then U added the eggs, one at a time until nice and smooth. Then the vanilla which I doubled. Then, the dry ingredients were stirred in just until incorporated. Finally, the chocolate and white chocolate chips. \n\nI spread it all out in a 9x13 pan and backed 25 mins. I browned lightly on top with a crispy outside but chewy and dense inside. \n\nKids chomped them up. Very simple. \n\nI might it them in a smaller pan next time, just to get them a little thicker. \n\nGood basic recipe that can be easily modified."

It baked pretty quickly in an 8x8 Glass Pan in just 30 mins. Definitely will do this again soon!"

I used a smaller metal pan (8x8 I believe) and baked for 40 minutes using parchment paper in the pan: no burning and perfect brownie consistency! I also used white chocolate chips in the batter and topped with buttercream frosting. I think this is a perfect option for people who are not huge chocolate fans. My boyfriend is one of these people and asked for an entire pan of these just for him, he can't get enough. And since the recipe is so basic your creativity can run wild trying different special ingredients. The only negative thing I noticed was that the middle of the pan sank a bit upon cooling, so I'm not quite sure what happened there... still tasted delicious though!"

I used chocolate rice instead of chocolate chips and baked for 35min. Oh yeah, and I did not use any kind of mixer, just the traditional way which made the dough not so perfectly mixed. But the outcome - crispy right on the edge and it gets chewy as you move on from the edge. The chocolate rice were melted inside so they made it looks vanilla brownie sprinkled with chocolate rains. I bet it will be good with vanilla ice cream on top! Very effortless recipe, so easy!"

My boyfriend liked these, but not as 'brownies.' Mine baked maybe 5 to 10 minutes quicker, but all bakers know to check and never rely on times, they're only guidelines since ovens vary in temperature. (I'm really surprised how many people don't know that on this site.) Since it was already so sweet, I'm going to try a modification: without white sugar, with butterscotch chips and marshmallows, and only 1 tsp of baking powder. Really wasn't impressed, but I see it as a good starting base."

It took forever to cook (using an 8x11 which someone suggested worked good for them)so I had to burn the outside to get it to cook. Then when it did cook, it was like glue on the inside. NEVER making these again. Sorry."

"reviewBody": "OUTSTANDING with the changes suggested by JANE37. I cut the sugars to 3/4 C each and used only 2 eggs -- the dough was a great consistency. With the complaints about the middle being underdone (and because I'm shipping these to friends in the military to share with their buddies), rather than baking as bars, I put 1/4 C of dough in foil muffin cups and baked @ 350' for 25 minutes (there was just enough dough for 18 individual cups). The tops are \"bitey\" (not crunchy, but not soft...) and the consistency of the middle is a cross between a cookie and a cake. I added 1 C caramel / choco swirl chips and 1 C choco chips, and I used half soy margarine and half butter-flavored shortening, because that's what I had in the pantry. These are now a permanent part of my recipe collection."

"reviewBody": "My 13 year old made these and they were really good. I left her to her own devices, she baked them in an 11 x 8 glass baking dish instead of the jellyroll pan. It took longer for them to bake, but they were chewy with a nice vanilla flavor. She didn't have chocolate chips. I'm not sure I would add them, it might be too rich and sweet, they are sweet without the chips, and would kill the notion of being vanilla. They were great just the way my daughter made them. Thanks!"

Thanks for the recipe though!"

(Plus my son dumped in extra vanilla which gave them a strong vanilla taste!) I baked them in a 9x13\" pan for about 35 minutes or so, and they came out perfectly - a little crisp at the edges and a little softer in the middle, just like bar cookies should be. Fantastic recipe, thanks! :)"
