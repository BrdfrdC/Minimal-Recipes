The only thing I did differently was use regular granulated sugar as opposed to superfine sugar, and vanilla bean paste instead of vanilla beans - both substitutions worked beautifully. \n(For the vanilla bean paste: I made a ×3 recipe, and used 1 tablespoon of the vanilla bean paste instead of 1.5 vanilla beans)"
