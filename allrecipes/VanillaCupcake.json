This is going to be my go-to cupcake recipe, and is also the perfect base for other add ons\n\nModifications: \n- 1 cup superfine sugar (1 cup instead of 3/4, I also pulsed regular sugar in a Nutri bullet a couple of times, since I did not have \"superfine\" sugar)\n- 2 eggs instead of 3\n- 2 teaspoon vanilla extract instead of 1\n- 1/2 cup of almond milk, or any milk. \n- I just mixed the ingredients with a spatula, you don't need to spend time overworking the batter with an electric mixer"

When I took the first bite of the cake out of the oven, it tasted like a sugar cookie. So flavorful, and you can really taste the butter. In the future, I might reduce the butter."

So, when I made them, I added a little bit less then 1 tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp of salt to the flour whisking it together in a seperate bowl and then adding it to the wet ingredients. It turned out delicious! Also, if the cupcake batter seems a bit thick just add milk until the the batter is just right!"

They are my first cupcakes that I've ever made from scratch so I have to compare them to box batter, the difference I've noticed is that this recipe is a little thicker than what I'm used to seeing but other than that I must say that they are AMAZING and everyone loves them.\nThey are full figured and fluffy, so good.\nThank you for a great recipe!"

The recipe should bring this to the baker's attention as it was very easy to miss the first time I made this recipe. It was AWFUL!! The cupcake was dense and the flavor was off-putting. I am definitely NOT going to make this recipe again."
