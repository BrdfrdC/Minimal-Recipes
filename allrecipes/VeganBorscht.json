Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir in the celery, carrots, bell pepper, beets including the greens, whole tomatoes, diced tomatoes, potatoes, Swiss chard, and the onion mixture. Cook and stir until the chard begins to wilt, 4 to 8 minutes. Stir in the vegetable broth, water, dill weed, and salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 1 hour."

Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the beets moving before leaving it on to puree. Add the tofu, and continue pureeing until smooth. Stir the tofu mixture back into the pot. Simmer until the mixture is reduced by a third, about another hour. Serve chilled or warm."

"reviewBody": "Love this recipe. I'm making it again this year w/my excess beets. I love that you use the greens. I don't have celery in the garden so I leave it out, everything else I have. Oh, no fresh dill either--I use the dill seed I saved earlier this summer. And I don't put in the tofu. It's really great w/o it. I bet it'd be great w/it too, but I never have any on hand(or veggie broth). This freezes great. I make a big batch or two and eat it all winter long out of quart jars in the freezer. Cracked pepper and a dollop of sour cream and I'm good to go. Thanks for sharing!!"

I don't understand how anyone could call it bland, but that's just me- loved the taste of variety of ingredients and I added some extra chard and used diced tomatoes with chilis, yummy! My first time working with beets and chard and it turned out awesome! Thanks for the recipe!"

Although, the way I made it probably doesn't count as \"borscht.\" I didn't have dill and I didn't blend anything. Just boiled it up and crumbled medium tofu into it... lazy, but still tasty! But do let it boil at least an hour before adding the tofu. Also, used fresh tomatoes instead of canned ones."
