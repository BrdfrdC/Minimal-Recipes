I followed the recipe except I added cinnamon used milk instead of water and I did as another commenter said, about using 1/4 cup of oil and 3/4 cup of applesauce. They are extremely moist, which is perfect because I love moist cupcakes. I even added powdered sugar on top. I did think that the mix was a little liquify for brownies after mixing, so I ended up adding more flower, which might have been why they ended up a little cakey. It’s definitely a recipe I’ll play with a little. I’ve been craving vegan sweets!"

I used coffee vs water, oil and unsweetened applesauce (1/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce) and i used a little less sugar because I don't like brownies to be too sweet. Overall, this is a really good quick recipe , especially when you have a taste fir a brownie or anything sweet. This recipe definitely satisfies that craving and hits the spot. Hope this helps!"

Also, 350 for 25 minutes is not typical for baking brownies and at that point mine were a chocolate lava mess. Cooked at 350 for 35 minutes total and turned up to 400 for 10 more minutes. Theyre finally done. Would not recommend this particular recipe but a little adjustments could make it a solid go-to."

"reviewBody": "I was looking for a quick, vegan brownie recipe and found this. I had baked as a last minute treat for an event, but sadly they are too crumbly to present. \n\nFirst off, I used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup, which was perfect. I do this as standard practice as I have baked too many cakes, especially online recipes, which were sickly and way too sweet. \n\nI bake a fair few vegan cakes, biscuits, scones etc and noticed on making, that this recipe seems to call for way too much oil in my opinion, but gave it a go none the less. I now feel I should have reduced the oil to 3/4 cup. The rise was not as expected, the bake was much too dense due to the oil and the brownies did not hold together as they should after cutting. They were way too greasy and way too crumbly.\n\nThe texture in the mouth is somewhat claggy, rather than moist, but the flavour is spot on. They won't go to waste, we will eat them with custard or vegan ice cream, but in all honesty, this recipe needs tweaking!\n\nI will either try again with less oil, or find another recipe."

"reviewBody": "The ingredients for this recipe are good. No substitutions are needed. The problem Reviewers encountered was the brownies were oily or the oil pooled in the brownie pan. Reading this recipe to my cousin who went to culinary school, she identified the problem. Since oil and water do not normally mix, the oil needs to be bound to something first before adding the water. Solution: Blend the sugar, oil, and cocoa powder first. Then, add the rest of the wet ingredients. Now the batter is ready for the addition of the salt, baking powder, and flour, in that order. Be sure to blend well after each addition of the dry ingredients. Another note: Be sure to line your 9x13 baking dish with parchment paper and spray well with nonstick spray. Now you’re ready to bake according to the Baker’s directions. The reason I gave this recipe 4 stars is because the directions weren’t as clear as they should be. However, after rectifying the oil issue, these brownies are chocolatey goodness. I will definitely make these again, should I come across another need for a vegan dessert."

Also added 2 spoons of instant coffee to dry ingredients because I like strong chocolate flavor, and added chopped walnuts. I am not a professional in baking and it was my first time making any type of brownies, but it came out so, so delicious: cakey, gooey, soft. I just made the brownies and having a very hard keeping my family away from them, they keep picking at them. Thank you all!"

The taste is the same as non vegan brownies. To make them more cakey you would need to add a “little” more flour. A LITTLE (a couple of tablespoons maybe). To cook longer may be to overcook them but it’s your choice. Either way the taste is amazing. Highly recommend this recipe."
