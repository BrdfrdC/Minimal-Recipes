Also added fresh juice and zest on 1 big lemon but I didn't feel it neither the vanilla (although my vanilla extract is quite good). That's why I give 4 stars. Next time I'll add more. Otherwise, it's a keep one! Thank you!"

I got a decent rise on my cupcakes and the texture was excellent -- moist and not too dense. I thought they were good for being vegan, but I think the coconut oil is too overpowering. It tastes like a coconut cupcake. Next time I would try a neutral oil like canola or vegetable."

"reviewBody": "The best vegan vanilla cupcakes I‚Äôve tasted so far! I needed to make some for a couple of birthday parties we will be attending since I didn‚Äôt want my young food-allergy son to feel left out. Some specifics: I used sweetened soy milk, canola oil, and King Arthur all purpose flour. I read that another baker allowed the measured milk to sit out to reach room temperature‚Äîdon‚Äôt forget this step! I sprayed my cupcake liners with olive oil and filled them 3/4 which made the full 18 cupcakes; if you fill less you could probably get close to 24. I did need to bake them for 20 minutes (the first one I tasted after 17 minutes was a little gooey in the middle top). I will be saving and reusing this recipe probably hundreds of times in the years to come. Thank you for sharing!"

If you set out the almond milk and vinegar to curdle first before doing anything else, it has time to come to room temperature and not solidify the coconut oil right away. If you add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients as soon as they are combined you shouldn‚Äôt have any problems with the oil."

They‚Äôre not too far off in texture from non-vegan cupcakes. They‚Äôre moist, not too dense, and perfectly sweet. Just make sure you heat the milk (I used vanilla soy milk, which also adds a little bit to the vanilla flavor!) before you add the warmed coconut oil, as it would likely re-solidify if you were to add it to room-temperature milk. This probably should have been mentioned in the instructions, since not everyone is used to baking with coconut oil. Other than that, the recipe was easy to follow and didn‚Äôt take much time to complete at all, and the result tastes sooo good! With some vegan buttercream these will very well be the best cupcakes I‚Äôve ever made!"

I took the trial to my non-vegan co-workers to try without telling them they were vegan. They also liked them. The only con is they didn't rise and I think that was because of the lack of egg. I might try to use an egg replacement the next time. This is definitely a keeper."

They are so light and fluffy and when they are warm they are even better. My batch made about 16 cupcakes but of course this differs between how much you fill your tins. I used cupcake liners and they popped out of each liner super easily when ready to eat(almost too easily, I almost dropped one!). And they are very easy to make, because the ingredients are things that can be easily found around the house. Although instead of using coconut oil, I opted for using vegetable oil and it worked out splendidly! Even if you aren't vegan I really think these cupcakes are worth making!"

I am an avid baker, and thought maybe it would help the rising process if I sifted the flour and sugar. Oh my they turned out beautiful. They raised perfectly, and tasted scrumptious. I even filled the cupcakes with pie filling apples before baking. I love your recipe, and will for sure use this over and over."

I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleasantly surprised. Here are a couple things I would note for myself next time: the cider vinegar and almond milk didn't curdle as I thought it should, even after leaving it for twice as long. That said, it didn't seem to make a difference to the final outcome. The other note for next time is to reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup (1 3/4 cup total). Thank you for sharing this recipe."

Used whey protein powder as the milk (its all I had, as I don't drink any milk regularly), used brown sugar, used whole wheat flower, I added a 1/2 teaspoon more of baking powder, used a sifter to blend all the dry ingredients with exception of the sugar-added that after, used canola oil as I did not have coconut oil. Didn't use the apple cider. Didn't have cupcake pan so I made it into a few small loafs. I got a normal rise out of the cakes. I over cooked it a bit though to get a nice crunchy shell, all at 350 degrees started the timer at 30 minutes added 10 to 15 minutes accordingly to get the outside a nice firm shell, I started monitoring the oven at the 25 minute mark. I made sure to constantly check the center to make sure it baked all the way through. cool completely before you taste. Very tasty, nice shell, soft and fluffy on the inside. This would taste great if it had nuts. I didn't use a blender, I whisked and then used a wooden spoon."

Trust what the reviewers said and give this recipe a try. One thing I like to add that you should mix it well until the sugar dissolved properly to prevent some cupcake being too sweet from the other. I kind of mix it a bit too little so the last few cupcake from the batter is too sweet."

The only changes I made to the recipe was to use organic refined coconut oil instead of unrefined because I didn't want a coconut flavor. I also stirred the melted coconut oil into the flour mixture before adding the milk because I've had issues in the past with coconut oil solidifying when added to cold liquid... other than that the recipe was prepared as instructed. Made 17 cupcakes....definitely will make this recipe again and again."
