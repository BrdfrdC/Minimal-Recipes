"reviewBody": "I cut the tortillas in 4ths and, after putting pam on my big pyrex dish, I covered bottom with layer of tortillas. I blended a can of diced, fire roasted tomatoes with the refried beans to apply easier, then brown rice. I put a couple tbsp of olive oil in pan and cooked a small onion, half a seeded poblano pepper and 2 large cloves of garlic until soft (about 4 mins). I then added Seitan and tsp of cumin, sprinkle of oregano, salt, pepper, and 2 Tbls of ground medium-hot, New Mexican red chili. Let that cook for about 4 minutes and took off heat. I added this to the layers (total of two tortilla) ending with top showing the Seitan and then the cheese. I used all ingredients plus added some healthy, yummy ones. It was awesome!!! and made enough for 8-10 people."

"reviewBody": "This is a perfectly tasty meal from the pantry! The flavors were spot on. I tend to use more fresh ingredients. But for a quick tasty dinner for 6, I will keep this recipe. I did follow the instructions fairly close. I used petite diced salt free tomatoes instead of crushed. I mixed with a whole can of medium spiced Ro*TEL. I chopped the Seitan into bite size pieces. The rice I cooked in veggie broth. I used Good Planet brand mozzarella. Also the green enchilada sauce I used 28oz can of medium spice.\nThe basics are here! Make it your spice level!\nMy husband felt it needed more crunch...I handed him a bag of tortilla chips! Happy man"

Added shredded cheese to the top and guacamole to the last ten minutes of the bake. Excellent and easy to serve if you spray with pam before filling casserole tray."
