"reviewBody": "First, I have to say, that I'm not Vegan. I just happened to pick up a jicama, and was looking for something to do with it. This sounded interesting, so I gave it a try. I can see where this would mimic a seafood ceviche for a Vegan. That said, it had a bitter taste to it that I couldn't get past. My son enjoyed it (he's been on a \"I don't want to eat any meat\" phase lately, so I'm glad he liked these.) Probably not something I'd make again."
