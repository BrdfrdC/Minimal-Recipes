We followed others direction and took the artichokes out and I also like some spice, so I added some sriracha to taste and it was…. Very nice. Also went the vegan option with Tofu for protein but I could easily see this with sausage and/or shrimp being delicious."

I can’t think of anything I would do differently—a winner! I served it with the wonderful Vegetarian Sweet Potato Burritos, also from this site. Thanks for the post!"

Peppers need to be sauteed much longer than 3 minutes and/or cut into smaller pieces or they'll still be much too crunchy. Overall a great recipe that I will be using again (with my changes)."
