"reviewBody": "It was challenging to mix the pumpkin in, so I had a couple ingredient lumps left after baking. It's very thick and more dough than batter at the end, and I almost added the water as the tip about muffins mentions, even though I was using a baking pan. The taste is lighter on pumpkin, so even the usual pumpkin hater of my family enjoyed these. I was making \"Best Brownies\" at the same time and ended up baking this recipe at 350degF as a result, so they took a couple minutes more - about 23 minutes total."

I used 2/3 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup maple syrup, no vanilla(did you know a lot of vanilla extracts are made wuth BEAVER ANAL GLANDS?!),cinnamon sugar on top and allspice instead of cloves. They were a bit undercooked so bake for a bit longer than 20 I'd say"

I did omit the brown sugar just to make them a little healthier for breakfast. I dont eat a lot of sweets, so the bread still tasted sweet enough to me with just the white sugar. Then I sprinkled some walnuts and chocolate chips on top for some exciting texture."

"reviewBody": "These turned out moist and melt-in-your-mouth good! I used 2 cups of fresh pumpkin that I roasted and pureed, which is probably slightly more than you'd get in a 15-ounce can. I also subbed coconut sugar for the brown sugar, doubled the spices (except for the cloves), used whole wheat pastry flour, and added a tablespoon of ground flax seed to account for the extra amount of pumpkin puree. Vegans and non-vegans in my family loved them! Next time (and there will definitely be a next time) I'll add some chopped vegan white chocolate, dried cranberries, and walnuts...or maybe pumpkin seeds...or both! I'll also experiment with other sweeteners such as maple syrup. This is a great basic recipe that I'm sure will have lots of variations. And it's easy to make! This one's a keeper!"

I used vegan butter instead of oil, and used 1.5x the amount called for. I also 1.5x the amount of spices and doubled the amount of salt, and cooked for an extra 5 minutes at 400 degrees for the bigger pan. They mad for a tall cake brownie-like pumpkin bar, but incredibly delicious and a crowd-pleaser."

I will say though that this is wonderful warm with the ice cream if you're not a fan of the normal super sweet blondies but if you are which I'm not but hubby is just make minor adjustments for sweetness. I will try this again using the spices measurements I use for my pumpkin pies and increase the brown sugar by a 1/4 cup and see if he likes that better. Like I said though if I was judging for me alone this would have another star. My Korean friend loved it but the young American military men weren't fans."
