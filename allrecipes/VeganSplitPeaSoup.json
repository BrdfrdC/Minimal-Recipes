What I also did was split the soup in half and added leftover ham into one since I eat meat but the others in my house hold do not. great reciept and I will make this again as a vegan dish as well as the addition of the ham!"

I doubled the garlic, used 2 medium red potatoes and all of the herbs were fresh. I put a lid on the pot during the whole 3-hour process even though it doesn't say to do so. Split Pea Soup is SUPPOSED to be thick, but I could tell at the 2-hour mark that it was going to be way too thick, so when adding the potatoes I added a two more cups of the water/bouillon mix. It came out perfectly thick yet still a soup. It's garnished with crushed pita chips and chives, and this is easily something I could eat every week....SO delicious!"

This is a hearty soup, especially when partially pureed. The soup freezes very well. The only change I make is too double the herbs for flavors. This recipe is definitely a thumbs up and I'm only sorry I forget to take a photo every time I make it. For people who like ham in their pea soup but want to keep the recipe vegan, I add 1/2 tsp liquid smoke."

And the barley adds such a wonderful texture. I used to eat a lot of processed pre-packaged foods and split pea soup was one of my favourites. It's something I have definitely missed over the years. Now that I know how easy it is to make, I think it's going to become a staple! And it's so much more delicious - and nutritious - this way!\n\nI made some tweaks to this recipe, so I thought I would share: I omitted the potatoes and celery. I added 1/4 cup extra barley - because I love barley! I also doubled the garlic, doubled the basil, and used 2 tablespoons of dried parsley in place of the 1/2 cup fresh because I didn't have any fresh on hand.\n\nI noticed, like many others, that I did need to add extra water throughout the cooking time. I just added as needed. The 3 hours total time got the peas to that perfect soft consistency. I'm so in love with this soup :)"

I did the quick soak method after sorting my beans, simmering them with the onion and garlic to infuse more flavor (since I didn't have veggie stock to use). After waiting an hour for the quick soak, I simmered for about 90 mins, blended it in batches in my blender, and added the butter to finish. Delicious."

As far as bland is concerned, again you can always season to taste so if you use what they ask and want to add more. \nThis soup smelled wonderful as it cooked yesterday morning I was making it for Lent since it has no meat in it. I like the ham hocks in split pea soup but with the potatoes and barley it wasn't lacking in texture at all. I think I added more thyme then was on the original recipe, I had soup for breakfast. Awesome!"

I had the same experience another reviewer had, stuff stuck to the bottom and then formed a crust on the bottom of my pan which I'm currently trying to boil off! I had added a cup of chicken broth with the vegies, and I'd probably cut the potato to one. I don't think I'll make this one again."

I stirred it often but it didn't matter cause a soup that thick on the burner for 4 hours is almost impossible not to burn unless you are constantly stirring for 4 hours straight. A lot of work and ingredients involved in making a soup that ended up burnt to and was unbearable to eat. Very embarrassed cooking this mess for my family."

"reviewBody": "This recipe tastes amazing.\n\nFull disclosure, a few things I changed: only 1 tsp of salt (kosher sea salt); more garlic, carrots, celery, and potato, but no parsley; brown rice instead of barley. (Personal preferences and/or adapting to what I happened to have in the house.)\n\nMost importantly, I did not need to cook it nearly as long as the recipe says – more like 1 – 1 ½ hours for the first simmer, and maybe only 30 minutes more after adding all the veg. I also used more water, somewhere between 8 and 9 cups, and I actually think I could have used even more. The soup came out very thick, and towards the end I really had to be attentive that it didn’t burn to the bottom of the pot. However, overall this recipe is super easy, low-maintenance to cook, and DELICIOUS!"

Also, I added my veggies after about 1.5 hours instead of waiting for 2 hours because I noticed the peas had almost completely broken down (not necessarily a bad thing). Soup was done in 2 hrs. If you want your peas to have more structure, I suggest adding the veggies an hour early. I will definitely make this again. The barley is an awesome touch."

I adjusted ingredients to my family's diet and made it gluten-free by substituting 1/2 cup arborio rice for the barley, 8 chopped green onions for the yellow onion, and I used less fat for sauteing. Otherwise, I used two huge red potatoes rather than russet and added 1/4 t. cayenne with the spices. I started the peas in water in a separate pot while I chopped/sauteed the vegetables because I didn't have three hours for the soup to cook. As I finished chopping/measuring items, I added them to the soup. It was completely done in two hours. Be sure to use lots of water, stir frequently, and turn heat down once the potatoes and rice soften and begin to stick to the bottom of the pan."
