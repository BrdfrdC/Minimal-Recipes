"reviewBody": "I wan't able to find actual vegan stout before I was ready to cook this, so next time I will find, ahead of time, where I can buy that.\n\nI used Guiness; I think for my own tastes I would buy a lighter stout. I used store bought seitan, and it was a little chewy, not so pleasant, so I might actually try making my own to see if I can come up with a better consistency.\n\nOtherwise, made as directed, very good flavor. My family enjoyed the flavor, not so much the seitan."
