Prepared, whole wheat pastry dough is cut into squares and heaped with a hearty, cooked filling of onions, carrots, diced potatoes, turnips, mushrooms and Cheddar cheese.

The first time I was pretty slow figuring out what I was doing, but I'm sure in the future it will be fairly quick!\n\nI did not use the turnip or the yeast extract spread. I just made a crust like I normally make for pies. I think next time I will make 8 smaller pies rather than 4 large ones so that I hope they will be easily transportable and good finger foods."

I actually used flaky croissant pastry from the biscuit section which took a lot of the prep time out, and was delicious-although not totally authentic, I think it made my very American husband like it more than if I had used the traditional pastry. \nThese freeze great- I will make this again and again!"

I think as long as you make the sauce, the filling is flexible. Um... yeah I also didn't actually make a pasty. I wasn't feeling all that motivated, so I made the filling and ate it with bread. But I am *certain* that it would only be better in pasty form."

"reviewBody": "This was very good -- much better than the simple ingredients might suggest. It is a very hearty vegetarian meal -- my husband was convinced there was meat in them until I told him otherwise. I omitted the yeast extract spread (didn't have any) and forgot the egg wash at the end. I think this recipe would be pretty forgiving in terms of root veggie substitutions -- I didn't measure or count, just scooped a good handful of carrots, turnips, and potatoes. I think the filling would also be excellent done in a bread crust like a calzone. Thanks! Great recipe to use up all the root veggies I got from my CSA!"

Oh, I did add some smoked chile tomato sauce in the veges instead of yeast extract and a wee bit of oregano. This tasted very good. The crust is out of the world."

"reviewBody": "Awesome recipe! My husband and I have made this one many, many times. We use just potatoes, onions and carrots for the veg... tastes exactly like the ones I've had in Cornwall. I always get compliments on this recipe!\n\nNote on putting them together: For a true pasty shape, cut the dough into circles and put the filling in the center, leaving lots of room all around. You need less filling than you think! \n\nThen fold the dough over the filling so you have a semi-circle. Fold the bottom dough up over the top and press your thumb in all around to create indentations and seal in the filling. This creates the thick crust that Cornish miners would hold onto when eating them (they then threw the crust away!)."

I used a food processor to grate all the vegetables together, making prep a breeze. Perfect amount for four pasties THANKS."
