I did substitute the peanut oil for walnut oil and didn't use peanuts either and I also used frozen mixed vegetables instead of just peas and a yellow pepper. But over all it was a very good recipe.

I also added: 1 egg, 1 chopped up chicken breast I had left over from grilling out the night before, and 1 julienned carrot. I also used a red pepper instead of green for the color. My husband raved about this batch of fried rice when I made it 2 weeks ago and am actually making it again tonight. Am thinking of making it with Hot Chili Oil as my husband loves hot stuff and the red pepper flakes were barely detected last time."

I used one bag of the Success Boil-in-Bag brown rice and it was perfect. I added one egg just to give it some protein since I was giving it to my kids for lunch. This was quick, easy and flavorful!"

I used the brown rice, but followed the cooking instructions on the packet. I used olive oil instead of peanut oil, but did add a tblspn of peanut butter. I used red bell pepper instead of green, and added frozen peas and corn, which went in with the onions and garlic. I was out of soy sauce, so I used teriyaki and I omitted the green onions, sesame oil and peanuts. this was still an awesome dish and the red pepper flakes added just the right kick. It was a hit with my family and I will be making it again, with the changes I made."

I used olive oil, because that was all I had, and used instant white rice. I didn't have any peas, peanuts or any sesame oil. I substituted with carrots, asparagus, and extra olive oil and two eggs that I beat up. I also used extra garlic and extra red pepper flakes. I like it spicy. I didn't add extra soy sauce, but put the bottle on the table for people to use. I did feel like it needed more salt, but I wanted people to add soy sauce/salt to their own liking! I will definitely make this again, and will experiment with more veggies and maybe even shrimp or chicken!"

I used a large yellow pepper (we don't care for green peppers) and I increased the garlic. Instead of canned peas, I used a mixture of organic frozen peas and carrots I had in my deep freeze. This was a quick side I could throw together and it went well with Christian's Killer BBQ and Grill Marinade on the chicken I had to go with it. This was an inexpensive meal that made enough for my two hungry boys, one hungry husband and I plus it made enough for lunch for my husband tomorrow."

"reviewBody": "It really needed some carrots so when I was all done I chopped up some carrots and stir fried them seperately and added them to the recipe! I also used frozen peas instead of canned (more nutricious) and added them with the onions and pepper! Next time I might put half of the pepper flakes just because my kids thought it was spicy but it wasn't too spicy for me and I'm not big on a lot of spice! I also added some chicken for some protein and we had this as a meal instead of a side!!! It was so very yummy! Even without my adjustments it was really good I just thought carrots would add nutrition and some bulk since it was the only course!!!\n\n****Now that ive made this ohhhh I don't know....100+ times I wanted to add a few things! This recipe is so easy to adjust to your liking! First of all if you aren't vegan you can take 1-2 eggs, beat them and add them in last then stir fry until eggs are cooked! Be sure to get the veggies in there right away once chicken is in there or you will end up with crunchy veggies... unless of course you like crunchy veggies! I put chopped chicken in and imeadiately start chopping and adding veggies! We also use brown rice! I cook 2 cups dry rice seperately in my rice cooked then just blend it all together before adding sesame oil or seeds!"

This will give your finished fried rice a lovely, non-sticky texture. I think it's critical. I'm also partial to fried rice with addition of scrambled egg."

I substituted teriyaki sauce for the soy sauce; don't care for soy sauce at all. I read the reviews and tried sauteing my rice before hand but the results were mushy. I think I will try another suggestion of cooking the rice a day ahead of time and letting it sit in the frig. Regardless, the taste was great! Definitely the best fried rice I've ever made. This recipe is a keeper!"
