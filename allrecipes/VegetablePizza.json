"reviewBody": "Have used this recipe with all types of customizing for 20+ years. Here's a few hints. Pillsbury has the dough sheets now - no trying to squeeze the perforations together - yay! I use a spoonful or so of Miracle Whip and go light on the Ranch dressing. Rather than adding each topping separately, I chop everything fine, stir it all up in a big bowl, along with the shredded cheddar. I use broccoli, celery (chopped superfine), cauliflower, carrots, red, yellow and green peppers, sweet onion (family only - you might not want onion breath at your party!) and fine shredded cheese. If you use tomatoes, use roma and drain the seeds and juice as much as possible; same with cucumbers : juicy items like tomatoes will make your crust soggy, and may 'bleed' into your cream cheese. Once I top the crust with the cream cheese mixture, I cut into two inch squares and put them on the baking sheet. Then, sprinkle the toppings liberally , pushing them deep into the cream cheese. This will keep them from being quite so messy to serve and eat. Almost everyone loves this dish - but it can be tricky to eat, so the smaller 'slices' make them easier to handle."

And looking at the nutritional info. it has 467 calories PER SERVING, and 38.8 grams of fat per serving. So, I would change it up a lot with using neufachtel and use less and only a sprinkle of ranch powder. And would not refrigerate it. But, as always, thanks for posting and giving us recipes to try!"

So yummy! \n\nI followed 90% of the recipe - my only changes were that I only added a little shredded cheese and I put it on top of the cream cheese mixture (under the veggies) so that it would stick and not fall off when eaten. \n\nI used red pepper instead of green, omitted the carrots and added green onions. I used purple cauliflower and it was sooo pretty!\n\nOh - I recommend gutting/seeding the tomatoes so that they don't get your pizza soggy. Also, I found that gently pushing the veggies down before cutting them made them stick to the bread so guests didn't lose their toppings. \n\nThis was really great - I can't wait to try some more variations - thanks for the recipe! :)"

If you care about appearance, like I do, make sure to dice/chop the veggies all the same size. They should be very small and uniform. Another tip, make sure to mash the crescent roll dough so that it is even. Some people make this and have \"fluffy\" crust or uneven crust. You want the crust to be rather flat and uniform."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe. I used miracle whip vs. mayonnaise &amp; crescent rolls that weren't perforated. I may add garlic and dill weed for extra flavor the next time. I recommend using sharp cheddar vs. mild cheddar. I mixed the miracle whip, cream cheese and hidden valley ranch dressing mix the night before and refrigerated it so the flavors could blend. Also 7 minutes was PLENTY of time to cook the roll (the recommended 12 minutes listed in the recipe yielded me burnt buns, lol). The dish was a hit &amp; I'll be making it again soon!"

I set out my cream cheese so it is room temperature and mix it with the mayo in my mixer, I add a teaspoon of dill. I sometimes change up the veggies on top. I have made this for family gatherings, graduation parties, and made 4 of them for my in-laws 70th Anniversary party. Everyone loves it!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe was a hit! I was unable to fit two cans of crescent rolls in my 9x13 inch pan, so I halved the recipe. The first time I made this, it seemed terribly salty and the veggies kept falling off while my family was trying to eat it. The second time I made it, I mixed the mayonnaise, cream cheese and dressing mix together the night before and let the flavors blend in the refrigerator. The next day I baked the crust and assembled it. I also lightly pushed down on all the veggies and cheese before refrigerating the finished pizza to help everything \"stick\" to the crust. That did the trick because it held together well and tasted delicious! Even the kids, who are not veggie fans, loved this pizza!"

"reviewBody": "The Pros: A great variety of veggies. Loved that. First time trying crescent rolls, liked that as well.\n\nThe Cons: Only one, but I consider to be very important and the reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 4, the dry ranch mixture completely overpowered the flavor of the cream cheese.It made it impossible to eat.\n\nI find it odd, because I don't see any mention of that in any other review, but I followed the recipie exactly as it is written. I didn't skimp on the veggies and I used two packages of cream cheese and 1oz package of dry ranch mix, and despite following the reciepie exactly as it is written, after about the second piece of pizza, I couldn't eat anymore. I normally like Ranch on my pizza's but next time, I may only use half the package or none at all. My advice would be to add the dry ranch sparingly and taste it as you add more, to make sure it doesn't become overbearing before spreading it over the bread.\n\nOther than that, I would make this again. I am trying to find ways for my family to eat more veggies. I have a two year old son who hates veggies, but I chopped everything up in small fine pieces, and to my excitement, he ate most of the veggies. It was great! He loves pizza, so this was a great healthy substitute."

"reviewBody": "I dislike the sauce that's spread on the pizza. There's something about it that doesn't mesh well with my tastebuds. I did find some shortcuts for this dish that reduce the preparation time, and it also improves the flavor. \n\nInstead of cream cheese, dry ranch dip mix, and mayonnaise, purchase premade vegetable ranch dip and spread that over the crescent rolls. Instead of crescent rolls, which you have to spread out and try to cover the surface as well as stick together, you can purchase pizza dough (Pillsbury makes them and they're on the same shelves as the crescent rolls). This will make it a LOT easier to spread out, and it bakes evenly without lumps. \n\nEnjoy!"

It usually goes pretty fast, and it's easier to eat vegetables this way then trying to spoon some ranch on your paper plate and grabing some carrot sticks. It's also probably less healthy, but who are you trying to kid, no one eats eathing at those things! That being said, I use reduced fat crescent rolls, fat free mayo, and fat free cream cheese when I make these to soften the blow on the calorie front. I haven't had any complaints from the coworkers for switching to the low fat option. I also use red bell pepper instead of tomato. I always make these on cookie sheets, though I think the ones I use are bigger than the 9x13 suggested here. Basic, easy, yummy receipe for your next office party or baby shower."

Then just half the pkg. of ranch, spreads on a little thinner, but who needs that much gunk? If you need more spread, just dont half the recipe, but you can still use all the healthier ingredients!

I have also made it with the Fiesta RAnch dip and I think it adds a bit more flavor. I usually use pillsbury thin crust pizza dough - it holds its form a bit better. The other thing I do to save time is I buy the small bag of broccoli/caul/carrot mixture in the refrig section of the grocery store. It makes it easier to dump it all in my chopper and in 5 minutes my veges are ready. If I have bell pepper, I add it, but if I don't it still tastes great! Red onion added is also good - don't need a lot though."

I used 2 packages of Crescent rolls but cut the mayo and Ranch seasoning roughly in half. I go by taste most of the time and add ingredients gradually. I used one 8 oz container of cream cheese with chive and onion and a few spoonfuls of sour cream. I liked the idea of layering the cheese first and also added a few thinly slice radishes and used heirloom tomatoes. These tomatoes are so good. Again, just sprinkled all of the vegetables over gradually in very thin layers to prevent one flavor dominating and to make eating less messy. This dish is really delicious and beautiful, especially with the colorful tomatoes."
