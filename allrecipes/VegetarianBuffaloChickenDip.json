I had to substitute all vegan products (vegan cream cheese, vegan Ranch dressing and vegan cheddar cheese) as my daughter is vegan and I was making recipes she would be able to eat. I halved the recipe and we were on a time crunch so I just heated dip up in microwave until cheeses were melted and it was heated through. I did mix the cheddar into the dip prior to heating as this is how we like our Buffalo Chicken dip. this turned out wonderful! She absolutely enjoyed it with celery sticks as well as tortilla chips. I liked it a lot, too.!"

I did as a previous poster advised and used TVP and a few more alterations as followed: 3 cups TVP, 16 oz of cream cheese, I made my own ranch dressing (16 oz) and 13 oz of buffalo sauce. I didn’t use a crock or but rather heated everything up in a pan on the stove and placed in the oven until warmed through. The whole family loved it (from Pre teens to 6 year olds)."

I like it hot so the consistency was great for me. I also love cheese so adding a little extra can cool it down too."

"reviewBody": "Everything about this recipe is perfect except that I substituted the \"chik'n strips\" with about 3/4C of TVP flakes which was absolutely perfect. I didn't think that the strips would provide the right texture and the TVP flakes were a good choice (and cheaper). I served it to my unsuspecting meat-eating family and it went completely undetected and there were no left-overs! Everyone loved my \"chicken wing dip\" and no one noticed it wasn't real chicken :-D Even my tofu-hating father had like four helpings!\r\n\r\nFour stars because the chicken substitute tbe recipe calls for is terrible but my fix was perfect :) Try it again with textured vegetable protein flakes if it didn't turn out right for you with the other chicken substitutes. I know it sounds gross but it really is the best. And remember, buffalo wing sauce is NOT the same as hot sauce ;)"

Next time, I will try shredding the chik'n in a food processor instead of just dicing to improve the texture. I will also mix in blue cheese dressing, take out some of the ranch and experiment with different types of cheeses. It was just a little too \"blah\" for me as is."

It's vegetarian, and you can shred it, add it to sour cream, mayo and blue cheese, maybe some diced celery as well and an extra dash of hot sauce for a really great meatless alternative."
