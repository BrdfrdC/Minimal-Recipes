I used only one large onion, 2 teaspoons of garlic powder, 2 teaspoons of onion powder and 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of cumin. I use New Mexico chili powder which is hot. So, I only used 1 teaspoon of chili powder."

Increase the amount of tomato juice if it will be eaten over multiple days. \n-add the crumbles for the last 15 mins. \nYum!"

I also didn’t have tomato juice, so I used veggie stock to water down tomato sauce. It all worked- delicious!"

I made a few minor adjustments, I added one can of chick peas and added 6 tbs of chili powder, I also added only one onion because more then that seemed excessive. As well as excluding the cumin. A very good recipe to go off of and make your own!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe was delicious, but it makes a ton! I would estimate at least 16 X 1 cup servings. This is just me eyeballing it without measuring. I wound up freezing half of it which is future peace of mind for a rainy day. If I could adjust one thing, I would decrease the spiciness, but only by a tad for my palate. Everyone else in my family was OK with the spiciness level. I notice it gets spicier on day two after the flavors marinate overnight in the fridge, so something to keep in mind if you're cooking ahead for company."

I did saute the onions prior to putting them in the stock pot. I also used tomatoes with onion, celery and bell pepper included for flavoring. Some worcestershire sauce helps to develop a meaty flavor."

"reviewBody": "This recipe serves as a great starting point. I prefer to make mine in the crockpot, using dried/soaked beans. For a non-soy option that adds meaty texture, I add finely chopped baby portobello mushrooms. Like other reviewers, I add chopped bell peppers (all colors work great) and fresh garlic, rather than garlic powder. Adding brown sugar and corn a nice variation. I add a half a cup of uncooked quinoa for the last 30 min of cooking time for added nutrition and texture. May need to add 1/2cup of water at this point if the liquid level low in crock.\nLeftovers can make \"Chili Pie.\" Pour chili in rectangular (larger) casserole dish. Cover with layer of shredded cheese, then top with jiffy cornbread mix (prepare mix as directed on box). Bake at 350 until cornbread golden."

I used shallots (5) instead of traditional onions and switched out the red kidney beans for whole kernel corn. I made the chili very colorful and attractive. Also, I didnt have tomatoe juice in my pantry so I used condensed tomatoe soup with the water added and just used half. Again turned out great."

I only used 3 onions which was plenty and I used 2 Tbsp of chili powder, which was enough for us and our young child but I did add 1 small can of diced chili peppers. I planned on adding the fake meat but after getting everything in the pot I decided it really didn't need it. I served it with a bit of cheese sprinkled on top and some chips on the side. So so good!"
