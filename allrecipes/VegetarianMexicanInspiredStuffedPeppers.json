I left out the added salt, but may add some next time to bring out the tomato flavor a bit more. As others said, this makes quite a bit of filling! I’ll use the extra in low-carb tortillas. Only 6 points on WW!\n\nThis would also be yummy with some ground chicken breast added in for extra protein."

Also, sautéed some of the pepper tops (chopped) that were sliced off along, a few chopped mushrooms and with minced garlic with the onions. I used yellow and red peppers (that's what I had). I also had quite a bit of filling leftover and am enjoying them as a filler in tortillas a few days later! A tad of sour cream on top makes it even better!"

"reviewBody": "This is fabulous! I hate to make adjustments the first time I make something because I then question how accurate my review is but, based on several reviews, I made a few adjustments (some out of necessity &amp; some because of personal preference) but I think this recipe is foolproof. It will become a regular in our house.\nSo, based on previous reviews, I made the following changes: 1) I used quinoa instead of rice to add more protein; 2) I pre-baked the peppers instead of boiling them since that was easier (350-degrees for 15-20 minutes); 3) Sautéed the onions &amp; 3 cloves of garlic instead of garlic salt because I prefer real garlic; 4) Couldn't find tomatoes w/chili in store so used plain petite cut tomatoes and added a bit more chili powder and 1/2 jar of salsa. I wanted to make 6 servings instead of 4 so made more Quinoa thinking I would need it. No! I only needed 2 C of quinoa &amp; the half jar of salsa and I had enough for 7 or 8 peppers. I use the extra to as a rolled tortilla for a quick and easy lunch. This is fantastic! Thank you for sharing."

"reviewBody": "I used Quinoa instead of rice as I had just cooked a batch of it. I used plain water to boil the peppers, used fresh garlic and omitted the salt and it was still plenty salty for me with the salt in the canned tomato and beans. Plus I did substitute some canned corn for part of the quinoa. Used dairy free cheese as milk bothers my allergies. Was very good but tricky to eat so since we had to chop it up on the plate decided next time I will just forget stuffing the peppers, just dice them up and make a casserole! I used all organic ingredients so was a successful vegan meal! Even my picky husband liked it!"

"reviewBody": "This was 5 stars with my changes, as copied from other users. I baked the peppers at 350 for 15 minutes and this was a game-changer. It mellowed out the flavor and softened them up for my family who doesn't love peppers as much. I used a clove of garlic with the onion, used brown rice, increased cumin to 1 tsp, and instead of the can of tomato sauce, I had some leftover Aldi brand spaghetti sauce and put at least a 1/2 cup in the rice mixture and more on top before baking. This sweetened it up a bit, but it was so yummy. I've made several variations of stuffed peppers and this so far was the family's favorite!"

I also added a couple of jalapenos and fresh garlic. \nI liked to pre-boil method and I didn't think the flavor of the peppers suffered as a result. The texture of the peppers were just right, not too soft. \nWe will definitely be making these again."
