Topped with cheddar/pepper jack mixture. Didn't use the full two cups of cheese in the cheese layer, probably 1 3/4 cup."

"reviewBody": "One of the best recipes I have tried from here....it's delicious!! Made a few adaptations to make putting the casserole together a bit easier. Used 3/4 tsp crushed red pepper instead of jalapeno. Next time I might cut back to 1/2 tsp. I used 2 tsp chopped garlic from a jar. I suggest using chunky salsa that is refrigerated at the store. I also added a bit of brown sugar to the salsa to pacify some of the acidity of the tomatoes. I substituted cottage cheese for the ricotta. Makes the cheese layer so much easier to spread. The recipe makes a large casserole and it does freeze well. BIg hit with my husband and neighbor."

Changes I made: extra red bell pepper, about 1/2 cup extra pepper jack cheese on top and 2oz extra enchilada sauce (the can was 10oz). I’ll definitely prepare this dish again."

I have to prepare low fat, low salt meals."

The ratio of veggies and cheese and corn tortillas is perfect ! The enchilada sauce and salsa you use can vary the flavors to your liking, which is perfect. I used green enchilada sauce, next time I will try using red."
