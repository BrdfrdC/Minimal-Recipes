"reviewBody": "I made this as written for the most part with the following exceptions: I chose to add some broccoli and cauliflower because I wanted more veggies. Even though the restaurants do fry the tofu before adding to the soup as the recipe calls for, I personally don’t like the texture; therefore, I skipped the frying step. If you have trouble finding enoki mushrooms, look for an Asian market/grocery in your area. It’s a very common ingredient in Asian cuisines, and an Asian market will have them."
