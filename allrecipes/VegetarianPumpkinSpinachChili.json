My husband said that it tasted better the next day, but I really had a difficult time eating it (I gave it two, instead of one star because my husband found it edible). It looked like it had potential, but I really don't know what I would do to even doctor it up!"

Well, it's certainly different... I literally couldn't eat it, and I will usually eat stuff that turns out badly because I'm too cheap to waste food if it's edible. This did not qualify as edible, in my opinion."

I think it has potential though. \n\n\nI adapted things a bit: I used fresh tomatoes (skins removed) instead of canned, fresh pumpkin instead of canned. I used butter beans because i couldn't find fava beans. \n\nI thought the pumpkin pie spice was too strong. I was going to omit the meatless crumbles but decided to add them in hopes of taming the pie spice and salvage it. Unfortunately I anticipated loving this and double it to freeze. It is very healthy so i gave it 4 stars."

I didn't think they pumpkin pie spice was overpowering at all, &amp; in my opinion, it could have used more. I also had to salt &amp; pepper it more at the end. I wish this had more reviews; it's a good &amp; easy dish!"

So, yes it was that simple. And I even strayed from the recipe--another first! \nWe added a can of corn, a can of black beans, nutmeg and cinnamon. \nIt had amazing texture, and a great combination of sweet/spicy! Definitely making this again!"

"reviewBody": "This could be an awesome dish with a few tweaks. I had trouble mixing the ingredients because there simply wasn't enough liquid - I ended up adding 8 cups of water just to get the ingredients to mix. I couldn't find fava beans in my area so I substituted butter beans. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice in the house so I made my own from nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger and clove, making sure to use only 1 TBS of my spice mixture. I added double the chili powder. In the end, the dish was terribly underflavored. Adding salt at the table helped but wasn't enough. Next time I make this I will quadruple the chili powder, double the black pepper and add a bit of cayenne. I will also probably quadruple the amount of vegetable juice and add vegetable broth as well. Additionally I will add more spinach - we like spinach."

It has a very different taste, and plenty of spice. We couldn't find fava beans, so I used garbanzo beans, and they tasted really good! I couldn't even taste the veggie meat, but it's healthy and was definitely in there! This tastes good on a cool fall or winter night."

"reviewBody": "Not bad. Definitely something that can be tweaked (and probably should). The best part was the smell of the house! Most of the vegetables can be swapped based on your tastes. The one change I would definitely make for next time is to reduce to 1 tbsp pumpkin spice. I found it fairly overwhelming and by the end of the dish I felt quite saturated by spice. My wife seemed to enjoy it more than I did so I may make it again in the future (though she agreed...too spicy)."
