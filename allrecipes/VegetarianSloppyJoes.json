That being said, I'm totally going to be that guy who made something very different from what the recipe says to do...\n\nI made my own unseasoned marinara to serve as the base. Dice a tomato or two, an onion and some garlic. Mix in tomato paste and a touch of water. Then season that sauce with the spices listed in this recipe until it tastes that way that you want it to taste. I didn't use Worcestershire sauce. I used Bragg's amino acids instead. I do think it would be better the next time with a touch of brown sugar. \n\nI used the fake crumbly hamburger meat stuff instead of the tempe. I mixed in some fresh black and pinto beans that i cooked in my pressure cooker. I used some green and red pepper. I served on a fresh organic ciabatta roll that I found in my grocery store's bakery. \n\nThis is totally in the rotation."

I tend to do less tempeh and more onion and bell pepper just because I like to load up on veggies where I can as well. I always double the garlic in any recipe too. Other than that, the flavors are spot on and this is a GREAT vegetarian alternative - and we're not even vegetarian! ;)"

"reviewBody": "In the end the general consensus in my house was that this was pretty good, but probably won't be made again because the 20g of fat is more than we would like, not because it wasn't good though. It did need a few modifications. After I had followed the recipe exactly and sampled the results I was pretty disappointed. As other reviewers have said it needed more tomato sauce, and I added about an extra tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. It was terribly dry and definitely did not resemble any sloppy joe I had ever had. With the additions it was much better, and as leftovers actually seemed to be much more tasty than the initial serving."

"reviewBody": "I had just bought my vegetarian worshtishire sauce and was surfing for a recipe to try it on... and voila'. This recipe whips up quickly. It's been over 14 years since I had a sloppy joe, but this certainly reminded me of what I used to enjoy. Small amount of clean up involved- the flavors are good with sweet initial flavor and a spicy aftertaste. I agree with another reviewer, my 8 year old thought it was too spicy, though I thought it was perfect. (I'm a mild salsa type gal). Very good flavor, I don't think it could pass as the real deal but certainly will pass this on to EVERY vegetarian/vegan I know (I think vegan use br. sugar in lieu of honey). I used MorningStar for my tempeh/meat substitute."

I left out the celery seed since I didn't have that on hand, either, and I used vegan worchestershire sauce. This would be a great quick weeknight meal!"
