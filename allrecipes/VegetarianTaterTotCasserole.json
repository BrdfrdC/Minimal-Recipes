I used \"crispy\" tots and substituted cream of chicken soup. I topped it all with Funyuns. This version is quite bland, but could be easily amended with a few stalks of chopped celery, chopped olives, or even a can of green chilies!"

"reviewBody": "I did everything just like the recipe stated - exactly - but It was awful. First off, the tots were cold inside. Second, the gloopy ‚Äúsauce‚Äù stayed gloopy. It did not thin out to run in between the potatoes and just stayed on top like a hat. The onions on top charred. Taste was also rather one sided - sour cream. You couldn‚Äôt taste the mushroom soup at all, nor any of the cheese, as it was overshadowed by the sour cream. If I were to ever try this again, I would make a mushroom sauce from scratch with a B√©chamel base and make sure it coated all the tots. The onions would go on top towards the end of the baking, along with some extra cheese to give it a bit more flavor. Not a fan of this, though."

I believe my husband even had three helpings.\n\nI added extra cheese on top before the fried onions because we love cheese. I also added in frozen broccoli for some veggies. This was so good with ketchup (in my house we love ketchup too). \n\nIt is extremely rich and heavy but so good. I would pair it with a salad or steamed veggies or even some grilled chicken.\n\nWhen I make it again, which I will, instead of just pouring the mixture on top, I will mix it into the tater tots because some of the bottom ones weren‚Äôt smothered."

I think that this could be a 5 star recipe just by adding an ingredient of personal preference as many other reviewers have done. I‚Äôll try adding beans and or cheese next time. I also will wait to sprinkle the onion on top until the last 15 minutes of cooking to prevent over browning. I will make this again with a few modifications. Thank you for sharing your recipe!"

"reviewBody": "This was stellar. The only reason it did not get 5 stars is that there was some modifications required. First off: Brown a pound of burger with some onions. I used a third of a red onion and that was enough. Double the cheese in the mix in the bowl. I used probably 2/3 of the recommended amount of sour cream. Use more or less. Either way will be fine.\n\nDrop the burger in the bowl and stir. Add 1/2 the french fried onions when done mixing the burger in the bowl. Spoon and spread the mix in the pan and cover the tots. Spread the remaining FF onions over the top. Sixty minutes plus 10 was required at 350. Make this. You will not regret it!"

I'm usually not one to make alot of substitutions because then it becomes another recipe? But I did, and it turned out great! The only ingredient I didn't change because I had on hand was the cheddar cheese. My subs were, Greek yogurt for the sour cream, cream of chicken for the mushroom, homemade caramelized onions for the French fried onions, and French's crispy jalape√±os just because.\nIt was delicious and I intend to make the original next time!

After some attempts I swapped out the cream of mushroom for a good, buttermilk-based ranch (Ocharleys or litehouse) and added a layer of American Cheese over the top (before adding the onions). I feel like there is a lot you could do to this (bacon, broccoli, shredded chicken or beef) but it‚Äôs perfectly great as is. This doubles as a good family comfort meal or the office/church potluck hit."

I use onion flavored tater tots for a little extra oomph to the dish. For the cream of mushroom soup I have used cream of chicken, celery or onion on occasion. They all tasted fantastic! I also add a can of french sliced green beans (drained) to the sauce mix. It lets me imagine that its a little bit healthier and the flavors go well together! I also add a tiny bit of milk to thin the sauce out just a bit so it can get inbetween all the tater tots and not sit on top of them. Overall an awesome recipe!"

"reviewBody": "It was good, but not satisfying. Personally, I think it needed salt, pepper and garlic powder. my son liked it a lot. I also think the sauce to potato ratio is a bit large, so maybe cut down on the sour cream and calories at the same time. I think I would make it again if I had the ingredients, but probably would have to improvise a little"

"reviewBody": "How my husband made it through a 1970s childhood without trying this dish is beyond me! I just made him his first Tater Tot Casserole yesterday, using this recipe. I lined the dish with parchment paper, then warmed half the tater tots and smashed them in the bottom of the casserole dish to make a solid potato layer. I added a pound of already browned meat and onions, then a cup of cheese, a sprinkling of the French Fried onions, then the cream sauce. I topped the cream sauce with the remaining tots, the rest of the shredded cheese, and some more French Fried onions. He LOVED it. Thanks for the great improvements on what was always a childhood favorite of mine!"

Would actually double by putting another layer of food,tater tots,veggies ,kielbasa, seasonings,sour cream/soup mixture next time. My husband wanted leftovers of this.:) This seems like a great dish to take to a potluck."

So, next time I will use less. I did use a double batch of \"Mexican\" mix shredded cheese. I don't think it would make all that much of a difference in the taste. Many reviews have said to/and have used double the amount;but I would go as far as using triple amount with the last \"cup\" spread over the top."

"reviewBody": "The ultimate in comfort food! This dish brings me back to my childhood...even my college sorority cook made this. This version is definitely better. After finding this recipe and making this many, many times now, I make the following changes: brown a pound of 93/7 hamburger, seasoned with garlic powder, pepper, and half an onion; no grease to drain! I brown an entire bag of crispy crowns instead of regular tots. I layer the hamburger meat over the crispy crowns, then spread the soup mixture, which incorporates the top reviewer's suggestion to add more sharp cheddar than called for, some French fried onions, and I also season the mixture with additional spices to my liking (garlic &amp; onion powders, a little paprika and pepper). I also use the Roasted Garlic Cream of Mushroom soup and the entire 16 oz container of sour cream. It's thick and creamy and using the back of a spoon, it spreads easier than you think. So what if the hamburger is mixed in? Top that with some additional cheese and bake 35-40 minutes at 350. 1-2 minutes before it's done, I sprinkle a few more French fried onions on the top and turn the oven to broil. After taking it out, let it sit for 10 minutes. Perfection! Now, if only my husband would let me add some green beans to the mix...."

Next time (and there will be a next time) I'll add 1/4C of milk to the soup/sour cream (to start) because the soup/sour cream mixture was quite thick and, once it started cooling down on the table, it started to congeal. My husband LOVED this which is weird b/c he doesn't \"love\" any food and in particular he's not much of a sour cream fan (he had no idea there was sour cream in this dish). I served w/a fried swiss chard &amp; spinach mixture and I'm glad I did because all the richness needed a counterpoint. A salad would be good to serve with this also... this would also be a good side (except it makes a LOT) to a (healthy) meal. Very good!"
