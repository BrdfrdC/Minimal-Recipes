I did not have any red wine on hand so I substituted red wine vinegar and water mixture at 1:1 ratio. I left out the sugar and was glade I did because the red wine vinegar gave it a nice sweet flavor without the added sugar. I will definitely be making this again."

"reviewBody": "This pretty much tastes like Italian, what with the tomato and oregano and all. I do not know what Quorn is, so I substituted tofu using the following methodology: Press a block of extra firm tofu in a kitchen towel to get as much water out as possible. Cut into half inch cubes. Coat cubes in a mixture of 3T firmly packed brown sugar, 1T paprika, and 1/4t ground ginger powder. Bake in 400F oven on parchment until edges get firm. Mix into recipe where Quorn is used. Also, I used a can of \"Pear tomato strips in puree and basil\", Great Value brand from Wal-Mart, then left out the tomato puree addition. Served over spiral noodles. This was easy, satisfying, not too strange for my husband, so I'll make again."

Also didn't have any whole canned tomatoes so I just used chopped ones. I omitted the sugar in the end, and used a bit more tomato puree for sweetness. Having read other reviews, I added about 1 tsp of carraway seeds, which was a great touch. I also added a handful of frozen green beans. I doubled the recipe and it made four standards size portions. This is a great dish that I will be making many more times!"

But it was still really tasty and since I almost always have these ingredients at hand, I will definitely be making this quite often. I think the only change I'd make next time is I might perhaps use a wee bit less wine. :)"

"reviewBody": "This is a great vegetarian recipe, though like most reviewers I made it with mushrooms (portabella caps) instead of Quorn. As written, I thought it was missing a little something as I tasted it cooking. So I added more (LOTS more) paprika and a dash of cayenne (since I've never been able to find good hot Hungarian paprika). That added measurably, but it was still missing a note. Finally, when I reheated some leftovers, I added some caraway -- and that made the dish shine! NOTE: This recipe makes about double what I'd call \"2 servings.\" YMMV."
