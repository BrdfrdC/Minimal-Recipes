Once you flip the pate out of a baking tin, it loses the nice baked brown color. Very good appetizer for a vegeterian/vegan guest."

I also just made it with leftover veggies from an autumnal stew, which included squash and ginger. It's still really good. The nutritional yeast and sunflower seeds give it a rich, creamy, savory flavor that's delicious. My friends love it."

I will make this again with a slight change in the spice mixture. Also thanks to the person that said they used their blender as I don't have a processor. I just made sure to add the veggies and liquid first before the flour etc. Also I used chickpea flour and it worked great."

I also added 1/2 tsp creole seasoning (Tony Thachery Creole seasoning. Sorry, I put it on everything). It was delicious, but it was even better after 2 days in the fridge. Thanks for the recipe."

I served it w/ homemade whole meal bread and green salad. It's a lot of paté. We are just 2 people and in spite of beeing a lot I had to hide some away so DH would not pig ou and finish everything at once :) This is addictive!"

This recipe yields the equivalent of 4 of those little Fontaine Sante packs and I calculated it costs around $6 to make (vs almost $16 for 4 packs of commercial paté!)\nOne little thing: next time i'll go with only 1 cup of water maximum instead of 1 1/2 for a denser texture."

I made this recipe to precision but next time, I'll probably try something different with it since it seems to be a base recipe with a few extra herbs added. I'm thinking along the lines of curry powders and poultry spice mixes... even though I'm a vegetarian. I think this could very easily take on the smells and flavours of a Thanksgiving meal."

"reviewBody": "I've been making this dish and its variants for decades, and it's a local favorite in Quebec. The choice of yeast is a critical element. In Quebec, torula yeast is fairly common, but in the states people in stores look quizzically at you when you ask for it. Some Asian markets carry it. If you can't find it, look for a primary yeast grown on molasses for the best flavor."

I'll defintely be making this one over and over again."

I also only put in 1/4 cup of oil to reduce the fat content, especially since I used peanuts. Other then that I followed the recipe pretty close and found that it actually makes 4 cups (before being cooked) so I divided it into four different containers, baked one and froze the other three. After baking let it cool to room temp and it can be shaped into a ball or log for a nice presentation, sprinkle top with dried parsley and paprika too. Next time I will add some cayenne pepper for a little extra zip. Thanks for the recipe!"
