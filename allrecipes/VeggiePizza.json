I've made some adjustments to my pizza: instead of a full pie, I've only did half of the crescent roll. Instead of a full packet, I've used half of the sour cream, skipped celery (don't like it), used orange instead of red peppers, and let it chill for 15 minutes. Delish! I would make it again-though I didn't make it twice. An error over here."

"reviewBody": "Made this for family and work about 5x. I highly recommend as years later they remember how good this recipe is. The day before I mix the ‘sauce’ ingredients to allow it to permeate. The night before, I cook 2 tubes of crescent rolls on a 12x18” cookie sheet and cut into 18 pcs. It can be challenging to stretch it evenly. I like to made things proportional (the tedious part) so I give myself enough time to cut the toppings perfect and to make sure the rinsed broccoli etc. isn’t dripping wet. For transporting, I place another cookie sheet inverted over it and strap tape around it. Then I time how long it takes people to eat all 2 of them. My own sister told me last month that it is good which is surprising to her because it is full of ingredients she doesn’t like, but all together..."

If you don't like raw broccoli, you can steam it a few minutes, ice to chill and then chop. To the review who commented that without a chopper it's a lot of time, it's true, but thats what cooking is about. It's a dish that you can also have family &amp; friends chop to turn into a group activity. You can also divide it into halves or thirds, so my husband &amp; I could enjoy mushrooms and olives but my daughter could have twice the carrots and added some shredded cheese. We also cut with a pizzia cutter."

Now when I make it I always use a pizza crust, bake it for 10-12 minutes allow it to cool then add my toppings. The topping are interchangeable and can be adapted to what is in season. I've even in a last minute pinch omitted the sour cream but in that case I felt the cream cheese layer was a little over powering. Every time I make it I top it with a little grated cheddar cheese (~1/4 c). Love it!! Thank you for the excellent crowd pleasing appetizer."

Re: the mixture. We mixed to taste. Basically, we combined all the ingredients in smaller amounts and then continued to add to the mixture according to our preference. All in all, this makes for an easy, and yummy, meal that the kids can help prepare and, amazingly, eat (with no complaints)."

I baked the crust, chopped the veggies and mixed up the \"sauce\". I then refrigerated overnight in separate containers so nothing got soggy. Layered it all together in the morning and stuck it in the fridge at church for approximately 3 hours till lunch time. Everyone loved it! I got tons of compliments!"

I did exactly as directed, except I used 3 cans of crescent rolls and made a very large pizza, and had enough left over to make a small pizza for myself and kids before the party. There was just enough cream left for it. Glad we got to eat that, cause by the time we got through the line to get food, the pan was polished clean. I also added a large spoonful of mayonaise to the cream mixture to improve flavor and used my own variety of vegetables including tomatoes, onion, red bell pepper, broccoli, carrot and shredded cheddar. Everyone raved about how good it was."

Good enough to serve at my party, but I won't be making this again. I once had a veggie pizza years ago and it was delicious this one not so much."
