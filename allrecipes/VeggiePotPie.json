I replaced the carrot with butternut squash because that's what I needed to use up, and it worked great. I agree with others to cut down on the amount of pepper. Adding the soy sauce makes it flavorful but I think next time I'm going to try Worcestershire. Just two of us so got to enjoy leftovers!"

Made a few changes to fit what was in my fridge and pantry: had only one potato, and thought it enough; used flour (about 1/3 c) instead of cornstarch to thicken; used refrigerated piecrust (top only); added frozen peas (about 1 c); added a tbsp butter with less oil to saute onions and mushrooms; used combo chicken and vegetable broth (needed to use up the chicken broth!). I was ready to pour the cooked veggies into the pie plate and saw the cauliflower still sitting on the counter. I blanched it for a couple of minutes and added it in - no prob. I also blanched the carrots, celery and potatoes in the beginning. Very good!"

Thanks for the recipe and comments.\nAside from one or two veggies I had to substitute for what was in my fridge and adding 4-tablespoons of corn starch all the ingredients were the same.I used a veggie paste I bought at Costco — Better Than Bullion It’s already spiced so nothing else to add and it’s much cheaper, better flavour, and smaller to store. Yes, it took a long time chopping and dicing but since I didn’t measure the veggies I had enough for at least another pie or on rice or to freeze."

I had many of the veggies in the recipe on hand: onions, garlic, potato, cauliflower (purple), carrots; didn't have mushrooms, celery, or green beans, but added some peas from the freezer. With just the soy sauce, salt/pepper, and veggie broth, this was rich with flavor and filling. All four family members loved it, including 2 teenagers. Will definitely be a regular for us."

In addition to the sauce in the recipe, I added one can of cream of mushroom soup and 1.5 cans of broth to veggies (potatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, celery - which I cooked until soft) instead of the 3 cups of broth (I also used broth in the sauce instead of water and increased cornstarch to 4 tablespoons). I added some great all purpose seasoning mix (\"Seasoning for All the Things from Imperfect Foods) and baked it in a cast iron skillet. Was using a pie crust mix I've never used before (mistake). I opted to do a crumble style top crust out of convenience and it was so good! I had leftover filling and made another one today. So good! the crumble crust means every bite has a bit of crunchy crust. I give 4 stars bc I altered the recipe. I am certain the original recipe is far too runny."

I use Pillsbury ready crust and frozen cauliflower, carrots, green beans, corn (whatever veggies you prefer). I just sautéed the fresh veggies first and mixed in partially thawed frozen veggies into the broth to heat through. Make sure to cut your potatoes into small chunks so they cook well. A little extra corn starch is needed to make the filling less runny. I was able to prep the filling the night before and then toss in the ready made crust the following night after work. We freeze the leftovers in individual pieces for quick college girl meals."

However I will agree that the filling was a bit runny, I served it kind of “deconstructed” - I’m not sure if you could double the cornstarch or something, I tried to add some more in before I poured it into the pan but it got a little clumpy. So flavor = awesome but if you’re trying to impress your guests with presentation I would either play with the consistency to thicken it up or maybe make individual servings in ramekins. Will make again!"

I used all the same veggies only used just a tad more of everything so more water might have gotten soaked up and i added about a cup or more of frozen peas. I also cooked the bottom crust at 400 for about 10 minutes and popped the bubbles every 5 minutes. After filling it i put the top crust on and cooked it at 400 for 20-30minutes i let it sit until it thickened more. This is my new favorite recipe"

But the great thing about this recipe is that you can easily change up the veggies to use what you have on hand. The seasonings are pretty much perfect as is, IMO, but I have also tried subbing worcestershire sauce for the soy sauce and adding thyme to give it more of a \"fall\" taste, and it was really, really good. I always make my pies with an all-butter homemade crust, because that is what I like. But you can easily use any kind of crust, even a store-bought, and this recipe will still taste great!"

The only changes I made were to leave out the garlic and use four tablespoons of cornstarch as suggested by other reviewers who found the consistency too thin. Extending the cooking time for thickening from 3 minutes to 6 or 7 and cooling the pie for one half hour before eating, produced a very nice result. My husband and I loved the flavor and we will add it to our favorites list. I am planning to freeze half of the pie for the future."

Instead I added parsnips (3) and a small amount of sweet potato. \nI also added sage to the seasoning, and changed the veggie broth to 2 cups broth and 1 cup white wine. \nI followed the pie crust exactly and then pre-cooked it for about 10 minutes as the first time the pie was soggy. \nOverall this is a great recipe that is easy to play around with...and best of all my meat loving boyfriend says it has flavour!"

"reviewBody": "I made this into 6 individual sized pies, and they turned out wonderfully! It was just the right amount of filling for the 6 small pot pie pans, and I used the Crust for Veggie Pot pie recipe also on this site. I baked them in the oven until they were finished all the way, and then froze and individually vacuum sealed each pie. Since the hubby refuses to eat veggies, I'm the only one who will enjoy these, so I take out one at a time to defrost in the fridge and reheat in the oven. They are SO delicious, and such a perfect meal for a cool Autumn or Winter day.\n\nI wouldn't classify this as an easy recipe, by any means. Mainly due to the labor of the crusts, and assembling all of the little pies. But they are so worth the effort to have the meal already put together, and just needing to be heated up. I doubled the recipe for crust, to have enough for both the bottom and top full crusts for the pies.\n\nI am not sure how just assembling and then immediately freezing (without baking first) them would have turned out in comparison to what I did, but I would guess that you could just freeze the uncooked version to bake all the way later. It may take more time in the oven at that point, though, and by the time I put one of these little pies in the oven, I am not prepared to wait very long until I can eat it! \n\n I did personalize the ingredients for my own tastes, and for what I had on hand, and put some \"No-chicken\" broth powder into making the crust, which I HIGHLY recommend, since it"

It's warm and satisfying and just plain yummy. Thank you for a wonderful go to veggie/non veggie recipe. P.S we use ready made pie crust like Pillsbury, just to make it easier."

"reviewBody": "This works well as written, and can serve as a starting point for variations, depending on available vegetables, the wish (or not) to add a mock-meat of some kind, the wish to make a more specific flavor by adding (e.g.) garam masala, paprika, chili powder, etc. On my first use, I filled the pie shell pretty full, and it took 40-45 minutes to reach pie-brown. I was very fond of pot pie in the days before I adopted a vegetarian diet; I’ve not often found a good vegetable pot-pie in a restaurant or in a grocery store. This one satisfies my craving. My wife commented that it brought back childhood memories (g); for me it was perhaps more starving-student-day memories. My terrier begged for seconds, so the lack of meat was obviously not an issue! I think it can be served to meat-eaters without apology."
