Everyone raved, even my 7 year-old who is an extremely picky eater. The spices are just right. I didn't think they were too hot and my husband even added hot sauce on his. I served them with sour cream and \"fiesta\" cheese blend. What was great is that I did the prep work in the late afternoon and put the meat in the fridge to marinate, went and picked up kids from activities and then was able to cook everything when my husband got home from work. We will definitely do this recipe again."

So the second time I just cut it in half, and it was perfect! I would not knock it down a star just because of the heat because I did like it both ways and my family also liked it both ways. I would not change the recipe at all but go ahead and add whatever toppings you would like. Can't wait to eat the leftovers LOL"

I put it in a vacuum packed bag to help it absorb. It worked out well.A little tip, I doubled the recipe and made a second bag of meat for those evenings when pressed for time. I vacuum packed it &amp; stored it in the freezer. Spices and oil are already inside. The next time all I have to do is thaw &amp; cut up my vegetables and I’m ready to cook them up."

Personally I would leave out the oregano next time . \n\nUpdate: Used this recipe again today, without the oregano and half the cayenne, for chicken fajitas on the grill. Grilled the peppers and onions in a cast iron pan then added the grilled chicken strips. Before taking off the grill I squeezed a 1/4 lime onto everything. These were outstanding. Upgraded it to five stars!"

I used the fajita seasoning as a dry rub let it sit, then slipped it in my traditional fajita marinade to chill overnight.

Came out extremely flavorful as I cooked down the marinade with the onions and peppers. This will definitely go into the rotation again once our freezer is stocked again.

"reviewBody": "We use venison all through the year and I am always looking for new ways to use it up. The seasoning blend on these fajitas are amazing. It is warm, full of flavor and I might even say succulent. I LOVE this recipe! My family loved it too. The only difference I made was on how I cooked it. Since my meat was partially frozen I mixed it in a stone baking dish with 2 TB olive oil and the seasoning. I let it cook bake on low (250) for about an hour then added a can of diced tomatoes and some sauteed peppers, onion(in olive oil) to the meat and let it cook for about another 30min on 350. Wonderful! I am making them again tonight! Thanks for sharing this recipe."

The only change we did was we didn't think the seasoning/marinade was enough so we used half of what it called for the marinade and added 1/2 pkg of Lowry's fajita seasoning, refrigerated overnight and cooked the next evening. We can't wait to have this again!"

ENJOY PS: I am not a huge fan of game meat, however if you soak it in milk for about 2 hrs prior to the marinade tastes close beef tenderloin"

"reviewBody": "This provides a good basic approach, but can be helped along by adding some of the following (like around at LEAST 1/2 teaspoon of EACH): Epazote; Adobo powder; Ground Cumin; Ground Ancho Chili Pepper; Ground Red Chipotle; and the juice of one lime. {I use Penzeys spices; but I imagine other brands would be fine, too.} Should mention, too, that it should all be served with diced tomatoes, sour cream, shredded Mex-blend cheese OR cheddar, salsa (green and/or red), and refried beans. I use a food Saver (vacuum packer to facilitate the marination.) Ouch. Now I'm hungry and it's only 10am!"

I only made it for myself so I had to scale back everything. I got it pretty close, I had to use hard taco shells since I didn't have soft ones. I put cheese on top of it and now it's almost like a taco but with venison. It has a little kick to it maybe a little to much but I think I just added more than I should have :) Pretty tasty I'll have to try it again."

I did add mushrooms to the pepper and onion mixture.\n\nI will make these again, but I will be more careful when measuring! I made a mistake and used too much cayenne. My sons were able to eat it, but the oldest mouth was burning! Grumpy \"grumped\" because he hates that \"mexican food\" but he ate it anyway. These get 5 stars because I loved them and my youngest son loved them - even with too much heat! My oldest son would have liked them more if I hadn't messed up the cayenne...."
