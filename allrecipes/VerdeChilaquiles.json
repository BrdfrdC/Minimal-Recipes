"reviewBody": "This dish was labeled \"Fun!\" by husband and both sons gave permission to make it again sometime. Two of these guys forbid any use of cilantro, however and I don't think Cotija cheese adds much either, so neither of these ingredients were used. I might also reduce the number of chips to 8 oz instead of 10 oz. since it was a bit on the \"chip-py\" side. I did put chopped avocado on top which added great color. Hubby might want the radishes on top for himself next time."
