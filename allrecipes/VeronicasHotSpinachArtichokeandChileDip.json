Sometimes, depending on the crowd and/or simply what you have on hand, recipes don't always get followed to the letter...so here goes....\n\nI made this for my daughter who at 43 years old still hasn't managed to get over her childhood hate of spinach! That said, I left it out, but doubled the artichokes instead, using bottoms rather than hearts as this is what was in the cupboard. And not being a fan of mayonnaise, I substituted the same amount of sour cream as a replacement. \n\nThe dip was a huge hit at her party and was gobbled up fast! For \"crackers,\" I thinly sliced a fresh baguette, brushed each piece with olive oil, and baked for about 10 minutes. YUM!"

I made half what the recipe called for and it was perfect for a party of six. I did, however, use 3/4 of the 8 oz box of spinach - My guests told me the dip was restaurant quality.

"reviewBody": "Wow. This is really great. I don't like to use frozen spinach so I wilted my own. I chopped 2 pounds of baby spinach and wilted in 1 tablespoon of olive oil with a pinch of salt. Then drain in a colander while I prepared everything else. I substituted 1/2 of the mayo for sour cream. also added a tablespoon or so of chopped garlic. Once I had it in the baking dish, I sprinkled the top with parmesan so that it would get a nice brown crust. Served with French bread slices that I toasted with oil."

"reviewBody": "I made this tonight for my brother in laws 50th birthday party. It was a crowd pleaser! The only things I changed was halving the amount of mayonnaise and substituting it with sour cream. I also added 1 additional (6.5 oz) jar of artichokes per my preference. I forgot to take my cream cheese out to soften so I put it in the microwave for about 30 seconds and then added the mayo and sour cream, folding it over until it was smooth. Hands down the best Spinach Artichoke dip I have ever tasted, and I am quite the connoisseur of this dip. I also put this in a slow cooker on high for 1 hour and then turned it down low for another 2 before the party. I will definitely be making this again."

I served it in sough dough bread bowls and there wasn't even a piece of crust left.\n\nI also used Romano instead of Parmesan, but that's simply a personal preference."

I didn't think I'd be able to handle the spice of the jalapenos (I used canned this time and I normally make sure to get all the seeds and membrane out - I'm a wuss) but it was delicious! The cream cheese cut down on the spice nicely. I added a few cloves of minced garlic, half a cup of sour cream and a little bit of onion powder. Also a little extra spinach, and mozza cheese (just because my parmesan was expired). This is my new favourite dip! It has a nice kick without being too spicy. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!!"

"reviewBody": "Excellent. It would be difficult to come across another spinach/artichoke/jalapeno recipe that was better than this. A couple of changes I made, just because I didn't feel like grating fresh cheese, I just bought a bag of generic walmart shredded parmesan cheese. Still melted in all nicely, and made it easier. Also, I like a little more \"hot\" jalapeno dices, so I put a little more in mine. I also used half mayo half sour cream, and sprinkled some garlic powder in it. The overall change, I'm sure, was negligible. Easy and very very tasty. It made more than I expected, and me and the 3 kids ate every last bite. Thanks."

Use extra jalapenos with a touch of the juice &amp; artichokes in ours. Can sub canned spinach which is quicker to remove liquids. We are garlic fanatics so we add either dried or fresh depending on what is at hand. Also use shredded Italian blend cheese if no yogurt to add flavor ."

The second time, though, based on other reviewer's suggestions and my own personal preferences I did switch it up a bit. I used half mayo, and half sour cream. I used fresh diced jalapeños because I love them, and threw in some real lump crab. Because of the lack of vinegar from the pickled jalapeños, I added some garlic salt and Old Bay seasoning to taste for a little extra kick. Let me just say that with my changes this dip was PHENOMENAL!!! Easily a new favorite. :)"
