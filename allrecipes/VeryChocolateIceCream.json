"reviewBody": "This was my first time making chocolate ice cream and I was a bit nervous. But instead of using a recipe that ommitted the eggs, I decided I could handle one that had them. And I think I did great! However, I'm REALLY happy I took the advice of another reviewer and used a sieve/strainer to pour the mixture through before putting it in the fridge. I had thought I'd combined the eggs and chocolate perfectly but nope, a small amount of my eggs had scrambled. Had I not used a seive, that would've grossly ended up in my ice cream. My only suggestion to the receipe would be to maybe add this information up top as well. I also deviated a tiny bit by adding an extra half-teaspoon of cocoa powder. Bit of a mistake, lol. Unless you are just the biggest chcolate lover out there, it's not needed, and that's with me buying very cheap cocoa powder and store-brand semi-sweet baking chocolate. I finished my ice cream off by scooping it into a chilled bowl (ironically, a chocolate ice cream container I'd saved) and every few scoops, I added some chopped Reese's. While I'm actually not crazy about my Reese's addition, the chocolate ice cream is delicious. Will definitely be making this again."

I added a bit more chocolate and it froze really fast, only took my cheap little machine 15 minutes to freeze it. The cannister has been in the freezer for a couple of days, and that really made a difference. Love, love love this recipe, can't believe how easy it is."

"reviewBody": "This is a good recipe and make a very rich, very chocolate-y ice cream. I did tweak a couple of things, though. I used about 3 ounces of Ghiradelli 60% chocolate. I used a thermometer when cooking the custard (custards scare me) and heated it to about 170F, then poured it through a sieve into a bowl to cool. The sieve did indeed catch some bits - whether they were egg bits or bits of cocoa powder, i'm not sure. The ice cream froze well in my Cuisinart ice cream maker after about 30 minutes, and then i threw in a handful of mini chocolate chips before moving it to the freezer. Everyone who has tried it really likes it."

Also let the full mixture set in the fridge for a few hours after you complete all the steps before you put it in your machine. This will help the machine do less work. Only took mine 15 minutes to get perfect icecream.!"

However, it was not a rich chocolate flavor, and it wasn‚Äôt too sweet. The taste was kind of a cross between a Wendy‚Äôs Frosty &amp; Cocoa Puffs cereal milk. Nonetheless, it tasted great! I may try some dark chocolate chips next time and see if it makes it more rich. I also think that this recipe would be a good base for any flavor. I want to try it as a vanilla ice cream and possibly mint chocolate chip."

Having tried numerous ice cream recipes from AR and been disappointed (things like no eggs and sweetened condensed milk, why??), I followed this one and it is so creamy and perfect. Only had 2 eggs so that‚Äôs what I did and no problem. Also, I did half dark chocolate morsels chopped up for the melting part and the other half semi sweet that was added 10 minutes in the churning for chips. Chilled the chocolate for well over 2 hours in a glass bowl before adding the cream and vanilla, don‚Äôt know if that made a difference. But oh so good. I‚Äôll never buy ice cream again!"

"reviewBody": "Amazing recipe! Just needs some adjustments. When cooking down the milk, sugar and cocoa powder, the powder never fully dissolved. I continued to add it slowly to the eggs and then return the mixture to the heat. I thought it would then cook down, but never did! I thought id done something wrong, but previous reviews had some similar complaints. I used a hand blender to beat it together which worked wonderfully! Without the blender it wouldn‚Äôt have been smooth! I also replaced the cane sugar with coconut sugar because its Keto and even sweeter! The coconut sugar had cooked down since it was heated and the initial taste test was very bitter. I added another 1/4 cup of sugar and it was perfect! Adding less sugar at the right time (off the heat) would fix this problem, unless you like bitter ice cream. I had to blend it yet again when I added the chocolate bits because, again, it never fully emulsified. I would mention using a blender in the recipe, give some info on substitutions, and mention that it only makes two pints which is pretty small."

The first time I made no substitutions, but I altered the technique a tad. I stirred sugar, cocoa, and salt until dissolved before adding the milk. No stirring while it heated. I tempered the eggs with the scalded milk, added the egg mixture back to milk and stirred constantly until it was thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. I removed from the heat, stirred in the chocolate until melted, then immediately added the cream and vanilla, before chilling. The second time I substituted bittersweet chocolate, added a little ancho and chipotle chili with the sugar, and added a vanilla bean and vanilla caviar to the custard. l strained the mixture before chilling, removing the vanilla bean. Outstanding!"

"reviewBody": "Excellent texture! And, I didn't even use an ice cream maker. Okay, so this is what I did....I had to make two substitutions because of an allergy. I used goat milk vs. cow milk. I used 1 can of coconut milk vs. 2 cups cream. And, after adding add the ingredients as instructed in the recipe, I used a stick blender to make sure every bit of cocoa was evenly dispersed w/in the mixture. This incorporated some air into the ice cream mixture so it was pretty creamy.....almost like pudding but less fluffy than a mousse. I poured the cooled mixture into freezer containers and stuck them in my deep freeze because I wanted it fast but went to run some errands that took longer than expected. Imagine my delight when I came back several hours later and my chocolate ice cream was NOT rock hard but very scoopable! It has perfect texture. I have never been able to make a homemade ice cream that doesn't turn rock hard in the freezer. I love it and will certainly make this again and again! I gave only 4 stars because I felt the ice cream was too sweet. I know the sugar plays a part in the texture but I'm going to experiment w/less sugar next time and that means I'm also going to try a very dark chocolate instead of chocolate chips. You've got to try this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I read both the favorable and unfavorable reviews and decided to make this ice cream. Boy am I glad that I did. The ice cream came out of my Cuisinart about 1/3-1/2 frozen (this is normal). I transferred it into a Rubbermaid storage container and froze it overnight. When I served it, it came out if the container exactly the same as store bought products. The gritty mouthfeel reported by others was mostly not evident, but when I did detect it, I realized it was unmelted chocolate. I rushed chopping the 2oz of chocolate, and I‚Äôm sure it didn‚Äôt fully incorporate into the base material, so this was a user error, but it by no means detracted from the end product. This is an amazing recipe and I would recommend it."

The only issue with sugar free is I think the freezing point is lower so the cuisinart didn‚Äôt freeze it and it ended up freezing VERY hard. I think xantham gum helps with that but haven‚Äôt tried it yet. I also strained the hot batter before refrigerating which was a good move because I think there was a slight amount of cooked egg white in there. This recipe is a keeper, thanks!!"

I did make a few changes: dark chocolate instead of semi-sweet, and 2% Lactaid milk Instead of regular milk. To cut down the cooling time, I set the pot into a bowl of ice &amp; water till the mixture had cooled to about 40-45 degrees. I put the mixture into my very basic, inexpensive ice cream churn. In almost 20 mins later,I had the MOST delicious chocolate ice cream.The consistency was like a thick soft serve. I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like after freezing since we devoured it as soon as it was done! YUMMY!!!"

"reviewBody": "although it is a very good tasting and texture of ice cream....it doesn't freeze properly as other recipes I have used for ice cream. \n\nI tempered egg yolks properly as I have made ice cream before and had a lovely thick base until the addition of the cream separately after the base had properly cooled overnight. adding cream after to a properly thickened base ends up thinning it out which will cause problems with getting a good firm ice cream in the end.\n\nI had to churn it 55 minutes in my ice cream maker to get it to even some sort of very loose form of soft serve and even allowing it to properly \"cure\" over night in the freezer didn't bring it to the solidness that a proper ice cream should be. if I make it again I will be heating the milk AND cream together as all other recipes I have had success with do....thus creating a proper thickened base that will stay that way when it goes into the ice cream maker to be. churned and then in the freezer for a proper cure."

I'm fairly certain these steps saved me from having lumps in the end product, like some others had. (During sifting, I definitely prevented a bit of scrambled egg from going in the mix.) The end result was a very decadent, chocolaty dessert (though I did add 1 extra oz of chocolate). If you follow the instructions to the letter, and be patient when you cook, you'll end up with a really awesome dessert.\nWhen I make it next, I think I'll try adding cinnamon and cayenne pepper to make a Mexican chocolate ice cream."
