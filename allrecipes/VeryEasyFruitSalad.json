I recommend thoroughly draining the canned fruit you use before adding it to the salad."

Real peaches are alive and have their full complement of enzymes, vitamins and minerals. Sad to use fresh fruit in the salad and then top the salad with complete trash....fresh, raw fruit is always your best bet."

"reviewBody": "This was certainly very easy... it was also very good. I can see how some would be put off by the pie filling mixed in, but I was looking for something different and sweet (but healthier than some other desserts) so this worked out great. If I wasn't in the mood for the sugary syrupy goodness I'd definitely not make this recipe. I added some blueberries and blackberries and it turned out delicious. The bananas browned up pretty quickly after it set in the fridge a while, so some lemon juice is probably a must next time - either that or omitting them altogether because they were my least favorite part anyway - but other than that, no issues. Good stuff!"

As soon as I got home with the ingredients, I opened the can of peach pie filling to check out the flavor and texture of the peaches - to get an idea of how it might come out. I'm so glad I proceeded with caution! I did end up using all of the peaches, but the only \"juice\" I used was what had stuck to the peaches as I was scooping them out. I chopped the peaches, as well, to make them about the same size as the other fruit I used. My husband still thought it was a little \"goopy,\" but everyone else seemed to enjoy it. I also ended up using chopped apples instead of the strawberries since they were out of season. I would make this again - it was pretty simply to throw together, and definitely a treat for the eyes!"

The fruit looked beautiful (red grapes, strawberries, blueberries, kiwi, and bananas), and I only used the glazy part of the pie filling (painstakenly removed the peaches after reading some of the negative reviews). Even then, it was way too gloppy and slimy. Didn't hold up over time in the buffet line either."

Next time, I might use the sweetened strawberries and just use canned peaches. I also, didn't add the bananas I don't like them browning and the salad lasts longer without them."

The pie filling was way overpowering and made all the fresh fruit taste fake. Looked pretty in the bowl but was awfully slimmy when spooning it out."

I think the rest of them (including my husband) didn't try it because it looked too gelatinous. Probably because of the pie filling. If I could find some pie filling that was more homemade looking they might try it. But over all I have got the say it did taste very good."

We leave the bananas out and also add other fruits such as granny smith apples, canned or fresh pineapple and mandarin oranges. It helps to cut up the peach pieces in the pie filling too and use about 2/3 of a can. My family eats it up enthusiastically!"
