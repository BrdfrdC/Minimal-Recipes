I made it exactly as instructed but I did use pearled barley which cut the cooking time. ( Okay this is a tweak lol) My husband pulled out the mushrooms which he dislikes but loved it. Regarding tweaking. I love to read reviews and some the reviewers tweaks have made a recipe much better. In this case, I used low/ no sodium broth as I am sodium restricted. I was afraid I'd hate it. It was spectacular."

I added pieces of freshly bought rotisserie chicken making it more hearty and a dinner entree. \n Much thanks to Trixie T. and her tips as published which I used exactly but added at least 6-8 cloves of chopped garlic and doubled the Parsley leaves and added 1-2 oz of the white wine. Kudos to suggesting 3 cups each of both chicken and beef broth; really makes a difference including each of the dry herbs noted in your tips. Made the kitchen smell fantastic and the soup simply ultra delicious. A recipe to hold onto."

She'll take doubles of this soup so I'm always thrilled to make it because of its nutritional content. The only trick I would add is to use INSTANT barley, which cuts down cooking time by at least half, and never leaves me with par-done barley."

I used 2 lbs of mushrooms, 1 whole large yellow onion, 3 cloves garlic, 1 large carrot, 2 celery stalks, 8 cups homemade chicken stock and 4 cups beef bouillon, 2 cups barley. I added about 1 Tbsp dried thyme, 1 Tbsp dried parsley, about 3/8 cup white cooking wine, 1 bay leaf. I simmered for one hour, it had a great consistency, but the flavor seemed to need an extra punch. I added about a tsp of garlic salt, and then the flavor was what I was hoping for. Delicious. I'll make this again!"

"reviewBody": "So I did make changes because I was using it as a base for a soup that I was trying to recreate from many years ago, the mushroom barley soup served in NY delis. To do this I read the reviews &amp; added the 2 bay leaves , 1 tsp each thyme &amp; marjoram, dash worstershire. I upped the celery &amp; carrot &amp; added a parsnip since I had on hand. Then I added a few squats of the concentrated tomato paste in the tube plus I took a 1 oz. container of Dried mushrooms which I simmered in water to cover @ the beginning of the soup making process. After about 3/4 hr I turned it off &amp; let it sit for a while longer. Added to the soup ingredients upon starting to cook the soup. These mushrooms take a while to cook..Actually turned out better than I remembered."

The name of the soup is mushroom barley yet there were many more mushrooms than there was barley. I think the barley should probably be doubled. I also was surprised that there was more onion than there was celery or carrot. I would give it a 5 for being easy to make and having a low calorie count."

Turned out very thick so I'd consider reducing the amount of mushroom used to 400g next time, and you definitely don't need that much olive oil. I added some coriander, black pepper, rosemary and thyme and am glad of it now as it may have been a bit bland otherwise."

"reviewBody": "I made this with pearl barley and my own chicken stock and added some dried and fresh herbs. I honestly did not measure the carrots etc but did approximate per the recipe. I gave some away to friends that were in need of comforting (both had a parent pass away within a day of each other) and I had plenty for myself. It was very good and I got thanked by both friends who said it was wonderful. Im going to make it again with hulled barley and again, use my own gelled chicken stock (from pastured local chicken bones). So it takes me actually days to make soup, but most of that time Im doing other things (soaking barley and making the stock in a crockpot) Im bringing a batch with me next week on a visit with friends in their vacation home in the Poconos. I gave them options and was told mushroom barley is their fav. Im seeing reviews saying its bland but it is very comforting ~ probably moreso with homemade stock ~ and it's easy to add a little flavor with small amount of herbs. I think I used dried thyme and at the end, added fresh parsley."

You don't need to cook as long &amp; I did use the same amount of barley which I wasn't sure about doing at first. You can always add more carrots, celery &amp; mushrooms per your preference."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe! I made this tonight as it is cold and snowing. It is perfect for this weather. I used 8 oz of white mushrooms and 8 oz of baby portabellas (cause that's what I had). I did up the carrots to 1 cup and same with the celery (I'm not good at figuring out how much I'll need and chopped away) and upped the garlic to 1 tablespoon (I love garlic!). No problem. Unfortunately I also upped the barley (I used Medium Barley and simmered for 50 min) to 1 cup which made it more like a thick stew. But the taste was great after adding salt and pepper to my taste. Next time I'll keep the barley to 3/4 cup. After a few bites I added 2 pinches of dried thyme to see how it changed it and it really did, I'm not saying good or bad but it was different. Thank you for a great recipe!"
