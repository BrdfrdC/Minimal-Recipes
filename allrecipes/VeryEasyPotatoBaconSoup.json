I also added a can of Cream of Potato Soup and some potato flakes until it reached the thickness I wanted. It turned out great! Used real bacon instead of bits too."

Here are the tips I can offer that always make it yummy- \n\nI add about 3 cups of potatoes and 2 cups of water that makes just enough for me and my husband to each have 2 bowls\n\nWhen I add the milk in I also add 2 oz of cream cheese- it makes it nice and creamy. Also I only add about half the milk at first and make sure I get the consistency correct. A lot of times the milk with make the soup way to watery. \n\nI had the crumbled bacon to the top not to into the soup until we are ready to eat so it’s not soggy and cheese as well"

One change was I used my home-made turkey chorizo instead of bacon. Delicious! \n\nOh, I did stir in 1 Tablespoon of flour once the onions were done (make sure to add the flour before adding any liquid or you'll have clumps of flour!) I'm sure it would have been fine without the flour, but I remembered an old Julia Child recipe, which added flour. Anyway, this is a really good and simple recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I tend to follow most recipes loosely and utilize common sense after years of experience cooking. That being said, I was searching for a recipe that would use up my bacon and also use ingredients that I already had on hand. Using this recipe was great because it uses milk, instead of half and half etc. and no chicken broth. Both of which I realized that I forgot to grab from the store. Anyway, I used all the ingredients listed but my potatoes were larger, and so I added two cups of water with two cups of milk. It look a bit too thin so I added butter and cooked it down to being thicker. I also added carrots and mushrooms , red pepper flakes and celery seed. Taste great! This is a great recipe to freestyle to your own taste. Thanks for posting!"

I also added Italian seasoning. I plan to garnish with shredded cheese and parsley as well next time I make this. Definitely a good snow day meal. 01/07/2017."

I also added 1 cup of chix broth and only half cup of water while waiting for the potatoes to cook down and become tender. One change I also made was to use English bacon, instead of regular bacon... as the English bacon provided more flavor. Great recipe and it came out great! Would make it again. Only gave 4 stars because I altered the ingredients to make it my own."

Simple steps in a very reasonable amount of time and it delivers a fantastic dish...5 stars. I made changes to ensure our family liking: I used red potatoes, added chicken broth in lieu of water, added 1 cup milk and 3/4 heavy cream(I know I know) for a richer broth. I also read review about adding potato flakes for a thicker consistency...I added about 1/4 cup of instant potato before serving. In the end, I smashed some of the potato up so we had chunks of potato and some very small bits! \nI'm in love w/ recipe and can't wait to make again for a cool fall/winter evening"

It was still a little salty, but that was my fault, for using 2 bouillons. Next time if I have to use the bouillon, I'd only use 1 and reduce the parsley to half."

I didn't have any dill, but DID add a couple bay leaves when I added the potatoes and water. *Remember to take them out before serving* Instead of thickening with instant potato flakes, I used some mashed potato that I made from a few extra potatoes I had set aside. I also put in some hardboiled eggs that I chopped up. Experiment with this recipe....Add what your family likes.....Omit what they don't like. ...."

I used 2 cups of frozen cubed potatoes, 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth and left out the bacon and dill. Mashed the potatoes a bit, but left them chunky. I only used 1 cup of milk since I didn't let the water evaporate because I like mine a little soupy. Added the parsley and a little shredded cheese and it was perfect. Great base recipe."

Did not want to use potato flakes, so I did boil some extra diced potatoes on the side, then mashed them with about 1/2 cup of the milk, and stirred them in when it says to add the milk, which worked out perfectly to make the soup a little thicker. I did not have the dill, and I think it tastes great even without it. Yumm!"

The potatoes were really mushy as I think the recipe calls for them to cook too long. We added about 1/2 a packet of country gravy into the soup to try to thicken it a little bit and give it a kick. I would try this recipe again with a few adjustments. Thanks!"
