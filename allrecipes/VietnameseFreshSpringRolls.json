"reviewBody": "I’ve made these many times as I cannot get these at any local restaurants in our small-ish community. At first I made strictly by the recipe and they are very good. This is an easy recipe to adjust to your tastes. I really like them with shrimp but have also used leftover rotisserie chicken, thinly sliced leftover rare beef, etc. I slice my veggies and meat first. Then I find that by bringing the water to a full boil b4 tossing in the rice noodles they cook almost instantly. I then strain them out, saving the hot water, and do a quick dip in cold water. Then plop them on a kitchen towel to dry a little more. I quickly dip the rice papers into the reserved hot water, lay it directly on the counter and fill/roll one at a time. With a little practice I’ve realized that less is best with filling them up and rolling tightly. I’ll make 4 just for a evening snack and use dumpling sauce or ginger dressing as a dip."

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding diced cucumber and diced avocado. I couldn’t find the basil required so I just omitted it. It was delicious but the sauces (or similar sauces) are a must, or it is bland. It is best served the same day, as I had some left over and the side with more layers got a little chewy as leftovers but that didn’t stop us from devouring them. I will make this again."

The rice paper was incredibly sticky and just impossible to eat without the whole thing falling apart. There must be a way to ameliorate the stickiness but neither the recipe nor the comments provided an answer. I can't recommend this recipe and I won't be making it again. I hope I can find another way to use up the rice paper."
