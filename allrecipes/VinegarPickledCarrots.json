I reduced the amount of organic sugar by half. The AVC makes for a sweeter taste, so less sugar is required. I also used sea salt instead of table salt, as well as organic pepper. I also used was filtered water, which retains all the good stuff and eliminates the chemicals, etc. The purer the ingredients used the better the flavor. Yum!"

After completing the recipe, I couldn't wait the 12 hours. Five hours in I can say I'm thrilled. So much so I'm chewing while typing. I eat, blend, juice, quite a number of vegetables so I used some \"crunchy\" vegetables that I had available. I like it spicy so in went the last Serrano pepper. Have fun everyone experimenting and finding out what you prefer, there's plenty of reviews to help you out. For me, it's a thanks to Sal."

"reviewBody": "Good recipe. You have to be very careful about how you slice your carrots and other veggies versus how long you marinate them in the vinegar mixture. After about 24 hours, thinly sliced zuccini and radishes turned out wonderful in this marinade. However, shredded carrots were REALLY vinegary, and 1/4\" carrot slices were kind of bland. So monitor you pickles closely for flavor.\n\nAlso, I did not think the recipe made enough marinade for the number of carrots, so I would suggest doubling the recipe to be on the safe side."
