I agree with other reviewers on 2 things. 1 - I cut the salt in half and I think the recipe is still too salty 2 - these are difficult to get out of the waffle iron. What worked for me was making them a bit small and then I figured out how to lift them with a fork. These are great toasted the next day."

Two recommendations, first is put oil on the bottom plate of waffle maker, put the mix in, and the brush a coat of oil top of the mix itself rather than the top plate and it worked splendidly! I made a tahini lemon and salt mixture to drizzle and it was relish... by the way i put it in for about 6 min total."

"reviewBody": "Yay delicious and fun. Do not believe that you can course chop the beans in the food processor and then add the vegetables. Even the video is deceptive because you can see they removed the brand and added the veg to the bottom of the processor. I recommend rough chopping the beans, removing that before you add the veg and spices. Then combine everything. Otherwise you’ll get puréed beans and it will be very messy to progress. Next tip... use the spray in between each waffle otherwise it will stick and not give you the gorgeous results you want. Enjoy!"

Made it exactly the way it states and it was bone dry and first batch pulled apart when the waffle iron opened. The second and third batches looked okay but again, was too brittle to be able to remove so it crumbled into mealy pile of yuck. We sprayed EVOO extremely well between batches. We are experienced in the kitchen as well so it isn't us. This was an epic fail. Seriously- do not bother and find another fun twist on an original food."

These are definitely delicate, so I had to be extra careful getting them out of the waffle maker. Most of the falafel I've had has been very dense, but these weren't. They were a great addition to some oregano chicken and cucumber salad. My only complaint is they were a little bland. Next time I will double the spices, except for the salt."

To stretch the recipe to serve 8, I added extra garbanzos and spices, but still just used the 2 egg whites and kept the amount of olive oil the same. I made it a day ahead and then added water to the batter so it was easier to spread on the waffle iron, which I brushed oil onto just for the first waffle. They did not stick. We had them with homemade tsaziki and sliced cherry tomatoes. Putting them on a rack in a low oven while cooking kept them slightly crisp. I would make this again. Also, I used whole wheat flour but I don't know if that made any difference."

Well, I guess the taste was good, but a MESS to make.\" Even with a liberal, heavy squirting hand of non-stick spray, this was disastrously stuck to the waffle maker. I pulled it out in clumps with a butter knife, re-forming it into the semblance of a waffle-shape and finishing them off in the oven. The falafel taste (and I followed the recipe exactly as written) was terrific, but the execution was just a fail."

The only thing I will do differently next time is to cut back on the salt (maybe by 1/2), because these came out super salty, and I even drained and rinsed the beans very well. Other than that, these had great flavor. Be careful b/c getting these off of the waffle iron can be tricky. I served these w/ a Syrian-type salad, 'Roasted Garlic Tzatziki' from this site and whole grain pita. This was great for a change...I will def be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)"
