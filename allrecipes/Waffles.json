I still have enough for more and the rest of the batter is in a container in the fridge. Um. I used almond milk, with vanilla, unsweetened, so I did not use vanilla. Well, putting it all together, I had more modifications to the basic recipe than I thought! But the recipe is obviously robust enough to allow such."

I made four batches, two with recipe mixing order, two with classic cake style, mixing dry together, then making a well, adding eggs, milk, mixing in, then the oil and finally extract. The recipe order tasted more oily and a bit more flat, the cake style was more to my liking and fluffier. This was with a full sized Cuisinart 4 panel waffle maker."

My small maker, think eggo waffle sized, turned out light fluffy waffles. So maybe this is the reason for so many complaints of waffles that did not rise. For me it's the waffle iron. Otherwise this is simply a standard waffle recipe. Easy and a good medium for the blackberry compote recipe I found on this website."

Add chocolate chips and bananas or anything you want really. Only thing I did diff was I added 1/4 cup oil (mine was extra virgin olive oil and I had no issues like some did..) and 1/4 cup apple sauce so I wasn’t adding too much oil. I also added the 3tbsp’s of cornstarch and it did infact make my waffles crispier :) Other than that with maple syrup I saw no issues :)"

"reviewBody": "The best waffle recipe I’ve tried! I do a mix of oat flour, whole wheat flour, and all-purpose flour (I go by weight rather than volume) and add a bit extra vanilla, as well as some cinammon. I also add some hemp hearts and ground flaxseed if I remember. Even my husband, who doesn’t like healthier versions of original recipes, loves these. I have to make a weekly batch and freeze for my 3 year old’s breakfasts. Love them!"

"reviewBody": "Overall good, and simple to make with staples at home, but not quite as good (texture wise) as buttermilk based recipes IMO. (Might have been better if I’d had whole milk at home instead of 2 percent.) I accidently splashed in a little extra vanilla, and chose to add a little cardamom (1/4-1/2 tsp). I think those additions helped the flavor."

Then I add the sugar to the egg whites and whip them again for about 30 seconds. After mixing the egg yolks with the other ingredients, I fold in the egg whites mixture. The waffles always come out with light &amp; crispy outsides while soft in the middle."

If you over cook them they will taste like cardboard like any waffle does being cooked till the light goes off or comes on to say it is finished, A 4 year old could put this waffle together and cook them easy as pie. To them less worthy to cook a good waffle remember just don’t over cook and this waffle and it will taste EPIC! 5***** all day long…"

I did change as follows... Use real butter instead of oil for better flavor Added another teaspoon of sugar Added dash of cinnamon as someone suggested Used 2 teaspoons of vanilla I added a blueberry topping. Here's how... Add one pint blueberries, 1 tablespoon of sugar, one tablespoon water to saucepan and stir then simmer 15 mins. Use immersion blender to blend into syrup. Pour hot syrup over waffles! Yum!,, P.S. My first time making waffles and this turned out great."
