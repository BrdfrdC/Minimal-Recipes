I used a regular green cabbage and for the apples I used early mac's. (it was what I had on hand) They worked great in this recipe. The only change I will make is to drizzle lemon juice over the apples next time to keep them from turning brown. My husband is allergic to nuts, so his portion was minus the nuts, I did use the nuts in my salad. They really add flavor and texture to the dish. So happy we tried this."

Each of us discussed certain things we would put into it like Feta and Bleu cheese chunks next time. This recipe does not need to be adjusted unless it’s for dietary reasons. It’s simple, basic ingredients and I intend on making it weekly. Served it with fish and Brussels sprouts. Thank you for your submission!!"

Cut up one apple, one stalk of celery, handful of walnuts added to coleslaw. For the dressing I like to put 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 tablespoon of vinegar added to the mayonaise and mixed together. The vinegar helps the apples to keep from going brown."
