"reviewBody": "This recipe is highly dependent on the vinaigrette you choose, so make sure to get one you like. I'm not real crazy about the bottled raspberry-walnut dressings I've tried (too sweet and 'walnutty'), so I used a regular rasperry vinaigrette and added a couple drops of balsamic and walnut oil. The red lettuce/red grape/goat cheese/pecan combination is beauty! I toasted my pecans for a few minutes at 350. Thanks!"
