I also seasoned it with salt, pepper, and celery seed. I did not have time to whip the heavy cream, so I omitted it. I will make this many times in the future. I also added chicken one time, and turkey breast another."

I had no lemon, but I think the salad came out great regardless. I added cauliflower and diced boneless/skinless chicken breast. Tomorrow for lunch I will be eating this salad on a whole wheat pita, but it also tastes amazing on its own!"

I omitted the salad dressing/mayo and took a large container of whipped cream and added in warmed up package of cream cheese. I also doubled the recipe used granny smith apples and stirred in a bag of mini marshmallows. I also used a bag of glazed walnuts because they were less expensive. I made it for a ladies fellowship. Was loved by all. and they even took the leftovers home."
