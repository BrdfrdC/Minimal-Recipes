I only used 1 cup of mayo and halved the juices and sugar too. Used 2 cups of whipped cream and added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. Used craisens instead of raisens and added 1 cup of chopped walnuts. I garnished it with a sprinkle of nutmeg all over it. So good! I even had some ask for the recipe so, so I'll be passing it on."

"reviewBody": "Just finished making this wonderful salad for the first time. I'm wondering if the complaints on the volume of dressing have to do with how you interpret \"2 cups whipping cream\"? Is that before or after whipping? Or are people substituting Cool Whip? I used 1 cup of whipping cream, which was probably more than 2 cups after whipping. (If you started with 2 cups of whipping cream, it would be a mountain!) I did cut back the mayo to 1/2 c, as I prefer a sweeter dressing. This seems to be the perfect amount of dressing for me. I also substituted craisins for the golden raisins, and threw in a handful of pecans. Can't wait to serve this at Thanksgiving dinner today!"

"reviewBody": "Whatever you do, DO NOT use as much dressing as this recipe calls for. I added the apples, raisins and celery to the mayo/whipped cream mixture and, after mixing, you couldn't even tell there were in the bowl. I ended up dumping half of it into a colander and washing off the dressing and then returning the washed off portion to the bowl. Otherwise, it wouldn't have been a salad; it would've been a soup. You could easily get away with 1 cup mayo and 1 cup whipped cream."

"reviewBody": "Good flavor - I took the advise of other reviewers and made 1/2 the sauce. I used enough to coat the salad well and UNfortunately threw the left over out. The salad does absorb some of the dressing, so I wish I had kept it and RE-coated before serving, as I had made the salad up several hours in advance. I will make it again and Keep the left over sauce, just in case!"
