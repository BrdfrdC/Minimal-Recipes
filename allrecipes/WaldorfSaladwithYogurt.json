I also used one sweet apple and one tart only. The salad looked elegant on the plates and delicious. I think this should be called \"Waldorf Watercress Salad\" so people can see the special ingredient when just browsing. But anyway a lovely dish. Thank-you"

Onions omitted (picky eaters), no celery seed, watercress unavailable and only had pecans on hand (smashing flavor!) and also toasted up some pumpkin seeds for an extra bit of crunch. A big hit! First salad to vanish from the table. A real keeper, this one."

I've heard of waldorf salad but never tried it, so I was a little sceptical about combining spices and chives with yogurt, mayo, fruit, and this new green leafy thing. Boy am I glad I did! We followed the recipe exactly and it came out GREAT! I'll be buying watercress on purpose from now on just to make this recipe."
