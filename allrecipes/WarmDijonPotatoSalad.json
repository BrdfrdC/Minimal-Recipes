Sometimes we have to forego the Parmesan since we don't always have it available. Personally, I'm not a big fan of mayo, and this dish, depending on the size of your potatoes, can have an excess of dressing. I just add more potatoes."

EVERYONE came back for seconds and commented on it. Welcome my new tradition. The only thing I ommited was the onion as I ran out of chopping time. It was darned delicious anyway.

Third time you'd get bites that were tarter than others. It does get better the longer it sits in the fridge. Still, I threw the recipe out. I'll go back to my classic PA Dutch potato salad."

I used baby yellow potatoes, roasted and quartered, sauteed leeks instead of onion, added some dill and used half mayo, half Greek yogurt with a handful of scallion tops to finish it off. Even though I modified for my tastes and ingredients I had on hand, I think this would be excellent exactly as written."

We also forgot the red onion, so I used the whites of the green onion instead and still topped with the greens once it was prepared. This is a super simple and easy recipe that is full of flavor . Definitely a great side dish for summer. It was enjoyed by both people who do and do not like more traditional potato salads. It's good both warm and cold"

Doubled the dressing except used listed amount for cayenne. Used yellow mustard, it is what I had. Finely chopped about 5 stalks of celery, 1 small to medium onion &amp; 1 yellow pepper &amp; added to mixed up dressing. Skipped green onions as I did not have any on hand. Added drained, warm potatoes to all of the above. Colourful &amp; tasty. Well worth making &amp; will make again. Thanks for the recipe!"

No one would ever know it’s vegan! The flavor is definitely in the dressing with the spicy cayenne and tangy Dijon, but the best part is the warmth of the potatoes which brings it all to life and the crunch of the red onion! What a great combo! My absolute favorite part about this recipe...the fact that you can pull it together in no time and it’s designed to serve warm! Perfect for those moments when you didn’t have time to plan ahead! Thank you!"

"reviewBody": "Good potato side dish loaded with flavor. That little bit of cayenne gives it a nice punch of flavor, and the vinegar gives it some tang. I did add a little bit of chopped celery, but wouldn't change anything in this recipe. UPDATE 10.22.12: Just finished off the leftovers for lunch, and it's equally good cold."

Here's my tweeks:\n - used only 1.5 capfull of cider vinegar (can add more for extra tang)\n - added 4 hard boiled eggs, hardwood smoked bacon, and 1 stalk of celery cut up super duper fine\n - opted not to use cayenne\n - garnished top with a little bit of parm and paprika"

I added an extra potato and reduced the cayenne pepper. Other than that followed the recipe. It went well with pork chops and beans. Thanks"
