After sampling it, I gave it an additional sprinkle of salt and chili powder for more kick. Nice lunch on a hot summer day. Thanks for the recipe!"

Gives it just a hint of spicy which is countered by the sweet basil and watermelon. Salt... I just ground pink Himalayan over it I didnâ€™t measure. Awesome summer treat! Thanks for recipe!"

I was hesitant to try this recipe because of that. Watermelon had to go. Fresh basil outside. O-kay, I'll try. What a surprise! The spiciness was subtle; basil wasn't overpowering. A really good blend of flavors without taking away from the watermelon. Thanks!"
