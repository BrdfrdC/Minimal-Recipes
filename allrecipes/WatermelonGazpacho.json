I doubled the recipe and made it as written, but without jalapenos, with dill instead of cilantro/basil/parsley (YUM), and with low-acid OJ because someone here suggested it. In my experience, people are often cautious to try this recipe, but get them to smell it and they always go, \"ooooh!\" You really can't imagine what the flavor will be until you try it, but it's goooood. I think next time I might puree the whole shebang and drink it out of a glass!"

"reviewBody": "I have tried to acquire a taste for gazpacho, as it is so healthy for you, but until now I just could not get into it. The fruity twist in this gazpacho recipe makes it easier for someone like me to enjoy. I LOVED this! The coolness of sweet watermelon, crisp cucumbers and yellow peppers combine beautifully with the zip from the garlic and jalapeno and herbs (I used a combination of cilantro, basil and mint). I used slightly less orange juice (squeezed two large oranges) and it was still very liquidy - but it is a soup, not a salsa, so it's fine to have a little extra \"broth\". Great idea and a wonderful recipe for someone who may not find cold soups appealing. I'm already rethinking my opinion of traditional gazpacho thanks to this recipe!"

Be as indulgent as you want without a drop of quilt. This became my new favorite food EVER. However I think I went overboard a bit with this one and I ate it so frequently I am ready to put this to rest until next summer! It's probably a good thing watermelon is seasonal. I did however add a whole jalapeno pepper and I mixed things up a bit and exchanged 1/2 cup of Pineapple juice for the Orange. And Mint for the Cilantro. I just submitted another version of this Gazpacho with the ingredients and changes I just described to the Allrecipes team hoping they will include the other version. The marriage of all the ingredients is an unexpected and exotic blend of flavors. This makes an excellent first course or surprising contribution to a summer pot luck. Deeelish!!!"

I basically tripled the recipe but I used 2 English cukes (they were huge), about 4 cups of O.J., 2 jalapeno peppers, 1 each of yellow, red and orange bell peppers, 1 small red onion, and cilantro. The ingredients were the same but I adjusted the amounts a bit for the larger recipe. I also let it sit overnight and it was good advice. It mellowed a lot. The taste was wonderful and refreshing and it's now in my favorite recipes folder. Try this one. You really can't describe the flavor."

I used Parsley (it was on hand) and orange bell peppers (they were on sale)... it came out very well, very cool and mildly sweet flavors. The notes are crisp from the vegetables and fruits in the soup, and no one flavor of anything stands out. I served it to the boys and they were in awe, it was gone very quickly. I suggest you try it just to see how you like it! I was hoping the acidity would be brought down from the cukes and the watermelon, so my only suggestion is to get the low-acid OJ, I will make it again with the low-acid someday. Perfect dish for a hot day when you dont want to eat. I also saved a smidge in a bowl to be refrigerated overnight, the next day it had AMAZING flavor. I highly recommend putting it in the fridge overnight."
