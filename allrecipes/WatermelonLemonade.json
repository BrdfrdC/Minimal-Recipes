When I don't have lemons on hand,I sub it for lemonade crystal light or whatever brand we have on hand and reduce or omit the sugar. Frozen lemonade concentrate would be great too, but I'd recommend adding a few extra cups of water. Put this in the freezer for a few hours until it gets slushy, delish!"

I also used organic raw sugar, so I don't know if that had something to do with it. HOWEVER...Today, I made it again, I was running low on lemons, so I peeled the lemons, de-seeded them &amp; put the entire lemon in with the watermelon AND I added 12 strawberries. This drink came out even more fantastic then the first time I made it. I also did NOT strain the pure mixture, I just blended it on HIGH for 3 minutes, I did not feel it needed to be strained. Thank you for an AMAZING recipe! This well be the new family favorite! (I had a really bad day the other day and felt as though I could use an \"adult\" beverage, so I added a little Pineapple Malibu Rum to it and it was a perfect compliment)"

Lemonade is awesome good, of course, and the first time we had Watermelon Agua Fresca we were both simply blown away by how good it was. While this was indeed refreshing, it seems something was lacking, diminished perhaps, by combining the two - maybe not a prominent enough flavor of either the watermelon or the lemonade."

"reviewBody": "One of the things that I like about this recipe as opposed to a \"watermelon slush,\" is that you don't have to consume it all at once. I had some left over, so I just stored the puree and the lemonade separately, so this could be enjoyed later, as well. My melon was very sweet, and after mixing the first glass, I did add more lemon juice to achieve the \"lemonade\" flavor that we like (but that likely could be just a taste preference). It's in the 90's now, and this was enjoyed immensely after doing yard work in the hot sun. And for those of us watching our diet, this is a great refreshing summer drink."

"reviewBody": "I assembled this right before a party. I was horrified at how sickeningly sweet it was. I even cut down the sugar as per other reviews. I added a lemon club soda to it and it saved the day. I think I doubled the liquid with the amount of club soda. It turned out really nice once this was added. I will have to figure out just how much sugar is necessary. ?Maybe on a previous review? As of right now, I would cut the sugar by 2/3rds and see how it went."

Took it a step further and added 1 1/4 oz of vodka. Shake, pour over ice and you have an excellent summer cocktail."

"reviewBody": "Such a great idea! I don't have a blender, so I gave the watermelon a rough chop, then put it in a large bowl and used a potato masher to get the juice out. I then strained it through a sieve, using the back of a spoon to make sure I got all the juice out. My only problem with the recipe is that the lemon juice got completely masked by the watermelon flavour; there was just no tang! I added another lemon's worth of juice to the mix, which seemed to help."

"reviewBody": "Ok, so I goofed when i made it the first time and didn't add the 3 cups of water, and I added the 1/2 of water and sugar to the blender, I did not make a simple syrup. These were not adjustments lol, just me running back and forth from the computer to the kitchen to do the recipe. I would like to say, its very foolproof, even with those two goof-ups, this is an excellent recipe. I had come in from way too much gardening and sat down with a big pitcher of this mix, and then napped tehehe. Thanks for a fantastic recipe, I will make sure to actually follow the directions properly next time."

I believe this would have been less sugar than the recipe called for. I blended the watermelon and lemon juice together - did not strain - I like my lemonade pulpy. Thanks for the great recipe, Docswife!"
