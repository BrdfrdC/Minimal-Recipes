"reviewBody": "They came out flat but that’s because this recipe didn’t call for cornstarch and I didn’t think of that in the moment haha. They taste great!! I cooked them on 350 F for 8-12mins. Make sure to whip every ingredient in after adding it for at least 2 mins. Add an extra 1/2-3/4 cup of flour if it’s not the right consistency. I had to add 3/4. Whip the last bit of flour in for 5-10 mins depending on how fluffy you want them. Add a tsp of cornstarch and a dash of vanilla for flavouring. Chill till its cookie dough consistency before cooking!! I had to chill it for 3 hours. After baking they were all too fragile so I threw them in the fridge overnight and now they’re durable enough that if my brother drops the bag a bunch, they don’t break easily."

I used butter (always do for cookies). I put the cherries on them, even some mini chocolate chips and nothing saved them. My husband took them out the chickens; an hour later they were still on the ground. I normally love anything I make from allrecipes but these missed the mark all the way around!"

They were perfect!!\nAnd MELT in your mouth delicious. Thank you for my must have recipe for any occasion:)"

They were well received be family and friends alike."

Also, having used this recipe for years, I’ve customized it a bit:- You have to WHIP forever, but SO worth it. - I doubled the recipe and added an extra cup of flour. - I didn’t add all the ingredients together. I whipped the room temperature butter and 2tsp Mexican vanilla for about 7 minutes and then alternating flour / icing sugar while whipping constantly. I probably mixed for around 13-15 minutes total. I also added 1tsp corn starch- I formed them into walnut sized balls and then flattened slightly and sprinkled red &amp; green sugar on top. - I baked at about 13 minutes on an insulated baking sheet"

They just tasted like flour and the texture was gross. Almost chalk-like. Not anything like what the other reviewers described in their glowing reviews.

I cooled the cookies on the pan outside, (no fridge space left this time of year!) and while they didn't keep the full shape, they had a nice little swirl in the middle of them once baked. \nThese were for sure, the favourite cookie of the ones I made.

Like kathleen mentioned, I whipped the butter for about five minutes and then added icing sugar and let it whip for three minutes more, before adding the flour. I baked at 300 for 5-8 minutes as she suggested...it did not work for me. I ended up baking them for longer because they were definitely not cooked, and then they were crumbly. I also tried two batches at 350 for 15-20 minutes...this was ideal, but you need to press the spoonfuls down (haha). I used silver balls instead of maraschino cherries, and these were great! Held together, buttery...delicious!"

"reviewBody": "I followed reviewer KATHLEEN'S review instructions. Though I increased my oven temp from 300 to 325 and baked them for 12 min. Just until the edges were toasted brown. I topped the cookies with mini chocolate chipits before baking. They are melt in your mouth AMAZING! So whip your butter for 5min then add powdered sugar and whip again for 5min. I also added about a tbsp. of vanilla powder cuz I like it. Then in increments of 1/2 c. at a time add flour whipping 2 min between ea. increment. Scrape the sides of the bowl down into the batter regularly as you whip. Then I whipped for another 5 min after all the flour was added. I really don't think you can OVER whip these cookies so don't worry about that. Now you could pipe the cookies onto a cookie sheet but I just dropped them by spoonful onto a PARCHMENT PAPER lined cookie sheet. I also DOUBLED the batch and it worked out just fine. They are really good. The taste of Christmas. Gosh there are so many tastes of Christmas aren't there? LOL! Merry Christmas bakers and chefs of allrecipes.com !"

We followed the measurements and everything else verbatim, but the seemed to melt in the oven and when we tried picking them up, they crumbled. Disintegrated on my tongue, it was weird. We tried it again the next day with granulated sugar and the cookie was more substantial, but still \"melted\" in the oven. We subbed peach preserves for the cherries, that was great!"

I followed one reviewer who said to whip for 5 minutes after each ingredient and those cookies practically turned to liquid when they baked. I've never seen a cookie do what that batch did. I do, however, beat the butter for a solid 5 minutes alone, then add the remaining dry ingredients slowly. Beating time ends up a total of 10 minutes, as the original recipe states. These cookies melt in your mouth, and they are VERY DELICATE, but they taste amazing."
