Next time will add a little more cayenne pepper (maybe a 1/4 teaspoon) and will add the cheese when serving in bowls instead of in the pot so the pot is not so hard to clean (the cheese sticks). Served with jasmine rice and topped with avocado, sour cream, cilantro, and corn chips (Fritos). Was really delicious! My family loved it. Will make again!"

I’ve made this as written a few times but tonight had to change it up to use up what I had and it was just as good. I only had garbanzo beans so added those in when I added the spices so they had a little longer to soften, and it was an excellent substitute. I was also out of chicken broth so used one can of cream of chicken and half a can of cream of celery with one and a half cans of water. I also added a little red and orange pepper and corn, and garnished with fresh parsley. Oh, and I used shredded Parmesan because that was the only cheese I had left. Almost sounds like a new recipe lol! But I swear the spices made it taste quite similar to the original."

I added 4 cups of chicken broth and it was still not thick enough. So I had to add Wondra to thicken. I also didn’t have chili peppers, so I substituted with what I had on hand which was diced jalapeño peppers. I added some juice along with it and it gave it the same flavor.I also added about a 1/4 cup of vermouth to give it a little more flavor. Of course, the alcohol cooks out."

I made as written, but did add a little extra cayenne knowing that I prefer things a little spicier. This was absolutely fantastic and if you’re someone who likes to tinker with recipes, this is a great base to start with, but truly, this is just great as it is. One reviewer is right to comment on adjusting the amount of broth based on your preference, but 5 cups does give it a bit of a soupy texture but I was fine with that as well. Great stuff and can’t wait to make a lot of this over the winter!"

Guess I can't complain I kicked three Chefs butts in this competition, this is a good recipe"

I made it with hot pork sausage for extra depth of flavor, and for goodness sake, don't leave out the pinch of cinnamon. I know, strange, but trust the other 980 of us, you won't taste it but will appreciate it. Mine was made with dry beans, pressure cooked for 30 minutes, then added the broth, veggies and chilies. I added a small can of green chilis and at first it was really spicy, but settled down after about 6 hours in the crock pot. Served with monterey jack cheese and fritos, we have dinner!!!!"

I used fresh green chili's and a pablano pepper. what I had to work with on the chillis. \nI wish I had some white pepper it would have really elevated the whole thing. don't skip out on this or the cinnamon. doesn't seem like it makes a difference but seem to me that would have made this a WOW dish instead of Very Good-great.\nMy family devoured it. thanks for the recipe. will make again."

I also cut down on the chicken stock - about 4 cups - and then brought the chili to a boil and reduced to simmer until it reduced a bit (about 20-25 min). I doubled the amount of fresh garlic, doubled the spices that were called for, and added ground cilantro, onion powder, garlic powder, and agave nectar. Garnished with fresh cilantro.
