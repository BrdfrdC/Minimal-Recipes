I did however, make some changes. I added an extra ounce of chocolate square and around a 1/4 cup more of chips for cutting. I cut out 1/2 cup of sugar. Since I baked it in a 9 by 9 baking pan, it took 15 more minutes after the 35. They were moist, chewy, and with a milky flavor that you'll love. Two tips, buy good quality chocolate and add a bit of tart from either a bit of lime juice to the batter or some fresh strawberries on the side after it's done. Will definitely make it again!"

Also Make sure the butter, sugar, vanilla, and eggs are well beaten. I advise beating vigorously with a wooden spoon. You may want to try increasing the flour a bit and decreasing the sugar to about 1&amp;1/2 cups. This will yield that perfect white chocolate brownie you crave!"

To get more of a brownie, I cut the eggs in half (to 2) and added 6 oz. melted white choc. instead of 3 (but that might not even be necessary, I just love white chocolate). You do have to cook it a bit longer, probably closer to 45 mins, just keep checking it. They turned out amazing!!"

Mine turned out too browned and crispy on top, which wasn't what I was going for. I wonder if it's because I was baking them in a small toaster oven and they were too close to the element? I will probably put them on a lower rack and try a lower temperature for longer next time. So yum though. Thanks for sharing the recipe :)"
