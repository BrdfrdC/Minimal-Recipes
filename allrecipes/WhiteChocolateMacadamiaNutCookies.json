"reviewBody": "So! I decided I wanted to make cookies for my boyfriend's family meeting them for the first time and he chose the type of cookie they'd like. I'd never made white chocolate macadamia nut cookies but I've made most other types and I'm the kind of baker who usually plays fast and loose with recipes. I read the mixed reviews and here's my tips/changes: 1. Equal parts brown and white sugar, I did 3/4 cup of both. 2. Cream the sugar and butter until it's fluffy and fully incorporate the eggs, it shouldn't look grainy or separated. 3. I used double vanilla purely because I hate almond extract and it's not a normal flavoring for these cookies. It'd be a good addition if you're a fan of marzipan flavor. 4. I used salted butter but unsalted nuts then the called for 1/2 tsp salt. 5. I cooked them 6 at a time on a medium non stick pan and that helped them spread and crisp the bottom/edges. 6. Mix it by hand, beat the hell out of the wet ingredients but as soon as you add flour all you should be doing is incorporating it, I did about 15 turns with a wooden spoon, then another 10 for mixing in the nuts and I used white chips. They turned out amazing with minor adjustments and I'm at high altitude. (about 7000ft)"

I actually made larger dough balls with the hopes that they'd flatten out to the big chewy cookies sold at cafes, etc. They took 12-13 minutes to bake and didn't flatten, but were perfectly chewy! Next time, I'll flatten down the dough balls when baking. I also sprinkled flaky salt on top before baking, which accentuated the flavors! Will definitely make again!"

I am not sure if my oven isn't as hot but I found that baking the cookies between 12 - 14 mins turned out better. At 12 mins, you get the crisp, caramelized edges with the soft inside. I personally love my cookies on the burnt side a little so at 14 mins gives me a more crunchy cookie with the subtle burnt-sugar flavour. \n\nI can never get my cookies to look pretty like store bought cookies by using the drop-method so I just refrigerated the dough for a bit until it was firmer, molded the dough into balls, and then press down on that ball a little bit."

For example less flour, no almond extract, one less egg, etc. I finally decided to make the recipe as is and then if I wanted to, to make adjustments after that. I’m glad I did not make one change. I’m not sure what others were talking about as far as the cookie turning out like cake. Even though they come out puffy, once they sat for a few minutes they rested and came out chewy. Glad I made them. Would not change a thing. Thank you for the recipe."

I also used all vanilla and no almond extract. They are crunchy on the outside and chewy and tasty on the inside. I also kept the cookie dough in the fridge between batches to stay chilled. I think this helped with spreading. I used an medium pampered chef cookie scooper and cooked for 10 minutes on 350."

Second batch i put parchment paper underneath the dough and cooked for 9 minutes and they were perfectly cooked. Be careful though, very easy to overcook. maybe less white chocolate/macadamia nuts next time since there were a lot and i found it overbearing (probs 3/4 cup of each would b better)"

I baked the cookies for 10 minutes, they came out perfect, no spreading at all. Also would use more macadamia nuts, I only had 1/2 cup on hand. Definitely will make again and again!"

For those having problems with taste and texture, be sure to use real butter, not margarine and ensure the oven is preheated. Too much spreading could.be the result of expired baking powder, or dough that is too warm. Adding this to my favorites!"

I put the trays of dough in the fridge while I pre-heated the oven to avoid excess spreading. I had two trays in the oven at the same time, the top batch came out good and doughy, the bottom batch came out more round with crispy bottoms. I used an ice cream scoop, which yielded 20 cookies, and took about 14 min in the oven."

A double recipe only lasts a few days I use only 1/4 cup of white sugar per my hubby’s request and he is a sweet stuff junky. Never had a problem with spreading . Have used butter as well as shortening. My recipe does not call for almond extract, just vanilla. Otherwise recipes are identical."

"reviewBody": "Wow! I made these today and they were outstanding! As with any cookie, you need to cream the butter and sugars really well before adding any other ingredients - this helps the sugars dissolves into the butter. I scraped down the bowl several times to ensure all sugar was incorporated. When I added the eggs, I also scraped the bowl and mixed well before adding the next egg. We like our cookies slightly underbaked, as the carry-over will occur on the cookie sheet when you remove them from the oven. This cookie is the perfect bite! Not too much white chocolate (I hate that stuff!!) and just the right amount of macadamia nuts. Delicious!"
