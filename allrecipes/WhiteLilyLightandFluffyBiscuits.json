"reviewBody": "I have been a Southern cook for 36 years, learned when I got married. I pride myself on being able to cook anything EXCEPT biscuits. They never rise, are too dry, etc. I have heard so much about White Lily Flour biscuits I decided to try them. I can’t find While Lily self rising flour anywhere here so just used the brand I had. They were still the best biscuits I ever made. My son ate four before heading off to school. I won’t stop searching for White Lily even if I have Togo to Amazon."
