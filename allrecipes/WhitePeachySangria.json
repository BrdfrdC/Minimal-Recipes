We mixed it the evening before, but waited to add the Sprite until right before we served it. In hindsight, we should have listened to the author and mixed it all together to rest overnight. It was definitely better the 2nd day, with the flavors having had time to meld and the Sprite to blend."

Important that these flavors have time to marry.\nI have used a mixture of bottles of chardonnay and Moscato (I did this at graduation) slightly less sweet all are good. :)\nAnd finally, when the Sangria is gone and you have a bunch of yummy boozy fruit left. puree it in the blender with a little more liquor (vodka or brandy), freeze it, then when you want a \"special\" adult slush, spoon it into a rocks glass, add some sprite, and Voila! A whole other treat."

FYI: I didn't necessarily follow the measurements in the recipe; I just made to taste preferences."
