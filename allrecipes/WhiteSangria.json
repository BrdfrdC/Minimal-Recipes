After looking at several white Sangria recipes, I decided not to make this one because peach schnaps with cognac, wine and ginger ale does not sound anything like what the 4 of us enjoyed at a restaurant recently. This recipes also didn't call for a variety of fruit, which definitely was in other sangrias. The one I selected was a huge hit, and I'll make it again. It just wasn't this one."

I have made it many times now, various ways. I use Pinot Grigio for the white wine version, and it works equally well with red wine such as Pinot noir. Experimenting with other variations, I have skipped the cognac, doubled the peach schnapz, used Splenda instead of sugar, and made the ginger ale optional (just because I'm not supposed to drink carbonation). I have also used sugar free 7-up instead. I recommend fresh mango plus sliced peaches when in season, and feel free to add other fruits as well such as apple and orange slices when mango is out of season. You really can't mess up this recipe--it's so good. Thank you for a big keeper!"

I followed the recipe and it was VERY strong and a tad too sweet. I used a sauvignon blanc, peach schnapps and ginger brandy. Used peaches, mangos and red raspberries. I also used super-fine sugar - definitely less than what was called for - and made it the night before. Boozy and maybe overly sweet drink, next time will ease up on the sugar and try club soda instead. But really good, pretty and easy."

I add lots of fruit...have also used apples, pear, pineapple, its no fun with only one slice of fruit in the glass. Try it with frozen fruit in place of ice to keep it chilled for a bridal shower, etc. I use trader joes \"2 buck chuck\" . The recipe gives you a lot of room to play with different flavored liquor (mango rum, flavored vodka in place of scnapps). But definately a keeper the way it is, too."

You can use the liqueur \"43\", or Grand Marnier in place of peach schnapps. Use any and all kinds of fruit on hand. I don't like to use bananas because they tend to get mushy and brown. Make sure to marinate the fruit in the wine for at least a few hours, preferably overnight, and don't add gingerale until serving."

We like to add the gingerale to each glass as it's poured - it makes sure the last glass is as lovely and fizzy as the first, and also lets each person control their own alcohol intake. I've substituted Sprite and club soda with equally good results, and for a little colour I added some frozen raspberries. Works well with frozen mango, to cut down on prep time too. I will definitely make this again!"

"reviewBody": "Wow! This one's a keeper! I primarily followed the recipe, but made the following modifications: 1. skipped the cognac and used only peach schnapps and 1 Black Box sauvignon blanc wine (equals 4 bottles). 2. Added 6 sliced fresh peaches, 2 sliced ripe mangoes, 2 pints of strawberries, 2 sliced oranges, and 2 sliced lemons. Put mixture evenly in 2 covered pitchers and let it sit in fridge for 2 days, stirring occasionally. Turned a beautiful light peachy/pink color. Served over ice in individual glasses, topped off with gingerale (3/4 sangria, 1/4 gingerale) according to individual taste in each glass. (No punch bowl) Enough for several days of drinking, so don't dilute with gingerale until serving time. I even drank a glass on day 3 without any gingerale and it was amazingly good. Unbelievably delicious! Tasted even better on the third day...and the boozy soaked fruit was YUMMY to eat."

When I make any sangria I usually make it the night before the party (or first thing the morning of). The longer you allow the fruits and liquids sit the better flavor you have! (Stir occasionally!) Just remember your ginger ale (or whatever soda you add) is to be mixed in just before serving. Time is one ingredient any good sangria simply cannot do without!"
