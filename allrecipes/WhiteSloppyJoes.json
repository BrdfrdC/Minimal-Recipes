After careful thought, I decided to try it again and kicked it up a notch adding sauteed onions, celery, green and red peppers for more body and flavor. It was much tastier with more color and appealing to the eye as well as the tummy. My advice is to ad what ever you like to suit your families tastes."

I didn't use the hickory however, but let my guests add tabasco or bbq sauce to their taste. It was simple, but lacked in flavour. I probably wouldn't make it again unless I was cooking for a picky eater though."
