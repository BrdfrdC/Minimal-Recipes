"reviewBody": "I used white whole wheat. The dough looked a bit dry, so I added 2 tablespoons more of water. At the \"Add\" portion of the dough cycle, I tossed in a handful (probably about a quarter cup) of raisins. I will definitely be making these again, and will try sprinkling toppings like sesame or poppy seeds after brushing with the egg white."

"reviewBody": "This was my second try at bagels, and the first with whole wheat. I don't have a bread machine, so I made these in a stand mixer. The batch size is a little small for the dough hook, so I finished kneading by hand.\n\nI liked the idea of adding gluten instead of mixing the whole wheat flour with bread flour. The result was a nice, whole grain taste and an excellent texture.\n\nI did not use the egg wash, but might try next time as the I prefer a crustier bagel. I may also try boiling them a bit longer to see if that helps to develop a chewier crust."
