This ended up being way to sweet for me and will try with the oil next time. With all these sugars in the recipe I don't think it is very healthy especially for those who have to watch their intake. Using something like canola oil is much healthier and will add only a few more calories. Not happy but will try recipe again using the oil."

I used organic grass fed butter instead of oil. I added an additional 1/2 cup of (1) banana. Instead of the 1/2 cup honey I used 3 TBS fructose and 1/4 cup honey to reduce the glycemic index. I love cinnamon so I added at least 1 Tbs along with a pinch of ground clove and nutmeg. I also used more nuts; a mix of 1/2 cup walnuts and 1/2 cup pecans. It was amazing!! This was very moist and made good sized loaf in a 9\" loaf pan. I cut into slices and froze most of it so that I don't eat it all in one day. It froze very well with the thawed pieces tasting just as fresh as the day it was made. I will definitely do this one again."

To keep that addition minimal, I baked this for 30 minutes in a 9x13 cake pan and sprinkled just a few chips on top of \"cake\" fresh out of warm oven. Then I spread the chips when melted for a nice, thin layer of chocolatey goodness."

I admit that I couldn't wait and cut into it an hour after it came out of the oven. It's been my experience that banana breads are best a day after baking. This was already moist and its flavor can only improve. Whoever posted that it has a horrible aftertaste must have used a rancid ingredient or mismeasured."

"reviewBody": "Very good recipe; however, I would, like other reviewers have mentioned, increase the banana a bit and add spices to enhance the flavor. The main issue I ran into was the baking time- the batter is wet! 1/4 cup water may be too much.. but seeing that only a handful of other reviewers mention extending the baking time, I wonder if the issue is more a result of the altitude of where I live (a little over a mile up.) I had to knock the temperature down to 300 (and then lower to keep from burning) after the first hour and bake for another 1 1/2 hours! I will certainly make the recipe again, but I think I will try muffins or use a flatter dish next time (which would give me banana bars instead of a loaf.)"

As well as a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice added flavor but wasnt too spiced. I then baked these for 12-15 min in a muffin pan lightly greased with nonstick cooking spray. Amazing! :)"

I added 2 packets of maple brown sugar instant oatmeal and about a tablespoon of cinnamon to the batter and replaced the oil with applesauce.
