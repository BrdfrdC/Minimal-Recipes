Today I used King Arthur white whole wheat flour and added a scant teaspoon of salt and they are great! I've made them medium sized and small sized, and we prefer small. I roll the whole ball in sugar as it makes the dough easier to work with and it doesn't stick as much. Thank you Mrs. Daycare for a family favorite."

Thank goodness these cookies don't taste much like straight molasses. The flavor is very nice and they came out chewy on the inside and crisp on the outside, even though I mixed up my baking powder and soda amounts... they just spread a little extra, no big deal. This is a very large recipe, it made almost 4 dozen, which is not a bad thing except my husband is not sure he likes gingersnaps. I'm hoping to convert him since there are so many cookies. I'll be taking a couple of bags to friends as well. The rest are mine!"

I froze a bunch and did roll the ilittle balls in sugar. I also did not like the way the other spices overwhelm the ginger. Next time I will make this with regular molasses, more ginger, and omit the cloves, nutmeg and allspice. Live and learn."

I followed the recipe for the most part..the only thing I did different was use brown sugar (didnt have white) and cut everything in half (didnt want 60 cookies) 30 were enough for my family. I would recommend letting the dough sit in the fridge 30 min to hour for easier handling. The end result were excellent cookies these are very spicy...so cut spices in half, if you dont like spicy food or you will have hot flashes like we did. lol"

The low end of baking time was great for a softer cookie. We'll definitely have these again!"

So I had a plate full of some whole wheat flour and sprinkled the dough with flour first to make it easier to roll, then I rolled it in the sugar.

I added more flour to the remaining batter, and that helped a little.\n\nI suggest adding an extra cup of whole wheat flour to the ingredient list.\n\nAlso, I sometimes use a course-ground whole wheat flour that might have worked better. I'll try it one more time with the courser flour before I delete it from my recipe box."

"reviewBody": "Mixed feelings! I made the recipe exactly as given, but am not sure if I used the correct molasses. I went to the store especially to get some, and there were two to choose from. The Black Strap Molasses had a label which stated it was for use also in ginger biscuits, etc., and that is what I thought was right then. However, I really did not like the bitter aftertaste that it left in my mouth, and my husband had the same comment. The spice was overpowering the ginger for me, but I loved the old fashioned look with the cracking on the top. This worried me all night, and because I ran out of eggs, I was at the local garage at 06:00 this morning so that I could try it again, this time with variations. I then used half flour and half wholewheat flour, cut down considerably on the spices, but not the ginger. I left out the molasses totally and used a bit of maple syrup that I had leftover with syrup. This morning's batch came out more to our taste. I plan to try it once more, with even more ginger, and perhaps less sugar."

I knew that the soda and powder amts were too much, so I reduced the soda to 2 tsp. and deleted the powder, then added 4 tsp. vital wheat gluten (1 tsp. per cup of ww flour). The cookies rose just fine and taste wonderful. My diabetic husband loves these now that he has sweets he can eat."

These cookies taste best the next day when the flavours have had a chance to mingle and will stay fresh for a very long time if kept in a sealed container.

To make them super healthy without losing the flavor I made the following changes: coconut oil for butter, two very ripe bananas &amp; 1/4 cup of turbinado sugar for the white sugar and 1/2 wheat &amp; 1/2 oat flour. They were devine! Although this rating isn't exactly for the listed recipe it helped a great deal with making healthy, flavorful cookies.

Which doesn't matter at all to me as far as the recipe goes. I did not think the spices were overpowering at all. The dough was a little sticky so I had to dip my fingers in the WW Flour to make roll into ball better. The use of WW Flour does not change the taste but a slight change in texture, even visual texture, but that is expected. I will reduce sugar the next time just because I want to try it that way."

People seemed to like these extra sugary cookies better than the ones without additional sugar on top.\n\nThese cookies get even better after a few days! Everyone is asking for the recipe and this is now a staple in our home. Thanks for the great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Just made these. Hard to say what I think about them. The taste was perfect - nice and spicy. The texture, not bad. The edges were hard after cooking and cooling but the rest was chewy. They were completely flat once cooked, but that could be from over mixing the batter. Any time I hear about flat cookies, I've always been told it's from over mixing. Cooked them on the top wrack at 300 for 12 minutes. The batter was quite sticky, too sticky to roll. So I tried 2 things: wetting my hands as little as possible so the dough wouldn't stick to me and putting the batter in the fridge in between batches to firm it up. Both weren't great. The only other thing I would do next time is to add a little more flour. When I went to roll the balls with wet hands, the ball was coated in water (of course), and therefore the sugar on the top dissolved almost completely before it was even in the oven. I think if I make this again I will BOTH put the batter in the fridge for a while to firm it up and add more flour so that the batter is more crumbly. I'm giving it 4 stars and not less based on my reviews because the end result could've been my fault, not the recipe's. Overall, worth another shot with some tweaking."

They are a strongly flavored cookie (especially when you use high quality spices as I do) which I love. These have a lot more molasses than most ginger snap recipes. The only problem I had with these is that the dough was very soft and they flattened out more than I like. I tried chilling the dough but that didn't help them stay thicker, though it was easier to roll them into balls. I think I'll try tinkering with my old ginger snap recipe but add this combination of spices because I really liked that."

"reviewBody": "This cookie was OK, but nothing great. It was grainier than expected. It would be better to not use all whole wheat flour I believe. And there was no way these were rolling into balls. I refrigerated briefly, but still had to add more flour. But, it's not just the flour that's the problem. The other spices cover up the ginger taste too much. If I make again, I will have to try to figure out which spices, other than ginger, I need to cut back on (maybe all of them). Another problem I had was that the cookies didn't keep their shape, they just melted into large circles. The cookies stayed chewy after cooking, which was good. I took some other reviewers advice and substituted 1/2 cup brown sugar for white. I like the idea that they are whole wheat, but I think I'd rather have a white flour or mixed flour version that tasted better."

I used 3/4 cup of raw sugar, 3 TBS of butter and a handful of pecans that I made into pecan butter in my coffee grinder instead of using oil. I did cut back on the baking soda to 2 tsp. These were so good - my kids loved them. I will use this recipe again especially at Christmas time! Great spice combo."

It was easier to roll them in sugar than just dip the tops. I also baked them on parchment paper so they are easier to lift off the pan. Warm, they were a little chewy in the center and had a nice crunch around the edges. I stored them right away in a tupperware, so hopefully they will retain a little bit of that chewiness when they fully cool off. \r\n\r\nI love that this recipe uses whole wheat flour, and I am keeping these in the regular rotation."

Cooking them for exactly 10 minutes made the perfect cookie. I shorted the flour a tiny bit and didn't add as much molasses, simply because I didn't have what I needed. I replaced it with maple syrup and it worked brilliantly. \nThis batch made me over 75 cookies. PERFECT recipe for a cookie exchange/ christmas time gifts.

While getting the spices from the cupboard I saw my container of cayenne powder and thought hmmmmm. :) I added two teaspoons of cayenne and the result was remarkable. The warmth of the cayenne went so well with the other spices. Of course you could divide your dough in half and just add a teaspoon to one half, but I think I'll be adding cayenne regularly from now on. I also flattened them a bit after the first batch and left them in for the full 15 mins because I wanted crispier cookies. Thanks mrsdaycare for such a great recipe. Oh one more thing. I forgot these were 100% whole wheat cookies when i was eating them."

Just like Goldilocks said, these are \"Just right!\" Spicy, Chewy, Moist and DELICIOUS! Thank you ever-so-much! My only caviat is to make sure your whole wheat flour and spices are not stale, which might be why one reviewer said they were sandy.
