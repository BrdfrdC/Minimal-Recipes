"reviewBody": "Based on the number of stars (and without reading too many of the reviews), we chose this recipe for my daughter's final for Foods class as a freshman in high school. As others have noted, the cake part is excellent! No changes. I am a pretty experienced baker, but failed to notice the TWENTY minutes of mixing for the filling. should have been a red flag.... The filling as directed was just awful. I added: cornstarch mixed with water, a lot of powdered sugar, and roux (butter and flour), until after about an hour we got to an actual acceptable creamy middle. If you are not an experienced baker, find another filling recipe! Ours turned out great, but it was really trial and error until we \"got it.\" Find your \"own\" or another recipe for the filling PLEASE and spare yourself our problems!"

A tip though, when making the filling, try sifting the flour before putting it into the pot or make sure that the flour is clumpless because when the mixture thickens, if there are clumps in it, you will definitely taste it in the filling. Also, take the time to beat it for the full 20 minutes. It really pays off. Great recipe!"

I used granulated sugar and as a result, the frosting had the texture of creamy granulated sugar, which was bad. I think it's important to know this before you select this recipe. Also, one tablespoon of vanilla extract was WAY too much. It was overwhelmingly sweet. I would decrease it to half a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Also, the cake was very dry and lacking fluff like you'd expect from a whoopie pie."

It takes a little practice to get them to come out the same size and shape, but once I got that down I had no other problems. \n\nWhen the milk &amp; flour are on the stove, I'd suggest stirring constantly rather than frequently. \n\nThe filling is so good I'm going to find other places to use it. Smooth &amp; creamy, and just sweet enough.\n\nThanks BZYMOM!!"

I thought they were supposed to be a soft cake like cookie sandwich, but these cookies came out more like a typical crisp chocolate cookie. I cooled them and then covered them well and they did soften up a bit after that. They tasted great though. I won't rate the filling as I made these to use up some excess cream filling from another recipe."

The batter was really thick so I mixed in 1/2 cup boiling water to get it to the perfect consistency. I baked these on a well greased cookie sheet for about 7 minutes and they turned out perfect--nice and puffy and came off the sheet very easily. I also doubled the amount of filling called for, substituting a stick of butter for 1/2 a cup of the shortening. I only used a teaspoon of vanilla. I've made this type of filling before. It's not like frosting but more like the filling inside a Twinkie (the flavor and texture my son was craving). I am sure we will be making these again."

I tried to save it by adding powdered sugar and some peanut butter. I managed to save it from the garbage. Overall it was OK but not great."

You also have to beat the filling a good long time when you add in the cooled milk and flour mixture. These actually taste better the next day. At first the filling does simply taste like sugar and shortening but after a day the ingredients meld together and the filling becomes more creamy. If you think the filling tastes too much like bakery icing at first give it a day and you'll see a big difference."

I took everything into consideration and decided to try it. I followed the directions very closely and beat the mixture for 20 minutes. First, I really didn't care for the flavor. Second, it was on the loose side. NOt a good consistancy for a filling. The recipe directions remind me of a homemade pudding. So if anyone was to try this recipe, you might consider using corn starch instead of the flour and maybe add a few beaten egg yolks to the mixture after it boils for a minute. Temper the yolks and then add to mixture and boil one more minute. That might work"

You have to let the flour mixture cool totally and then beat it for a long time. I use my stand mixer and at first it looks strange and like not enough but you have to keep beating it. The filling should not be greasy either and I have used both butter and shortening. In fact the filling is my favorite part, it's like Waldorf frosting so good, but for sure a different texture then regular frosting, and that what is so great. I am making these again for my son'e Pi party on Pi day (3.14), and I can't wait!"

I took the advice of one of the reviews and used butter flavored shortening- my boyfriend loved the buttery flavor of the filling but personally I found it tasted odd with chocolate. Next time I will use regular shortening. The consistency and taste of the filling was otherwise wonderful and will use it again if I can find a better recipe for the cookie.\nI followed the cake/cookie part of the recipe exactly and the cookies were not nearly fluffy enough. They flatten considerably and even with only 10 minutes in the oven come out crispy along the edges because they're so thin. As a chocolate cookie it's tasty but a whoopie pie should be more cake-like. Again, not a bad recipe but definately not a whoopie pie."

"reviewBody": "These whoopie pies are great! If you like \"traditional\" whoopie pies, this is the recipe for you. The filling is not a sweet buttercream or marshmallow, but fluffy and just the right sweetness. A few tips based on others' reviews: I do not recommend refrigerating the batter before baking, nor does it require time to sit. This makes the 'cookies' come out more dry. If your batter spreads thin while baking, it is not due to the recipe. One element that is key is the cocoa powder. When measuring this, make sure to pack it down (or at least sift it). This will ensure a very chocolatey flavor and keep your batter from coming out too thin. On a similar note, the filling should not come out thin if prepared correctly. I made this on a very hot and humid day and the filling didn't come out runny. Be sure to beat using a mixer (I even used a hand mixer) for the full 20 minutes. Have faith, the filling will come together! And do give this filling a shot. I'm generally opposed to using shortening, but sometimes it's worth it. This filling was really great and worth a try. Finally, these desserts taste great warm, cool from the fridge, and frozen. But be sure to note that the texture of the 'cookie' changes entirely when put in the fridge or freezer (drier and even drier, respectively). Overall, a great recipe for when you want something *special* that reminds you of your childhood. A+"

"reviewBody": "I used the exact ingredients and followed the recipoe as stated however, these were not good at all. The cookie part itself tasted of bitter chocolate and was a little salty. THe cookies also did not spread very much. The filling was very oily looking, the ingredients did not combine well at all. If I was going to make this again I would use a chewy chocolate cookie recipe and a filling that calls for cornstarch and water as a thickening agent added to light cornsyrup, powdered sugar, and vanilla. I will not be making this recipe again. Even my 3 year old whohas never meet anything with sugar she did not like, said mom what is this? No thank you I don't want it!"

The cakes were perfect, just like the ones my mother used to make but the filling was very different. We can't find her (my mom's) recipe and my sister and I have yet to duplicate her filling, but these still taste great!"

I used my own filling recipe: 1/3 C butter, softened, 3 C powdered sugar, 1 t vanilla, 1-2 T milk. Cream butter and sugar. Add vanilla and enough milk to reach desired consistency. I also tinted the filling orange and will use these for a fall themed bridal shower. Very yummy!"

"reviewBody": "These were great! After reading through the reviews, I planned on serving these right from the freezer so I actually mixed a little bit of cool whip into the filling (helps thicken it up a bit too). I also substituted just a little of butter for the shortening. \nThe cookies were great, I didn't think they were lacking in flavor at all.. but even if they were that filling wouldve made up for it, it came out soo rich and creamy. I'll be making this again for sure.\n\nBy the way, I didnt want to make too many whoopie pies, so I had some leftover cookie batter as well as the filling.. so I made mini cupcakes! they turned out great, I baked them for about 10 minutes."

The filling was too greasy, and called for too much vanilla. My kids definitely did not like this recipe, and I will not be making it again."

My advice is to make sure the milk/flour mixture is completely cooled before adding to the rest of the filling recipe. I always get lumps in my filling from the flour and I am not sure how to fix that, but this is yummie anyway and I think I am the only one that recognizes the lumps! Everyone at worked loved them! Plus, my husband who usually doesn't like treats like these had two!"

I think that I either didn't whip the filling long enough (I doubt it, I used the whisk attatchment on my stand mixer for 20 minutes to no avail)or more likely this filling wasn't made to stand up to September in the Deep South. I had to put them in the fridge to keep the filling from oozing out the sides. It still tasted good. The kids thought that they were ice cream sandwhiches. Every one loved them, even my husband. I will make these again but will try powdered sugar to help stabalize the filling."

"reviewBody": "These are wonderful! Because we have a large group that comes over for Sunday dinner, and we all love chocolate, we doubled the cookie recipe and made a couple of changes: we replace the oil with butter-flavored shortening and added 2 squares of unsweetened chocolate (and one of bittersweet chocolate), melted. Because so many reviews said there wasn't enough filling we tripled the filling recipe, and we used 2/3 butter and 1/3 butter-flavored shortening instead of all shortening. We don't usually use shortening at all, but happened to have some on hand and were low on butter. In any case, they turned out terrific- with not-too-sweet cookies and a fluffy, just-sweet-enough filling. Thank you Byzmom!"

I didn't use the icing part of the recipe though since we both love super sweet icings (I used a buttercream frosting that is on this site instead.) I tried to make this recipe again for fathers day but instead I made it into a gob cake. I accidently put the wrong amount of cocoa in...making it 3/4 cup instead and to compensate I added about an 1/8 cup more milk. I baked the cake till a toothpick came out clean and then let cool and cut the cake in half and put icing in the center. I have never gotten so many compliments...saying it was better than store bought. This recipe is definitly a keeper!!"

The filling was a little too fluffy for him but I can fix that by not whipping it as long. the next day after unwrapping it from the celophane, the bread was nice and soft and moist and he LOVED them! He just wants the filling a little sweeter and less fluffy. But they're good."
