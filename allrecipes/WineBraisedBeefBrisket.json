"reviewBody": "I needed to double this recipe. I made it as is the day before serving it. After 7 hours on LOW in the slow cooker, (the next day) I transferred the meat into a large roasting pan on top of about 8 thick mushroom slices, 1 c. of sliced garlic and another onion, sliced. I then covered everything with 6 shallots (sliced)and all the liquid from the slow cooker. I roasted covered/then uncovered at 350F for 1.5 hours. Interesting note: even the tiny bit of added mushroom added a lovely flavor. That said, next time I will add a carrot for added sweetness and complexity. My discerning French in-Laws were singing my praises for days. Thanks for this recipe!"

My BF who is an excellent cook told me, after I'd put the brisket in the oven, that it was something that needed to cook slowly all afternoon. :O I was certain I'd ruined a meal considering this recipe says about 2.5 hours. Well, 90 minutes after I had it in the oven it was done, tender, juicy and delicious! My teen son even had multiple helpings because he liked it so much. :) So, this cooking novice thanks you for this recipe. Out of curiosity I may cook it 'low and slow' next time just to see if there is a difference but not because it's needed. Also, the sauce is fantastic!"

I’m not a fan of thyme and so I used a rub from a famous Austin BBQ restaurant instead of making the one in the recipe. I cooked in a Dutch Oven and added sliced carrots the last hour. This was amazing!! Thank you for posting."

The recipe was fantastic! I cooked the brisket an hour longer than the recipe required (maybe my oven) and it was wonderfully tender. The wine and seasonings gave the gravy so much depth of flavor which I loved so I recommend doubling the gravy to use with a side of your choice. This was my first time making brisket and I appreciate you sharing the recipe!"

We are both on low-sodium diets, so I swapped 1 Tbsp salt with 2 Tbsp of Mrs Dash Table Blend, and used no salt-added bone broth and tomato sauce. Still great! The wine adds body and flavor, without overwhelming. As others suggested, I made it a day ahead, sliced the roast, and returned it the pan, and covered it with sauce before refrigerating. The next day I brought it back to room temperature, then reheated at 200° for an hour. Perfection."

"reviewBody": "Okay, I made an almost 7 lb brisket for a dinner party of 5 and didnt have as much left over as I expected. I used Tempranillo Merlot for the wine and yellow onion and also sprinkled it with a “Burgundy Pepper” seasoning I bought at the farmers market. I seared it as they suggested and then started it in my 200 degree roaster for an hour or a little less (bc I was baking a pie in my oven) before transferring it to a large double grill pan, covered it in aluminum foil and baked it at 350 for another 2 hours and 15 min then let it rest a half hour before peeling off the foil and slicing it on my cutting board and placing it back into the juices and recovering w foil and served it about 40 minutes later. It was the best brisket I have ever made and all my guests raved about it. I normally do brisket a little more BBQ in style but this is much more sophisticated than that and more tender. Leftovers have been incredible also. I give this high marks, but definitely use a high end merlot or merlot blend!"

Added sautéed mushrooms to gravy just because....I will likely serve it over the holidays as something different!"

"reviewBody": "This was better than I thought it would be. Instead of brisket, I used 1 1/2 pounds of chuck roast (since it was all I had). Also, I substituted vegetable broth for the red wine. I seared the meat and made the gravy in a deep dish skillet on the stove. Then I poured the contents into a roasting pan and put it in the oven for 50 minutes. After basting, I returned the meat to the oven for one hour. My roast was tender and delicious. The tomato sauce added that extra flavor that made this dinner really good. I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. The gravy tasted great on potatoes."

Served over Parmesan creamy polenta and though quite peppery, wonderful flavor. Served with sliced carrots which I had added in the last 30 minutes to the crockpot. I think sliced mushrooms would also add to this dish. Will definitely make again!"

For 5 lb brisket I substituted small can tomato paste for tomato sauce and used 1 14 1/2 ounce can of chicken broth as that was what I had on hand. I increased the wine to 3/4 cup, increased the seasoning slightly and added an extra onion to compensate for the larger size."

"reviewBody": "I followed the recipe as listed. I have not had a veggie burger in years; however, the reason why I rated only a three is because the texture was good but had to cook a little longer maybe because I used a Nutri bullet to chop veggie ingredients. Also, although I like cumin it was slightly taken over the other flavors in the burger. I did add swiss cheese and toped with Dijon mustard and a little sweet chili sauce. I do recommend to top veggie burger just like you would any other burger in order I believe to get a nice flavor and I did not use bread but I would take a sesame bun and place it in a skillet to get a slight buttery flavor which I believe will make this recipe a 5 star. If someone tries it with the bun and other stuff please let me know your opinion."

I didn't have beef broth so I used vegetable broth and added two packets of onion soup mix. I also substituted tomato paste with more broth and more wine in place of the tomato sauce. I added garlic because that's a flavor we really love in our household.\n\nDespite the size of the brisket, it came out amazingly tender, with plenty of delicious sauce. I sliced up the whole brisket, packaged it with sauce, and shared with friends. Everyone is loving it and asking for me to make it again."

I did saute the onion and de-glazed the pan with the broth, added the tomato sauce and wine and poured all over the brisket in the crock pot."

Did change the recipe a little, was too lazy to saute the onions so added them raw to the baking pan, used tomato paste instead and found a lonely carrot in the fridge so I throw it in too....\nWhen I took it out from the oven and tried it...Oh my , my, my...! it was so tender! I had not had a tender bite of beef in such a long time that I almost cried :). Perfect recipe! I will definitely do it again."

"reviewBody": "This was incredibly delicious. I read every where that if you want a tender brisket you have to smoke it for 12 hours or have it in the oven at low heat for 6 hours. I made this one in about three and half hours. When I took it out of the oven, I reduced the juices by half and poured a good amount to each serving. Served it with a side of cole slaw and mix of small potatoes. I did make a small change only because I forgot to buy the thyme so I replaced it with oregano and I added seasoned salt to the onions when I was cooking them. The red wine I used was Pinot noire. Everyone loved it, my aunt even suggested that we replace the ham at Christmas dinner with this wine braised brisket recipe. This recipe was easily doubled to accommodate a 7 1/2 pound brisket."

Not having a baking dish that could be used on top of the stove as well, I used a large, heavy non-stick skillet. I browned the meat, put it into a foil-lined baking dish, and then did the onions and added the other ingredients. I poured this into the baking dish, covered everything with foil, and put it in the oven for an hour, then basted the meat and put it back in the oven for 2 more hours. I had some concern about the temperature, but relied on the reviews. The meat was absolutely delicious, moist and cut-with-a-fork tender. Surprisingly, the union was outstanding too. My husband said it was as delicious a meat dish as he had ever had, and far surpassed any brisket he had ever been served. We had leftover brisket for lunch today, and it was excellent heated up. My husband says we'll be having brisket again soon now that \"we\" know such a great recipe. I'm fine with that since it was so good and so easy to make."

I seared it on both sides as directed and removed it from the pan. Then I sautéed the onions for a couple of minutes and deglazed the pan with the beef broth, then stirred in the tomato sauce and wine. I returned the brisket to the pan on top of the onions and put it in the over at 350 degrees. After an hour I spooned some of the liquid and a lot of the onions over the top and returned it to a 300 degree oven. It seemed to have a lot of liquid at that point, but it does simmer down quite a bit. After a total of three hours I removed it from the oven and allowed it to cool somewhat, transferred it to another container and refrigerated it. The next morning I sliced the brisket and returned it to the refrig. Then, at dinnertime, I only had to reheat it and serve. Hubs liked this a lot, but I found it to be pretty greasy. It was probably my brisket, even though I sliced off a lot of fat from the bottom. I can see trying this with a pot roast next time. And I’ll add more onions. They seemed to disintegrate over the long cooking time."
