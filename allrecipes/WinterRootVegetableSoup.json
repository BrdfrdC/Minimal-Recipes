Pealing the squash was painful, so next time I would just cut it in half and bake then scoop it out. Sautéing the onion and celery in butter rather than oil added a really nice flavor. I didn’t have 1/2 and 1/2 so I used milk and a dollop of sour cream. I also used chicken stock as I had it on hand. I read the reviews and someone suggested adding cumin, which was the perfect topper! Very yummy"

However, I was raised in a family that believed that dinner MUST contain meat so I add a little sweet Italian sausage that I browned separately from the onion and celery. (I due want to recognize that this is much healthier without the sausage.) I also left out the butternut squash due to my husband needing to limit starchy vegetables. All in all this is a great soup for a cold rainy or snowy night"

"reviewBody": "Amazing, the roasting of the root veggies is what makes this a winner. I roasted a bunch of root veggies from my local CSA that I had no idea what to do with. I roasted them with the olive oil and seasonings. A few of them were nicely charred. I also threw in 1 cup of red lentils for protein. Once everything was done simmering on the stove, I threw it in my vitamix and it came out nice and smooth. My husband loved it. I really liked it too. The flavor really came through. Excellent."

Also, if you don't want it to be the consistency of baby food (which I liked) then do not puree all of the soup. My husband would have preferred I left it whole in the broth. Still, the taste was awesome and it froze well! Thank you for the recipe."

I followed others’ suggestions and added three cloves of garlic to the onion and celery and a teaspoon each of nutmeg and cumin to the pot after the vegetables had been added. The soup was so good! I liked the purée texture, and I thought the turnip (I only used one because it was large) added a unique flavor. I took off one star because the directions were not precise in terms of the specific amount of each vegetable (for example, one sweet potato instead of 4 ounces or 500 grams)."

Instead of a hand/immersion blender, I poured the soup in small batches into my Vitamix. I first tried it with a hand blender and the results were pathetic. In the Vitamix, the soup came out super creamy. I don't feel like this soup needs any extra spices, though something like a pinch of nutmeg, clove, and/or cinnamon might be interesting to try. I'll sprinkle a bit on my next bowl and see how that goes. Not necessary, though. The flavours of the veggies combine to a rich, delicious soup that stands on its own."

I also took some suggestions for adding garlic and nutmeg. While the roasted veggies were simmering in the broth-prior to pureeing-I tasted it and loves it. The flavor was so good and it looked so appealing that I considered just stopping there. But I followed the recipe and pureed and added the half &amp; half - really wished I hadn't!! It was so thick that my immersion blender was bogging down so I had to add more broth and that really weakened the flavor. I just was not happy with it after pureeing. The next time I made it without pureeing and skipped the half &amp; half. Much better IMHO. It does need more seasoning. I used garlic,nutmeg, ginger,parsley, S&amp;P,rosemary and some basil."

I stuck to the recipe as best as I could- my local store didn't have any celery root or vegetable broth (so weird), so I added in yellow carrots that I had on hand and extra sweet potato and used sodium free chicken broth instead. I also used maybe a 1/4 cup of half-and-half because we have a lactose issue in my house. I read the reviews and was worried that I too would have a bad broth-to-veggies ratio, but after I blended everything up, it turned into an amazingly delicious puree. I can't wait to make it again! It was warm and comforting on a windy, cold, drizzly day in Southern New England."

"reviewBody": "Very tasty and a great use for root vegetables. I did roast all veggies and 3 cloves of garlic for 2 hours at 325 (the lower temperature allowed everything to roast without being too charred). My hand blender was useless and I used my regular blender. Water was required to even use the regular blender (too cheap to add vegetable broth). I did not add the half and half. This made an ice cream pail full of blender veggies with the consistency of baby food - it was still that thick. Chilled in the fridge overnight.\n\nReheated it in my crock pot (added more water to get the consistency I wanted). And served with a scoop of sour cream in each bowl. Wonderful. I chose not to add additional seasoning.\n\nI did think about leaving some not pureed but was afraid that the picky eaters would only eat the things they liked."

I wanted it to last for several meals so I doubled the veggies, the broth and the half-n-half. I knew my hubby would like chunky soup better than a smooth soup so when it came time to do the pureeing, I only pureed half the vegetables. Then I mixed everything together in my crock pot and cooked it on low for about 4 hours. We finished it off tonight and he is still raving about what a great soup it is. This one is definitely a keeper and I am already planning to make it again in a couple weeks. Thanks so much for a great recipe!!!"

"reviewBody": "Tried this last night for the first time and except for adding a little additional spice and doing some minor substitutions, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fabulous. I couldn't find celery root at my store so I omitted it. I subbed turnip with rutabaga because it's sweeter in taste and not as bitter. Finally I added heavy whipping cream instead of 1/2 &amp; 1/2. Veggies were nice and soft after roasting for 40 minutes, and it was easy to purée them in the dutch oven with a handheld mixer. Beyond salt and pepper, I added 3 generous tsp of garlic, a little bit of cumin, and some garlic powder. The soup had the consistency of a pea soup; a little thick but this is how it's supposed to be. I served it with warm demi baguettes and a glass of Merlot and all I can say is this recipe is a keeper for cold winter nights when you want something warm and filling, but also healthy. I gotta say that this recipe has also inspired me to do a lot more roasted vegetables with dinner because it's so easy and they're so good right out of the oven! Thanks for sharing this great winter soup recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I really liked it! I woke today and it was 12 degrees outside. Been carrying this around for a while now and finally made it.never cook much with parsnips, butternut squash, and never with celery root. I pretty much followed the recipe but did take a few hints from the other reviews. I used four parsnips, 2 celery roots, I did add about a tsp of dried basil, a tsp of dill weed. I also used one whole chopped sweet onion and two cloves of minced garlic. Because I increased those items it took almost 1 pint of half and half and almost 32 oz boxes of vegetable broth. The result was creamy smooth and not too sweet and not bitter at all. Warming this soup tomorrow will be fantastic! The only thing that you may want change is cutting up the turnips more as I found cutting them into even eights required more than an hour to cook them through.\nThank you! This a unique soup and one to keep!!!"

The only thing I did different was I did add Garlic and I had some rutabaga that I added from our garden. Some are saying the texture was too 'baby food like'. That is exactly what root soup is! :) If you are adding more broth, then saying it is too bland - that is why. If you add too much broth you are watering down the taste of the veggies. I served this with some home made Irish Brown Bread. It was delicious!"

Per other reviews, I added cumin, salt, pepper, and a little garlic salt, and I followed the recipe (except for the celery root). The first few bites were good and hearty, but then it started tasting a little like dirt; the earthiness was a little heavy. The veggies I had were butternut squash, sweet potato, red onion, parsnips, carrots, zucchini, yellow squash, mushrooms, and red onion. I'm sure it was a combination of my own \"operator error\" and the veggies I used, but I was a little disappointed."

I roasted them @ 350F for 2 hours, stirring once every 25 mins. I then placed the roaster on my stove top, scraped down the sides with a whisk, and while adding the vegetable broth...I pureed it with my hand-held blender. Instead of adding the cream, I served it with a dollop of fat-free sour cream. Although my guests begged for seconds, I made them hold off until after the 5th course was served. Needless to say I ended up sending them home with the left over soup."

I subbed olive oil for the butter and used a little flour &amp; water to thicken it instead of adding the half 'n half (on a vegan diet) and it was plenty thick &amp; creamy. I used only one turnip because after tasting a piece of one raw I thought it was pretty bitter and I ended up wishing I'd left it out entirely. I didn't have any carrots but thought the sweet potato &amp; squash would lend enough sweetness and they did. What this soup needed was seasoning and I ended up going with garlic &amp; rosemary, which I really liked. I didn't have celery or sweet onion so I used a large shallot and 4 plump cloves of garlic instead and really liked the flavor. I may make this again but will substitute yukon gold potatoes for the turnips. I honestly think the turnips are what ruined it for me. They were just too bitter. Tasted like there were radishes in the soup."

Some problems I ran into: Butternut squash roasts to fork tender much more quickly than some of the other things being roasted! So, by the time I had everything soft, some of the veggies had begun to crisp &amp; brown! Once I started to puree, it became more \"mashed veggie\" consistency than soup. I added more broth, ran out of veggie broth...and moved on to chicken broth! Maybe I had more veggies than called for? I dislike amounts like \"3 carrots\" instead of 3 ounces, or 2 cups. The carrots I grabbed were the smallest in the bag, but still larger than others I've bought (farmer's market veggies vs. store veggies?)! My sweet potato was kind of large, b/c the alternative was 2 very small ones &amp; I thought the big one looked nicer on the outside. So, maybe I had too many veggies, in the end I just added more liquid to help boost it...but I do think this could use some more herbs."
