As you make them, they can be stacked with the parchment squares in between."

I let the dough rest for 30 mins. Then used my kitchen aid pasta roller attachment. Saved me so much time."

I should have dusted them or used wax paper between the layers when I stacked the finished wrappers on a plate. I had the most amazing looking tower of eggrolls, but when i went to fry them, two of them ripped because the were sticking together. Lesson learned. But the effort was still worth it, they came out absolutely delicious."

But I was set on making crab rangoons for a potluck and of course, none of the food markets that were open at 9 pm had wonton wrappers. \n\nSo overall, great recipe. Everyone was incredibly impressed that I made everything by hand but it was a simple, foolproof recipe. I ran out of time so instead of resting with a damp cloth, I wrapped it in plastic wrap and let sit overnight in the fridge. Let it rest on the counter for about 10 minutes then rolled out with plenty of cornstarch. Don't use flour when rolling out. It will make it tacky. Use cornstarch!"

I've never had to make Wonton Wraps before but this recipe was great. I let the dough sit for 30 minutes and used a little less flour. Unfortunately, I did have to roll it out with a rolling pin and that was a tad time consuming. Making more today and I'm planning on using a circular cookie cutter, maybe that will cut 5 or 10 minutes off cooking time?"

I learned that after cutting these out and after making them to put them on waxed paper dusted with cornstarch and that is what keeps them from sticking together. I would make many pans of them and freeze them between the cornstarch dusted waxed paper that were layered high in a plastic container. When I wanted to fry some up, I would just take out what I needed. Very nice way of storing them!"

I have a Marcato Atlas Wellness 150 Pasta Maker and I highly recommend it rather than rolling them out by hand. I make the wontons into 5\" by 6\" rectangles and make my own hot pockets. Put in pepperoni, mozzarella, and marinara sauce. Fry them up and then freeze them for quick lunches. MUCH better and cheaper than buying them at the store."

I wanted to make crab ragoons and apparently where I live no one has ever heard of them because there was not a single store selling the right wrappers, only those rigid spring rolls wrappers. At 6 pm, after checking I don't know how many stores I was tired and I lost all hope. As usual when I'm desperate, I turned to Google for help and when I found this I couldn't believe it was so easy to make them. The best part is that while eating them what we liked the most wasn't the filling or the sauce but the crunchy, tasty wrapper. Life saver and better than anything store bought."

The dough was beautiful to work with. I actually made the dough the day before, wrapped it and put it in the fridge. The next morning I took it out to come to room temp and 'rest'. I used a pasta machine to roll the dough to the thickness I wanted. Very easy and VERY delicious, waaaay better than store bought (and cheaper too)...A definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)"

I followed the recipe, except I let the dough rest for 45 minutes. They were so easy to roll out. Just make sure to roll them paper thin, or there will be waay to much dough when you fry them. I also used flour to knead the dough, and then mixed half flour half corn meal to roll them. Also, make sure to knead long enough, it took me 15 minutes. So don't think you need a pasta maker to make this recipe."

The only really big issue is rolling this business out is HARD! We have since decided while it is nice to make wonton wrappers at home it is like making your own butter, it's just energy and cost effective to buy them from the store. The materials cost about as much at the store as buying the stuff and making it at home AND it taste just the same. But it was a fine recipe"

I suggest letting them cure a little individually before dusting with flour and stacking. Instead of making squares, we used a 3 1/2\" circle cutter to make rounds and made potato, onion, and cheddar perogies. Any scraps I deep-fried and drizzled with honey and sprinkled with powdered sugar for a sweet snack. I had no wasted dough. Personally this is the recipe I'll use to make ravioli, dumplings, eggrolls, and perogies from now on. It is very versatile and easy to make."

Took my bamboo cutting board and dusted it with flower. Flattened the dough out best I could by hand , pizza crust style. Then, with a dough scraper, cut the circle into six equal slices. Flattened out each piece and broke again into four pieces. Rolled all of the pieces into balls, let rest on parchment paper in between the board. I floured my board again and flattened each circle first with my palm, and then with the bottom of a measuring cup, also sprinkled in flour. I used the scraper to cut each circle into a square, then gave them on final mash. Made a few more with the circle scraps. Drained and pressed a can of spinach (usually use frozen, but had none on hand), sauteed 3/4 of an onion with a can of mushrooms in 2tbs butter, then tossed them in my mixer with 8oz room temp cream cheese. Filled the wraps and fried in sunflower oil. Made a dipping sauce with a little soy sauce, orange juice, and a tiny bit of oil/flour roux. Superb!"
