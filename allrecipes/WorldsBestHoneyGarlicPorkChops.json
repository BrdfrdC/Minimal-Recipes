We only had 1/2 inch chops--ten of them--and between four of us, three of us and a neighbor--all ten no longer exist in the world. The sauce is basically a BBQ sauce and provides the chops with a memorable, juicy flavor, as long as they are not overcooked. I didn't end up with a glaze, but the sauce was so good, it didn't matter. I suspect if I flash-broil the chops for a bit, after grilling, that I'd get a nice glaze."

I then glased one side, face up, turned it over, glazed, turned it over 30 sec each,them moved them to a baking tray. This used half the glaze. Then I baked on grill 250 degrees. Glaze side up. 5 mins, flip and repeat. This prevented that black carbon forming from that high temp. Both sides glazed under grill and it was PERFECT."

The only changes I made to the sauce were to use 1/4 cup honey and 3 large pressed garlic cloves. I did make the quantity of sauce shown for 6 chops, and did end up using most of it for cooking our 1 double chop. I began the chop on high heat on my grill, having sprayed it first with avocado oil. After searing both sides and the fatty top, I lowered the heat to medium and/or medium low, turning every 3 minutes and basting with each turn. It took 30 minutes to reach 145 degrees and it was tender and succulent. My hat‚Äôs off to Chef John!"

I doubled the garlic, which I think improved on an already really good glaze. I also flipped the chops every 2 minutes and brushed them with more glaze. It added a little more dimension to the finished product. I should add that drying the chops off before searing them is an important step--dont' skip it or your glaze will just slide off the meat."

I turned the broiler on high, salted the naked pork chops, and broiled them for about 6-7 minutes on each side. Then, I dabbed them with a paper towel to absorb the moisture, brushed them with the sauce, and put them back in the oven for another 1-2 minutes. Repeated on the other side. Came out tasty, and will make them again!"

We cooked for pork chops\n\nI give this five stars, very delicious sauce one of the best pork chops I‚Äôve tried. Unfortunately it won‚Äôt allow me to upload my photo even if I am trying to size it down, but I have shared on my Facebook as well as my Instagram and this is an amazing recipe \n\nPicky child eater approved !!!"

When I was done brushing on the sauce, I placed the rest in a small sauce pan to cook the raw garlic a little and served it on the side as a sauce. 10/10 would recommend."

"reviewBody": "My boyfriend seemed to like this recipe and it tasted better the next day- to be fair. I‚Äôm just surprised it has so many raving reviews because it quite literally tastes like ketchup. I‚Äôd expected the other ingredients would obscure the ketchupy taste a bit, but it‚Äôs a ketchup marinade basically, which isn‚Äôt that exciting. Maybe my pallete is different or more advanced than the reviewers here but for all the rave I expected something more than a keychupy taste. Other things taste great with ketchup like burgers and hotdogs and fries but if I‚Äôm gonna actually ‚Äúcook‚Äù something and ‚Äúmarinade‚Äù it I don‚Äôt want it to taste like something a college student quickly put together. Or for it to taste like artificially sweetened tomatoes when I could just use either real tomatoes or something closer to a real tomato taste like a dash of tomato paste and other ingredients. So I‚Äôm definitely still on the look out for a bomb pork marinade that doesn‚Äôt taste like ketchup. But if you want something fast that at least my boyfriend seemed to like enough, I suppose this will do. I tossed it in the oven and turned it every 15 or so, slathering the recipe amount of the ketchup marinade on it."

I marinated them in 1/2 the sauce for about an hour as one person recommended before I put them on the grill. Came out very tasty. I‚Äôd probably double the glaze if I was making more than 2 chops. I‚Äôll definitely make them again."
