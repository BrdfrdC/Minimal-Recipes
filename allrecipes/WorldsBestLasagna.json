I made a double batch, I used 8 mild itialian sausage links removed the casings a little over 2 lbs of ground chuck 1 red bell pepper 1 green bell pepper and 1 yellow bell pepper 1 sweet yellow onion all minced and half cooked with sausage and half cooked with hamburger meat definitely drain off all the grease from both meats 1 tomato paste 3 30oz cans of fire roasted crushed tomatoes 2 15oz Tomatoe sauces 3 tablespoons of sugar 3/4 cup of red wine 2 bay leafs, 4 tablespoons of fresh flat leaf parsley. I had to add an additional teaspoon of basil and also 1 additional teaspoon of itialian seasoning salt to taste pepper to taste. I used a total of 5 chopped garlic cloves probably 2 tablespoons. Definitely refrigerate over night after simmering for about 3 hours with the lid on. I did add about 1 cup total of water throughout the cook including at 7am when I started to reheat. We are having it for lunch so I plan to have them in the oven by 10:45 ish so I have time to make garlic bread in the oven. As always this is my base recipe and these are the tweaks I know for a fact this will make \"the best lasagna ever\" ."

I haven't given a review yet because it's in the oven lol... I think I didn't put enough of the noodles on the first layer I only put 3😧 So this time I put 6 it makes sense that first layer should be more noodles to hold its form. Anyways I will write up another review after it's all done 😋 .. Fingers 🤞"

"reviewBody": "Really liked this recipe. I like deep dish lasagna and am gluten intolerant so made these adjustments: 1 1/2 lb ground beef, 2 - 8 oz cans of mushroom stems and pieces, and 2 - 6 oz cans olives (recommend dicing in food processor), 2 - 14.5 oz cans diced tomatoes with Italian Seasoning, and doubled all of the cheeses. Used Barilla Gluten Free Oven Ready Lasagna Noodles (can be found online). If using these noodles, recommend making the lasagna the night before or early in the day and increasing the amount of water used by 1/2 to 1 cup as they need extra time to soften. There may be extra sauce left over so try using it as a spaghetti sauce."

First of all, the directions are off - there is way too much sauce for only 2 layers of noodles (6 noodles in each layer!?!), I had so much sauce that it would not all fit in my dish which is an extra deep lasagna pan. The sauce itself was too sweet for my taste. I will not be making it again."

I used frozen seasoning blend (onions, celery, green peppers or in Louisiana we call it in the trinity) in lieu of minced onions. I also used dried parsley bc the store was out of fresh but I did use fresh basil instead of dried. My daughter didn’t care for the fennel so I’ll leave that out next time. I bought the sliced log mozzarella but it was thick slices so it wasn’t going to divide up evenly between the layers. I cut them into smaller pieces to spread them. However it was still good and I didn’t feel like it wasn’t enough mozzarella. Next time I’m going to try doubling it to see. How it does between layers."

It was almost like the ricotta and mozzarella weren’t there. The tomato paste flavor was too strong in my view. I made it for a friends gathering last night and I could tell they weren’t enamored with it either since no one really commented on it. I’m going back to winging it on my lasagna with less sauce, and more ricotta, and using jarred spaghetti sauce and only hamburger."

I love the use of two cans of tomato paste (and really love the trick of getting it out of the van by opening both sides and using one lid to push it out.) I soaked my lasagna noodles (12) in very hot (just boiled) water. I made mine four layers because that’s more traditional. Great flavors and not runny at all. Everyone went back for seconds, even my four year old grandson. Thank you fir a wonderful recipe!"

I've made this twice. It's really delicious. I double the ricotta, parsley, and egg. I recommend one pound of fresh mozzarella, but buy unsliced if you can. I think the slices on pre-sliced mozzarella cheese are too thick. Don't forget the Parmesan. It's tucked in there and easy to miss. I'm more generous with it than the recipe calls for. I'm a believer that sugar is necessary to cut the acid of the tomatoes, but I used only one tablespoon. I used about a cup of red wine - not expensive but very drinkable. I had about 1 1/2 cups extra sauce and noodles. I did cook the sauce 90 minutes and prepared it the day before."

"reviewBody": "Wow!!! I think that this may be one of the best dinners I've ever made. Just phenominal. I made a few edits based on my own personal taste. 1. Tenderized the ground beef by mashing 1/8 tsp baking soda into it &amp; letting it sit for 20 minutes prior to browning (I don't like hard super texturized chunks of ground beef in my sauce, so this almost softens it and allows it to blend in better with the sauce) 2. Didn't use Italian sausage (didn't have any), and skipped the fennel seeds (dont care for fennel) 3. Used whole wheat lasagna pasta 4. Used about 1/2 more ricotta than what was called for. What can I say... I love cheese 5. Broiled for the last 5 minutes on 400° The end result was a house filled with the beautiful aroma of fresh sauce and crispy cheese, and a very happy husband! The lasagna wasn't too watery and didn't fall apart when I served it. This recipe was super easy to put together, and can be frozen afterward. A must try for sure!"

A splash of red wine to scrape up the bits on the bottom of the pan. No sugar. Also I use all spicy Italian sausage plus crushed fennel seeds. Commercial Italian sausage contains some sort of sweetener , sugar or corn syrup. My noodles are half cooked so that they are not overcooked. Pecorino romano instead of Parmesan. These are my tweaks, but my basic recipe is almost the same. Delicious!!"
