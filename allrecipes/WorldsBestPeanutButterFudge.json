BUT… the taste makes it totally worth trying to salvage this recipe (which doesn’t give clear enough directions to allow it to set properly). I’m buying a candy thermometer just because I believe this fudge can be awesome! It needs to be cooked properly for it to set properly.

So, I invested in a candy thermometer and tweaked the recipe just a little. I used two cups granulated sugar and two cups packed brown sugar, for added depth of flavor. I added 2 tablespoons of corn syrup. I used a 12 oz can of evaporated milk. \nI cooked the syrup over medium heat until my thermometer read 237. I took it off the heat and scooped my premixed pb/marshmallow mixture onto the surface of the syrup without stirring. I allowed the mixture to cool to 140 degrees. I added 1 tsp. vanilla and used my hand mixer to blend the peanut butter mix into the fudge. I poured it into my 9x13 pan, prepared with parchment paper. It set up in no time! Give it a try without the flour. Invest in that thermometer...It's worth it."

I didn’t have a thermometer but after the sugar mixture came to a rolling boil I timed for 5 minutes on med/high heat while stirring constantly. Came out perfect.

Something made me come back to this one and I began reading the reviews. I made it and it truly is the best PB fudge that I've ever eaten. I mixed the flour with the PB and marshmallow cream. I did increase the PB to a full jar (I'm one of those people) and it worked out perfectly. Rolling boil for 5 min... All went smoothly and it came out a very dense, rich, beautiful fudge. Worlds Best, I have to agree! Great recipe and I'll use this one from now on. Add the extra PB, you will not be sorry."

I increased the PB to 14 oz and decreased the sugar to 3 1/2 cups, may try decreasing to 3 cups next time and use 16 oz PB. When it came to a boil, I did the 5 min., Then checked in ice water. It made a soft ball so I removed from heat and added remaining ingredients. This fudge is delicious."

If you don’t, it will start to scorch and it will make little brown pieces in your fudge. I lined a 9x13 dish with aluminum foil that I greased with a stick of butter."

"reviewBody": "I have made this fudge dozens of times. For those who have a problem with the fudge not becoming firm after setting and stated that it was too soft--here is some candy making advice from a real candy maker that I received after having the same problem:. Don't make this fudge recipe on a rainy or humid day, because it won't set. Something about humidity affects the cooking process. I have found this to be true. If I make it on a rainy day, it's too soft. \n Also, if you cook it too long, it becomes very dry and crumbly. To save time, I mix the peanut butter, marshmallow cream, and flour together while waiting for the mixture to boil.\n You can vary the recipe by using caramel peanut butter, etc. After spreading in the pan, I top with colored sugar crystals for the holidays."

However, I liked the taste so much, I did more batches before hitting on about 10 minutes at the \"sweet spot\" for this recipe. Now it is the only one I will use."

"reviewBody": "Made this with my granddaughter Jacie (11) before Christmas and she practically made it by herself. Everyone liked it so much I had to make another batch tonight. Both times it turned out perfectly. So smooth and creamy. Never became crumbly and set perfect. I lined my pan with aluminum foil and lightly coated the foil with butter. Easy to pull of out of the pan to slice. Will be making this one of my go to fudge recipes- reminds me of my mother's . She has been gone for over 23 yrs- and never could find her recipe. She had always made several varieties of fudge for Christmas. Thanks for letting me carry on her tradition with my granddaughter- taste just like mom's. (Not many things can equal -mom's cooking) Thank you!"

The first time I made it using another recipe it was good but the last time it turned out like gritty soup and I was hesitant about trying again. Glad I found this recipe because I think it was the flour that held it so well. I'd prefer just a little bit more crumble to it though, otherwise, so tasty and there's plenty of it!"

I put the rest of the ingredients into the bowl and I stir it constantly. When it is fully boiling, not just boiling around the edges, is when you start the five minute timer. If you still have trouble go to the store and buy yourself peanut butter fudge out of aisle 13 and stop wasting your time on poor reviews for this great fudge. This person deserves nothing but praise and gold barrels filled with mead."

Also i used a candy thermometer but went on up to the softball stage. That's where it went with 5 minutes and it works well. I added about 1/4 more pb because we like it and a bit of vanilla. My kids fight over the bowl and spoon or whisk. This is by far the best pb fudge out there!"

A roaring boil is when it continues to boil up when stirred. After cooling make sure it is kept in a cool place and in is an air tight container so it does not dry out. This fudge holds up without getting too soft ."
