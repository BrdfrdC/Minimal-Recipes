I made it for my son's birthday party barbecue today and am in the process of making macaroni salad at the last minute because I don't even want to serve it."

This is so good the next day and the next. I boiled the potatoes whole for 20 minutes and they came out great. I tried to get the same size. They peeled easy when warm. I used the yukon gold and they held together well. I cooked the eggs 5 minutes in a pressure pot. Peel them warm, and no problem with the shell. ( My daughter's tip) My husband doesn't like the potato salad, so I eat it all! Good luck!"

"reviewBody": "If you cook the dressing for 10 minutes like the video suggests it becomes quite thick...at least mine did and I used the exact measurements called for on the sauce. While cooking, the sauce had an odd texture which made me a bit nervous but once it cooled and was added to the mayo it was very smooth and creamy. I used 7 medium sized red potatoes but maybe could have added another 1 or 2 and still had plenty of sauce. The only changes I made was to use 1/2 yellow and 1/2 dijon mustard and to sub some green onions for regular onion. It is a bit on the sweet side and I think next time I will use white vinegar. I only had AC vinegar and the recipe didnt specify so...I think white vinegar would make the sauce less sweet. this is a delicious recipe and it will be my new \"go to\" for potato salad."

He had trouble finding a potato salad that he liked after our local supermarket deli stopped making the sliced potato salad, so I found this recipe and made it.

I used apple cider vinegar, almond milk instead of evaporated, half a medium white onion and 3 diced green onions. I left the skin on my red potatoes. I had never hard boiled eggs this way and noticed I could remove the shell easier after they cooled completely. I also added the celery seed. Something to keep in mind is the size of your potatoes for those who had too much dressing. I used larger red potatoes. I also added in another cup of celery. Nothing but rave reviews!"

I am not sure that adding some ingredients to mayonnaise (doesn't everyone do that when they make potato salad?) counts as making your \"own dressing\" as the recipe claims, but I do know that it took a lot more time than the other potato salad I was making and had a slightly less desirable texture in the end. I didn't find it particularly rich or creamy."

We don't have strange taste for strange foods but this was good and different from plain potato salad...I will fix it again. It takes a little more time but worth it."
