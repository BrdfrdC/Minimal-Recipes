"reviewBody": "This turned out to be a great soup, but the way it’s written is subject to interpretation, and there are unknown factors. “8 potatoes” can vary greatly in size, as well as “enough water to cover all ingredients.” So, I measured most everything I did, and it ended up to be 5 stars. I also took the advice of some reviews, such as cutting down chicken broth because of saltiness, using less bacon, and adding carrots. I peeled the potatoes because my husband can’t eat potato skins. I used 12 small and medium ones and it was easily 4-1/2 cups. I used 1 diced celery stalk, a medium chopped onion, and 1/2 to 3/4 cup of minced carrots and sautéed them in some butter for a few minutes, then added 3 cups of water to cover and 3 teaspoons of chicken broth powder. Also sprinkled a little garlic powder in it. Cubed potatoes do not need to cook initially for 15 minutes, so I cooked it (covered) a lot less than the recipe states. (One reviewer suggested removing 1/3 of the water after cooking and before adding anything else, but I did not do that.) Then I added the mushroom soup and 3/4 of a 12 oz. package of good turkey bacon. I realized that if I added an entire pint of half &amp; half, it would be too thin for our liking, so I added only a 1/2 cup, and then only 3/4 cup of medium cheddar cheese. It turned out great, and the next day it was even better! It had thickened more by then, so I added a little more half and half when I reheated it. I’ll be making this again!"

"reviewBody": "This is a terrible recipe. It wasn't at all thick. Why leave the skins on? They just come off and float around. Didn't have much flavor but I followed what a commentor said and added things so it did. The cheese did not incorporate at all. I did a roux to thicken the soup and if I had added milk and cheese to that and then added that to the soup it might have worked out. It would be good to specify the type and size of potatoes as well. Also, adding bacon into the pot is a bad idea because it will get soft. But it makes sense as a topping. There are definitely better potato soup recipes."

Used reduced sodium chicken broth and 2 oz of bacon bits to avoid salt overload. Stayed with recipe otherwise and love the soup. I am not much of a cook - more of a recipe reader. Think this is a wonderful recipe."

Yesterday I didn't feel like going to the store and had some food that needed to use or lose so typed in potatoes and half and half. I love potato soup and was actually surprised I never made it. I ended up having to make do with ingredients I had on hand and it still came out very good.\nSubstituted cream of broccoli instead of mushroom, used a palm full of dried minced onion instead of fresh and since I thought I'd used too much water for the potatoes I took half of them out of the pot and riced them back in to thicken it up. I've gotta say that even though I brutalized the recipe I was very happy at the result. Though I wasn't able to follow the recipe I thank you for posting it. \nBTW I also only had half of the bacon but it didn't suffer much from that I don't think."

Really glad I was out of the chicken bouillon or i never would have discovered how delicious it was with the beef instead. Rich broth, that i swear you could drink from a cup as a snack."

I am a novice cook so I was double impressed that I was able to make something so delicious"

A pound of bacon seemed a bit much, so I reduced this to about 1/2 a pound. I will definitely make this again with these changes, as it was delicious."

I had a red bell pepper lying around, so that was diced and went in to provide some color and a bit more flavor. I also snipped a few pieces of green onions on the top to garnish the bowls."

"reviewBody": "I agree that it's an excellent starting point but I also agree with others on content and cooking - I saute onions, celery, garlic in a little of the bacon drippings until they begin to look clear and are soft but not mush and I do NOT use an entire pound of bacon -- use your personal discretion on garlic, onions, bacon etc. - if you love em use more, not so much use less. I boiled the potatoes then rough mashed about half of them putting them back into a cup of the potato liquid (for the starch) added 2 cups of chicken broth (use more broth or water if it's needed to cover everything) and put the veggies in with the potato mixture let simmer, add a pint of half and half (or heavy cream), a regular can of cream of mushroom soup - salt and pepper to taste at this point - let it get slow bubbly hot again and slowly add as much milk as you like - less for thicker soup more for thinner soup - when it is nice and bubbly add cheese ( I used Colby, Swiss and sharp cheddar combined) when the cheese is melted stir in 8 ozs of sour cream and bacon - garnish as desired. It is heavenly."

I didn't have a whole pint of half and half, so I added a can of Campbell's cheddar cheese soup with the cream of mushroom. I only had 4 large potatoes, so at the very end, I was simultaneously roasting chicken and threw some breast meat in because I like a thicker soup. It was a good recipe but I did add quite a bit of black pepper in at the end. It was just a bit bland for us. Thanks for sharing the recipe, it was an easy base and pretty versatile to throw some left overs together into something yummy."

NO CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP. i took 1 cup of cooked potatoes, mashed them, and put them back in the pot as the thickener."
