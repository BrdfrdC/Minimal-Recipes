"reviewBody": "The best recipe ever. I grate 1/2 Cup of frozen , unsalted butter with a course cheese grater just before mixing the scone dough up. I keep the flour and other dry ingredients (nuts/fruit) in a sealed, metal mixing bowl in the fridge overnight. I take my freshly grated frozen butter and stir it into the dry mix distributing it well. Then I just whisk the egg and sour cream together and combine. I usually make 6, not 8. I just grab the dough with a generously floured hand and gentle form the scones. I bake on parchment, no need to grease. \n\nBaked mine 15-20 minutes as they are larger. These freeze extremely well and the air fryer resurrects them like they are fresh from the oven. \n\nThank you for this amazing recipe. When my mom visits I make a double batch so we can enjoy them and she takes the rest home. Her favourite is toasted walnuts, and I like them with walnuts abs raisins."

I also cut my butter up into small pieces, dust it with flour so the pieces don’t stick together and put in a bowl and put in the freezer for about an hour. Then right before mixing everything together, I take the butter out and break into pea sized pieces. Helps keep the butter solid until right before it goes in the oven."

I didn't brush them with the egg wash, also an advice from a comment, and I did not miss it. Oh, I did add raisins, and -amazing! Cheese and rosemary next time!"

I'm a bit of a nerd, so I actually read through all the reviews and compiled the adjustments that others had suggested. I took the ones that came up most often and applied them to my efforts, and WOW....did I say WOW. These scones came out amazing. Not only did I think so, but so did the family, who requested another batch this weekend. I altered the flavor profile and once again had another hit.\n\nSo here's what I did with the ingredients... 1. Decreased the baking powder to 3 teaspoons. 2. Increased the butter to 6 tablespoons. 3. Added 1.5 tsp of vanilla 4. Eliminated the egg. 5. Substituted for the currants/raisins (more on that in a moment).\n\nFrom a process perspective... 1. I threw the butter into the freezer the night before, and pulled it out when I needed it and chopped into pea size pieces. 2. After making the flour mix and adding the butter, I put the bowl in the freezer for 5 minutes. 3. Put the scones on parchment paper instead of greased cookie sheet. 4. Eliminated the egg wash and sprinkled generously with granulated sugar on top before baking. 5. Baked for 17 minutes when a toothpick came out clean. They still look quite blond at this time, but they are done.\n\nFlavor alterations...\nBatch 1 - peeled and chopped one granny smith apple to fill about 3/4 cup, and then coated with 1 tbl cornstarch and 1 tsp cinnamon. This was somebody else's idea and it was excellen"

I used self rising flour because of other reviews commenting on having to reduce the amount of baking soda due to bitterness. They rose up light and fluffy! I used blueberries for fruit but am making some chocolate chip and white chocolate raspberry in the morning so possibilities are endless! After brushing the tops with the egg/milk mixture I sprinkled them lightly with sugar. Finally, I recommend a longer baking time than the recipe calls for. It takes a good 20-25 minutes to get them a soft golden brown."

"reviewBody": "Followed other reviewers' recommendations and reduced baking powder to 3 tsp and froze and grated butter into dough. Egg wash gave nice color. Mine were for 2 teenagers so added mini choc. chips rather than currants. Next time make for me with dried cranberry and add almond extract to mix. Make orange icing for top. May attempt clotted cream recipe in allrecipes also. I made mine into 12 smaller scones - 11 in pic because 1 in my tummy."

"reviewBody": "It’s light and cakey. It expands and doubles in size (or mine did at least). I added 1 tablespoon of lemon extract and 1.5 cups of frozen blueberries (which seems like a lot but almost every bite had a blueberry). I took the advice of others and grated the butter and mixed until just incorporated. I put the mixture in the freezer for 15 minutes just to make sure the butter wasn’t melted. The texture is cake like and not dense like the American scones. Two thumbs up, it would be perfect for a tea party or get together!"

They are a lot more fluffier than baking soda biscuits and not as sharp.\n\n I left out the raisins/currants and I mixed the egg and milk then took half of it and added it to the recipe. I also used only 3 tsp of baking powder. \n\nThey turned out a little lighter and not as crumbly. Add three min to overall baking time and don’t open the oven door at all."

No egg wash either and I prefer tearing the dough over hand rolling into balls. (thank you for sharing this tip fellow scone baking enthusiasts! )I have made two types so far: sweet scones with fresh blueberries ( entirely without the sugar) and savoury chili cheese scones. The latter are more popular with my peeps. Just taking a fresh batch out of the oven. Next week, rosemary scones."

Then, gently again, formed into round \"patties\" three inches diameter by about 1.5 inches tall. 375 degree convection for 12 min worked best."

In place of the milk I used half heavy cream and half milk. I also added the coarse sugar on top to bake since that's how they made them in England, and added a splash of vanilla.... just cause.

The dough was very sticky, so make sure you have flour available on the side. I gently pressed the dough into a circle and cut out eight wedges. I did not use the egg as it seemed like a waste (unless you are making scrambled eggs). I brushed the scones with buttermilk, or you can use heavy cream. I sprinkled vanilla sugar on the top of each scone. It took about 17 minutes in my oven. They were good, and I would describe the texture as crunchy biscuits that are tender, soft and fluffy inside."

I like that I could save a step by just rolling them into a balls, and then press flat, rather than patty down the entire dough, then cutting round with a biscuit cutter, or into wedge some with a knife. I substituted blueberries for the currants, and drizzled with a lemon glaze (1 c powdered sugar, 1/4 c lemon juice, zest of 1/2 lemon, and 1/2 TBS of butter, all heated over double boiler, whisking til smooth). Served with hot Earl Grey tea. Being true scones, they do have a biscuit-like texture, so if you prefer the very sweet dense kind of scones you can buy at grocery store here in the U.S. , this recipe may not be for you."
