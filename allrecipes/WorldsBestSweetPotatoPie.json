It made 3 deep dish pies, which ended up being a great thing because people were happy to take leftover pie home with them. I recommend the Kroger brand frozen 2-pack deep dish pie crust. For the 3rd pie I used a different one, but preferred Kroger's and was asked by 2 people whether it was homemade crust."

Something I thought I had until I made her pie. Now, a days I make this, which is pretty much 'Grandma Brown's' pie with 1/2 the sugar ??. \nI want this written for 1 pie as well. Please! ??. I know taking out 1/3 of everything won't work. Thank you!"

I made the pies for Thanksgiving and brought one to a family get-together, one to a friend get-together, and one to stay at my house. I got rave reviews from everyone and personally thought it was fantastic. Absolutely delicious!"
