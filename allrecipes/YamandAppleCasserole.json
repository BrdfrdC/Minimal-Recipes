Used one TBSP sugar and this was plenty sweet for us as a side dish. Per another reviewer, added some minced fresh ginger, and this was good. Instead of boiling, I microwaved the sweet potato for 3 minutes, and this worked well. (Fed the potato skins to my dog, so he gives 5 stars to this recipe also.) Will definitely make again."

In fact, they liked it that there was no sugar. How about that."

Used apple cider instead of apple juice. Had a half of a navel orange, which I cut up and added. (peeled, of course). Threw it all in the crockpot with the butter sauce and cooked for about 4 hours on low. It was kind of sticky looking, but oh man...outstanding flavor! Definitely keeping the recipe so I can make it again (and again and again.)"

"reviewBody": "I found and saved this recipe a number of years ago but had thought it not \"fancy\" enough for my Thanksgiving table, so I never tried it. Was I wrong! I finally made it yesterday for just my husband and myself and think I may serve it next Thanksgiving instead of the other wonderful preparations I have been using (also from this site). I would be terrific for \"every day\", too. It is simple to prepare, not cloyingly sweet and uses much less butter and sugar than other recipes. The apples softened a lot in the oven. The sweet potatoes, though soft, kept their shape. The blend together was perfect. (By the way, boiling them whole and then plunging them into cold water so they were not too hot to handle made peeling a breeze. The skins simply fell off by slightly rubbing.) I was a bit concerned that the sauce was too thin and runny when I put it in the oven, but it thickened up nicely, especially after taking off the cover for the last half hour. The only thing I have to work on is presentation, because I wouldn't want to put a 13x9 Pyrex baking pan on the dinner table. Next time, I am considering layering in circles in a round casserole dish or dividing into two smaller, square Corningware pans that might make a pretty presentation."

(this would be easier for me then cutting up apples) I am just curious to see if someone tried altering this and if it worked? thanks..."

Also, I didn't have apple juice so I used apple sauce instead. Lastly, adding salt to the recipe made the casserole taste more like a side dish (my family loves dessert so they would've been easily confused!). Great recipe all in all...I received comments like, \"better than Marie Calendar's yams!\""

I was forced to substitute bottled spiced cider for the apple juice, so I omitted the spices and lemon (since those ingredients are already in the cider). It came out great! Very simple-- and I widdled 4 ingredients down to 1."

It's an excellent recipe for those looking for something different. I will definately be using this again!"
