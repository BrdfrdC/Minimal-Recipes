I had some glass noodles and this was the first recipe that popped up.\nI made it as written with the sauce although for some reason I was reading sesame oil. Used that but I dont think there is much a difference.\nI did add carrots and green onion. \nDelicious and my kids were eating before we even left\nI wonder though as it really is sweet if I cut the sugar back."

I made it exactly as the recipe said (he's not a very big meat easter, so it's perfect the way it is for him) and I made bibimbop and my son plus family and friends gobbled or all up faster than I could dish out. I'm actually making it again tonight. Thank you so much for the wonderfully simple recipe."

I used a box of thin rice noodles instead of vermicelli and before adding the noodles to my wok, I put carrots, mushrooms and green onions in. It was awesome. \nI'm sure it would go well with thinly sliced chicken or shrimp. Very good recipe!"

I mix sautéed vegetables such as sweet onion, celery, green pepper, and use it as a side dish with grilled steak. I used low-sodium soy sauce and sometimes sautéed vegetables in light sesame seed oil when I have it. topping green onion.. everybody's a critic, this is an easy play around recipe for first time international cooks!!"

"reviewBody": "This turned out great. The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly, perhaps adding a bit more brown sugar to fit my taste. The second time, I just boiled the vermicelli as I would regular pasta - it cooked WAY faster. I also skipped the skillet part, because the first time my noodles stuck and it made no difference in taste. Instead, I just added a bit of sesame oil - a little goes a long way here - and tossed the noodles with the sesame seeds. The oil seemed to bring all the flavors together much better than the first time."
