The game-changer was that I also used an immersion blender. This made the casserole so light and fluffy, it was like eating air!"

The only changes I made to this recipe other than the type of sweet potato (I have made it with gold sweet potatoes mixed with the orange ones. I have also made purple sweet potatoes and gold sweet potatoes mixed) is that I add about a half can of pineapple that I crushed to each casserole so when I make a double batch I use a a full can. When you use the pineapple you don't need any sugar. Add a half a cup of sour cream per casserole and it really brings out the flavor! You're welcome! (Add a half a cup of sour cream for any sweet casserole or sweet bread that you make and you will triple the love for it!)"

"reviewBody": "As written, this is much too sweet for my taste. I have made this twice and tweaked the second version and it's much better, in my opinion. I used 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of real maple syrup. I also added cinnamon, about a teaspoon or so. I added 1 teaspoon of my homemade vanilla extract that I made using bourbon. I skipped the entire topping as we like ours topped with marshmallows. Also, I baked off the sweet potatoes rather than boiling them. I find that the sweet potato flavor gets lost in the whole boiling process, while baking them concentrates that flavor. As written, I'd give the recipe 2 stars. With my tweaks, I give it 4.5. I split the difference with you."

"reviewBody": "I LOVE sweet potatoes! But 1 thing I would HIGHLY recommend is to not boil them, roast them! I caramelizes the natural sugars and the flavor is SO much better! Also, it allows you to cut the added sugar to the recipe. I typically add a few tablespoons of light brown sugar, cinnamon, butter, &amp; a little heavy cream before mashing. Then add to your casserole dish and top with your pecan crumble mixture. Always a staple at any holiday dinner &amp; never have leftovers!"

For the sake of my daughter, after it's baked, I layer marshmallows as well and broil it till golden. I suggest that before you add the eggs to start slow on sugar and go by taste. Lllllllove it!!!"
