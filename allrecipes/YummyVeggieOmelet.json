I washed, dried and sautéed the mushrooms, then sat aside. I then sauteed chopped onions in a little butter and olive oil and added the asparagus, which was cooked, to warm. I sat all of these aside, added a little butter - maybe a tsp- to the pan and cooked four egg whites and two whole eggs as the recipe directed. I had a little left-over sharp cheddar and a blend of Parmesan, Asiago and Romano. Once the egg were set, I layered about one half cup over the eggs and put under the broiler until the cheese was melted. I spread the veggies on top and folded the eggs in half. It was very tasty!! I can't wait to have fresh tomatoes on hand to eat with this."

I also add fresh herbs. \nOne trick is to tilt the pan when lifting the side to let the uncooked egg slide to the sides. Also if you have a lid that fits over the pan, putting that on right after you add the toppings and cheese will hold in the heat and cook any uncooked egg left on top, usually just long enough to melt the cheese. Nothing worse than uncooked egg in your Omelet."

I didn't need the full two ounces of swiss. I just used a sprinkling. I ate this with a tablespoon of homemade salsa."

"reviewBody": "It's funny because I too changed the recipe and it was the best omelet I ever made! I believe it's the process that we are all having success with. I finely chopped up some turkey slices, 1/2 an orange pepper, and 1/4 of a green apple. I sauteed the turkey, pepper and apple in almond oil (just had it on hand) lightly sprinkled the mix with crushed mint, then set it aside in a bowl, sprayed the same pan with PAM, poured the egg mixture and moved it around in the pan as indicated, super easy!!, then added back the mixture, topped it with a chopped up deli slices of borehead's horseradish cheddar cheese (happened to be the cheese we had for sandwiches at the time) and sprinkled some romano cheese on top, then folded the omelet over--don't be worried if it breaks up a little, just fold it over and continue to cook, it should jell just fine. And voila! instant success. My advice, choose the leftover ingredients that you have that you usually make sandwiches with, substitute where you are missing, I was missing onion so I substituted it with a green apple, and keep the amounts of each to a minimum, I usually make the mistake of too much cheese or too much meat--making it too rich."

I added fresh spinach to the top of the sauteed veggie mixture and let it steam until wilted under the pan lid. I also loved the technique of lifting the edges to get the uncooked parts to run to the side and cook -- it was much easier than trying to flip or, worse, folding the omelet over and serving prematurely! :)"
