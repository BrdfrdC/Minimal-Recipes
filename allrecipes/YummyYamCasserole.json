The brown sugar and butter caramelize the pecans on top and they make this casserole yummy. I simply put this in my 325 degree oven by the turkey for about 45 minutes and it came out great."

Really, really good."

Let them cool, then removed the skins, and prepped the casserole. I used my electric mixer to whip them into a super creamy texture. Once my turkey was cooked, I removed it from the oven and then put the casserole in to bake while I made my gravy and carved the bird. The timing was perfect."

This is soooooo good I could not believe it. My dad who shared my dislike of yams tried and loved it as well. This recipe has become a part of our holiday \"regulars\" since."

I might have to try that sometime."
