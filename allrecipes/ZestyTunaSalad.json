This recipe is a little dry so you definitely have to up the mayo and adding the spices makes it very flavorful. I use the same recipe for chicken salad and they are so tasty!"

I like the creaminess. Also, I did not have sweet relish so I used dill relish and I thought it was still good so I'll use either in the future. I chopped the onion and then rinsed it because my husband isn't a huge fan of raw onion but I still like it - so rather than forgo it completely, I rinsed it in order to mellow the flavor. I think my can of tuna was 7 oz instead of 6 but I don't think that I will ever have to change the rest of the ingredients since it was such a small difference."

To stretch it for four sandwiches, I threw in two chopped hard boiled eggs, added another stalk of celery and threw in more chopped onion and relish. To add \"zest\", I threw in a couple shakes of Frank's Hot Sauce, dried dill, garlic/onion powder, and paprika. This did need more mayonnaise. It's a cheap sandwich filling (I appreciate this because we're really broke and need a cheap lunch that stretches well) but zesty as it sits? Not really."

This is good with or without the dill pickle. Serve it on toast or with a garden salad inside a hollowed out tomato or red pepper and it's a lite lunch that's attractive and good for you!"

However, the second time I made it I added 1 egg (not including the yolk) along with a little extra of the dijon mustard. Then it came much better, ecspecially after it chilled a while. YUM YUM!"
