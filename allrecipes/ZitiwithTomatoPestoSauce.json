"reviewBody": "I liked this recipe a lot. It was very fast. My only tweak was to add some of the pasta water to the tomato-pesto sauce as I mixed the pasta with it. It allows for the sauce to stick better to the pasta. I cooked a little portion of sweet Italian sausage to add a bit of protein. I also added a few sliced grape tomatoes and warmed them up with the sausage. The Parmesan also helps thickening the sauce while adding salt so be careful with the amount of salt. I will definitely make this again."

I used my homemade sauce, &amp; also saut√©ed some onions, garlic, bell peppers &amp; mushrooms to add in. I stirred in a few shifanoted fresh basil leaves before serving, &amp; grated Parmesano-Regiano cheese over all. It was exceptional, and my family enjoyed it very much. BTW, for us I used whole grain pasta."

I used whole wheat penne in place of regular ziti (couldn't find whole wheat ziti) as well as a mushroom &amp; pepper tomato sauce to add a few more nutrients. Adding sliced veggies to the sauce would also make this dish more hearty."

Also I bought Victoria basil-tomato sauce and pesto sauce. And they were both very good. The pesto was perfect. It was not overwhelming but you could taste the flavor. I melted mozzarella on my husband's dinner and with mine, I rounded out the dinner with a nice salad."

"reviewBody": "It never occured to me to add pesto sauce to plain old spaghetti sauce - the results are wonderful. Though you can't really taste the pesto, it really adds another layer flavor. I did change a few things. First, I browned and crumbled some sweet Italian sausage, then added some fresh mushrooms. Once that was all cooked, I add two cans of plain spaghetti sauce and almost a whole container of pesto. Once the pasta was cooked, I threw it all in a casserole, topped with cheese and baked for 20 minutes or so. My husband doesn't usually comment on pasta dishes - this one he did, repeatedly!"
