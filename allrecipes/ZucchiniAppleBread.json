The batter was extremely dry and crumbly until we added the extra oil. It cooked well and was a fast and easy recipe. We didn’t use walnuts because my mother couldn’t eat them. It was more like a cake than bread, though. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a somewhat-healthy cake-ish-bread-ish hybrid."

I let it sit in the fridge while I did other things (2 hours or so). That allowed all of the the zucchini to sweat enough to mix into a manageable batter. I made muffins, baking for 35 minutes. They were a hit!\nI will make this recipe again for sure!"

The first batch, I cut the flour back by 1/2 cup, sugar back by 1/2 cup, and added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and used zucchini I had squeezed the liquid out of. Still thick and bland. Next time I make it I will add 1 cup of applesauce or make sure you use fresh, drained but not squeezed, zucchini, and add more spice. I would also check on the bread after 30 minutes. 40 minutes was too long. This thick batter cooks quickly. 1 hour and I would've had dog treats."

I'm glad I added nutmeg too. I made a lemon glaze and garnished it with pecans and matcha covered chocolates. I would make this again, and since I love variety, I'd switch it up and try making it vegan with flaxmeal instead of eggs."

"reviewBody": "I made this bread twice. The 1st time I made it I followed the recipe and directions exactly. Result: My son, his wife and both of his boys loved it (hence, the 5 Stars). Both my Husband and I are diabetic, so the 2nd time I made it, I altered it (as I alter all of my \"for our consumption only\" quickbread recipes) by: (a) using 3/4 All-Purpose flour + 1/4 White Wheat Flour; (b) 1/2 Canola Oil + 1/2 Applesauce; and (c) substituting Splenda for the Sugar . And it was delightful -- especially at Breakfast and especially when my \"secret ingredient\" (Vanilla extract) Cream Cheese spread was applied. I've been using my Vegetable Peeler to prepare my \"additions\" to my Breads for years (and then I cut the pieces into 3rds or quarters) and I made no exception here. This Bread freezes well. Next time, I'm going to make it into Muffins (reducing baking time to 35-40 minutes) if only because Muffins are easier to grab and run with on busy weekday mornings."

The version of this recipe that we liked best included these modifications (based on 12 servings): 1 cup flour, 1 cup oats, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, used un-peeled zucchini and un-peeled apples. \n\nNext time we make it, we will reduce the sugar to just 1/4 cup brown sugar (or possibly use honey) and add some unflavored protein powder and more walnuts. I also may try melted butter or coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. \n\nAnyway, great starting recipe for us. I'm writing this review so that I can remember my modifications."

"reviewBody": "For those reporting they found this bread not very moist, it could easily be because there's a lot less oil in this recipe than there is in most recipes of this type. After a gagillion years of baking experience I stuck with what I was comfortable with and doubled (yes, DOUBLED) the amount of oil. As I expected, I was quite content with the outcome. As for the zucchini, I shredded it - I know I wouldn't have cared for biting into pieces of zucchini in a sweet muffin. I omitted the walnuts so everyone would be happy, but I believe these would be equally delicious with or without them. Half the recipe was just right for 12 gorgeous, perfectly risen and rounded muffins which I topped with demerara (aka turbinado) sugar before baking. (If you choose to make this recipe as muffins, bake them at 350 degrees 20-25 minutes) These are moist and just sweet enough, the apple lending a lot of extra flavor using zucchini alone wouldn't. While I ended up loving these, for me having to double the oil to ensure a moist muffin, particularly since this is a deviation from other, similar tried and true recipes, made this a 4, rather than 5-star recipe for me."

Chop or grate the zucchini and apple, comes out good either way. One time I was out of oil and used buttermilk, it was just as good."

Converts to gluten free really well, too (just minus a few tablespoons of flour if using rice flour). Very yummy - will make again, soon!"

I made the changes I usually make to baked recipes (ww flour, less sugar, applesauce for part of oil, twice as much spice), and my amounts of zucchini/summer squash and apple weren't exactly the same, and it held up great. Moist, slightly sweet, rich... I'm sure it's wonderful exactly as is, and I can tell you that it's fantastic to play around with too!"

I'd like to try this with half whole wheat flour and a half cup or so of organic raisins thrown in."

I substituted 2 cups of the flour for whole wheat flour and when I went to mix it into the egg mixture it was so thick there was no way I could \"pour\" it into the loaf pans. I added more oil, another egg, and some milk before it was even close to the consistency I have seen in other recipes. Did I do something wrong? Seems like its a bit shy on the liquid ingredients to me. Anyway, I just stuck it in the oven and can't wait to try it out."

But this bread came out dry and a little bland. I don't think I did anything wrong following the directions, but it cooked in half the time and as I said it was dry. I believe the flour to oil ratio is way off. I won't bother trying to fix it though because next time I'll just use the Blueberry recipe and substitute apples for the berries."
