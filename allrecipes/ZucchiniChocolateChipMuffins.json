Flavor was great but fragile texture, did not release from greased tin as easily as other muffins. No mini chocolate chips or walnuts on hand so I substituted regular chocolate chips, might have been a contributing factor. Tasted delicious, but fell apart easily."

After trying these, he has realized all the stellar reviews are right! I substituted applesauce for half the oil, and reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup like another reviewer suggested. Moist and delicious with just enough sweetness from the chocolate chips and lower amount of sugar. I love the touch of cinnamon and the fact our 3 year old is getting some vegies with her muffins!"
