Added ginger and lemongrass paste because Pad Thai needs them. No peanuts, so stirred in a TB of peanut butter. No sprouts, so I chopped greens from the garden. Yummo!"

We added a bag of matchstick carrots at the end for extra crunch. We used half zucchini noodles and half rice noodles. Next time we will marinate chicken in the sauce"

"reviewBody": "I came across this recipe looking for something to use up zucchini and bean sprouts. I had some cooked bbq chicken that I put cut up and added to the finished dish. So I skipped the instructions with the chicken and shrimp (which I know will work well here the next time). I noticed others also did not have the tamarind paste on hand, which was my case as well. In place of the chile pepper sauce, I added some Thai red curry paste. I just sauteed the zoodles with the sprouts in sesame oil for 3-4 min and added the sauce, maybe half-way thru. The sprouts gave it a nice crunch. I skipped the eggs entirely. Darn, I forgot about the basil, and I had it available. This is a substitute dish where you're looking to cut carbs, etc. It surely looks like pad thai, and the taste is pretty much spot on. I'd maybe add a little cornstartch to thicken the sauce. Great recipe, Andrea!"

I'll cut it back further for them next time. I was skeptical about the zoodles but they were great and I don't feel bogged down by a pasta belly."

I mostly stuck to the recipe, except I added celery and onion to the mix. Also, I tossed the zuch noodles in salt and let drain in a colander for a while before cooking . We will definitely be making this again."

The first time I made it I did not have tamarind paste. I cannot eat shrimp so I just used a bit more chicken. The tamarind sauce does add a more authentic flavor but we liked it just as well without it when I substituted a bit more soy sauce. This put to good use the new spiralizer attachment for my kitchen aid mixer."

"reviewBody": "First I have to say it is a long list of special ingredients, which I don't regularly use. My local store did not have tamarind paste, so I opted to purchase Thai Kitchen's Pad Thai sauce and then I did not by the Oyster Sauce. Once everything was spiralized, chopped or cut, the recipe went together super quick. My husband had finished off all the roasted peanuts in the house, so we topped it with roasted sunflower seeds instead. We liked the result, but our sauce was not really true to the recipe. The use of zucchini as noodles is a favorite here."

But we loved the flavor and the texture was great, though I will also admit I made several substitutions due to pantry availability... 1 Tbsp lime juice + 1 Tbsp brown sugar replaced the tamarind paste. I added red onion, red, yellow, and green bell pepper (probably 1/4 c total) while the chicken was cooking, and used 2 c cabbage and 1/2 c celery instead of bean sprouts. I also omitted the green onion and oyster sauce. It was a hit with everyone though!"
