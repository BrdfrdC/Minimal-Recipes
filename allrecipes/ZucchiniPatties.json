The one slight change I make is to add some salt to the shredded zucchini and let it sit for 15 minutes or so to draw out some of the water from the zucchini, then squeeze out as much moisture as you can before mixing in the egg, flour and cheese. I think that this gives a better texture in the end."

"reviewBody": "Lessons learned: 1) Didn't have a clue how many zuccs to buy. Told the wife 3 or 4 to be on the safe side. She got 6 (bogo). Turns out ONE good sized zucc will make you a cup of shredded, so I made a double batch. 2) I use decent quality stainless fry pans (Misen) and the recommended heat was way too high for me. I had to go below halfway (hair under medium) to keep them from burning. 3) I tended to try to make the patties too large. Better off with smaller/flatter so they cook through in the time that they brown. 4) I felt like they needed more seasoning so I will experiment next time with some Sunny Paris blend (Penzys) in the mix, probably some pepper, who knows what else. Definitely will make again. Piece of cake if you have a food processor."

I added two cloves of chopped garlic, and seasoned with pepper, and onion powder. Make sure to really drain and squeeze out the moisture from the zucchini. I fried these in a little olive oil, 2 minutes each side to crisp them up, then put them in a 325 oven for 10 more minutes."

Ratings were great, so why not! I thought they turned out pretty tasty. College kid/twin A loved them, and tried topping them with every thing from sour cream to boom boom sauce to green goddess dressing! Twin B is already back to college and missed out. Not sure why but I had some small packets of instant cheese potato mixes and I substituted them for the flour and thought they were great. Made a few batches!"

Changes I made (because I had more than 2 cups of zucchini grated) were: added in an extra 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar/co jack cheese, 2 minced garlic cloves, instead of flour I used Bisquick and added about 1/4 teaspoon of sriracha sauce. Served with sour cream. I can’t wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow! Will reheat in the air fryer to get them crispy again. This is a keeper and have already passed this along to family members. 😊"

It's important to squeeze as much liquid as possible out of the grated zucchini. Instead of mozzarella I used some Mexican blend grated cheese because I wanted to use up the open bag. Deeelish!"

Went with suggested modifications of adding some fresh cut porta Bella mushrooms, crushed garlic, roasted red pepper flakes and I used green onions. Sautéed the garlic and onion before adding to mix. Also used mostly Italian bread crumbs and little flour. And I sprinkled each side with breadcrumbs once I formed the patties. Even though I removed liquid from zucchini, the mix was a little wet so I mixed in more breadcrumbs. Very good!!!"

Used summer squash instead of zucchini, substituted Italian bread crumbs for the flour, didn't have any mozzarella so used some Italian cheese and cheddar. I also added some chopped green chile and then some extra bread crumbs to thicken it a bit. So perhaps 5 stars is not exactly accurate for the recipe as written, but with the changes that I made, it was delicious!"

Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. Really, really good!"
