So it made more than I needed. I'll just put the balance in fridge to keep for relish or something. I'm sure they will taste great as the liquid was very yummy. Also be sure to adjust processing time according to your altitude."

Will do again.\n\nI agree with other reviewers that these did not make as many jars as indicated. I doubled the recipe and got 6 pints of pickles."

If I don't have quite enough poundage of zucchini, I combine it with sliced cucumbers. Basically you need 1-1/2 cups of vinegar and 1 cup sugar with each pound of zucchini, so I try to do batches of 3# of zucchini to make the canning process more worth the work. I like to use part white vinegar and part ACV, but I should warn you that the hot ACV will stain your counter, so be sure and protect your counter, unless you don't mind doing some heavy scrubbing with baking soda."

For some reason it's hard to get nice pickling cucumbers where I live, but zucchini is no problem. Thanks for inspiring me to try something a little bit different. I know already that I will love them."

"reviewBody": "The pickles were good. My husband loves all sweet pickles, so it was win win BUT I only got 3 pints NOT 3 Qts. I even weighed everything since it was my first time making them. The other thing that was confusing was it said 1:35 min to prepare, how can that be when you soak for two hours, then add the boiling syrup and soak again for two hours. A lot of time for three pints of pickles. If I had known I would have doubled the recipe. The taste is very good."

I do suggest if anyone uses pickling spices to add the prepared mustard. You nailed it with regards to flavor but my two pounds of zucchini did only yield 3 pints using all the liquids."

So what I did was make some great BBQ sauce by adding a jar of tomato sauce, then boiled it down until it was reduced by half. I added a little bit of cornstarch as well just to thicken it up even more. I poured it over some chicken to bake, then poured the pan drippings over rice. It was delicious and everyone in my family loved it."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe. Fantastic taste and relatively easy to make. I wish the slices were crisper, but they were good. The only other issue is that this will not make 3 quarts or pickles, more like 1 1/2 or 2 at best. The brine was the perfect amount for 2 quarts. I don't have canning equipment, so I stopped after step 3. I then let jars rest until sealed, then will refrigerate until they are eaten. I think if I wanted crisper slices, I could dump the hot liquid on the slices in the jars, then seal."

"reviewBody": "Warning the recipe states 2 lbs zucchini yields 3 qts I think they meant 3 pints. I did 10 lbs zucchini (5times all ingredients) and instead of getting 15 qts I got 7 plus 1 pint. Half what the recipe stated. Other then that I made these today and they were pretty straight forward. I have not done much canning before and for a first time solo these were a good start. I tasted some prior canning and was very pleased. Fewer jars then expected was both good and bad, good because it means I can make another batch if I want without having more then I could ever use. 10 lbs of zucchini was only 1week of harvest. Bad because I had taken time to prep slot more jars then needed. 3 stars because of that."

We saved the liquid after the pickles were gone and marinated chicken in it then cooked chicken, tators, onions, mushrooms, carrots, peas, corn, zucchini, and pineapple like a roast in it....no words can describe how amazing all the flavors meshed. It was an excellent meal that had everyone going back for seconds."
