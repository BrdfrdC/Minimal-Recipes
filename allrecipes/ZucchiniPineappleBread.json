The only changes or addition I made was adding a tablespoon of lemon juice, and the directions called for 8oz can pineapple pieces. I added 2-4 oz‚Äôs more, and when complete, I wish I had put the whole 30oz can into it. The pineapple to me gave the bread a new vibe, fresh, not to mention I love pineapple, but everything else was on point. I will definitely be making this again soon, as my wife said, It‚Äôs a Winner!üèÜü•á"

I also used three eggs instead of 4 and that was fine. I added nuts and raisins to one loaf and preferred that to the plain one. I also needed to turn my oven down as it tends to run hot and my loaves browned too quickly."

I had an opened can of pineapple chunks, so I chopped them up in place of the crushed pineapple. I baked them in 5 mini (6\" x 3 1/2\") loaves instead of two full size loaves. This makes a nice size loaf of bread for sharing. As good as this was as bread, we loved it toasted for breakfast the best."

I cooked the muffins for too long, so that's my fault. It should have only been like 15 minutes or so. The next day the bread was so much better. I felt like I could taste all of the ingredients more on the second day. The overdone muffins were even much better the second day. My husband really liked it. I'm giving four stars because I feel there should be some tweaking with the spices. I followed the recipe as is, sugar content seemed just fine to me. Thanks for the good recipe."

The muffins cooked in 30 minutes, while the bread took 1h5m. My toothpick came out clean, but the bottom of my bread is mushy and looks extremely undercooked. I probably won't make this again."

The funny thing is that I could still not taste the pineapple. So im thinking the pineapple is used more for keeping it moist. Next time I will get pineapples and dice them and put full ones on top. This is the best Zucchini Bread Ive ever had:) 5 stars all the way!"

I put 1 cup of coconut into the batter as well, and I used cooking spray on the bottom of the pan with cinnamon and sugar to coat as well. But, the best thing I did was to combine 1/2 c. quick oats, 2 T. butter, and 1/2 c. of brown sugar together and crumble it over the top of the bread before I baked it!! Mmmm!!! So, good - crunchy on the top and moist and tasty on the inside. A keeper for sure!"

You use 1/2 the measurement as regular brown so I used the amount to EQUAL 3/4 cup. I used 1/2 c applesauce for 1/2 of the oil, and used 1 c. wheat flour. I just bought pastery whole wheat flour so I might try that for the entire recipe. I did use generously measured cups of zucchini, so it was a bit more that 2c. I will add more cinnamon next time. Soooo good. The pineapple makes this so very wonderful. I did not have crushed, so I pureed some chunk pineapple, worked just fine! Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe!"

And while at the store we didn't get shredded pineapple-oh no, we got chunked. :P So I sat there poking the pineapple with a fork trying to get it to shred-it didn't- so we just put it in there chunked. We added about 1/2 cup more sugar than said, and made two loaves. It did come out wonderful! His mom loved it, my parents loved it. The only problem was it took about 1hour and thirty minutes to bake, and a lot of the pineapple went to the bottom(imagine that :P) but yes, it was very good, and will definitely make it again(:"

I used half brown sugar and half regular and cut it down like others suggested, just a little though (maybe 1/2 of what was suggested, I quadrupled the recipe and left out one cup). I found the bread to be plain and lacking something. I don't think I should have left out any sugar, and it definately needed more flavor, more spices and maybe use all brown sugar. I thought it might've been better with some nuts and some raisins perhaps. I only made this cause I was too lazy to peel 4 pounds of carrots for my famous carrot raison nut bread, and I'm not sure I will make again."
