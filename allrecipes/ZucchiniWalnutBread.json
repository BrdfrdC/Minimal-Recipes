I did tweak it a bit, but I always like to add a bit extra ;) I doubled the recipe and replaced a cup of the zucchini with some grated carrots because my zucchini wasn’t big enough, and it added a lovely color to the bread when I cut it. I used golden raisins instead of regular because I like the flavor and look of them better, as well. I also replaced half of the white sugar with brown to give it a richer flavor and color. Finally, I added some more spices like nutmeg and clove and extra cinnamon. Fabulous recipe!"

I'm not sure that I'd know a good zucchini bread from a bad one. I followed this recipe to the letter and it took about one hour and 20 minutes to bake through. The bread is tasty, but nothing that I'll have to make again anytime soon. Very sweet and heavy with a strong cinnamon flavor. Not as moist as I expected."

But I also tweaked the recipe for a few loaves to include a little nutmeg (about a half teaspoon) and a little brown sugar (about a quarter cup, not packed), and it added a little something extra that also worked really well, too! And the best part? They all froze beautifully!"

I added some carrots, extra cinnamon ( 2tbs total), extra walnuts, but I'd NOT add arisen, which I think helped make it not so sweet. Great overall"

Mine is a propane oven though and electric ovens have their own set of rules and things to watch.\nBeen making this bread for years, the only change is one cup of sugar and one cup of Splenda. Also like to run a row of walnut pieces down the middle. Prettier, shows those you are sharing with that there are nuts inside."

I don't know why the vanilla wouldn't be included with the wet ingredients and why you would have to alternate the dry ingredients with the zucchini. That just seems like unnecessary work. I mixed all the wet ingredients and all the dry ingredients and then combined them. I then added the zucchini and mixed until just combined as per standard zucchini bread procedure. I'm sure it turns out great either way, I just don't like wasting time. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is for the raisins. I like raisins but I see no reason why a fabulous bread recipe would need them. I honestly think it would devalue this awesome bread. I leave em out."

If anyone knows what I did wrong, please let me know. \r\n What bread I did get to eat was very good."

Even my dayhome kids love it, and they're picky eaters!!! I found that when baked a little longer on the second rack from the bottom, the crust takes on a crispness that is so good overall. I'll definately make this over and over again!"
