I used meat from two small lobster tails as a treat and used a little less spice as I had guests that didn't like too much heat.I made one mistake which was using Cherrystone clams instead of little necks ( price was HORRIBLE!) Clams were tough as leather. BUT, ...I found a great bargain on mussels so we had more mussels in it which was fantastic!!"

"reviewBody": "Used a pound of mussels, a pound of littlenecks, pound of shrimp, a pound and a half of calamari, and maybe ten scallops (weren't high quality so i didn't want that sharp taste to get in the dish). Doubled the garlic and spices because too tomato-y without it. Put a bay leaf in too. Also used fresh basil and garlic and oh my god did my house smell amazing. Warning: don't cook the shrimp and calamari together, calamari cooks much faster than shrimp and you will be left with overcooked calamari. Next time I will boil the shrimp and use the stock from that instead of the water. I cooked my clams and mussels before hand but according to my friend if i had just put them in there when it was boiling and closed the lid they would have opened right up....might have given a better flavor to the dish because I tasted the water from the boiling of the clams and mussels and it was briney-deliciousness. Overall it was great! Just tweet it to your families tastes. Made for a bunch of people and it was a hit!"

I halved the recipe, but kept the tomato sauce the same, to have enough to submerge all the seafood otherwise the mussels and clams kind of sat on top and didn't \"simmer\". Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. My picky 15 year old daughter ate 3 helpings, then went back for more calamari. Delicious!!!"

We didn't have the calamari rings and we added a bit more garlic and a splash of wine when cooking the shrimp and scallops. We also had an Old Bay seasoning bag so we used that when cooking the clams and mussles. It was so good. Even the kids devoured it! We'll be making this again!"

Otherwise, we followed the recipe as written and it came out with great results. This is the kind of recipe that you can vary slightly to adapt to your needs and taste. We substituted the water with the juice of the chopped clams. This added to the flavor. Thanks for a great recipe. Will make again."
