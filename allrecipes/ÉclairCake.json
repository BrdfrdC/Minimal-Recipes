"reviewBody": "I made this using flaxseed milk as my daughter has a dairy allergy. Then used the coconut ready whip to mix into the pudding since we can't use cool whip. Lastly instead of spreading the chocolate frosting, I melted it over the stove and peed it over for a shiny 'eclair' like finish. Since I could not use cool whip, I had the container out so that people can just put it on top of the eclair when they were eating it for the people who are not dairy-free. Everyone liked it a lot. I gave it a four rating because it got a bit mushy, but I made it the day before so I wasn't sure if that was supposed to happen. But maybe next time I will double up on the graham crackers for each layer instead and maybe that would help it not be so soft and still be able to see the layers. I have to get better at getting a picture of the entire dessert."

He has Diabetic 2 and we keep his sugar intake down. NO one can tell I use sugar free in it. My marry children do not eat ''anything sugar free.\" This they do, but don't know my secret and ask for it all the time. To make it interesting colorful, try layering 1 layer Vanilla pudding and 1 layer Choc sugar free pudding. Very good. And diabetic friendly, also can omit the middle layer of graham crackers, just bottom and top use the graham crackers to make it much more diabetic friendly. Haven't been able to find sugar free graham crackers. My next one, I am thinking about using 1 small box sugar free Orange Gelatin my vanilla pudding mixture. (No water) just the powder Jello."

"reviewBody": "This is an easy, DELICIOUS recipe! I get requests to make it at least once every holiday season. I add a bit of pure vanilla extract to the pudding mixture to intensify the vanilla flavor. I also use whipped cream instead of cool whip (lots of grocery stores now sell containers of fresh whipped cream in their bakeries). Serve it with a dollop of the fresh whipped cream for an extra layer of flavor. I recommend taking the time to make it the night before- it really does allow the dessert to set into a perfect texture. It's a great \"semi-homemade\" dessert to serve this time of year."

"reviewBody": "If you want to put a really yummy Brazilian twist on this very good recipe, replace the chocolate frosting with a brigadeiro topping. Brigadeiro is comprised of 1 can of sweetened condensed milk (we love the Eagle brand), 2 TB of butter, and 4 TB of Nestle Chocolate Quik powder. Heat all of these ingredients over the stove on medium high. Once the mixture thickens to the point that it no longer sticks to the bottom of the pan, turn off the stove and let cool for a couple of minutes. Once ready, spread mixture over the eclair just as you would the chocolate frosting. As another option, you could top it off with strawberries or chocolate sprinkles. Enjoy!"

For those who found it bland, try adding a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the pudding for more flavor dimension. Made a simple homemade fudge frosting bc I don‚Äôt like sweet, artificial tub frostings. Next time, I‚Äôd make with whipped heavy cream in place of the cool whip for less sugar. This recipe would be good with chocolate Graham‚Äôs, and chocolate pudding with espresso powder for a mocha cake. Options are endless. Thank you for a fast, simple, delicious recipe."

Because of the almond milk the pudding didn‚Äôt set up as firm as it should and I used Dark Chocolate frosting heated so I pretty much poured it on the cake. It is delicious and my husband was very happy I found this to make a few changes to make it much better for diabetics."

It tasted great with my changes, I used cooked pudding, because I can‚Äôt stand the taste of instant, but I didn‚Äôt let it cool completely, before blending in fresh whipped cream, also can‚Äôt stand Cool Whip. Only had 3 hours to chill, and result was Eclair Soup. I should have thought about Cool Whip probably having a stiffening agent that fresh whipped doesn‚Äôt have, although I added a teaspoon of cream of tartar while whipping. Anyone know anything else I might have messed up? Otherwise, people liked the taste, even though they had to eat it with a spoon. That‚Äôs what I get when I only bake for company, and always want to try something new, and always want to tweak it!"
